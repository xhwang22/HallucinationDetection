I found out from the press that they had nationalized that player, who had no link with the country,\" added the Real Madrid player.\n\n\"I had the reference of having played with [Nikola] Mirotic and with [Serge] Ibaka\", continued Fernandez.\n\n\"They are foreign players, but they have been trained in a Spanish youth academy since they were very young and in that sense they had a special bond with our country,\" Fernandez explained.\n\n\"If (Lorenzo Brown) is there, we have to try to help him as much as possible because in the end he will also help us compete. But there are many Spanish players who have earned to take up the guard positions and in the end, perhaps they will not have the recognition they deserve,\" the 37-year-old veteran said.\n\nFour weeks later and on the occasion of Brown's presentation by the Spanish federation, in which the naturalized player spoke highly of him, Fernandez offered another perspective on the matter.\n\n\"Brown is a player who comes to help the national team, we must make that clear and I prefer players who are linked to this national team, even if we are 22, to others who may ignore Sergio Scariolo's call to come this summer,\" the experienced forward told the press during the team's presentation in Madrid.\n\n\"In the end, there are many players who have played in the FIBA windows and now they cannot be here, but speaking with the Federation, I am delighted that Brown is here,\" he continued.\n\nFor Rudy, enthusiasm is fundamental.\n\n\"Having young players on the team always comes in handy and enthusiasm has to be intact, whether you are 37 like me or 18 like Juanito (Nunez) who is the youngest\", he explained.\n\nFor the captain, being able to represent his country \"is the greatest thing and I've been lucky enough to be doing it since 2004, to be able to be here again and convey to young guys that you have to give everything.\"\n\n\"Each championship is very difficult. The national team always has to aspire to the maximum, but key players are leaving the national team every year. You can win or lose, but you have to leave everything on the court, it must be the DNA of this team,\" he added.\n\nVery few expect Spain to be a real contender for the trophy in the EuroBasket, but Fernandez has seen a lot of different versions of the team reach their goals, no matter how much the odds were against them.\n\n\"In the 2019 World Cup we weren't favorites either,\" he remembered.\n\n\"Surprises may or may not happen, but we're all prepared. The team is being rebuilt. We must enjoy the moment and have the feeling of having given everything\", Rudy Fernandez concluded."}, {"url": "https://www.tellerreport.com/sports/2021-07-26-rudy-fern%C3%A1ndez--%22it-was-fundamental-for-my-career-to-ask-for-help%22.ry74xvFoCd.html", "page_content": "In 17 years, Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez gave him to lose his matted hair and that first-time face of a mischievous comic boy, to go through the NBA, to have three operations on his back, ...\n\nAlba Torrens \"Locked up in the room for 14 days I have lived very beautiful moments\"\n\nUsman Garuba \"I want to give back to my parents all their sacrifice by leaving Africa\"\n\nIn 17 years,\n\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez\n\ngave him to lose his matted hair and that first-time face of a mischievous comic boy, to go through the NBA, have three back surgery, win two Euroleague with Real Madrid, 10 medals with the national team - and, among the five golds, two worldwide, from 2006 to 2019-, marry\n\nHelen Lindes\n\nand have two children,\n\nAlan\n\nand\n\nAura\n\n. In 17 years he was also several players, that jumpy and daring Joventut, the Blazers tripler and, now, with 36 compliments, the wise man, the one who supplies physical fullness with knowing how to be and read basketball like perhaps no one else in all the planet.\n\nIn 17 years, those Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez always had a common denominator in red, Spain as a priority, despite the pain, the physical and the mental. In 17 years, just one absence (Eurobasket of 2017), 15 tournaments with which it begins, captain of the ship that now sails in Tokyo in search of more glory, because they have already shown that nothing satisfies them. But, what is addictive about this human group to offer you an existence?\n\nIn his response, Rudy doesn't dig too far into memory to find the example that illustrates a commitment.\n\n\"Look, two years ago, I had one of the worst summers of my life on a personal level. And what made me be in the national team was the camaraderie. In the end, it seems a clich\u00e9 to talk about us being a big family, but in those moments is where friends really see each other, \"he responded to EL MUNDO in the days leading up to the Games, where today (2:00 pm) he awaits his debut against Japan in Saitama.\n\nThe walk along Venice Beach\n\nThe friends. Like that\n\nRicky Rubio\n\n, a mischief partner already in La\n\nPenya\n\nand a room in the national team, who caught him in Los Angeles like he grabs friends who go through a bad drink and took him on a bicycle through Venice Beach. A banal bike ride can be the best therapy in the world. Because Rudy had just fired his grandfather just a couple of weeks after his sister\n\nMarta\n\nlost the child she was expecting. And to Rudy, of course, the World Cup that was about to start was made a ball. But that's precisely what\n\nLa Familia is for\n\n. From those sleepless nights, those tears after raising the World Cup to the sky of Beijing, a tattoo remains on his left ankle. And a lot of thanks.\n\nBefore they sacrificed their summers of youth, now they stop seeing their children for weeks. I insist, what does this team have? The oldest of us are already parents and they are almost all small children, less than five or six years old. It is true, it is difficult to leave the family parked to face these concentrations or the tournaments. They are our priority. But we know they support us from a distance. Only the Eurobasket in 2017 was taken as a break. Since 2004 I have been lucky enough to be able to spend every summer in the national team. Before that Eurobasket, my body asked me, physically and mentally, for a break to face the years to come. It was fundamental for my career to ask for help, to put myself in the hands of people who understand this world, the ups and downs of this profession. It is important to be positive in the most difficult moments. And the demo was 2019,to be world champion, with everything that happened to me. The player must be mentally prepared for all kinds of situations. Good memories of Saitama. The pavilion remains the same, little has changed. Great memories. In 2006, El Chacho and I were kids (world champions in Japan) and now we are veterans. But the illusion remains intact. Do the young men who now enter the national team remind you of the 2004 Rudy, aged 19? That is far away, but of course. They were very happy Games, because also, I lived them with my sister. And Felipe, Pau and I debuted in our first Games. The youngsters have to be sponges, because there are players of the highest level in front of them. NBA players. Soak up the work they do so that it can later be used for their career. As a veteran,I try to help them to enter into the dynamics of this great family. It's easy to compete with this team. Garuba, his Real Madrid teammate, is also now 19 years old. That said, Usman has to be a sponge right now to learn. He is a player who has a lot of margin. I have lived his emergence closely, I know that he is working, listening and looking at players who can help him.\n\nRudy, during a Spanish training session in Las Vegas.FEB\n\nFelipe, Spanoulis, maybe Pau ... Do you feel that a time when you were the main protagonist is ending? Yes, of course. This does not stop and many players of my generation retire. You see it. On a personal level, I am 36 years old, many injuries, many games. Because the European competition has too many games. And physically and mentally some could have lasted longer, but they retire earlier because the level of physical demand is maximum. Only four basketball players had played five Games: Juan Carlos Navarro, Te\u00f3filo Cruz, Oscar Schmidt and Andrew Gaze. Now you, Pau and Luis Scola will do it. How do you face Tokyo? It is something incredible that I could not imagine when I started. And they may be our last Games. And we are aware of how tough they are going to be. In addition, the format changes with respect to what we know.The desire must always be there and even more knowing that it may be the last chance to be all together. Were you surprised by Pau's ability to return? He is a benchmark, he has shown many things preparing day and night to get here. He is eager to contribute.\n\nThe pandemic has taught me the lesson of living from day to day\n\nRudy, how can you always be in the right place on the track without having to run faster than everyone else? It's that touch. The years go by and you have a little more wisdom, intuition. It's about anticipating. In that sense, I have always been a player who has tried to intuit the play in defense. And in attack, choose the best option to get something positive. Outside of basketball, what have you learned from these uncertain times? The lesson of living from day to day. Be surrounded by people who love you, who you love. The situation we are experiencing is incredible, none of us thought that in two years we could go through all these kinds of situations. I think we are all dealing with it as best we can, trying to get the positive side out. For example, confinement served to be more with my family,Something that I had not been able to do so much before. In the future, do you see yourself on a bench, in an office or outside the world of basketball? At no point am I thinking about what to do when I retire. Yes I want to continue linked to sports, but as I told you, I go day by day.

In recent years, we always asked our audience to pray for the recovery of the movie star in his bout with cancer.\n\nWe had not had the opportunity to personally meet Rudy Fernandez the Movie Star, who finally lost his \u201clast battle\u201d with the Big C. But a movie editor-friend of ours had told us years back that we were about as tall and had \u201csoft palms.\u201d\n\nOne time, we missed him by a few minutes when he went to the National Press Club to settle a spat with another movie star through the intercession of our friend, then NPC president Marcelo Lagmay and former FAMAS president Rudy Salandanan.\n\nThe misunderstanding between the movie actors was resolved, all right. Which reflected to peace-loving nature of Daboy \u2014 he went out of his way to settle a row.\n\nHe had a soft heart for the small people, too.\n\nConsider: In one of those times when I dropped by the Press Club, I was thanked by some of the NPC employees for supposed Christmas gifts to them.\n\nWhen I asked them about it, they pointed to the sacks of rice which they said came from Rudy Fernandez, thinking that it was us.\n\nActually, I used to contribute cash gifts for the NPC employees during Christmas but not in kind. I told them that the sacks of rice did not come from us.\n\nWhen the NPC staff rechecked the gift\u2019s accompanying letter, they noted that it was the movie actor and his lovely wife Lorna who sent the rice.\n\nAs a science/research and development (R&D)/environment journalist, we were usually invited to speak in seminar-workshop for campus writers and budding media practitioners.\n\nOne such occasion was an Environment Reporting Workshop organized by our good friend, journalist-lawyer Manny \u201cJun\u201d Satorre of Cebu City. Since Jun did not have the time to fetch us at the airport, he sent his son, who brought a placard bearing the name Rudy Fernandez.\n\nThe placard, the young Satorre told us later, attracted many people in the airport, who waited with him for the arrival of Rudy Fernandez, thinking that he was the silver screen idol.\n\nWe did not arrive on time because we took the \u201cPAL-aging late\u201d plane (in recent years, though, the air carrier had always been on time). And by the time we stepped out of the plane, the well-wishers had left \u2014 mostly to eating places because their hunger took the most of them.\n\nOnce, too, we were guests of a Filipino family in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nThe lady of the house cheerfully introduced us to their small girl as the actor from Manila. The little angel stared at us from head to foot as she walked aroud us. Her verdict: \u201cHe is not the movie actor!\u201d Laughter.\n\nOne semester when we were yet teaching Science Reporting in a state university, many students enrolled in our subject, perhaps (we surmised) attracted by the teacher\u2018s name: Rudy Fernandez. It was a tough course (writing features or news articles out of scientific studies so that the research results could be understood and made use of by ordinary people). But by the middle of the semester, some of the students had backed out.\n\nOver the past few years, we had conducted workshops on Science/Development Reporting for student journalists and government R&D agencies.\n\nThe task had taken us to, among other institutions, the Benguet State University (for the writers in the Cordilleras), the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute (for those in Central Luzon), Aklan State University (for those of state colleges and universities in Western Visayas, and University of Southeastern Philippines in Davao City (for those in Southern Mindanao).\n\nAlmost always, the streamer announcing the name of the seminar-workshop lecturer (Rudy Fernandez) attracted curious people.\n\nBut, of course, there are a thousand and one Rudy Fernandez across the length and breadth of the archipelago.\n\nOnce, former Laguna Gov. Joey Lina and this writer were seated side by side in a gathering in Calamba City, the two of us being among the invited speakers. He had told us that I was the third person named Rudy Fernandez that he had met.\n\nIn a research forum we attended in Baguio City one time, we unwound in one of the hotel rooms after a hard day\u2019s work. When we ran out of finger foods, we called up the hotel management to send more canap\u00e9s.\n\nAfter a while came the waiter with our order. His name, as written in his nameplate Rudy Fernandez.\n\nAt The STAR, some of the staff members fondly address us Daboy.\n\nBy the way, for almost two decades, we were division head of a Philippine government-hosted Southeast Asian Center. And did you know that my long-time secretary\u2019s name is Lorna?\n\nRudy Fernandez was a good actor, who epitomized the just and defender of the oppressed. And Rudy Fernandez the Writer admits he relished his movies.\n\nOne time, we flew to Tuguegarao City (Cagayan) to speak in a seminar on Development Communication. The following day, we were bleary-eyed because the night before, though tired, we finished a Rudy Fernandez starrer depicting the life of feisty police officer Bobby Ortega or Bungo shown in our room\u2019s television set.\n\nTinseltown has just lost one icon it can really be proud of.

In a recent interview at Versailles Restaurant, the robust, jeans-clad Fernandez freely switched between Spanish and English, and joked about Miami's unique political atmosphere.\n\nFormer Montana Gov. Mark Racicot, chairman of the Bush/Cheney campaign, said Fernandez built a solid rapport with him and earned his position through hard work. In a recent telephone interview, Racicot said he first met Fernandez 2 \u00bd years ago while Fernandez worked for him at the Republican National Committee.\n\nWhen Racicot was named chairman of the Bush campaign, he asked Fernandez if he would come along for the ride.\n\n''My most satisfying times at the RNC were the outreach efforts I worked on with Rudy,'' Racicot said. ``Rudy is a young man, at least by my standards. And he has accomplished a great deal in that period of time, and not without significant obstacles.''\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nAs regional director of the Bush campaign for the American Southwest, which includes California, Arizona and Texas, Fernandez oversees everything from communications to political strategies to the logistics of voter outreach and campaign stops for the president.\n\nFernandez believes being an immigrant gives him the sensitivities required to connect with a broad swath of minorities, from Asians to blacks, to Hispanics of all backgrounds.\n\n''Hispanic voters are complex,'' he said. ``But I choose to focus on the similarities, not the differences. We see Hispanics first and foremost as Americans. And they care about the same things Americans care about.''\n\nBlaise Hazelwood, political director for the Republican National Committee and Fernandez's former boss, said Fernandez has the ability to both understand policy and be able to communicate effectively.\n\n''I have to admit, he has a Cuban temper, it's very endearing,'' Hazelwood said. ``He's opinionated. He'll tell you exactly what he thinks.''\n\nCOMMITMENTS\n\nHis girlfriend, Miami lawyer Miriam Alfonso, concurs. She said it hasn't been easy keeping their long-distance relationship alive for 2 \u00bd years, but that she understands his commitment to his job.\n\nShe said that when Fernandez is not working, he tries to catch up on sleep, or do something relaxing like going to a movie. Fortunately, she's a Republican, too. He jokes with her that he doesn't know if he could date her if she was from another party.\n\n''I tell him he's part of a cult,'' she said. ``You really have to be brainwashed into thinking this is such a great mission and that it's so important.''\n\nAs a Cuban American on the Bush campaign, Fernandez has faced his share of awkward moments. For example, several of Fernandez's Cuban-American friends in the Florida legislature wrote a letter to Bush last year telling him to get tougher on Castro or risk losing Cuban-American support.\n\n''Friendships sometimes transcend jobs,'' Fernandez said. ``They have a job to do. They are following their hearts and doing what they believe their constituents want. But I also have a job to do. And I think the president has a good record on Cuba.''\n\nHe said the alternative, John Kerry, is ``a lot softer than even Al Gore in terms of Cuba.''\n\nKerry spokesman Mark Kornblau said Bush had done nothing to improve the situation in Cuba.\n\nSTILL FRIENDS\n\nState Rep. David Rivera, who helped draft the critical letter to Bush, said he and Fernandez discuss the Cuba issue informally, and he considers him a friend despite their disagreements on the issue.\n\n''The fact that I may want the Bush administration to be more pro-active on Cuba doesn't mean I can't be friends with Rudy,'' Rivera said. ``I was friends with him before President Bush was around and I will be friends with him after President Bush is gone.''\n\nFernandez was born in Venezuela to Cuban parents, and came to the United States when he was 10. He began school in the fifth grade and knew almost no English.\n\n''Since my husband and I always spoke so much about Cuba and the dictatorship, that perhaps inclined him [Rudy] to think about the importance of democracy,'' said Fernandez's mother, Elsa Fernandez, who lives in West Miami-Dade.\n\nBy the time Fernandez was a senior at Southwest High School, he had risen to the top of his class, graduating as the school's valedictorian. He went off to Harvard, where he earned his degree last year after taking time off from college in his 20s to work on his career.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Fernandez's political godmother, remembers the first time she met him. It was at a Southwest High School memorial service for Shannon Melendi, a student who disappeared from the school. Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, who also graduated from Southwest High, met Fernandez there and asked her chief of staff to ask him to apply for an unpaid internship.\n\nMOVING UP FAST\n\nSoon after that internship started, Ros-Lehtinen's press director resigned and Fernandez got the job. He was offered the position on a Wednesday and was told he had to be in Washington by Sunday.\n\n''Hiring Rudy was one of the luckiest things I've done,'' Ros-Lehtinen said in a recent interview.\n\n'We brag about him every time he is on TV now for the Bush/Cheney campaign. We say: `Hey, there's one of our guys.' ''\n\nThe next stop for Fernandez was the Republican National Committee, where he directed the groups' grassroots development, where he worked until last year, when he joined the Bush campaign.\n\nHispanic Business Magazine named Fernandez one of the ''100 Most Influential Hispanics'' in the United States in 2002, one of only two people under 30 on the list.\n\nIn his current role, Fernandez spends most of his time traveling around the country, mostly in the American Southwest, where his Spanish comes in handy. Although he will see less and less of Miami as the 2004 campaign heats up, he says he wants to eventually settle down here.\n\n''Washington is too cold,'' he said. \"Miami is home.''"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/news-relationship-between-pau-rudy", "page_content": "Rudy Fernandez is one of the most decorated basketball players in Spanish history.

He was one of the original organizers of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP/KMP) in 1975 and helped draft, develop, and establish its constitution and by-laws. He first came into the Philippine Labor Movement arena when he founded the Davao Port General & Transport Worker\u2019s Union (DPGTWU), now the Association of Trade Unions - TUCP (ATU-TUCP), in Davao City. DPGTWU was one of the most active labor organizations in Davao City and its membership spread throughout Mindanao in the Southern Philippines during the years between 1967-1979. He ran for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP) in the Philippines in 1978 as an Industrial Labor Sectoral Representative for the Mindanao Region but ultimately lost against his closest rival, Princess Porti Pacasum, daughter of one of the richest Lanao Muslim clans and owner of the biggest transport company in Lanao, Philippines.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nRudolfo A. Fernandez, Sr. was born in Sibonga, Cebu on July 26, 1927 to a prominent clan of landowners. His father, Mateo Fernandez, was a local police constable and his mother, Magdalena Austria, was a housewife. During his grade school years, Rudy was bright and became active in debates and oratorical contests. During World War II (1945\u20131947), the young Fernandez, still in his teens, made use of his expertise in the English language and became the local messenger and interpreter between the American troops and the guerillas who were fighting against the Japanese Occupational forces. Fernandez dreamed of becoming a boxer and left his hometown to join a carnival in the hope of becoming one. He was found and brought home by his father, Mateo, who implored him to finish his studies since it was where he excelled. Also while in his teens, Fernandez joined his older brother Vitaliano Fernandez, a prominent Civil Engineer in Cebu City, to continue his tertiary education at the University of the Visayas. He left the university and migrated to Davao City, Southern Philippines to be with his other brother Ramon Fernandez, Sr. and worked in his stevedoring business to pursue his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\nHe studied law at the International Harvardian University (IHU) in Davao City where he met his soon-to-be wife, Antonia Valenton Militante, the local campus belle at that same university and was in her senior year in high school. Fernandez soon became the president of their University's debate team and further improved his skill in speech and argumentation. This flair for discourse in the young Fernandez would be very instrumental in his becoming a skilled Labor organizer. The young Fernandez and Antonia were frequently seen in local clubs and parties and were always the center of these gatherings. Fernandez together with his wit and charm, was also known to be an exceptional dancer. He eventually married Antonia on November 10, 1951. The couple had eleven children named: Matthew, Rodolfo, Jr., Ruby Carmen, Ivan, Hope, Faith, Charity, Strauss, Pearl, Ruth and Rodolfo, III. He became a court stenographer of the local circuit court. His apprenticeship in the Labor movement was honed in the defunct Mindanao Congress of Labor as a labor organizer, then he joined the Philippine Labor Express as a columnist, and also became a radio reporter. Because of his growing family, he soon had to quit college. Fernandez and his wife Antonia separated in 1968. Later, he had two more children, Dean and Lynn, with his common-law wife, Vivian Alvar. Fernandez also became the secretary of then-Congressman Ismael Veloso (NP). Despite his serious years as secretary of Congressman Veloso, Fernandez never lost his devil-may-care attitude. He kept on attending club parties and went on to join club dance showdowns and charmed everyone. It was at this time in his life that Fernandez met and frequently partnered with Nida Blanca, one of Manila's most beautiful women and the queen of the city's club dance showdowns. However, Fernandez\u2019 stint in the Mindanao Congress of Labor urged him to leave Manila and continued to pique his interest in the Labor Movement.\n\nThe labor movement\n\nRudolfo A. \"Rudy\" Fernandez, Sr. eventually became an active Labor organizer in Davao becoming fully aware of the unhealthy and unlawful practices of the local companies and industries towards their workers and employees. Workers and or laborers during those times in Davao were predominantly oblivious of their basic legal rights and how to attain them and companies aware of this fact, were mostly abusing this ignorance. He founded his own labor organization called the Davao Port, General & Transport Worker\u2019s Union (DPGTWU) with the mission of stamping out all forms of oppression against local workers and educate them of their basic legal rights and on organized labor. DPGTWU was then organized and Fernandez was elected as its first president in 1965.\n\nIn 1964, Fernandez\u2019 suffered a massive cardiac arrest and became paralyzed. Most of his relatives, friends and detractors thought he would die. He was confined in the hospital for almost 3 months and was under physical therapy for almost 6 and then gained back his strength to walk again and continue his dauntless efforts as a Labor Leader. Some of his loyal supporters said that Rudy defied death even while already in its brink because of his burning refusal to die. Fernandez\u2019 brush with death, they say, was the turning point of his life. DPGTWU flourished and gained a large union membership in the Lumber Industry (i.e. Santa Clara Lumber Co., Kalinan Timber Corp. of the Consunji Family, etc.), the Food Production and Agricultural Industry (i.e., London Biscuit Co. (LONBISCO), and in the local Automotive Industry (i.e., Davao Motor Sales Inc. (DAMOSA), etc. Fernandez gained a reputation of being a tough negotiator in collective bargaining agreements with companies or industries he was dealing with then. He would further become known as a champion of workers in Davao City and was also recognized as a resillient and honest man. He marshaled his union into big companies and industries and was often offered bribes which he refused, by some of their owners so as not to organize a union in their companies. Instead of getting crossed for gaining access in his companies, Don Antonio O. Floirendo, Sr., the owner of the then Davao Motor Sales Corporation (DAMOSA) and Anflocor and one of the richest men in the country, became one of his staunchest ally and friend, and soon further gained his trust and friendship. Don Florendo could not forget Fernandez' quip when he once told him that he is quite good in what he is doing and Fernandez answered him, \"I should be, I worked hard to get to where I am now.\" The former said, Fernandez' remark was uttered without afterthought just as if it was just that, a certainty, so sure of himself. Florendo further related that is how Fernandez instills confidence to people who hears and listen to him: by the firmness of his voice when he talks and that, is a gift of gab. Having gained recognition in the labor movement, he was frequently invited into Davao City\u2019s important occasions and gained the friendship as well as enmity of local politicians, broadcasters and prominent clans because of his often frank and fearless comments against the Marcos dictatorship and the local political scenery. It was during these gatherings that he befriended the country\u2019s future Speaker of the House, Prospero Nograles, Davao City's former Mayor and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary of the Philippines' 11th President Corazon Aquino\u2019s cabinet, Mayor Luis T. Santos and Ernesto Macasaet, Davao City\u2019s Chief of Police, who eventually became a good friend of his. Maintaining his empathy towards the workingmen he had sworn to serve, he was known to offer generous help to them keeping his home constantly open whenever they come to him for food and provide whatever assistance he could give. Due to Fernandez\u2019 open criticisms against the Marcos' dictatorship and his close association with Davao City's local Liberal Party Chapter, his house and residence in Talomo, Davao City was raided by the Military and searched the next day after Marcos declared Martial Law in 1972, with an alleged tip that he was hiding an arsenal of guns. A wildfire of rumors spread in Davao City that he was going to be arrested for illegal possession of firearms or for any other drummed up charges. But, Fernandez using his knack in diplomacy defused the tension that arose at that time and the Military left his residence finding nothing and left him alone to carry on with his labor pursuits.\n\nIn 1973, Fernandez wrote an original oratory, \u201cThe Role of the Youth in the New Society\u201d which was delivered by his second son Rodolfo, Jr., and won second place in the Philippines\u2019 National Oratorical Contest for all Naval ROTC on October 20, 1973 held at the Philippine Navy Headquarters in Manila. The brilliant piece is still kept in the archives of the Philippine Women's University, Manila to this day.\n\nOver the next few years despite Fernandez being a very vocal opponent and his oppositionist leaning, the government supported collective bargaining, and the regulation of the minimum wages and strikes were still allowed although constrained. (QUOTE) DPGTWU flourished and spread and he soon made frequent trips to Manila in order to exchange ideas and ideologies among his fellow labor leaders in the Philippine\u2019s capital city, among them Senator Blas F. Ople, the Secretary of Labor during that time, Democrito T. Mendoza, National President of TUCP-KMP, Ernesto Herrera, Secretary-General of TUCP-KMP, who would soon become a senator in the country, the activist Luis Taruc and Eulogio R. Lerum, Sr., Chief Legal Counsel of TUCP-KMP. The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) was soon organized. It became the labor center to represent labor in the tripartite system of labor relations in the country under the period of labor repression. Fernandez helped organized and established the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP/KMP) and aided, wrote and improved its constitution and by-laws. Fernandez was elected as one of TUCP\u2019s Vice Presidents and was chosen to represent the country as a Labor Observer in Europe in 1976 which was sponsored by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Fernandez, together with his fellow Asian Labor Representatives, visited Yugoslavia and ILO\u2019s main offices in Geneva, Switzerland. Back in the Philippines, despite being swamped with labor work, Fernandez, a Roman Catholic and a known devotee of the Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa (Holy Child of Cebu), never fails to visit the Basilica where it is ensconced. This has been one of Fernandez' generally recognized proclivities and a quirk which he had developed during his later years, wherein he never goes to church in any other place nor province except in the Basilica del Sto. Nino located in Cebu City.\n\nIn April 1978, Fernandez ran as a sectoral assemblyman for the Industrial Labor Sector, Mindanao Region in the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP)\u2019s Philippine parliamentary elections and was a favorite among all the provincial governors of Mindanao to win. He eventually lost to Princess Porti Pacasum of Lanao, Philippines, the daughter of one of its biggest transport companies despite being the favored candidate to win. Fernandez a defeated man became literally old overnight. He was so sure of winning due to the strong support of 90% of the Mindanao governors spearheaded by Gov. Nonito D. Llanos, Sr., then governor of Davao del Sur and their electoral representatives. He suspected that the win was due to vote-buying, a common political strategy in the Philippines\u2019 political setting. Fernandez then decided to file an electoral protest to the Commission on Elections and was quite confident that it will result in his favor. The evening before he was about to file the protest, the then First Lady Imelda Marcos, visited Fernandez who was accompanied by his daughter Faith in Manila, and swayed him not to go through with the protest because it might get the ire of the Muslim population in Mindanao. Since Mindanao is predominantly Muslim, she said it would be best that a Muslim should win. Fernandez suspected that Imelda Marcos wanted Pacasum to win, because Mrs. Marcos was active in the Mindanao Peace efforts at that time and it would look good in her peace efforts. Knowing that the Marcos government is behind Pacasum and realizing their influence, Fernandez didn\u2019t continue filing the election protest and headed back to Davao City a disillusioned man.\n\nIt was during this period in his life that his heart illness became worst. After the IBP elections, Fernandez continued with his unrelenting labor efforts and DPGTWU remained highly regarded and robust. He nonetheless went to another observation trip to the US representing TUCP/KMP in October 1978 upon the sponsorship of the Asian American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) and toured 14 cities some of which were, Washington, D.C., New York City, and Chicago. The observation trip was cut short when he suffered a pulmonary heart attack in Chicago and was soon flown back to the Philippines by TUCP/KMP after being hospitalized for a brief period there. Meanwhile, during his term as president of DPGTWU, he was also elected as the President of the local Rotary International's District 3860 Toril, Davao City (then a municipality of Davao) in 1977. He further ran for the local Barangay elections in Talomo District, Davao City as Barangay Captain but then lost the seat to a local moneyed favorite.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nFernandez, with his health in decline and defiant of his doctors' wishes continued with his labor efforts and was still active in DPGTWU and TUCP/KMP in late 1978 and early 1979. He felt he was invincible and he never believed that death would overcome him. During a stop-over to Cebu City, in one of his frequent trips and visiting one of his daughters studying in Cebu, he suffered a severe stroke upon disembarking from a plane in Mactan-Cebu International Airport\u2019s tarmac. He was rushed to the nearest Perpetual Succour Hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival (DOA) on June 9, 1979 at 10:00 in the morning. A wake was held in Cebu for most of his relatives there and his body was flown to Davao City to be with his family and children. Buried at the Davao Memorial Park, his burial was attended by Davao\u2019s prominent citizens, some of TUCP-KMP\u2019s officers and his fellow workingmen. He used to say in one of his frequent monologues that he had always wanted to die in his hometown and he got his wish when he died in Cebu City. He left behind 13 children and two wives and a legacy of strength, integrity and wisdom within the Philippine\u2019s labor movement, his family & friends, and his compatriots."}], "Rudy Fernandez's legacy lives on in the work of the UFW and other labor and civil rights organizations.": [{"url": "https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-217", "page_content": "The formation of the United Farm Workers (UFW) in , under the leadership of Cesar Chavez, redefined farm labor activism and contributed to a new era of social justice movements in the United States. The union developed after years of struggle and failed attempts to create a permanent union for farm workers. In , the National Farm Labor Union, renamed the National Agricultural Workers Union (NAWU), made an attempt to organize farm workers. Scholar and activist Ernesto Galarza worked on strikes in the Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys of California but struggled to overcome differences in strategy among organizers. In , two organizations, The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), composed mainly of Filipinos, and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), composed mainly of Mexicans, formed in separate locations in rural California. The two organizations came together in for a strike of grape growers in Delano, California. They formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC), with Cesar Chavez as the president. In , the union became affiliated with the AFL-CIO, created a national executive board, and changed their name to the United Farm Workers of America, simply known by their acronym, \u201cUFW.\u201d\n\nCesar Chavez was born in Yuma, Arizona in . The son of sharecroppers, Chavez understood the difficulties of a life in farming. During the Great Depression, the government repossessed his family\u2019s homestead, forcing him and his siblings into the migrant stream of farm laborers that travelled through California in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Chavez met his wife, Helen Favela Chavez, during these trips. She, too, knew rural poverty, having family scattered throughout the many worker colonias (Mexican villages) in the Palo Verde, Imperial, and San Joaquin Valleys. These difficult beginnings inspired Cesar and Helen Chavez to pursue farm worker justice for the rest of their lives.\n\nAs an adolescent, Cesar Chavez exhibited early signs of rebellion, wearing the zoot suit common among disaffected Mexican youth in the 1940s, before entering the U.S. Navy. Following his release from the military, Chavez settled, with Helen, in the urban barrio, Sal Si Puedes (\u201cleave if you can\u201d) in San Jose, California. It was there in that Fred Ross, an organizer for the Saul Alinsky-inspired Community Service Organization (CSO), discovered Cesar Chavez and recruited him. Ross had studied the problems of rural communities in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and he learned that Mexican Americans and agricultural workers experienced the most entrenched forms of discrimination in California. He founded CSO with Mexican American activists and focused his attention on organizing the Mexican communities through house meetings in the barrios and colonias throughout the state. Ross recognized Chavez\u2019s unique ability to reach potential members in these meetings and quickly made him his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Together, they built a strong organization committed to solving the problems of Mexican Americans throughout the state.\n\nChavez recruited a number of skilled organizers into CSO, none more persuasive than Gilbert Padilla, a former onion picker from Hanford, California. Padilla embraced Chavez\u2019s vision for a more organized and politically active Mexican American community. Chavez also discovered a fiery, young single mother from Stockton, California, Dolores Huerta. Huerta channeled her father\u2019s United Mine Workers background and her experience working among Filipino field workers in her mother\u2019s restaurant and hotel business to build an effective strategy for organizing agricultural communities across racial lines. Together, this team moved CSO towards greater advocacy for agricultural workers in rural California. In , Chavez accepted a grant from the Packinghouse Workers of America to study the effects of the bracero program\u2014the bilateral U.S.-Mexican guest worker program begun in \u2014in Oxnard, California. When Chavez became national director of CSO, he assigned Padilla to the CSO service center in Stockton. To Chavez\u2019s delight, Padilla succeeded in securing a grant, in , from the Bishops\u2019 Committee on Migratory Labor in Chicago to study housing conditions for local farm workers.\n\nIn spite of his work and leadership in CSO, Chavez believed the organization lacked sufficient attention to the concerns of agricultural workers and rural communities. Against the advice of Saul Alinsky and Ernesto Galarza, Chavez resigned from CSO on , moved to Delano, California, and began building a new farm worker organization. Ross supported him and offered counsel. Padilla continued to study labor camps, and Huerta remained on staff at CSO until further notice from Chavez. By , Chavez had organized enough local members to convene the first meeting of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in Fresno, California. Padilla joined as a board member, with Chavez as director general. In a short period of time, Chavez reorganized NFWA, making himself president, Padilla first vice president, and Dolores Huerta second vice president. Ross would serve as a special adviser to Chavez over the next three decades.\n\nThe activities of other nonaffiliated activists and organizations assured Chavez that he had chosen the right path. The California Migrant Ministry began work in the San Joaquin Valley during the early 1960s, in part as a response to the activism of religion-oriented groups, such as Southern Christian Leadership Conference, working to end Jim Crow discrimination in the American South during the 1950s. Led by Wayne \u201cChris\u201d Hartmire, a Presbyterian minister, and Jim Drake, a Union Theological Seminary graduate, the California Migrant Ministry assisted local farm workers in the San Joaquin Valley with housing and transportation issues. Chavez counted the Migrant Ministry as an important early ally in his pursuit of farm worker justice.\n\nFilipino leaders shared similar concerns about farm worker conditions and sought remedies through unions. Among Filipino activists, Larry Itliong stood out. Born in San Nicolas, Pangasina, the Philippines, Itliong arrived in the United States in and worked in various crops and industries up and down the West Coast\u2014from harvesting lettuce in California to canning salmon in Alaska. He also served as a labor contractor who maintained constant communication with many of his fellow Filipino migrants. As an affiliate of the Communist Party and a believer in the union movement, Itliong embraced work with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and pursued justice through this organization. In , he began organizing for AWOC among Filipinos, recruiting a number of exceptionally gifted organizers, including Peter Velasco and Philip Veracruz, who became critical to the success of the United Farm Workers.\n\nThe merging of these movements and the establishment of the UFW began in the rural farming town of Coachella, California in the spring of , when Filipino workers under the banner of AWOC struck grape farms in an effort to increase their hourly wages and improve their living conditions. By , the movement spread to Delano, California in the San Joaquin Valley, where Padilla was working with Hartmire and Drake on farm worker housing issues and Chavez had been slowly building support for NFWA, one house meeting at a time. The decision of Itliong to call a strike of grape fields in Delano forced Chavez to make a decision whether to support the labor action and join forces with AWOC. Padilla played a crucial role in this process by speaking at the AWOC meeting in Filipino Hall in Delano and bringing Mexican farm worker interests to the table. On , Mexican Independence Day, Chavez held a meeting of NFWA in a small church in Delano. Although the strike had not been the preferred plan of action for Chavez, the momentum of the moment, and the rallying cries from rank and file Mexican workers, compelled him to join the fight. The following week, Chavez ordered his followers to picket grape growers alongside workers represented by AWOC, marking the beginning of what is known as the farm workers movement.\n\nDifferences in resources brought AWOC and NFWA closer together. The NFWA did not have a strike fund or permanent home, whereas AWOC had AFL-CIO support and Filipino Hall. The Filipinos relied on Chavez to persuade the majority of the workers who were Mexican to join the movement. The two groups forged a unique, if precarious, alliance that constituted the most serious challenge to the status quo in the San Joaquin Valley since the Cotton Strike of . The audacity of the movement captured the attention of United Auto Worker\u2019s union president, Walter Reuther, who chose to join Chavez, Itliong, and many other strikers in a march in Delano, and committed $10,000 per month to both AWOC and NFWA. Not to be outdone by Reuther, AFL-CIO president, George Meany, sent a representative, Bill Kircher, to fortify their support in the nascent movement. By , Kircher guided a merger of AWOC and NFWA, and brokered an agreement for Chavez to be president and Itliong to be vice president of the union.\n\nThe UFW began with the usual strategies of strikes and marches, but had difficulty winning in the fields. In the early days of the strike, Chavez merged picket signs announcing \u201cla huelga\u201d (the strike) with Christian iconography, such as the Virgin de Guadalupe, that resonated with Mexican workers and inspired them to join the movement. Although controversial for many traditional union leaders, the strategy played well to a public who understood racial discrimination during the Civil Rights Movement underway in the South. This message was most strongly communicated in Chavez\u2019s pilgrimage or peregrinaci\u00f3n from Delano to Sacramento, in the spring of . During the march, farm workers and their advocates carried religious symbols and sang Mexican protest songs in Spanish, while Chavez walked barefoot on highways that wound through farm worker communities. The pilgrimage gathered converts as it progressed and drew media attention to the farm worker struggle.\n\nThe march to Sacramento built support for the movement, but it did not break down the traditional advantage of growers in rural California. Agricultural work moved with the seasons and so did the work site, making it nearly impossible to anchor the movement in any one place. Additionally, whereas most union movements happened in urban, populated areas, the farm worker movement occurred in the countryside, away from the vast majority of citizens and fellow unionized workers who might also serve time on the picket lines. Chavez and the UFW learned how to overcome this problem by taking the fight to the cities in the form of the boycott. In , the union began boycotting the products of growers\u2014most notably wine and spirits\u2014upon the recommendation of Jim Drake. In time, the boycott expanded to table grapes and eventually became the key to the union\u2019s success.\n\nThe appeal to consumers not to buy grapes at North American markets was a major turning point in the movement for farm worker rights. Domestics and farm workers were among a group of U.S. employees denied access to collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of , known as the \u201cWagner Act,\u201d a major piece of legislation during the New Deal. Although the exclusion hurt the ability of farm workers to build unions, it freed them from some of the restrictions in the legislation, namely the ability to boycott. In , the Taft-Hartley Labor Act amended the NLRA to restrict labor unions from running campaigns against companies that were not abusing workers but were selling products of companies that were. In , the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act strengthened the restriction against this practice, which was known as a secondary boycott.1 The secondary boycott remained a viable tool to the excluded farm workers but prevented them from working closely with other unions on such a campaign. These restrictions necessitated shifts in the strategy by UFW organizers on the ground.\n\nChavez and the UFW maneuvered skillfully around these challenges to build a national, and eventually, an international boycott. During the spring of , Dolores Huerta appealed to the Central Labor Council, the Meatcutter\u2019s Union, and the Seafarer\u2019s Union to establish a total blockade of California grapes. The unions agreed to cooperate in time to interrupt the first grapes of the season from making their annual trip across the Hudson River by barge. As the grapes rotted in New Jersey, grape growers filed an injunction against the New York/New Jersey unions for violating federal regulations against secondary boycotts and demanded $25 million in compensation for lost sales. Although the Taft-Hartley Act did not apply to farm workers, it did restrict the Seafarer\u2019s Union from participating in such actions. The Seafarer\u2019s Union eventually released the grapes, but the pause in shipments had reduced the overall number of car lots for to a record low of 91, down from the industry norm of 418.2\n\nBy mid-July, Huerta and the efficient New York City boycott house shifted to consumer action, or the \u201csecondary boycott,\u201d picketing stores throughout the city. Huerta organized against the larger supermarkets in the hopes that an agreement with them would lead to their competitors following suit. In the New York area, the A&P chain dominated the market, which made it the first target for the boycott. Huerta described her strategy in a letter to Delano headquarters: \u201cIn each of the five boroughs, we organized neighborhood coalitions of church, labor, liberal, and student groups. Then we began picketing A&P, the biggest chain in the city. For several months, we had picket lines on about 25 to 30 stores and turned thousands of shoppers away. A lot of the managers had come up through the unions and were very sympathetic to us. In response to consumer pressure, the store managers began to complain to their division heads, and soon they took the grapes out of all of their stores, 430 of them.\u201d3 By knocking off A&P, the richest market chain in the United States, Huerta softened up their competitors\u2014Bohack, Walbaum\u2019s, Hills, and Finast\u2014for the kill. One by one, the stores became the exclusive target of the New York boycott house until all except one\u2014Gristedes, an expensive delivery service market for wealthy clients\u2014stopped selling grapes in the city.\n\nBoycott co-coordinator Jerry Brown, later described this maneuver as the \u201ctactic of the hostage stores\u201d and ordered boycott houses to implement it in cities across North America. According to Brown, Huerta had built strong boycott committees in neighborhoods where union membership was high and volunteers were plentiful, enthusiastic, and committed to stopping the sale of grapes in nearby stores. \u201cOnce [these individual A&P markets] started to capitulate,\u201d Brown explained, \u201c[Dolores] wouldn\u2019t call off the picket lines until they agreed to take [grapes] off the entire division [of A&P markets].\u201d4\n\nBrown demonstrated his prowess as a major tactician and organizer of the boycott. He arrived in Delano in from Cornell University with the intent of writing a dissertation on the farm worker communities. Instead, Chavez re-directed his energy in the service of the union. Within a short period of time, he applied his love of data analysis to the refinement of the boycott.\n\nWorking closely with his wife, Juanita, and a former Catholic priest, LeRoy Chatfield, Jerry Brown made changes that brought the growers to the bargaining table. In , they appealed to Chavez and the leadership for a much more systematic approach to the campaign. First, they argued for an approach that concentrated on building strong boycott houses in ten of the top forty-one cities, where more than 50 percent of California table grapes were sold. Those cities included: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, Toronto, Detroit, Montr\u00e9al, and Cleveland. They replaced the anecdotal reports for judging the success of the boycott with a clear and measurable goal of reducing shipments in every city by 10 percent or more over totals.5 Although growers had begun to show signs of redirecting shipments elsewhere to soften the blow of the boycott, Brown and Chatfield calculated that such a shift could not make up for the substantial losses in growers\u2019 traditional markets. As growers sent grapes to other ports, Jerry and Juanita Brown responded by working with volunteers in those cities to open up new boycott houses.\n\nThe game plan prepared by Jerry Brown and LeRoy Chatfield produced results as boycotters returned to houses across the country for the remainder of the season and through the harvest. In Toronto, the mayor declared as \u201cGrape Day\u201d and announced the city government\u2019s decision not to buy grapes in recognition of the farmworkers\u2019 struggle. In Chicago, Eliseo Medina organized a boycott campaign that persuaded the leading supermarket chain, Jewel, to stop carrying table grapes at every one of its 254 store locations. Similarly, in Cleveland, Mayor Carl Burton Stokes, the first African American to be elected mayor of a major U.S. city, ordered all government facilities to cease serving table grapes. Mack Lyons, the only African American on the National Executive Board of the UFW, made the appeal to Stokes and organized one of the strongest boycott houses in the network. In San Francisco, five major agribusiness organizations cancelled their annual meetings in the city in response to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors\u2019 endorsement of the boycott.6\n\nIn a final, desperate attempt to outrun the boycott, growers redirected their shipments to Europe. There, Brown drew on the creativity of Elaine Elinson, a veteran of the New York City boycott house, who had moved to England to study Chinese history but was unhappy with her decision. When she wrote Brown in Delano to see if she could come back to the United States to work for the union, Brown instructed her to remain in England. \u201cIf necessary you could come back right away,\u201d Brown responded to Elinson, but added, \u201cin as much as you are in London and we are trying to internationalize the boycott, Cesar asked if you couldn\u2019t hold on to your means of existence and do some ground work for us there.\u201d7\n\nLike Huerta before her, Elinson adapted to the environment around her. Elinson quickly figured out that social justice for farm workers could flow more easily through the collective action of unionized laborers. Unlike in North America, where labor laws restricted allied unions from helping the UFW execute a blockade of shipments, unions in the United Kingdom had greater freedom to assist other workers. British labor leaders and union officials were particularly scandalized by the denial of collective bargaining rights to farm workers. Rather than pursue a consumer boycott, Elinson shifted to working with a powerful British union, the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), to block (or \u201cblack\u201d) California table grapes. She described how it unfolded on the River Thames: \u201cWith the bill lading in hand, I went down to the London docks with Brian [Nicholson]. We would approach the team of dockworkers working on that particular ship and that particular hold. The workers would put down their ominous looking dockers\u2019 hooks (a pointed piece of iron attached to a strong wooden grip, used to pull cargo off ships before containerization) and gather round this odd pair. Brian, a third-generation dockworker, 6\u20193,\u201d in a thick sheepskin coat and cloth cap, orange sideburns, and a booming Cockney voice, would introduce me. I came up to his shoulder, had a ponytail and big mod glasses. They could hardly understand my American accent. We both wore red-and-black UFW buttons on our jackets.\u201d8 This same scene played out in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Unable to unload the \u201cblacked\u201d grapes anywhere in Europe, they were finally left to rot on a dock in Hamburg, Germany in late . By , the growers conceded defeat. The boycott drove twenty-six of them to the bargaining table, where they finally signed collective bargaining contracts with the UFW that ended the five-year-long Delano grape strike.9\n\nThe first few years after the historic contracts in were difficult ones, marred by competition from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union to represent farm workers. The Teamsters set their sights on representing lettuce workers in Salinas, California by negotiating \u201csweetheart contracts\u201d with growers without consulting workers. Although the UFW fought off the threat initially, the Teamsters continued to pursue the matter, including with grape workers in , when the initial contracts came up for renewal in the San Joaquin and Coachella Valleys. Through outright physical intimidation, the Teamsters declared war on the United Farm Workers, attempting to beat UFW representatives out of the fields. The extreme violence exhibited by the Teamsters precipitated retaliation from UFW supporters. In an attempt to quell the conflict and claim the moral higher ground, Chavez engaged in a hunger strike, converting his followers\u2019 ire for the Teamsters into concern for his health.\n\nChavez\u2019s strategy of nonviolence, borrowed directly from Mahatma Gandhi, worked to calm the passions of his followers but failed to stem the loss of members and the shift of momentum away from UFW. At the peak of employment in , the UFW boasted 60,000 members; however, loss of contracts to the Teamsters dropped membership down to 12,000 by the end of the harvest. By the winter of , the Teamsters cut UFW membership in half, to 6,000. The loss of members reduced dues, thereby cutting into the economic viability of the union. These struggles, and pressure from AFL-CIO president, George Meany, forced Chavez to sue for peace under a new state law\u2014the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act\u2014that promised to curb violence in the fields by holding elections and resolving unfair labor practices through the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB).\n\nThe United Farm Workers won the right to bargain collectively through the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA) in , a law that Governor Jerry Brown called \u201cthe greatest accomplishment of my administration.\u201d10 ALRA mirrored the NRLA and was implemented, in part, by members of the NLRB who came to California to see farm worker justice take off. Holding free and fair elections for representation in the fields and adjudicating unfair labor practice charges were two of the primary duties of the ALRB.\n\nALRA transformed the movement and Chavez. During its implementation, UFW\u2019s threats to boycott the ALRB and pressure from UFW\u2019s chief legal counsel, Jerry Cohen, helped the union win far more elections than it lost. By the end of , ALRB had held 354 elections; of these, the UFW scored victories in 189 of them, representing 26,956 workers, or 50.2 percent of voters. The Teamsters, by comparison, won 101 elections representing 12,284 workers, or 23 percent. While the union did not like to lose any workers, the UFW took solace in the fact that, in elections on fifty-eight ranches, 8,228 workers switched allegiances from the Teamsters to the UFW. Only 4 percent of workers voted for no representation.11\n\nJerry Cohen used these numbers to persuade the Teamsters to reach a settlement. After years of mayhem in the fields and numerous courtroom battles, the UFW and Teamsters met on , to agree to a moratorium on filing suits against one another. On , Cohen facilitated a meeting of Cesar Chavez and Teamster President Frank Fitzsimmons to sign a jurisdictional pact that recognized the right of the Teamsters to organize truck drivers, cannery workers, and other non-field workers, while UFW had exclusive rights to organize farm workers. The pact ended a six-year war between the unions and opened up the possibility for the UFW to take advantage of future union elections under ALRA.12\n\nIn spite of this success, the UFW struggled to work within the law. Problems existed from the start. After the first six months of its existence, the ALRB exhausted its budget and had to close down operations. In an attempt to protect funding for the future, Chavez pursued a risky strategy of appealing to voters to pass Proposition 14, an initiative that would have insured funding for all the work ALRB needed to do within a year. Chavez added the demand for greater union access to workers on farms, a provision that went against attitudes towards private property in California and the West. Proposition 14 went down in defeat by a 3:2 margin, costing the union $1.3 million and significant political clout. Nevertheless, the ALRB received funding the following fiscal year, in ; with it came continued opportunities for the UFW to win more elections.\n\nChavez\u2019s lack of faith in the strategy of state-sponsored collective bargaining further hindered progress under ALRA. He was not entirely alone among union leaders in his skepticism about the law. Eliseo Medina, a member of the Executive Board and one of the most skilled organizers, quipped in , \u201cWe ought to go to the Legislature and get\u2019em to repeal the ALRA and go back to the boycott!\u201d13 Crosby Milne, a management consultant for the union, shared, \u201cwe\u2019re being managed by the law.\u201d These sentiments supported Chavez\u2019s own notion that \u201cthe law had changed us completely,\u201d by which he meant, ALRA \u201chas become the center of power\u201d within the movement.14 For Medina, Milne, Chavez and others, the law made the labor of the movement more legal-bound and incumbent upon UFW attorneys to work out settlements with Teamster and grower lawyers or state officials. Under the law, the union\u2019s success became less a function of the \u201cmissionary work\u201d of appealing to consumers and workers to support la causa.15\n\nAlthough many union members lamented the change in strategy, no one resisted it more than Chavez. Eliseo Medina, for example, threw himself into organizing citrus workers and winning elections, striving to reach 100,000 members by the end of . Similarly, Marshall Ganz, a successful leader of the Toronto boycott, had worked with lettuce workers in the Imperial and Salinas Valleys and was committed to growing the union\u2019s ranks in these industries. Chavez, on the other hand, questioned the value of a union, and articulated a preference for organizing the poor and building a commune at the union headquarters, La Paz. Chavez envisioned the community looking much like those present at Synanon, a drug rehabilitation center that had become a religion under Chavez\u2019s friend, Chuck Dederich. In , he told the Executive Board, \u201cNo sooner than we will have it built than we\u2019re going to be faced with other forms of poverty \u2026 with mechanization and things coming up, it\u2019s going to be a small percentage of workers working, very well paid, a large majority of people in the rural areas still poor, you know, former farm workers, the rural poor. The way for me to go is to have a community like Synanon or close to that and start truly cooperative ventures. In other words, we start taking over the land.\u201d16\n\nIn the months following this meeting, Chavez appealed to the Executive Board to support the implementation of a controversial group encounter exercise, The Game, practiced at Synanon. The Game subjected members to harsh interrogations from peers, and sometimes Chavez, to achieve greater conformity to the leader. The practice began with a small group of younger members, including Chavez\u2019s son, Paul \u201cBabo\u201d Chavez and Dolores Huerta\u2019s daughter, Lori Huerta. The group met and played the Game at Synanon\u2019s headquarters, Home Place, in Badger, California, before moving to La Paz. Chavez eventually demanded that everyone at La Paz play The Game, though several members resisted. Outside of La Paz, staff members and volunteers working in boycott houses around the country questioned the practice and wrote letters of opposition to Chavez. When Chuck Dederich fell into trouble with the law after plotting to kill a lawyer who sued him for the mistreatment of children at Synanon, Chavez defend him. Ultimately, his association with Dederich and his experimentation with The Game damaged the esprit de corps within the movement and produced questions about his vision for the union. He responded to his critics by cancelling the boycott and purging members from the union.\n\nOther factors contributed to the weakened state of the union in the 1970s. The actions of the Teamsters created the perception that the fight for labor rights was between two unions rather than against the practices of farm owners. The confusion made it difficult for consumers to choose sides and follow the various boycotts. Some critics of the union also believed that the move of union headquarters in , from Delano to La Paz in the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains, contributed to Chavez\u2019s alienation from the rank and file. During the mid- to late 1970s, Chavez travelled to the field offices less frequently and focused a greater portion of his attention to building a community. When Chavez accepted an invitation from President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, several current and former members argued that he had lost touch with those who had supported him, especially Filipino members. He ignored the counsel of Gilbert Padilla, who advised him not to go. When Filipinos and Catholic supporters of the union faulted him for supporting Marcos, who opposed labor unions and practiced martial law in his country, Chavez refused to admit his mistake and pushed harder against his critics. The action upset many Filipinos within the union who challenged him from the floor of the UFW convention. Many left the union altogether. The controversy earned Chavez condemnation from the National Council of Churches and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, as well as criticism within the Filipino, radical, and popular press.17\n\nChavez\u2019s opposition to the creation of local chapters within UFW did not sit well with some members who had created \u201cranch committees.\u201d The ranch committees elected representatives and possessed their own ideas about strategy for pursuing justice on the farms they worked. This conflict came to a head in Salinas, when vegetable workers defied Chavez\u2019s wishes to pursue a boycott and declared a strike. The workers won the battle in , and Jerry Cohen negotiated the contracts with the growers, but Chavez refused to celebrate the victory with the workers.18 When these same workers tried to elect members to the UFW Executive Board at the union convention, Chavez expelled them from the floor and changed the rules unilaterally to block their election. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Chavez accused many of his most loyal members of treason, for their willingness to criticize him or express new ideas. These people included Gilbert Padilla, Chris Hartmire, Eliseo Medina, and Marshall Ganz, all key members who played a critical role in building the United Farm Workers.\n\nUltimately, Chavez and the UFW struggled with the transitions from being a social movement in the 1960s to a union responsible to members in the 1970s. Once it succeeded in drawing growers to the bargaining table, the union was forced into a process of professionalization by competing unions (The Teamsters) and grower expectations. Whereas other unions paid organizers to recruit workers, win elections, manage the hiring process, and negotiate contracts, the United Farm Workers depended on a volunteer system and a compensation structure that paid even the best organizers only $10 per week plus room and board.\n\nIn , the UFW lawyers\u2014who received $600 per month\u2014requested more for their services. Chavez refused to budge, demanding instead that they remain \u201cvolunteers,\u201d with a compensation structure far below the market rate. He also insisted that they play the Game. The lawyers accepted neither, leading to a break up between Cohen and Chavez, and a housecleaning of the legal department that compromised the union\u2019s ability to work within the ALRA.19 The dismantling of the organizing and management team also occurred elsewhere in the union, due in part to some of the same issues of poor compensation and Chavez\u2019s coercion.\n\nProblems in the organization notwithstanding, Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers delivered a degree of justice to farm workers and their families never before seen in California or the United States. Prior to the farm worker movement, unions used the boycott to create class solidarity by asking fellow laborers not to purchase a particular product linked to the unfair treatment of workers. Chavez and the UFW expanded the use of the boycott by appealing to an international public to participate on the grounds of achieving social justice rather than just labor solidarity. He attracted attention to the injustices of a farm labor system that employed mostly Mexican and Filipino laborers in hopes of capitalizing on a heightened civil rights consciousness in the nation. Indeed, at the height of the movement, Chavez counted Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert Kennedy, and numerous civil rights leaders as allies and advocates for his cause. His long marches in the San Joaquin Valley, fasts for calm in California and Arizona, and his speeches in urban California built a connection between the conditions of farm laborers in the fields and the buying habits of consumers in the city. To the surprise of his critics, his tactics mostly succeeded in winning over the public. The success of the boycott paved the way for contracts and legislation that, prior to the 1960s, no one thought possible. The boycott continues to shape the labor actions of current farm worker groups such as the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, who have appealed to consumers to call for an additional \u201cpenny-per-pound\u201d of tomatoes sold in supermarkets and used in restaurants, so that workers can monitor labor conditions on Florida farms.20\n\nChavez and the UFW contributed to a more general movement, known as the Chicano movement, for civil rights among Mexican Americans, during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the land grant movement led by Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina in New Mexico to reclaim property lost by Hispanos after the U.S.-Mexican War, the UFW inspired a new generation of urban Mexican American youths to organize their communities and peers. Chavez was a role model for this generation of Mexican Americans, although his opposition to illegal immigration occasionally landed him on the wrong side of college-educated Mexican Americans who began to question this policy. Chavez eventually withdrew his public opposition to undocumented immigrants but never embraced the idea that organizing them would benefit farm worker justice.21\n\nCesar Chavez died on , in Arizona. He continues to be an icon of the civil right movement, with his image gracing a U.S. postage stamp, his name can be found on streets and buildings through the country, and movies and books are dedicated to telling his story. President Barack Obama used the UFW rallying cry\u2014Si, Se Puede/Yes, We Can\u2014for his election, and honored Chavez and the United Farm Workers during his re-election campaign in by making La Paz a National Park."}, {"url": "https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=1578", "page_content": "Chavez and the UFW: A Review Essay\n\nCalifornia's 1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act was widely expected to usher in a new era for farm workers. The ALRA, the most pro-worker and pro-union labor relations law in the US, requires quick elections whose timing is controlled by unions. Employers who refuse to bargain in good faith with certified unions can be ordered to pay their workers the difference between what would have been negotiated and what was actually paid. Finally, since 2003, California farm worker unions can request mandatory mediation to achieve a first contract if they are unable to negotiate one.\n\nDespite the favorable ALRA, the United Farm Workers founded by Cesar Chavez had fewer than 50 contracts and 5,000 members at the end of 2009. What went wrong? Three decades ago, the UFW was expected to organize most of the 2.5 million hired farm workers across the US, which would have made it one of the largest US unions (the Service Employees International Union is currently the largest US union, with almost two million members, over half in health care, 850,000 state and local government workers, and 225,000 janitors and security guards).\n\nThe ALRA was a self-help tool? it granted rights to farm workers that they were expected to use to form or join unions and bargain for higher wages. There are four major explanations for the failure of the UFW and other farm worker unions to organize farm workers and transform the farm labor market via collective bargaining: union leadership failures, political changes, employer restructuring, and immigration.\n\nMost books emphasize union leadership failures and political changes in Sacramento to explain why the UFW was unable to transform California's farm labor market. The leadership failure explanation focuses on Cesar Chavez, acknowledging his charismatic leadership that inspired farm workers and attracted volunteers to La Causa and emphasizing his unwillingness to allow the UFW to become a business union that provided services efficiently to its worker-members. Instead, Chavez drove away loyal volunteers in the 1980s, just as the power to appoint policy makers to the state agency administering the ALRA shifted from Democrats to Republicans.\n\nEmployer restructuring and immigration explanations may be more compelling for farm worker union failures. The UFW had its breakthrough successes between 1966 and 1980 with the California farming subsidiaries of multinationals vulnerable to consumer boycotts, Schenley liquor and United Brands (Chiquita bananas). Both Schenley and the United's Sun Harvest signed UFW contracts that raised entry-level wages over 40 percent, an extraordinary accomplishment then or now, to avoid boycotts of their nonfarm products.\n\nThese vulnerable-to-boycott farming operations were sold soon after contracts were signed, and their land was taken over by growers much more likely to use intermediaries to obtain seasonal workers. Chavez saw farm labor contractors (FLCs) as the enemy of unions, and the ALRA explicitly makes the operator of a farm on which a FLC works the employer for union purposes (but not for minimum wage and immigration purposes). This means that a crew of FLC workers could move from farm to farm, vote for the union, and leave the farm with an obligation to bargain, even if the workers who voted for representation never worked on that farm again. Employers avoid FLCs believed to have pro-union crews. Furthermore, by bringing both workers and forklifts and trucks to the farm and making decisions about where to harvest in consultation with packers and processors rather than farmers, many FLCs became custom harvesters and thus employers in their own right, a development not anticipated in the mid-1970s. It has been very hard for unions to organize custom harvester crews.\n\nUnions, primarily the UFW and the Teamsters, had their maximum impacts on farm wages and benefits between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s, a period of very low immigration. The Bracero program ended in 1964, and unauthorized migration did not begin to surge until 1983, when a then-record 1.3 million foreigners were apprehended by the Border Patrol (peak apprehension years were 1986 and 2000, with 1.8 million each year).\n\nThe Teamsters withdrew from the fields in the late 1970s, clearing the way for the UFW to organize farm workers. With seasonal worker \"careers\" typically less than 10 years, organizing newcomers is a high priority for unions. Organizing was not a priority for the UFW during the 1980s, when the equivalent of the entire farm work force changed, making it no surprise that many 20-year old farm workers by 1990 thought Cesar Chavez referred to the Mexican boxer rather than the UFW leader.\n\nThe unanswered question is whether sustained organizing and pro-union appointees to the ALRB could have kept the UFW growing in the 1980s despite structural changes in farm employment and rising immigration. Ganz suggests that sustained organizing could have moved mountains, allowing the UFW to thrive despite other economic forces that put downward pressure on wages. Pawel shows that Chavez was not interested in business unionism, defined as organizing workers and providing services to union members. Shaw's book aims to extract lessons from the UFW that have aided in nonfarm social justice campaigns. All focus on personalities, not economic forces.\n\nThe UFW since 1994 has been headed by Arturo Rodriguez, Chavez's son-in-law, who repeated the Delano to Sacramento march, signed contracts with long-time UFW nemeses such as Bruce Church and Gallo of Sonoma, and won the mandatory mediation amendment to the ALRA in 2002 under then Governor Gray Davis. However, the \"new UFW?s\" strawberry organizing campaign of the late 1990s largely failed, and there have been more decertifications of the UFW in the image-conscious wine business than certifications.\n\nThe UFW remains a political power, able to persuade the California Legislature (but not the governor) to approve a card-check amendment to the ALRA so that unions can be recognized as the representative of farm workers without an election (the UFW lost an election September 1, 2005 at table-grape grower Giumarra Vineyards despite 70 percent of workers signing union authorization cards? some workers apparently changed their minds). The UFW executive board in 2009 included two members who primarily dealt with grower contracts and four who dealt primarily with politics.\n\nGanz. Marshall Ganz, a UFW organizer from 1965 until the early 1980s, credits the UFW's \"strategic capacity\" for winning contracts with grape and lettuce growers in the late 1960s and early 1970s (\"Why David Sometimes Wins\" is a seven-chapter rewrite of Ganz's 2000 PhD thesis). During the heyday of the UFW, many large fruit and vegetable growers believed that unionization was inevitable and signed contracts with the UFW that raised wages and introduced benefits such as health insurance and pensions to seasonal farm workers. The contracts negotiated in the 1970s gave the UFW unprecedented power to be consulted over pesticides and other farming-related practices.\n\nGanz's book is primarily historical, reviewing previous failed efforts to organize farm workers in the first half of the 20th century in order to explain how Cesar Chavez and the UFW succeeded in organizing farm workers in the early 1960s. Ganz attributes the UFW's success to three factors: motivated leaders; ties to supporters that ranged from unions and churches to college students; and creative decision-making. Ganz credits Chavez for the UFW's victories in the 1960s and 1970s, and blames Chavez for the UFW's decline in the 1980s. For example, it was hard to develop farm worker union leaders from within because the UFW had no locals, so that members of the ranch committees established on each farm had no easy way to climb the ladder to UFW leadership positions.\n\nPawel. Loa Angeles Times reporter Miriam Pawel examines the evolution of the UFW from the 1960s to the 1990s through eight key figures ranging from lawyer Jerry Cohen to minster Chris Hartmire; all left the UFW by the time Chavez died in 1993. She concludes that Cesar Chavez began the UFW practically alone, and wound up as the single force directing it, unable and unwilling to share power.\n\nPawel wrote a four-part series critical of the UFW?s financial dealings in January 2006, concluding that \"Chavez's heirs run a web of tax-exempt organizations that exploit his legacy and invoke the harsh lives of farmworkers to raise millions of dollars in public and private money, [but] the money does little to improve the lives of California farmworkers.\"\n\nPawel's fast-paced six-part, 28-chapter book reviews the rise of the UFW in the 1960s that culminated in contracts with major table-grape growers in 1970. As Chavez fasted in 1968 to call attention to the grape boycott and gained the status of the Hispanic version of Martin Luther King, it was already apparent that he believed that people were either union supporters or opponents and that there was no room for dissent within the union.\n\nPart two deals with the struggle to move the union from Delano grapes to Salinas lettuce in the early 1970s. Many grower-shippers responded to the UFW by signing contracts with the Teamsters, who already represented their nonfarm packing and transport workers. Instead of a boycott, Salinas lettuce workers went on strike, confusing nonfarm supporters across the US who were asked to boycott stores that sold lettuce picked by Teamster-represented farm workers and to buy lettuce harvested by UFW members. Meanwhile, Chavez moved from Delano to La Paz, a remote location, and ignored a rising tide of complaints from both growers and workers about the union's administration of its contracts, especially the hiring halls used to deploy seasonal workers to jobs on farms.\n\nPart three turns to the near-demise of the UFW in 1973-74 and its resurrection with the election of Governor Jerry Brown. Pawel emphasizes that Chavez was ambivalent about the ALRA, insisting on provisions so favorable to unions, such as quick elections at peak season and a continued right to engage in secondary boycotts, that he did not expect the ALRA to be approved. The ALRA was enacted in 1975, and Pawel quotes Chavez as predicting that, as the farm worker struggle shifted from boycotts in the cities to elections in the fields, the UFW would \"lose a hell of a lot of power.\" (p156)\n\nChavez believed that unauthorized foreigners weakened the UFW and helped growers to break strikes. Pawel quotes Chavez telling the UFW's executive board in 1974 that \"if we can get the illegals out of California and Arizona, we can win the strike overnight.\" (p141).\n\nPart four turns to UFW activities under the ALRA. California farm workers for the first time had a state agency, the ALRB, to supervise elections and process charges that their ALRA rights were violated. The ALRB could restore the economic status quo after ULPs were committed by ordering employers to reinstate unlawfully fired workers with backpay and ordering employers who failed to bargain in good faith to \"make their workers whole.\" No other US labor law has the makewhole remedy, which growers complained put the ALRB on the union's side of the bargaining table.\n\nChavez preached nonviolence, but Pawel emphasizes that he rejected the plan of Eliseo Medina to focus on farms without Teamster contracts in Fall 1975. Instead, Chavez insisted that the UFW confront the Teamsters on farms where they had contracts; the UFW usually won elections to represent farm workers, but there were frequent conflicts between Teamster and UFW organizers (p160). Pawel recounts the dirty tricks? employers and Teamsters sometimes called immigration agents to stage raids just before elections? but the UFW nonetheless won 55 percent of the elections that were certified in Fall 1975, compared to 32 percent for the Teamsters.\n\nIn February 1976, the ALRB ran out of money and shut down. The ALRA remained in effect, but no elections were held until July 1976, when the state's new fiscal year began. Over the objections of Governor Jerry Brown, the godfather of the ALRA, Chavez insisted on putting Proposition 14 on the Fall 1976 ballot, which would have enshrined the ALRA in the California constitution and assured funding for the ALRB. Most opinion leaders opposed amending the state constitution to fund a particular state agency. Growers ran ads attacking the access rule, which was not in the ALRA but adopted by the first ALRB and allowed union organizers to enter farms and talk to workers. Proposition 14 lost 38 to 62 percent, helping to pierce the UFW's aura of invincibility.\n\nChavez responded to voter rejection of Prop 14 with a purge of the volunteers who had built and sustained the UFW. He turned to Synanon, which used a \"Game\" to criticize a particular person. Lawyer Jerry Cohen, for example, was criticized for keeping the UFW's legal department in Salinas rather than moving to La Paz with Chavez. Pawel suggests that, during the critical 1976-77 period, when the UFW should have been building a structure to organize and administer contracts, Chavez focused on re-orienting the UFW to be a poor people's movement rather than a union.\n\nPart five recounts the tensions within the UFW between pragmatists who wanted to build a union and Chavez intent on turning the UFW into a cooperative sustained by volunteers. Chavez insisted on approving each contract that was negotiated. He wanted union staff be non-salaried volunteers, with no exceptions for professionals such as lawyers. When Chavez rejected plans to add volunteer staff to organize farm workers in 1978, Eliseo Medina, now a leader of the Service Employees International Union, resigned.\n\nPart six turns to the UFW's Waterloo, the strikes against lettuce growers early in 1979 that resulted in Pyrrhic victory. The first contracts signed under the ALRA expired in early 1979, and the UFW called a strike against Imperial Valley lettuce growers. After six months, the UFW won the 42 percent wage increase it demanded from a few growers, such as the Sun Harvest subsidiary of United Brands, raising entry-level wages from $3.70 to $5.25 an hour. In another seeming UFW victory , the ALRB's Admiral Packing decision ordered growers who refused to raise wages to Sun Harvest levels to \"make their workers whole\" at the Sun-Harvest wage rates. However, the multinationals sold their fresh vegetable subsidiaries, leaving the UFW empty handed, and the California courts overturned the ALRB decision, leaving UFW-represented workers without jobs or backpay.\n\nPawel concludes that Chavez did not want more contracts in the Salinas Valley because they included paid union representatives who became an independent power base that challenged his authority. Chavez's micro-management prompted key staff to quit. Jerry Cohen resigned in November 1980 after Chavez rebuked him for not including a UFW-run hiring hall in a re-negotiated contract, and Marshall Ganz and other long-time leaders left soon afterward.\n\nPawel devotes a chapter to the UFW convention in September 1981, the first time that Chavez was challenged by farm worker union members. These Salinas representatives, with independent power bases among relatively well-paid farm workers, wanted to nominate farm workers for the UFW's executive board. Chavez worked tirelessly to remove them from power and eventually fired nine. They sued and won back pay, but the UFW changed its constitution in 1983 to ensure that farm-level union representatives were appointed, keeping power centralized.\n\nPawel concludes that Chavez was a gifted but flawed leader. He was able to encourage farm workers to organize for change, to inspire volunteers, and to elicit donations and support from the wider public, but unable to negotiate and administer union contracts. Chavez made many sacrifices, including long marches and lengthy fasts, but did not take responsibility for mistakes. When things went wrong, Chavez found scapegoats.\n\nChavez in the late 1970s came to believe that most of his enemies were within the UFW. Pawel's stories of unfounded charges that drove dedicated volunteers from the UFW and frequent allusions to Chavez's preferences for the leadership style of Mao in China reinforce the image of the UFW as an organization unable to tolerate dissent. Chavez is quoted as saying that that he was reluctant to give up the \"absolute power\" he had when the UFW began in the early 1960s.\n\nThe UFW remains a top-down organization headquartered in La Paz, far from the San Joaquin Valley with half of the state's farm workers. The UFW has never had local unions, meaning that all decisions are made or reviewed by \"distant\" leaders, and there is no natural ladder from worker to local union leader. The UFW reports fewer than 5,000 members and fewer than 1,000 retirees on its annual LM-2 financial reports (www.unionreports.gov). They are served by 64 UFW employees and 11 officers, one of the highest ratios of employees to members among unions.\n\nIn recent years, UFW revenues have been almost $7 million a year, with 40 percent from dues. UFW dues are two percent of gross earnings, suggesting that $2.6 million in dues income was generated from $130 million in earnings, equivalent to 5,000 workers each earning $26,000. The UFW's share of workers is largest in mushrooms, where workers are employed year-round.\n\nShaw. Randy Shaw, an activist lawyer who helped to found the Tenderloin Housing Clinic http://thclinic.org), wrote the 11-chapter \"Beyond the Fields\" book because ?little is known about Cesar Chavez and the farmworkers' movement.? (pxi).\n\nUnfortunately, Shaw's book does not clarify the UFW's story. The history of the UFW in chapter one is marred by errors. Over 4.5 million Mexicans were admitted as braceros between 1942 and 1964, but they did not all come to California (p15). The table grape strike of 1965 was set in motion by growers reducing wages? Braceros had to be paid at least $1.40 an hour, but US farm workers at the time had no minimum wage protections, and growers offered them $1.25 an hour? the dispute was over a wage cut (p18). The DiGiorgio election was in August 1966, not 1967 (p20).\n\nShaw races through the grape boycott, emphasizing the importance of college student UFW volunteers, praising the UFW's willingness to give women responsibility, and arguing that mainstream AFL-CIO unisons were not helpful, even though United Auto Workers union contributions were a key source of funds for the fledgling UFW. The main message of Shaw's book is that UFW boycott strategies of the late 1960s and early 1970s were very successful, and that the UFW went into decline after winning the ALRA in 1975, when organizing and bargaining replaced activism.\n\nChapter two profiles \"successful boycotts\" that range from boycotting Salvadoran coffee to boycotting hotels to encourage them to remain neutral in organizing drives. Chapter three turns to fasts, crediting Chavez's frequent fasts with winning publicity and sympathy for UFW causes? but finds few successors who fasted to achieve labor goals. Chapter four turns to Justice for Janitors campaigns, highlighting on the successful effort of UFW-alumnus Eliseo Medina to have the University of Miami raise payments to its janitorial contractor so that the SEIU could win an increase in janitors' wages.\n\nChapter five on pesticides credits the UFW with an \"historic role in educating the public about the concept of environmental justice,\" (p140), largely because of pesticide safety language in 1970s contracts. Chapter six turns to political campaigns, crediting the UFW with developing an effective grass-roots campaign to defeat the grower-drafted Proposition 22 in 1972, but not explaining why the same grass-roots campaign failed to win voter approval of UFW-backed Proposition 14 in 1976. Chapter seven focuses on Miguel Contreras, the first Latino to head the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, who played a major role in shaping Los Angeles politics, and credits unions with mobilizing Hispanics to vote.\n\nChapter eight aims to \"set the record straight\" on Chavez's attitudes toward unauthorized workers. Shaw argues that Chavez opposed only unauthorized workers who were used as strikebreakers, and that his opposition softened as the UFW weakened in the 1980s (p198). Shaw recounts the AFL-CIO's journey from being an enthusiastic supporter of employer sanctions to calling for their abolition in February 2000, and summarizes the activities of union leaders who are calling for the legalization of unauthorized workers.\n\nChapter nine is devoted to House approval in December 2005 of an enforcement-only immigration bill and the reaction that culminated in the May 1, 2006 \"Day Without Immigrants,\" when perhaps a million immigrants attended rallies around the US. Unions provided much of the organizational support for the marches, especially in California, where a third of workers are immigrants. Shaw cites the slogan, \"today we march, tomorrow we vote\" as a reason the Senate rebuffed the House and approved a bill that included legalization in June 2006. Shaw noted that in June 2007, when the Senate failed to approve a comprehensive immigration reform bill, ex-UFW leader Eliseo Medina came under fire from many other union leaders for supporting a guest worker program, something Chavez opposed (p240).\n\nChapters 10 and 11 turn to what went wrong with the UFW in the late 1970s and 1980s. Shaw selects an event each year, from the defeat of UFW's Proposition 14 in 1976 to departure of Medina in 1978, to explain the UFW's demise. The 1979 lettuce strike, which raised the wages of some workers by 40 percent, turned into a union defeat as the employers most vulnerable to union boycotts signed contracts and went out of business. The UFW, which had largely dismantled its organizing and legal departments, turned inward in the early 1980s, dismissing UFW representatives who wanted to reshape the union's direction. Chapter 11 lists those who began social-justice careers in the UFW.\n\nThe concluding chapter emphasizes that the UFW allowed young volunteers to learn skills needed to fight for social justice away from agriculture. Shaw believes that ACORN (www.acorn.org), PIRG (www.pirg.org), and some unions are playing the training role of the UFW today. Shaw concludes that the volunteers trained by the UFW and its \"yes we can\" slogan will inspire a new generation of activists.\n\nShaw is a social activist who summarizes a variety of social justice campaigns, emphasizing the contributions of ex-UFW leaders or tactics developed by the UFW. The intent of Shaw's book is to highlight the contributions of the UFW to nonfarm social-justice movements in the 21st century, from living wages to immigration reform; his contribution would have been stronger with a more careful analysis of the UFW.\n\nOne issue not explored by Shaw is money. Chavez was notorious for living on a small salary and insisting that other UFW employees follow his example. The UFW was supported by donations from other unions, churches, and appeals to the public, and today gets most of its revenue from such sources. The UFW and other social-justice organizations often obtain government funds to deal with social problems that support the organization. Shaw's Tenderloin Housing Clinic, for example, reported that $15 million of its $24 million income in 2008 was from government grants.\n\nGanz, Marshall. 2009.

In an interview with UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, Dennis J. Bernstein discusses Cesar Chavez\u2019s legacy and the battles ahead.\n\nBy Dennis J. Bernstein\n\nThe late Cesar Chavez, who founded the United Farm Workers 50 years ago, was an extraordinary human being. His commitment to gain recognition for farm workers of California and across the United States was unstoppable. He worked tirelessly to get them key worker protections.\n\nWith his various acts of civil disobedience, and long fasts, risking death, Chavez has often been compared to legendary figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe California State Assembly recently passed a resolution recognizing March 31 as Cesar Chavez Day and urging Californians to observe a day of public service. The resolution was authored by California State Assemblyman, Luis Aledo, of Watsonville, where the UFW farm worker struggle began 50 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe injustices in the field are not merely a Latino experience,\u201d Alejo said \u201cThe struggles that farm workers faced and continue to face are shared with the African-American community, the Filipino and Asian community, members of the Arab community and countless others.\u201d\n\nMarch 31, 1927 was Chavez\u2019s birthday, and this year marks the half-century anniversary of the founding of the UFW. In conjunction, with the 50th anniversary celebration, I spoke with current UFW President, Arturo Rodriguez, about Chavez, his work, and the continuing struggle of the farm workers for fair treatment and safer working conditions.\n\nDB: We turn our attention back to the farm workers, who are currently fighting for legislation \u2014 really life and death legislation \u2014 to protect them from continuing to die in the fields from extreme heat. Joining us to talk about the battle in the California legislature is Arturo Rodriguez. He is the President of the United Farm Workers. .\n\nAnd before we jump into the legislation let\u2019s just say a thing or two about Cesar Chavez and his crucial legacy. Remind people who he was. Remind us who he was and why it\u2019s important not only to remember Cesar Chavez but to carry on the work.\n\nAR: Well, Cesar Chavez founded the United Farm Workers back in 1962 along with 200 farm workers. They had a dream, they had a vision, knew that it just wasn\u2019t right for farm workers to continue to get abused, disrespected, paid low wages, and not given the dignity that they deserve as producing and harvesting our fruits and vegetables here in the nation.\n\nDB: And what impact did he have on the whole labor movement? It was dramatic and was transformational, wasn\u2019t it?\n\nAR: Cesar Chavez brought new life to the labor movement, brought to it new tactics, new strategies, new ways of doing things, and yet at the same time, he didn\u2019t have the opportunities like so many others in getting a formal education. He was only able to go to the eighth grade but he was determined, committed, very practical about his work.\n\nHe understood that the only way we could build a union for farm workers was to not only rely upon the sacrifices and the hard work of farm workers but at the same time depend heavily on consumers here, throughout the United States, Canada, and other part of the world to really bring about economic pressure on employers through the use of the boycotts.\n\nNever before had boycotts been utilized throughout the labor movement. Now, today, it is very commonplace for millions to be able to utilize boycotts to be able to meet their goals and to meet their objectives in regards to getting contracts and improving wages for their work forces.\n\nDB: And he also put his life on the line with life threatening hunger strikes that called the attention, the plight of the farm workers, to people in this country and around the world, and brought significant folks from everywhere.\n\nAR: Exactly, Dennis. I mean, Cesar Chavez believed in non-violence much in the following of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. He felt that it was important to really engage people, and for one, to sacrifice, make sacrifices of their own to really get people to respond, and to listen and to demonstrate that this was such an important issue that he was willing to make penance for all the things that farm workers had to have done throughout the years in order to really bring about change and to bring about the determination necessary to be able to form a union, to be able to form an association.\n\nThroughout his life he fasted numerous times, but the three major fasts, the first one was in 1968 where he fasted for 24 days. Robert Kennedy came and broke that fast with him at that particular time. And then he fasted in 1972 in Phoenix, Arizona. And that again was for 24 days and at that particular time Robert\u2019s son, came and broke the fast there with Cesar at mass on that particular day.\n\nAnd his third fast was his longest fast, that was in 1988, shortly before he passed away when he was 61 years old, took place in Delano, California, and that was finalized with a mass and Ethel [Kennedy] came to break bread with Cesar and mark the ending of that particular fast.\n\nDB: You have said that it is still a life-and-death battle to have legislation passed in the California legislature that will prevent farm workers, at least help prevent farm workers from continuing to die horrible deaths in the sun, as they pick the fruits and vegetables that we all depend on. And this is, \u2026 I say life and death no exaggeration. Farm workers continue to die, right?\n\nAR: Exactly right Dennis. I mean we found over the last, since 2005, there have been at least 16 farm workers that have been documented, that died as a result of heat stroke just here in the state of California alone. And they\u2019re just horrible deaths, when folks are out there harvesting the fruits and vegetables with temperatures going beyond a hundred degrees, plus.\n\nThey are not given the water they need, they are not given the rest that they need. They are forced to work at an incredible pace in order to insure that the production quotas are met by the foremen, by the labor contractors, and by the growers where they work at. And sometimes it\u2019s just impossible.\n\nI know one of the deaths that we made sure that people were aware of was a young Oaxacan woman, Maria Isabel Vasquez Jimenez, who died at the age of 17 when she was pregnant. And it was impossible for her to maintain the pace that growers forced her to do while she was harvesting the wine grapes up there in northern San Joaquin Valley, up there near Stockton.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s been situations like that that has really, not only inspired us, but motivated us to go after legislation that really puts pressure on the state of California, on Cal-OSHA, on Governor Jerry Brown to insure that the laws that are passed by the legislature and signed by the governor are really enforced. So that farm workers don\u2019t have to needlessly die as a result of just trying to do their job out there, Dennis.\n\nDB: Now we are very specifically talking about AB 2346, we\u2019re talking about the California legislature. How will this bill help, if it passes?\n\nAR: Well, first of all, Dennis, I mean this is our way of celebrating the legacy of Cesar Chavez. We want to continue doing the work. You know, it is nice that we have streets, and we have buildings and schools and libraries and all those kinds of things recognizing the work that Cesar Chavez did but truth be told the way we really represent and remember his legacy is through continuing to make improvements for the lives of farm workers.\n\nAnd what AB 2346 will do is force the growers to allow farm workers, to give them the authority that if the grower is not abiding by the regulations that exist to give farm workers more drinking water, to provide them rest when they ask for it, to insure that there is shade in the fields while they are working out there in the extreme heat, that they can in turn make a citizen\u2019s arrest.\n\nAnd that secondly, that the growers will be responsible for the actions of the farm labor contractors, or their foramens, or their supervisors at their particular company. They won\u2019t be allowed to just wash their hands. These violations that take place constantly and saying \u201cLook, we didn\u2019t know, we weren\u2019t aware\u2026.\u201d you know \u201chow can we keep track of \u2026\u201d\n\nWell, of course, they can keep track of what\u2019s going on in their fields. Just like they do the production of the product that\u2019s being harvested there. They know exactly how much is being produced. By the same token they can know what the conditions are like. They can insure that the farm labor contractors, or foremen, or supervisors they are hiring, Dennis, are abiding by the laws that we fight so hard to get here in this particular state.\n\nDB: Governor Jerry Brown, bills himself as a liberal Democrat. On the last round for this bill, Brown opposed it. Want to give us a little history on his support, or lack thereof?\n\nAR: Well, Governor Jerry Brown in the 1970\u2018s, he signed historic legislation for farm workers. The California Agriculture Labor Relations Act allowing farm workers for the first time the opportunity to be able to organize and to be able to form a union, just like any other worker here in the United States. Now, we find in his second round of being governor here in the state that, you know, we need to go and call attention to the various issues that are important to farm workers.\n\nOften times the interest of growers or the interest of people with money far outpace the needs of farm workers, of poor people, of minorities here in the state, especially when they are undocumented workers. And as a result, Dennis, we find ourselves doing marches, and doing protests, and doing fasting and letter-writing campaigns and e-mail campaigns.\n\nAnything that we can possibly do to get the attention of the governor to insure that he does not forget about what the right thing to do is, and does not forget about the sacrifices that farm workers make every single day to make sure that he has food on his table as well as everybody else in this nation.\n\nDB: Have you spoken to the governor?\n\nAR: Oh definitely. I mean, last year, before we marched to Sacramento in pursuit of ensuring that farm workers had better organizing rights and opportunities than what was passed and what was existing right now. And to ensure that that law was enforced the Agriculture Labor Relations Act, we marched 200 miles, Dennis, from Madera, California, in the San Joaquin Valley, to Sacramento.\n\nAnd it was done during the month of August, it was extremely hot out there, for the workers that accompanied me. And as a result, you know, prior to that march we sat down for several hours with Governor Jerry Brown and made it very clear to him why we were marching, why we felt it was necessary to expand the organizing rights of farm workers. They are not just like any other worker in this country.\n\nAnd that we\u2019re up against tremendous opposition, tremendous power on the part of the growers. And so that we were looking for his leadership, and looking for him to do what was the right thing to do on behalf of farm workers in this country. And that he had a legacy, in terms of helping poor people, and he should be thinking about that legacy, as much as he is in terms of thinking about increasing the revenue of this state, and everything else.\n\nSo, yes, we have spoken with him, we\u2019ve made it very clear in terms of what our thoughts are in this situation. And we\u2019re going to continue to push for the type of enforcement necessary and to push for the types of laws that would really give farm workers the same opportunities as other workers in this country; to have a better life, to be able to have a decent wage, a living wage, be able to have a medical plan for their families, and to take care of their basic needs.\n\nDB: Well, I hope the governor is listening. He used to do the show right before this one on KPFA, Pacifica radio. And he used to talk a lot about how important these kinds of issues were and he seemed to be very supportive.\n\nAR: And, you know, it always is important and critical to just take a moment to let farm workers know that we appreciate the sacrifices that they make every day to make sure that we\u2019ve got fruit, vegetables, that we\u2019ve got the wine that we consume, that all of that, that we appreciate the fact that they take the time to do it.\n\nBecause, Dennis, the reality is if these farm workers weren\u2019t here doing that work there wouldn\u2019t be anybody else to harvest the crops. No line of people waiting, despite the unemployment that exists in this state. There are not people waiting to get that job in the fields. It\u2019s extremely difficult, it requires a lot of talent and skill, and profession. For someone to be able to endure the circumstances, and simultaneously be able to pick the kind of product that the grower calls on, that the consumers want and to ensure they pick it at the pace required by the growers.\n\nThat is our way of honoring Cesar Chavez, as well as we\u2019re going to be in all parts of the country these next few days. You know, I just returned from the Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., where Secretary Hilda Solis honored the five martyrs of the United Farm Workers.\n\nThis year we celebrate our 50th anniversary so the Department of Labor inducted the five martyrs of the UFW into the Labor Hall of Honor, which is unheard of and we\u2019re so grateful to Secretary Solis for taking the time, and then they named the auditorium there at the Secretary of Labor offices there in Washington, D.C., after Cesar Chavez.\n\nSo it was a real emotional event, as you might imagine Dennis, when the families of those farm workers were recognized by the Secretary of Labor, they were recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, as well as the Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack. So we are very blessed with a lot of support. We thank everyone that\u2019s joining in with us in various activities as we celebrate this year.\n\nDB: And please tell us the names of the five martyrs.\n\nAR: The first one was a woman named, a young Jewish woman named Nan Freeman, who was killed in 1972 on the picket line in Florida. And then there was two individuals that were killed during the 1973 grape strike, in the San Joaquin Valley, in the Lamont, California area. And one was Nagi Daifallah and the other was Juan de la Cruz.\n\nThe fourth was killed in 1979 during the vegetable strike, the Salinas and Imperial Valley lettuce strike, and broccoli and other vegetables, and that was Rufino Contreras. And then the last worker was a 21-year-old farm worker from the Fresno area. His name was Rene Lopez. And he was killed actually during a union election, if you can imagine that! Where the employer\u2019s brother-in-law came and pulled Rene over to his car and pulled a pistol out and shot him dead right there at the election site.\n\nDB: And I was just going to say before \u2026 the folks in Alabama found out how important the farm workers were, and how hard the work was, and how the skills were needed, when they passed that draconian series of laws, and they had a real problem, in fact, they almost lost their crops.\n\nAR: That\u2019s exactly right, Dennis. And I think it didn\u2019t only happen in the state of Alabama, Georgia is seeing the same thing, Arizona is seeing the same thing. There\u2019s nobody there to pick the crops except for the farm workers that are here today. And unfortunately most of us are undocumented and that\u2019s why we continue to fight so hard for immigration reform so that farm workers can be respected just like any other worker in this nation.\n\nDennis J.

To further her cause, she created the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA) in 1960 and co-founded what would become the United Farm Workers (UFW). Huerta stepped down from the UFW in 1999, but she continues her efforts to improve the lives of workers, immigrants and women.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDolores Huerta was born Dolores Fern\u00e1ndez on April 10, 1930, in Dawson, New Mexico, the second child of Juan and Alicia (Chavez) Fernandez. The young family struggled, and by the time Dolores was 3, her parents divorced and her mother moved Dolores and her two brothers to Stockton, California. Dolores maintained a relationship with her father, who later became a union activist and a New Mexico state legislator. Juan\u2019s own political and labor activism later proved inspirational to Dolores.\n\nWhen the family first arrived in Stockton, a farming community in the San Joaquin Valley, Alicia worked two jobs to provide for the family. Dolores\u2019s grandfather, Herculano Chavez, took care of the children, serving as the children\u2019s adult male figure. Dolores admired her mother, who always encouraged her children to get involved in youth activities and become something. Alicia worked hard to provide music lessons and extracurricular activities for her children, with Dolores taking violin, piano and dance lessons. A good student, she was also a Girl Scout up until she turned 18, and she won second place in a national essay contest.\n\nDespite her achievements, Dolores experienced the racism many Mexicans and Mexican Americans suffered from, especially those who were farm workers. At school, she was sometimes treated with suspicion and scorn. She was once accused by a teacher of stealing another student\u2019s work because the teacher was convinced that Dolores was incapable of doing it own her own, due to her ethnic origin.\n\nWith time, her family\u2019s economic conditions improved. During World War II, Alicia ran a restaurant and then purchased a hotel in Stockton with her second husband, James Richards. The businesses served the farm workers and day laborers, offering affordable rates and welcoming the diversity of the area.\n\nAfter graduating from Stockton High School, in 1947, Dolores went through a marriage, the birth to two children and a divorce. After a series of unsatisfying jobs, she returned to school and eventually completed a teaching degree at Stockton College, part of the University of the Pacific. She briefly worked as an elementary school teacher but resigned because she was so distraught over the poor living conditions of her students, many of them children of farm workers.\n\nDetermined to help, in 1955, she and Fred Ross started the Stockton chapter of the Community Services Organization (CSO), a grassroots group that worked to end segregation, discrimination and police brutality and improve social and economic conditions of farm workers. During this time, Dolores married Ventura Huerta, another labor activist. The couple would go on to have five children.\n\nA Life of Activism\n\nIn 1960, Huerta started the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA). She set up voter registration drives and lobbied politicians to allow non\u2013U.S. citizen migrant workers to receive public assistance and pensions and provide Spanish-language voting ballots and driver's tests. During this time, Dolores met Cesar Chavez, a fellow CSO official, who had become its director.\n\nIn 1962, both Huerta and Chavez lobbied to have the CSO expand its efforts to help farm workers, but the organization was focused on urban issues and couldn\u2019t move in that direction. Frustrated, they both left the organization and, with Gilbert Padilla, co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). The two made a great team. Chavez was the dynamic leader and speaker; and Huerta the skilled organizer and tough negotiator.\n\nIn 1965, the AWA and the NFWA combined to become the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (later, simply the United Farm Workers). That year, the union took on the Coachella Valley grape growers, with Chavez organizing a strike of all farm workers and Huerta negotiating contracts.\n\nAfter five hard years, the United Farm Workers (now affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations) signed an historic agreement with 26 grape growers that improved working conditions for farm workers, including reducing the use of harmful pesticides and initiating unemployment and healthcare benefits. Around this time, she was credited with coining the phrase \"s\u00ed se puede,\" or \"yes we can,\" as a means of spurring union members onward through tough times.\n\nIn the 1970s, Huerta coordinated a national lettuce boycott and helped create the political climate for the passage of the 1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act, the first law to recognize the rights of farm workers to bargain collectively.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Huerta served as vice president of the UFW and co-founded the UFW\u2019s radio station. She continued to speak for a variety of causes, advocating for comprehensive immigration policy and better health conditions for farm workers. In 1988, she nearly lost her life when she was beaten by San Francisco police at a rally protesting the policies of then-presidential candidate George H. W. Bush. She suffered six broken ribs and a ruptured spleen.\n\nLater Life\n\nHuerta has been honored for her work as a fierce advocate for farm workers, immigration and women. She received the Ellis Island Medal of Freedom Award and was inducted in the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 1993. That year proved bittersweet for her as she also experienced the passing of her beloved friend Cesar Chavez.\n\nIn 1998, she received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award, a year before she stepped down from her position at the United Farm Workers. In 2002, she received the Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship. The $100,000 award provided her the means to create the Dolores Huerta Foundation, whose purpose is to bring organizing and training skills to low-income communities.\n\nAt the 2018 Academy Awards, Huerta walked the red carpet alongside many A-list celebrities, before taking the stage with nine other activists during a performance of Common and Andra Day's Oscar-nominated song \"Stand up for Something.\"\n\nHuerta continues to lecture and speak out on a variety of social issues involving immigration, income inequality and the rights of women and Latinos.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Dolores Huerta\n\nBirth Year: 1930\n\nBirth date: April 10, 1930\n\nBirth State: New Mexico\n\nBirth City: Dawson\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Dolores Huerta is an activist and labor leader who co-founded what would become the United Farm Workers.\n\nIndustries\n\nCivil Rights\n\nAstrological Sign: Aries\n\nSchools\n\nDelta Community College\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Dolores Huerta Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/activists/dolores-huerta\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: May 6, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://ufw.org/research/history/ufw-history/", "page_content": "UFW History\n\nThe Rise of the UFW\n\nFor more than a century farmworkers had been denied a decent life in the fields and communities of California\u2019s agricultural valleys. Essential to the state\u2019s biggest industry, but only so long as they remained exploited and submissive farmworkers had tried but failed so many times to organize the giant agribusiness farms that most observers considered it a hopeless task. And yet by the early 1960\u2019s things were beginning to change beneath the surface. Within another fifteen years more than 50,000 farmworkers were protected by union contracts.\n\nThe Bracero program, an informal arrangement between the United States and Mexican governments, became Public Law 78 in 1951. Started during World War II as a program to provide Mexican agricultural workers to growers, it continued after the war.\n\nPublic Law 78 stated that no bracero-a temporary worker imported from Mexico-could replace a domestic worker. In reality this provision was rarely enforced. In fact the growers had wanted the Bracero program to continue after the war precisely in order to replace domestic workers.\n\nThe small but energetic National Farm Labor Union, led by dynamic organizer Ernesto Galarza, found its efforts to create a lasting California farmworkers union in the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s stymied again and again by the growers\u2019 manipulation of braceros.\n\nOver time, however, farmworkers, led by Cesar Chavez, were able to call upon allies in other unions, in churches and in community groups affiliated with the growing civil rights movement, to put enough pressure on politicians to end the Bracero Program by 1964\n\n.\n\nCONDITIONS OF FARM WORKERS & THEIR WORK\n\nBut some things hadn\u2019t changed. Grape pickers in 1965 were making an average of $.90/hour, plus ten cents per \u201clug\u201d (basket) picked. State laws regarding working standards were simply ignored by growers. At one farm the boss made the workers all drink from the same cup \u201ca beer can\u201din the field; at another ranch workers were forced to pay a quarter per cup. No ranches had portable field toilets. Workers\u2019 temporary housing was strictly segregated by race, and they paid two dollars or more per day for unheated metal shacks-often infested with mosquitoes-with no indoor plumbing or cooking facilities.\n\nFarm labor contractors played favorites with workers, selecting friends first, sometimes accepting bribes. Child labor was rampant, and many workerswere injured or died in easily preventable accidents. The average life expectancy of a farmworker was 49 years.\n\nNEW ORGANIZATIONS, NEW POSSIBILITIES\n\nTwo organizations attempted to represent and organize the farmworkers. One had been formed in 1959 by the AFL-CIO, called the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. It was an outgrowth of an earlier farmworker organization, the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA), founded by Dolores Huerta. AWOC was mostly composed of Filipinos, Chicanos, Anglos and Black workers. The Filipino workers in particular had experience organizing unions in the fields and with strikes. Two of its early leaders were Larry Itliong, a Filipino, and Dolores Huerta, a Chicana.\n\nThe National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) was started by a young Chicano named Cesar Chavez in 1962. Chavez, the son of a family of extremely poor farmworkers, had risen through the ranks of the grassroots Community Service Organization (CSO) to become its national director. CSO worked with communities to solve problems through organizing and direct action. But when CSO refused to concentrate its efforts on organizing farmworkers, Chavez left to found the NFWA. From his base in Delano, he traveled for three years from town to town in the central valleys of California, meeting with groups of farmworkers in their homes, tirelessly building an organization he hoped would one day become an effective union. His co-founder was Dolores Huerta, one of the CSO\u2019s farmworker activists.\n\nBEFORE THE BEGINNING\n\nTwo short strikes occurred in the spring of 1965. Eighty-five farmworkers in a McFarland rose farm asked the NFWA to help them gain a wage increase. Assisted by Chavez and Huerta, the workers struck. After a few days the growers agreed to the wage increase but not to union recognition. The workers contented themselves with the money and returned to work.\n\nAround the same time AWOC led a walkout of hundreds of Filipino and Mexican grape pickers in Coachella Valley. Although the bracero program had officially ended the year before, a new U.S.-Mexico agreement allowed growers to import Mexican workers, if they were paid $1.25 an hour, and never paid more than domestic workers. When Coachella grape growers attempted to pay the local workers less than the imported workers, the Filipinos, many of whom were AWOC members, refused to work.\n\nCoachella grapes, grown in southernmost California, ripen first in the state. Getting the grapes picked and to market quickly is crucial to the Coachella growers\u2019 profits. After ten days the growers decided to pay everyone $1.25 per hour, including Chicanos who had joined the Filipinos. Once more, however, no union contract was signed.\n\nIT STARTED IN DELANO\n\nAt the end of summer the grapes were ripening in the fields around Delano, a farm town north of Bakersfield. Many of the farmworkers from the successful Coachella action had come up to Delano, trailing the grape harvest. Farmworkers demanded $1.25 per hour, and when they didn\u2019t receive it, on September 8 nine farms were struck, organized by AWOC\u2019s Larry Itliong.\n\nAfter five days growers began to bring in Chicano scabs from the surrounding area. AWOC approached Chavez and asked the NFWA to join the mostly Filipino strike. At a meeting on September 16, packed with hundreds of workers, at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, the NFWA voted unanimously, to shouts of \u201cViva la Huelga!\u201d, to strike too. Chavez was apprehensive. Asked later when he felt his organization-which had $100 in its bank account, would have been ready to go out on a big strike, he replied, \u201cAbout 1968.\u201d\n\nIn joining the strike, the NFWA, with many more members than AWOC, took the lead. It also strengthened the ethnic make up of the strike: now the majority of workers involved were Chicano. By September 20 more than thirty farms were out, with several thousand workers leaving the fields. Despite the large numbers of striking farmworkers, however, the workers could not muster picket lines at all the ranches simultaneously. There were many fields strung across hundreds of miles.\n\nNFWA and AWOC set up a system of roving pickets, with different fields picketed each day. Fifteen or twenty cars full of pickets would go to a field where a grower was attempting to use strikebreakers. Striking workers, often harassed by the growers and police, sometimes violently, would try to get the scabs to leave the fields. Remarkably, their appeals were successful much of the time in persuading workers to join the strike.\n\nThe growers made a mistake almost immediately. They had always been able to end strikes with small wage concessions. Soon after the strike began, they raised wages to $1.25 per hour. This time they were shocked to discover it wasn\u2019t enough. The raise merely encouraged the strikers to believe they were being effective. Now there had to be a union, too.\n\nSQUEEZING THE COMPANIES WITH A BOYCOTT\n\nShortly after the strike erupted, Chavez called upon the public to refrain from buying grapes without a union label. Union volunteers were sent out to big cities, where they established boycott centers that organized friendly groups-unions, churches, community organizations-to not buy grapes, and in turn to join in publicizing the boycott.\n\nThe strikers\u2019 cause was boosted by other events in the nation at the same time. The Civil Rights movement had increased public awareness of the effects of racism, including lowered standards of living for the victims of prejudice in housing, employment, schools, voting, and other areas of daily life. The Civil Rights movement focused attention on the treatment of Blacks in the south. But the situation in the fields of California proved similar enough that the largely Chicano and Filipino farmworkers benefited by the new public understanding of racism. As a result, millions of consumers stopped buying table grapes.\n\nTHE BIGGER THEY ARE . . .\n\nThe two biggest growers in the Delano area, Schenley and DiGiorgio, were the most vulnerable to the boycott. Both companies were owned by corporate entities with headquarters far from Delano. For each company grape growing was a relatively minor part of a larger economic empire. Schenley and DiGiorgio had union contracts with workers in many other parts of their business. The boycott had the potential to hurt sales in other product areas, and to harm labor relations with their other workers.\n\nSchenley was the first to crack. Soon after the strike began Schenley had sprayed striking workers with agricultural poisons. In protest the NFWA organized a march to Sacramento. Seventy strikers left Delano on foot on March 17, 1966, led by Chavez. They walked nearly 340 miles in 25 days. Along the way they picked up hundreds of friends and rallied with thousands of people. A Chicano theater group, El Teatro Campesino, staged skits about the struggle from the back of a flatbed truck every night. The march attracted media attention and public support. Arriving in Sacramento on Easter morning, Chavez announced to a cheering demonstration of 10,000 supporters in front of the Capitol building that Schenley had bowed before the pressure and signed an agreement with the NFWA.\n\nWithin weeks, DiGiorgio agreed to hold a representation election. But before the election could be held, a complication arose. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, ignoring the questions of social justice at the core of the farmworkers\u2019 campaign for union recognition, offered itself to DiGiorgio as a conservative alternative to the NFWA/AWOC. The grower eagerly assented. Chavez and the NFWA, infuriated at this betrayal by another union, called for the workers to boycott the election. Heeding the call of the union, more than half the 800 workers at DiGiorgio\u2019s huge Sierra Vista ranch refused to vote.\n\nGovernor Pat Brown appointed an arbitrator, who ordered another election. This time the NFWA beat the Teamsters decisively. The two largest growers in Delano were employers of union labor.\n\nLA HUELGA CONTINUES\n\nHowever, the strike dragged on at dozens of grape farms throughout the Delano area. In the past a farmworkers\u2019 union would have been unable to survive such a long conflict. But there was strength in worker solidarity. NFWA and AWOC merged during the summer, just before the DiGiorgio election. On August 22, the two organizations became the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, AFL-CIO (UFWOC). The new union received organizing funds from the AFL-CIO, as well as strike support from other unions consisting of food, cash, and office equipment.\n\nDespite continuing Teamster collusion with the growers, the UFWOC organized steadily in the fields, and the grape boycott gathered steam in the cities. By 1970 the UFW got grape growers to accept union contracts and effectively organized most of that industry, claiming 50,000 dues paying members \u2013 the most ever represented by a union in California agriculture. Gains included a union-run hiring hall, a health clinic and health plan, credit union, community center and cooperative gas station, as well as higher wages. The hiring hall meant an end to discrimination and favoritism by labor contractors.\n\nIn cities around the country UFW support became stronger. UFWOC, as Chavez had envisioned, had become both a union and a civil rights movement, and this was the key to its success. The dual character of the farmworkers organization gave it a depth of moral pressure and sense of mission felt by members and supporters alike. It seemed as if the farmworkers of California had finally created a union that would last."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/activists/asian-american-pacific-islander-activists", "page_content": "While often at the center of many movements, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their groundbreaking accomplishments and contributions are sometimes overshadowed and ignored.\n\nGet to know 10 of the most influential Asian American and Pacific Islander activists who fought for marginalized people of all communities:\n\nFrank Emi\n\nEven though Frank Emi was born in the United States, he and his family, of Japanese descent, were forced to leave their California home to live in an internment camp in the midst of World War II. There, Emi\u2019s activism was born.\n\nEmi and his family were moved to a camp in Wyoming, where he took issue with two of the questions he was forced to answer as part of the \u201cloyalty\u201d questionnaire. The first asked if Japanese men born in America would consent to serve in combat duty, while the second asked them to pledge full allegiance to the United States and relinquish any fealty to the Emperor of Japan.\n\nEmi responded that he was unable to answer the questions and believed that men forced to serve in combat should first have their full citizenship rights reinstated. Emi eventually became part of the \u201cFair Play Committee,\u201d which encouraged men to resist the draft, and once made a point to prove they were prisoners by attempting to walk out of the camp.\n\nIn the end, Emi was arrested and convicted with conspiracy to violate the Selective Service Act. He was sentenced to four years in prison, of which he served eighteen months. He continued his advocacy until his death in 2010 at 94 years old.\n\n\"We could either tuck our tails between our legs like dogs or stand up like free men and fight for justice,\" Emi said of his activism. \"Some of us chose the latter. We were going to resist.\"\n\nLarry Itliong\n\n(L-R): Julio Hernandez, Larry Itliong and Cesar Chavez in 1966;\n\nA key figure in the farm labor movement, Larry Itliong first moved to the United States when he was a teen and immediately began advocating for better rights.\n\nBorn in the Philippines, Itliong was a natural activist who began advocating for himself and his fellow workers while traveling around different states. Itliong lived and worked in Alaska, Washington and finally California, where he crossed paths with fellow activist Cesar Chavez.\n\nItliong captured the attention of other activists when he organized the Delano Grape Strike of 1965, an event that would eventually lead to the formation of the nation\u2019s leading agricultural labor union, the United Farm Workers.\n\nThe UFW came from Itliong\u2019s Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and Chavez\u2019s National Farm Workers Association, which combined to become the strongest labor union. While Chavez is a name synonymous with labor rights, Itliong\u2019s contribution merits just as much praise.\n\nFred Korematsu\n\nFred Korematsu in the 1940s.; Photo: MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFred Korematsu took his fight against the Japanese internment camps all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Korematsu was born in Oakland, California, to Japanese parents who ran a plant nursery. World War II started when he was 22, and the young Korematsu subsequently refused to report to Tanforan Assembly Center, where his family reported on May 9, 1942.\n\nKorematsu was then arrested on May 30, 1942, for his refusal to comply with the mandatory evacuation order. His name was forever etched in history when he was visited by ACLU executive director Ernest Besig while in prison and he agreed to be the test subject in a case questioning the legality of the evacuation orders.\n\nKorematsu was sent to the same camp as his family and he was later convicted of violating military orders, a ruling the Supreme Court held up in a 6-3 decision. He eventually moved back to San Francisco where his felony conviction made it hard to find a job.\n\nKorematsu\u2019s conviction was later revoked in 1983, with the activist proclaiming in court, \"As long as my record stands in federal court, any American citizen can be held in prison or concentration camps without a trial or a hearing.\"\n\nHe went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Honor and on January 30, 2011, California held the first Fred Korematsu Day in honor of the activist.\n\nKiyoshi Kuromiya\n\nBorn in an internment camp in Wyoming, Kiyoshi Kuromiya went on to advocate for several movements that personally related to him. Kuromiya concentrated on the antiwar, civil rights and gay liberation movements throughout his life. He attended several key protests, including Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s March on Washington and a protest in Montgomery, Alabama, where he led Black high school students in a voter registration march in 1965.\n\nFour years later, Kuromiya founded the Gay Liberation Front\u2013Philadelphia in 1969 and simultaneously served as a delegate to the Black Panther Party's Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention.\n\nHis greatest activism came when the AIDS pandemic started decimating the gay community nationwide. To help those afflicted, Kuromiya founded the Critical Path Project. The project included a 24-hour telephone hotline, a web page and free internet service for people living with AIDS and HIV in Philadelphia and beyond. Sadly, Kuromiya later died due to AIDS complications in 2000.\n\nPhilip Vera Cruz\n\nLike Itliong and Chavez, Philip Vera Cruz focused his advocacy on his own life experience: farm labor.\n\nAfter being born in the Philippines, Vera Cruz and his family moved to the United States where he would eventually work on farmland in California, picking grapes, lettuce and asparagus in grueling conditions. This prompted Vera Cruz, along with Itliong, to organize the Delano Grape Strike of 1965, demanding a 10 cent per hour increase of pay.\n\nThe activist was part of the resulting United Farm Workers union and continued to work for the organization for years, eventually serving as the officer of the Agbayani Village. The village provided housing for retired farmworkers who couldn\u2019t afford to save up.\n\nHe went on to serve as vice president of the UFW, holding the title as the highest ranking Filipino in the union.\n\n\u201cWhen the UFW came along it really changed my life. It gave me the opportunity to bring my basically philosophical and questioning nature down to earth, and apply it to real everyday issues that actually affect people\u2019s lives,\u201d he once said. \u201cAs a Filipino American it gave me the opportunity to participate in the political struggles of this country.\u201d\n\nGeorge Takei\n\nGeorge Takei in 2016; Photo: Andrew Lahodynskyj/Toronto Star via Getty Images\n\nAn actor and activist, George Takei\u2019s resolve came from his experiences while detained with his family at a Japanese internment camp from ages 5 to 9. The Takeis rough life continued afterwards, as they were left with no capital and were forced to live on L.A.\u2019s Skid Row, an area known for a large homeless population.\n\nThe young Takei persevered and attended both the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles, where he graduated with both his bachelor and masters degrees. Though Takei wouldn\u2019t reveal his sexuality until 2005, he lived openly among peers as a gay man and worked as an activist for several LGBTQ organizations.\n\nHe also became involved politically in Los Angeles, narrowly losing an election for City Council in 1963 and later serving as part of the Southern California Rapid Transit District where he cast the deciding vote to build the city\u2019s subway system.\n\nTakei remains one of the most prolific figures to have firsthand experience of the Japanese internment camps and has committed his advocacy to ensuring the horrors are never lived again by another set of people.\n\nREAD MORE: George Takei and Pat Morita\u2019s Harrowing Childhood Experiences in Japanese American Internment Camps\n\nYuri Kochiyama\n\nLike others on this list, Yuri Kochiyama\u2019s activism was sparked by her time spent in the Japanese internment camps, where she grew deep pride for her roots.\n\nAfter living an idyllic childhood in California, Kochiyama\u2019s life changed when her father was arrested by the FBI and held for six week for being a supposed threat to national security. He died days after his release and the rest of her family were forced into the camps.\n\nHer release led her and her husband to New York City, where she grew enraptured by the civil rights movement and would later become friends with Malcolm X. After meeting the famous activist, Kochiyama began advocating for the liberation of marginalized peoples around the world.\n\nThe fight extended heavily into her work for the Asian community and she had several causes, including the opposition to the Vietnam War and advocating for internment camp survivors to receive compensation.\n\nKochiyama was there in 1965 when Malcolm X was murdered while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in New York City. She famously rushed to the stage and was pictured holding his head as he lay dying.\n\nHer activism continued for the rest of her life before she died in 2014. She was 93.\n\nHaunani-Kay Trask\n\nBorn to a family who advocated for Hawaiian statehood, Haunani-Kay Trask went against the grain and has spent her life fighting for independence for her people.\n\nTrask was born in 1949, 10 years before Hawaii became a state. Though she spent several years in the mainland while attending the University of Wisconsin and the University of Chicago, where she joined the Black Panther Party, Trask focused on her homeland and preserving native Hawaiian culture.\n\nShe returned home to teach at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, specializing in Polynesian women, Hawaii\u2019s political movements and the Pacific Islands. Trask was awarded the Angela Y. Davis Prize in 2019 for her work in education and the arts. She died in 2021.\n\nAnna May Wong\n\nAnna May Wong; Photo: General Photographic Agency/Getty Images\n\nAnna May Wong was known as the first Asian American movie star. Born Wong Liu Tsong in 1905 in Los Angeles, she gave herself the stage name Anna May Wong. Wong lived in the Chinatown area of Los Angeles and was allowed to attend public schools, where she faced constant racial attacks.\n\nShe first tried out for a movie when she was a teenager. She was cast as an extra, and would go on to have a hard time landing a leading role due to racism in the industry and anti-race mixing laws that prohibited her from sharing a kiss with a man of a different race. Though she eventually left the United States for stage work in Europe, Wong remains the first Asian American to become a movie star.\n\nGeorge Helm Jr.\n\nLike Trask, George Helm Jr. dedicated his short life to preserving the native culture of Hawaii. Helm was born on the Molokai island of Hawaii and later migrated to Honolulu to continue his studies. He became a renowned philosopher and is seen as a pioneer of Hawaiian sovereignty movement, aiming to bring independence back to the islands.\n\nIn 1975, Helm became involved in the efforts to protect the island of Kaho\u2019olawe from being used as bomb target practice by the U.S. Navy. The next year, he and eight others occupied the island in efforts to protect it and he became spiritually connected to the sacred land.\n\nHelm later died while trying to return to Maui from the island in the midst of bad weather. He was 26. His legacy lives on in his activism and music, with his recordings still often played on Hawaiian radio."}, {"url": "https://depts.washington.edu/civilr/farmwk_ch5.htm", "page_content": "On December 19, 1969, Cesar Chavez spoke at several public rallies in Seattle. University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections.\n\nAfter World War II, more former-braceros and ethnic Mexican migrants settled in Washington, eventually creating the community necessary to unite farm workers in a common cause. In the 1940s, the Latino population increased dramatically from less than 7,000 in 1940 to 17,600 in 1950. Half lived in the state\u2019s rural areas, especially the Yakima Valley.1 After establishing themselves in communities such as Toppenish, Sunnyside, Yakima and Granger in the Yakima Valley, many also ventured to other places across the state. In addition to labor, other factors, such as social and familial networks and the armed forces contributed to their increasing numbers.2\n\nIn the southwest, the bracero program and agri-business abuses continued as extensions were added to Public Law 45 (PL-45).3Growers used the proximity to the border as a tool for repressing attempts by Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans to unionize by encouraging an influx of surplus labor to bust unions or by threatening to deport braceros asserting their bargaining rights. Out of such abuses came a renewed activist energy.\n\nOn October 1, 1947, the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) commenced a strike against the DiGiorgio Corporation in California, with over 1,000 strikers.4 This union had originally formed with the name \u201cSouthern Tenant Farmer\u2019s Union 1936\u201d and was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Soon after the NFLU initiated the strike, over 130 braceros halted work as a show of solidarity with the strikers. This was one of many events that occurred from the late 1940s well into the late 1950s. Under the leadership of Ernesto Galarza, the NFLU undertook numerous strikes. Unfortunately, though Mexican laborers had a long history of resisting the bracero program, many of their attempts to resist never generated lasting results so long as the bracero program continued.\n\nThis would change by the late 1950s. Prominent groups to emerge during this period were the Mexican American Political Association (MAPA) (1959) and the Community Service Organization (CSO), among others.5 Both of these organizations would contribute to future organizational work in California. Their programs served as a fertile training ground for various activists and organizers, one of whom was Cesar Chavez. At this time, many Mexican-Americans were impressed by the Black civil rights movement. No longer satisfied to consider themselves \u201cethnic whites,\u201d they insisted racism was central to the struggle of their people and formed organizations to resist their second-class status.6\n\nCesar Chavez and the Genesis of the UFWOC and \u201cLa Causa\u201d\n\nOriginally trained by the CSO in San Jose, Chavez resigned in 1962 when that organization refused to commit to organizing farm workers. He then relocated, along with his family, to the town of Delano, California where he would dedicate his time to the task of organizing them. Later that year, joined by Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla, among others, Chavez helped organize a 300 delegate convention at an abandoned movie theatre in Fresno, California, that formalized the organizational frame of the Farm Workers Association (FWA), later known as the UFW.7 It was at this convention that the organization\u2019s emblem, a black indigenous Aztec eagle glyph within a white circle in a red field, was unveiled. It would become an enduring symbol of the Chicano Movement.\n\nAs a precursor to later activity, the FWA organized a $1,000 burial insurance program, as Padilla recalled because \u201c[p]eople didn\u2019t even have money for a decent burial.\u201d This was soon followed by a credit union that provided low-interest loans to farm workers because biased banking institutions often denied farm workers loans. They also established a cooperative where it was possible to buy farming equipment at a more reasonable price. These initial programs were a reflection of the organization\u2019s initial focus on alleviating the more immediate concerns within the farm worker community. By 1964, the group became the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) with a membership of over 1,000 families in seven counties in California providing the group enough funds for it to become self-sufficient.8\n\nAs the NFWA built its organizational infrastructure, various events occurring at the national and international levels provided a fertile ground for labor organizing. By 1964, the end of the Bracero Program removed many impediments to organizing and brought the program\u2019s abuses to public light. In the midst of larger struggles for civil rights at home and decolonization abroad, the NFWA fused labor and questions of racial equality. This pattern would soon evolve with the introduction of the NFWA\u2019s El Malcriado in December 1964, a newspaper which articulated the NFWA\u2019s stance on farm worker justice.9\n\nFilipino-American farm workers were also mobilizing. The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), led by Larry Itliong, was also active in California and to a lesser extent in Washington. Formed in 1958, this group\u2019s membership consisted mostly of Filipinos, many of whom had belonged to earlier Filipino-led unions. By 1965, it had the organizational infrastructure to advocate effectively for labor rights on farms. On September 8, 1965, the AWOC called a strike against grape growers in the Delano area in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley. Realizing that Mexican-American workers faced the, Chavez\u2019s NFWA followed suit, as members voted to go out in strike alongside AWOC on September 16, 1965.\n\nIn late November, the NFWA and the AWOC unions agreed to call for a national boycott of California-grown table grapes. This fusion of the AWOC\u2019s and the NFWA\u2019s efforts led to the creation of the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC or UFW). It also brought the struggle in Delano to a larger audience at the national and international stage. What differed this time around was the support the striking workers received not only from politicians (Robert F. Kennedy, among others) but also from other labor leaders.10 Evidence that this would not be the usual quickly abandoned farm strike came two months later when Walter Reuther of the Auto Workers Union marched through Delano at the head of a cheering column of strikers, Chavez, Itliong, and reporters from all over the country beside him.11\n\nWidespread support for farm worker rights occurred during the student, civil rights, and peace movements. Strikers won active support from a remarkable variety of outsiders whom saw farm labor demands as similar to their demands for equal opportunity and civil rights.12 It was in this social atmosphere that farm labor organizing activity reemerged in the Pacific Northwest. Amidst war on poverty programs, the Cursillo Movement, student activism, and other such catalysts, the stage was set in Washington State for the emergence of the UFW, farm worker support or support of La Causa, and a new era in labor and civil rights struggles within the ethnic Mexican community.\n\nNext: Ch. 6, El Movimiento and Farm Labor Organizing in the 1960s\n\n\u201cA History of Farm Labor Organizing, 1890-2009\u201d includes the following chapters:\n\nCopyright (\u00a9) Oscar Rosales Casta\u00f1eda 2009\n\n1 These population figures are calculated from the IPUMS samples of the federal census.

Extensions were added to PL-45, even though it was set to expire much earlier.\n\n4 The NFLU was one of the key farm labor organizations that came to prominence in the 1930s. One of the strikes it was involved in was the California Cotton Strike of 1933 that erupted in the San Joaquin Valley. The event itself is one of the most violent strikes in farm labor history, as groups in opposition to the organization launched a wave of violent repression on striking workers.\n\n5 The post-war period witnessed a shift in ethnic Mexican community organizing, as ethnic Mexican organizations moved beyond mutual aid societies into advocacy and political participation as a means of gaining access to larger U.S. society. This shift, though calling for Mexican-American civil rights was largely assimilationist in character. Prominent groups formed during the assimilationist period of the \u201cMexican-American Movement\u201d included the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) founded in 1929, the American G.I. Forum founded in 1948, the Mexican American Political Association (MAPA) founded in 1959, and the Community Service Organization (CSO) founded in 1948, among others.\n\n6 Francisco Arturo Rosales, Chicano!: The History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement (Arte Publico Press, 1997), 108.\n\n7 During this convention, Chavez was elected the nascent organization\u2019s director with Dolores Huerta, Julio Hernandez, and Gilbert Padilla as vice-presidents.\n\n8 Dick Meister and Anne Loftis, A Long Time Coming: The Struggle to Unionize America\u2019s Farm Workers (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1977), 122.\n\n9 El Malcriado, the underground UFW newspaper, was originally published in Spanish.

Meister and Loftis, 80.\n\n10 According to Meister and Loftis, \u201cIn early 1966, barely three months after the strike started, two dozen NFWA strikers and staff members were dispatched to thirteen major cities across the country. They lined up help from other unions simply by appearing at union offices, penniless and with no place to stay and asking for aid,\u201d 141.\n\n11 Ibid., 130.\n\n12 Ibid., 130-134."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-10-19-mn-431-story.html", "page_content": "TIMES STAFF WRITER\n\nFor a few glorious hours, the men and women who led the United Farm Workers fight during the lofty \u201860s and \u201870s put aside their own family feud to pay homage to Fred Ross, the mentor and mensch who died here three weeks ago at age 82.\n\nRoss spent his entire adult life in the trenches fighting for the rights of the poor, from Dust Bowl Okies on ditch banks in Bakersfield to Japanese-American internees in Cleveland to black civil rights workers in the South. He plucked a young Cesar Chavez out of a San Jose barrio called Sal Si Puedes --Spanish for Get Out If You Can--and channeled his raw anger into an epic movement.\n\nAs he had done so often in life, Ross brought together at Saturday\u2019s memorial the varied personalities who shaped the UFW in its heyday--lettuce pickers from Salinas, grape pickers from Coachella, clergy, progressive attorneys, sympathetic politicians and Chavez himself.\n\nChavez delivered the eulogy, recalling for the crowd of 400 the first time he met Ross: \u201cThen he started talking and changed my life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was nary a mention of the infighting and purges that have turned old friends into bitter foes, or of Ross\u2019 death having come at a time of enormous doubt about the legacy and future of the UFW. In 1975, the union had contracts with 80% of the grape growers in the San Joaquin Valley. Today, not a single contract remains.\n\nInstead, this was a day to bask in the past, to sing old field songs, to fly the union\u2019s black and red and Aztec eagle flag and recall the good gringo in the shadows whose work changed the lives of so many.\n\n\u201cFred fought more fights and trained more organizers and planted more seeds of righteous indignation than anyone we\u2019re ever likely to see again,\u201d said Jerry Cohen, the UFW\u2019s general counsel in the glory days of successful strikes and boycotts.\n\nCohen said he dreamed of Ross the night before. \u201cHe was 12 feet tall standing in that doorway and he had all this life growing out of him--branches and twigs and leaves. . . . This is not just about the past, but the fighting and organizing that will go on forever.\u201d\n\nThe service was held at the Delancey Street Foundation along the waterfront beneath the Bay Bridge. To those present, it felt, at times, like Delano must have felt in the hellish summer of 1966 when the towering Ross and the tiny Chavez--teacher and student--broke the back of the Di Giorgio Fruit Co., the first of many victories.\n\nJerry Brown showed up in cowboy boots, faded jeans and a black jacket with his 800 number on back. Brown first met Ross on a UFW march to Calexico in 1967. \u201cFred Ross was a full-time citizen-organizer who gave power to the powerless,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThere were Danny and Luis Valdez of Teatro Campesino and \u201cZoot Suit\u201d fame who led the gathering in rousing renditions of \u201cWell Done, General,\u201d the strike song, and \u201cSolidarity Forever,\u201d the union anthem.\n\nLuis Valdez said: \u201cIn the century of the \u2018Ugly American,\u2019 Fred Ross was the beautiful American, the human American, the American who came out to the barrio and put his life on the line.\u201d\n\nAnd there were Robert, Julia and Fred Ross Jr., each born on the road in a different \u201chot spot,\u201d each carrying on their father\u2019s work in a different way.\n\nRoss grew up in Echo Park and graduated from the University of Southern California in 1937. He had planned to teach English, but the Depression got in the way. In 1939, working for the state, he oversaw the Arvin Migratory Labor Camp where 4,000 Dust Bowl refugees had come to pick cotton.\n\nReplacing a brutal camp director, Ross won the trust of the migrants by instituting a form of self-government.\n\n\u201cYou never do for people what they can do for themselves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA good organizer is a social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire.\u201d\n\nHistorian Carey McWilliams wrote of Ross\u2019 \u201cexasperating modesty.\u201d When Ross stepped into Boyle Heights in 1947 as a member of Saul Alinsky\u2019s Community Service Organizations, he disarmed a group of wary Chicanos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two strikes against me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an outsider and an Anglo. I hope you keep those doubts because having them is healthy. I hope you\u2019ll hold on to them until I\u2019ve had time to prove you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d\n\nTo overcome the chasm, Ross learned Spanish from flash cards and met small groups of Chicanos in their homes over beer and salsa. Each group then would branch out into the community and organize other groups until a foothold was established. The beauty of the \u201chouse meeting\u201d was its simplicity, and Ross\u2019 technique is still used by labor organizers across the country.\n\nThis barrio army registered 50,000 voters on Los Angeles\u2019s Eastside, and in 1949 helped elect Edward R. Roybal as the city\u2019s first Latino councilman.\n\nRoss never lingered long to savor his victories. He left for San Jose to organize one of 30 Community Service chapters statewide and it was there that he met the young Chicano apricot picker named Chavez.\n\n\u201cI think I found the guy I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Ross wrote in his journal that night.\n\nOver the next 30 years, teacher and student would change the course of labor history.\n\n\u201cI tagged along to every one of Fred\u2019s house meetings during that first campaign in San Jose--sometimes two a night,\u201d Chavez told the gathering. \u201cThe thing I liked most about Fred was there were . . . no pretensions, no ego gimmicks. Just plain hard work--at times grinding work.\n\n\u201cI shall miss him very much.\u201d"}]}
