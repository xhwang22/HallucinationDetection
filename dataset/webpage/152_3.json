It was not until 1980 that women made their entrance in this sport and India are yet to win a medal in that discipline. The men, however, sit atop the gold medal standings despite not winning a medal since the Moscow Games in 1980.\n\nThe Indian men\u2019s team won six consecutive titles between 1928 and 1956. In that period, they scored a total of 178 goals and conceded just seven, winning every single out of the 25 matches they played. Till their defeat in the 1960 Rome final against Pakistan, India were unbeaten in 30 consecutive matches, and scored 197 goals, giving away only eight.\n\nThose are records that are unlikely to be matched in the Olympic Games history.\n\nPlay\n\nIndia's field hockey medals at Olympic Games Venue Year Medal Captain Amsterdam 1928 Gold Jaipal Singh Los Angeles 1932 Gold Lal Shah Bokhari Berlin 1936 Gold Dhyan Chand London 1948 Gold Kishan Lal Helsinki 1952 Gold KD Singh \u2018Babu\u2019 Melbourne 1956 Gold Balbir Singh Sr Rome 1960 Silver Leslie Claudius Tokyo 1964 Gold Charanjit Singh Mexico 1968 Bronze Prithipal Singh\n\nGurbux Singh\n\nMunich 1972 Bronze Harmik Singh Moscow 1980 Gold Vasudevan Baskaran Tokyo 2021 Bronze Manpreet Singh\n\nMost gold medals at Olympics field hockey (men) India 8 (1928, 1932, 1936, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1980) Germany* 4 (1972, 1992, 2008, 2012) Pakistan 3 (1960, 1968, 1984) Great Britain 3 (1908*, 1920, 1988) Netherlands 2 (1996, 2000) Australia 1 (2004) New Zealand 1 (1976) Argentina 1 (2016) Includes West Germany in 1972\n\nIndian hockey\u2019s golden streak at the Olympics Games: 1928: Played 5, won 5 (29 scored, 0 conceded)\n\n1932: Played 2, won 2 (35 scored, 2 conceded)\n\n1936: Played 5, won 5 (38 scored, 1 conceded)\n\n1948: Played 5, won 5 (25 scored, 2 conceded)\n\n1952: Played 3, won 3 (13 scored, 2 conceded)\n\n1956: Played 5, won 5 (38 scored, 0 conceded)\n\nHere, we take a look back at the six consecutive gold medals that India won from 1928 Amsterdam to 1956 Melbourne:\n\n1928 Amsterdam\n\nThe world was introduced to the magic of Dhyan Chand.

India went that Olympic tournament in Amsterdam without conceding a goal, while scoring 29 themselves. And at the center of it all was Chand, who finished the tournament with a total of 14 goals including two in the final.\n\nAccording to a report in Olympics.com, \u201cLegend has it that the Dutch officials took his stick apart to see if there was a magnet hidden inside it!

There were a couple of concerning defeats pre tournament but once the Games began, there was no stopping them. The crowning moment of the tournament was a win in the final against the hosts.\n\nAccording to a report on Olympics.com, \u201cDhyan Chand scored in six goals in the 1936 Berlin Olympic final.

More importantly, it was considered to be a difficult campaign as the once all-conquering unit was now divided into two separate teams \u2013 India and Pakistan.\n\nModern India\u2019s most decorated hockey legend Balbir Singh Sr. scored a brace as India hammered their former colonial masters on their own home turf 4-0 to clinch the gold medal.\n\n\u201cAs our national anthem was being played and the tri-colour was going up, I felt that I too was flying with the flag.

It remained one of Chand\u2019s biggest regrets in life that he did not get the opportunity to beat the rulers at their own game. But there was a sense of poetic justice to it as well. When India reached the final of the 1948 Olympics hockey tournament, their opponents were Great Britain, making a comeback to the world event. And revenge was sweet, one year after they achieved independence from their former colonial rulers, India thrashed Britain 4-0.\n\n1952 Helsinki\n\nEvidently, not for the first time, the build-up to the Olympic Games was marred by administrative controversies for the Indian hockey team. KD Singh Babu-led squad also had trouble with adapting to the conditions in Finland.\n\n\u201cNanaji (grandpa) told me that the team would draw the curtains at all times and even used bedsheets to block out the light and make an entirely dark room to be able to get some sleep,\u201d Kabir Singh, Balbir Singh Sr\u2019s grandson, is quoted as telling the Olympic Channel.\n\nThe start of the tournament was iffy, but they peaked \u2014 as the cliche goes \u2014 at the right time to claim their fifth consecutive gold medal. India defeated Great Britain 3-1 in the semi-final with Balbir Singh Sr. scoring the second of his three Olympic hat-tricks. Saving the best for last, Balbir scored five goals on the day of the final, a record in the final of a men\u2019s Olympic field hockey tournament that stands to this day. India stunned Netherlands 6-1 to win their fifth consecutive medal. The unbeaten streak continued.\n\nIndia squad: K. D.

Dubey, C.S. Gurung, Dharam Singh and Grahanandan Singh.\n\nPlay\n\nPlay\n\n1956 Melbourne\n\nAlready established as a great of the game, Balbir Singh Sr got the chance to lead India. The overwhelming favourites made it six gold medals on the trot and once again went unbeaten at the event. India did not concede a single goal in the entire tournament for the second time after 1928 Olympics.\n\nLeslie Claudius, Randhir Singh Gentle, and Ranganathan Francis were playing their third Olympic Games along with Balbir who further cemented his status in the pantheon of legends in the game. But the contingent was dealt a blow as their leader got injured in the opening match. Reaching the final was largely straightforward, with Udham Singh stepping up.\n\nWith history about to be made when India took on Pakistan in the final, to mark the start of an epic rivalry, a call had to be made about their talisman. Balbir Singh Sr. had not played in any of the Indian hockey team\u2019s matches since his injury. He led the team out on the field first and then on to the top of podium after a 1-0 win.\n\n\u201cThat day when I led my team out to the victory rostrum, I swelled with pride. The crowd cheered us and it was a thrilling experience to acknowledge their applause,\u201d the captain recounted about the experience at MCG.\n\n\u201cIt was a very happy moment for us. We won all the matches in the 1956 Olympics,\u201d former Indian hockey forward Gurdev Singh told Hockey India.\n\n\u201cThis was only the second time that no team had scored against India in the entire Olympics campaign. Our captain Balbir Singh Sr\u2019s finger was broken during the tournament, but he still played for the team. At that time, wherever the Indian hockey team went, it always won.\u201d\n\nAlso read: When Balbir Singh faced Pakistan in 1956 Olympic final with a fractured hand\n\nIndia squad: Balbir Singh Sr.(C), Leslie Claudius, Ranganathan Francis, Haripal Kaushik, Amir Kumar, Raghbir Lal, Shankar Lakshman, Govind Perumal, Amit Singh Bakshi, Raghbir Singh Bhola, Hardyal Singh Garchey, Randhir Singh Gentle, Balkishan Singh Grewal, Gurdev Singh Kullar, Udham Singh Kullar, Bakshish Singh, O.P.

The squad was brimming with experience and youth besides tremendous firepower. It was hardly a surprise then that the team came away with another gold medal, the sixth in a row.\n\nFour of the team \u2014 Balbir Singh, Randhir Singh Gentle, Leslie Claudius and Ranganathan Francis \u2014 were playing their third Olympics, while for Govind Perumal, Udham Singh, Raghubir Lal and Amit Kumar it was their second Games. There were some young guns too in the squad that had an aura of invincibility and so it turned out to be.\n\nThe team played four warm-up games in Ambala and Bombay, winning all, but some players stayed out citing injuries. The Indian Hockey Federation ordered fitness tests and Gursevak Singh (PEPSU) was ruled unfit with a dodgy knee and was replaced by Amit Singh Bakshi of the Services on the eve of the team\u2019s departure.\n\nThe Games were marred by boycotts as some of the nations from Middle East stayed away in the wake of the Suez Canal imbroglio while a couple of European nations, including Spain and the Netherlands, dropped out protesting the Russian handling of the Hungarian revolution.\n\nConsequently, only 12 teams took part. The teams were split into three groups of four each. India (Group A), Great Britain (Group B), and Pakistan and Germany (Group C) advanced to the semifinals.\n\nFor India, the league phase was a relatively easy affair as they hammered Afghanistan 14-0, the United States 16-0 and Singapore 6-0, but they lost skipper Balbir Singh, who suffered a fractured finger in the first game. Balbir\u2019s injury provided Udham Singh a great opportunity to showcase his scoring ability, which he did with seven against the U.S., two versus Singapore and then the match-winner in India\u2019s 1-0 win against Germany in the semifinals. Gentle converted a second-half short corner for India who beat Pakistan 1-0 in the final.\n\nIncidentally, India did not concede a single goal in the entire tournament to match their 1928 Olympics record, but then there were enough indications that other teams were catching up and so it proved to be.

Not only were India unbeatable tactically, the players\u2019 skills meant that they outplayed opponents and scored loads of goals, often winning matches by margins of more than 10 goals. It was, therefore, no surprise that they had won five consecutive Olympic gold medals, including a hat-trick in 1928, 1932, 1936. The Indian hockey team won golds when the Olympics returned after World War II in 1948 and 1952 and were overwhelming title favourites for the 1956 Games, held in Melbourne. On December 6, 1956, India did live up to that tag, beating Pakistan 1-0 to win a second hat-trick of Olympic golds, this time as an independent nation.\n\nThe perfect hockey team After starring in the previous two Olympics for India, legend Balbir Singh Sr. had blossomed into one of the best players in the world and was unsurprisingly named captain for Melbourne 1956. Accompanying him in India\u2019s pursuit of a second Olympic hat-trick were Leslie Claudius, Randhir Singh Gentle, and Ranganathan Francis \u2013 all of whom were playing their third Olympics. Udham Singh, Govind Perumal and Raghubir Lal were playing their second Olympics while the Indian hockey team also brought in exciting youngsters like Shankar Laxman, Gurdev Singh Kullar, and Haripal Kaushik. For the Melbourne Games, India had a great blend of experience \u2013 serial winners who knew what it took to come out on top \u2013 and young blood \u2013 who would provide the nonchalance in a title run. Prior to leaving for Melbourne, the Indian hockey team played four practice matches in Ambala and Bombay, winning all of them as expected. Though there were some injury concerns, much of the squad passed fitness tests with the only exception being Gursevak Singh, whose troublesome knee meant that he could not make his Olympic debut in Melbourne. Instead, that opportunity went to Amit Singh Bakshi. It may have been a minor injury blip in India\u2019s Olympic sojourn, but they were about to be hit by a major one. A bittersweet group stage experience With only 12 teams taking part in the 1956 Olympics - the first edition to be held in the southern hemisphere - they were divided into three groups of four teams each. India were drawn in Group A, along with Singapore, Afghanistan and the United States, opponents who were thought to be no match for the five-time champions. The group stage matches were played at the Olympic Park Stadium while the semi-finals and the final was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), which was also the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies for the 1956 Olympic Games. India opened their Olympic campaign against Afghanistan, and sounded out their intentions early, putting 14 goals past their Asian counterparts. The huge victory came at a cost though. Captain Balbir Singh Sr, who had scored five goals in the game, had suffered a fractured finger and would be forced to sit out the upcoming games. It could have been a big blow for the Indian hockey team, who were robbed of their star and main creative attacking outlet. However a champion side often comes out on the other side of adversity with their heads held high and India did just that. In the absence of Balbir Singh Sr, they unearthed a gem in forward Udham Singh.\n\nUdham, who had scored four goals in the opening game, followed that effort up with seven goals in a 16-0 victory against the USA and then scored a brace in the Indian hockey team\u2019s relatively sedate 6-0 win against Singapore in the final group game. The island nation was alert to India\u2019s attacking prowess and set up in a defensive shape, putting several bodies behind the ball. The Indian hockey team were unable to penetrate the Singapore defence until the 23rd minute, the longest India had taken to score their opening goal in Olympic history. The Indian hockey team did gather momentum after that opening goal to run Singapore ragged and end the group stage with 36 goals in total, but strangely, the media and other experts were unconvinced about India being firm favourites. The fears proved to be partly true in the semi-finals as India could only beat Germany 1-0, with Udham Singh extending his scoring record. Nevertheless, they had set up a pulsating title showdown with Pakistan, who had beaten Great Britain in the other semi-final. An emotional India vs Pakistan final The Melbourne 1956 Olympic hockey final was the beginning of the storied India-Pakistan hockey rivalry. It was the first time that India would be playing hockey against Pakistan on the global stage since the partition in 1947 and was an emotional occasion for much of the Indian hockey team, with Balbir Singh Sr even admitting in his memoirs that he was unable to sleep the night before. But it was also time for the star to return. Captain Balbir Singh Sr had not played in any of the Indian hockey team\u2019s matches since his injury in the first game and had been unable to recover by the time the final rolled around. However, head coach Harbail Singh insisted that the team\u2019s talisman take the field, if only to send a message to Pakistan. He told me that even if I wasn\u2019t able to play my best hockey, my reputation was such that the opponent would use two players to mark me and it would free up space for my other forwards. - Balbir Singh Sr. \u201cMy injury was kept a secret for the opposition and that I didn\u2019t shake hands with anyone. Just waved. I took pain-killing injections at the start of the game and at half time and managed to play.\u201d The final proved anything but easy for the Indian hockey team. Pakistan matched them stride for stride and ensured a goalless first half. However, India would soon take the lead. A few minutes into the second half, the Indian hockey team earned a penalty corner which was pushed through by Udham Singh. Raghubir Lal trapped the ball perfectly for Randhir Singh Gentle, who swept his shot into the Pakistan goal, past the last defender. Olympic debutant goalkeeper Shankar Laxman then kept Pakistan at bay, thwarting many attempts at his goal. India held on to win a historic sixth-consecutive Olympic gold, securing their second hat-trick and first as an independent nation. Moreover, India scored an Olympic record 38 goals in five matches, a tally unmatched to this date, and remarkably, conceded none. Forward Udham Singh ended with 15 goals, the most number of goals in an Olympic campaign."}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/news/helsinki-1952-olympics-indian-hockey-team-gold-medal-balbir-singh-sr-result", "page_content": "When the Indian hockey team won a second hat-trick of Olympic gold medals (1948, 1952, 1956) as an independent nation, it created a legacy that would be talked about for decades to come.

Worse, KD Singh Babu was injured, losing a few of his front teeth after colliding with a Madras XI player.\n\nIt led to some questions on the preparedness of the Indian hockey team that went to Copenhagen, Denmark for a preparatory camp. The main idea was to get acclimatized to the cold Nordic weather and the alien conditions they would encounter in Helsinki.\n\nFinland, known as the \u2018Land of the Midnight Sun\u2019, would experience daylight for 24 hours a day for almost 70 days after the summer solstice on June 21, and the period coincided with the 1952 Olympics.\n\nIt was a phenomenon that the Indian hockey team, with 10 out of 18 members making their Olympics debut, was not familiar with.

The 87-year-old recounted that if Balbir got into the \u2018D\u2019, he would definitely find the back of the net, \"We played with five forwards in that tournament. I scored 5 goals in the Olympics. We all used to practice a lot, but Balbir Singh Sr used to practice much more. Whenever he got into the \u2018D\u2019, he never missed the goal. He was a really good scorer.\"\n\nPlaying with injury: When asked about his memories from the Melbourne Games, Gurdev said, \"It was a very happy moment for us. We won all the matches in the 1956 Olympics. This was only the second time that no team had scored against India in the entire Olympics campaign. Our Captain Balbir Singh Sr\u2019s finger was broken during the tournament, but he still played for the team. At that time, wherever the Indian Hockey Team went, it always won.\"\n\nNo big welcome: The Indian team didn\u2019t receive a big reception once it returned home from the 1956 Olympics. \"When we came back from Melbourne with the gold medal, there were only three-four persons to receive us at the airport. Everyone expected us to win as it was quite normal for us to win gold medals in the Olympics,\" Gurdev said.\n\nIndian hockey team at 1956 Olympics: Balbir Singh Dosanjh (captain), Shankar Laxman, Ranganadhan Francis, Bakshish Singh, Randhir Singh Gentle, Leslie Walter Claudius, Amir Kumar, Charles Stephen, Govind Perumal, Gurdev Singh Kullar, Udham Singh Kullar, Raguhbir Singh Bhola, Balkrishan Singh Grewal, Haripal Kaushik, Raghbir Lall Sharma, O P Malhotra, Hardayal Singh Garchey and Amit Singh Bakshi."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/hockey/1956-olympics-indias-dominance-continues", "page_content": "The discerning reckon the hockey team to the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, led by centre-forward Balbir Singh, was one of the best ever to leave Indian shores. The squad was brimming with experience and youth besides tremendous firepower. It was hardly a surprise then that the team came away with another gold medal, the sixth in a row.\n\nFour of the team \u2013 Balbir Singh, Randhir Singh Gentle, Leslie Claudius and Ranganathan Francis \u2013 were playing their third Olympics, while for Govind Perumal, Udham Singh, Raghubir Lal and Amit Kumar it was their second Games. There were some young guns too in the squad that had an aura of invincibility and so it turned out to be.\n\nThe team played four warm-up games in Ambala and Bombay, winning all, but some players stayed out citing injuries. The Indian Hockey Federation ordered fitness tests and Gursevak Singh (PEPSU) was ruled unfit with a dodgy knee and was replaced by Amit Singh Bakshi of the Services on the eve of the team\u2019s departure.\n\nThe Games were marred by boycotts as some of the nations from Middle East stayed away in the wake of the Suez Canal imbroglio while a couple of European nations, including Spain and the Netherlands, dropped out protesting the Russian handling of the Hungarian revolution.\n\nConsequently, only 12 teams took part. The teams were split into three groups of four each. India (Group A), Great Britain (Group B), and Pakistan and Germany (Group C) advanced to the semifinals.\n\nFor India, the league phase was a relatively easy affair as they hammered Afghanistan 14-0, the United States 16-0 and Singapore 6-0, but they lost skipper Balbir Singh who suffered a fractured finger in the first game. Balbir\u2019s injury provided Udham Singh a great opportunity to showcase his scoring ability which he did with seven against the US, two versus Singapore and then the match-winner in India\u2019s 1-0 win against Germany in the semifinals. Gentle converted a second-half short corner for India who beat Pakistan 1-0 in the final.\n\nIncidentally, India did not concede a single goal in the entire tournament to match their 1928 Olympics record, but then there were enough indications that other teams were catching up and so it proved to be.

While it was \u2018The Wizard\u2019 Dhyan Chand who played a starring role in the Indian national hockey team\u2019s first three Olympic golds pre-independence, the architect of the other three was none other than Balbir Singh Dosanjh. Balbir Singh Senior, a three-time Olympic gold medallist, still stands as one of India\u2019s most revered hockey legends and probably the only player whose name is uttered in the same breath as Dhyan Chand\u2019s in the Indian hockey folklore. \u201cIt was destiny which helped me to achieve all I did during my career,\u201d Balbir Singh Sr. had summed up his accolades in an interview with The Hindu. Finding gold amidst the partition chaos Born in Punjab\u2019s Jalandhar district on December 31, 1923, Balbir Singh\u2019s fascination with hockey took root early. After watching India win its third Olympic gold at Berlin 1936, Balbir Singh, then just 12-years-old, decided that hockey was the sport he wanted to make his mark in. Six years later, Balbir Singh moved to Amritsar where Harbail Singh, the Indian hockey team coach at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics, spotted him and thus began his hockey journey.\n\nIn Their Own Words: Excellence is not an art but a habit\n\nAs a 20-year-old, he was \u2018arrested\u2019 by the Punjab Police, not because he was involved in illegal activities but because they wanted Balbir Singh to play for them. \u201cMy father and uncle were revolutionaries, the police were loyal to the British. How could I have joined them?\u201d he told The Times of India years later. Balbir Singh witnessed first-hand the horrors of India\u2019s partition as the state of Punjab was divided and poverty and violence engulfed its villages. Post-independence, most of his team-mates became citizens of Pakistan overnight. He faced multiple obstacles to get to the London Olympics in 1948. The striker was not included in the original 39-man squad list as the authorities \u2018forgot\u2019 about him and made it there only on the insistence of Dickie Carr, a member of the 1932 Olympic gold medal-winning team. Once in the reckoning, Balbir Singh made it to the final 20-man Indian hockey squad for the Olympics, but inter-team dynamics saw him banished from the playing XI in the first match. Only an injury to Ronnie Rodrigues saw him take the field against Argentina and he stepped up in style with six goals in a 9-1 win. However, Balbir Singh was again axed in the third game and had almost entered the field for the semi-final before he was informed that he would not be playing. A few medical students took offence to this and their protest to the Indian high commissioner in London is what got him into the team for the Olympics final. Balbir Singh scored two more goals in the final at the Wembley Stadium, against Great Britain no less, to help the Indian hockey team secure a 4-0 victory and their fourth Olympic gold. The win, and more importantly, the pride gave him an unprecedented high. \u201cFor the first time in 1948, the tricolour was hoisted at the top of the world. As the flag was going up, I felt as if I was going up too. Then I realised, no, I am on the ground. I still remember how it felt, as if I was going up as well. I felt as if I was flying,\u201d Balbir Singh had told ESPN.\n\nBalbir Singh in action during the hockey semi-final of the Helsinki 1952 Olympics.\n\nBalbir SIngh's Olympic final record By the time the next Olympics rolled around in 1952, Balbir Singh had become an integral part of the Indian hockey team and was named vice-captain to KD Babu for the Helsinki Olympics. He was also the flag-bearer for the Indian contingent. \u201cFinland is the land of the midsummer nights. The first night was terrible for us; the glare in the open window would not give us sleep. We adjusted to the odd sight of the sun shining in the night by downing our shutters and darkening our rooms with heavy curtains,\" Balbir Singh wrote in his memoir, The Golden Hat Trick. A disturbed sleep cycle aside, the 1952 Olympics was where Balbir Singh was truly recognised as the heart of the Indian hockey team as he scored nine goals, including a hat-trick each in the semi-final and final. In fact, Balbir Singh\u2019s five goals in the 6-1 win in the final against the Netherlands broke a 44-year record for most goals in an Olympic final and it still stands almost seven decades later.\n\nIn Melbourne 1956, Balbir Singh was named captain. He was not as prolific as before -- Udham Singh took the top scorer\u2019s honours with 15 goals - but the brave forward soldiered through a fracture in his right hand to help India win the final and secure a sixth Olympic gold. It also completed India\u2019s second hat-trick of Olympic gold medals in hockey and the first as an independent nation.\n\nBalbir Singh's love affair with hockey Balbir Singh became the first sportsperson to receive the Padma Shri, India\u2019s fourth-highest civilian honour, in 1957 and went on to win silver at the 1958 Asian Games, only conceding the gold to Pakistan on goal difference. Though he did not play another Olympics, Balbir Singh\u2019s love for hockey saw him take up coaching after retirement. He guided the Indian hockey team as the sport expanded beyond the Olympics. He managed the Indian hockey team to bronze in the 1971 Hockey World Cup and then was at the helm for their only Hockey World Cup win to date in 1975. In between, he also came to be known as Balbir Singh Sr. after three other Balbir Singhs were part of the bronze-winning team at the 1968 Olympics. Balbir Singh Sr. breathed his last aged 96 on 25th May 2020 but is survived by a doting family and an insatiable desire that one day Indian hockey will reclaim the lofty heights to which he once guided it."}], "Balbir Singh Kullar was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly in 1957.": [{"url": "https://organiser.org/2023/03/27/166591/bharat/punjab-aap-minister-balbir-singh-convicted-for-3-years-in-2022-in-assault-case-but-was-not-disqualified-by-mann-govt/", "page_content": "Punjab: On March 24, the Lok Sabha Secretariat issued the notification of former Congress MP Rahul Gandhi\u2019s disqualification from Lok Sabha following his conviction in the \u2018Modi\u2019 surname defamation case.

However, the AAP-led Punjab Government did not disqualify him u/s 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Furthermore, Dr Balbir Singh was sworn in as Punjab\u2019s Cabinet Minister for Health after Fauja Singh Sarari resigned as Cabinet Minister following his controversial audio tape discussing ways to \u2018trap\u2019 contractors for extortion surfaced on social media on January 7.\n\nThe complainant, Wing Commander Mewa Singh, is Dr Balbir Singh\u2019s brother-in-law. The complainant alleged that Dr Balbir Singh assaulted him and his wife, Paramjit Saini, over a land dispute. The Trial Court observed that Dr Balbir Singh and other accused persons were the aggressor and said, \u201cjustification given by the respective parties for their presence at the spot, nature of injuries and medical evidence as well as the time of registration of FIR and the cross- version clearly indicate that it was the accused in the present case viz. Dr. Balbir Singh etc. who were the aggressor.\u201d\n\nThe Trial Court held that the allegations against Dr Balbir Singh and other accused were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the Trial Court convicted Dr Balbir Singh and other accused u/s 323 r/w section 34, 324, 325 and 506 r/w section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nFurthermore, the Trial Court observed that \u201cwhile taking into consideration the plea of the convict and their age (convict Dr. Balbir Singh aged 66 years, convict Rupinderjit Saini aged 60 years, convict Rahul Saini aged 34 years and convict Parwinder Singh @ Parminder Singh aged 32 years) cannot lose sight of the fact that both the injured and the complainant in the present case were also aged about 68 and 60 years respectively, at the time when they were given merciless beatings by the present convict causing grievous injury to Paramjit Saini.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, in the considered view of this Court, this is not a fit case to grant benefit of probation to the convict,\u201d the Trial Court added while sentencing Dr Balbir Singh and the other three accused to 3 years of rigorous imprisonment.\n\nHowever, Dr Balbir Singh was not disqualified from Punjab\u2019s Legislative Assembly after his conviction in the 2011 assault case. It is pertinent to note that Dr Balbir Singh is an MLA from the ruling party and forms part of the ruling Punjab Government.\n\nFurthermore, Dr Balbir Singh alleged that he was falsely implicated in the case and said, \u201cI will file an appeal against the judgment.\u201d Dr Balbir Singh and Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan later held a meeting with Vidhan Sabha Secretary Surinder Pal to discuss the implications of the conviction on his MLA membership, The Tribune reported.\n\nDr Balbir Singh appealed to Sessions Court against his conviction. Dr Balbir Singh\u2019s counsel submitted to the Court that \u201cThe appellant had contested the recent assembly elections in the year 2022.

There are other cases as well where the appellant has been cited as an accused in the FIR registered against him and said cases are pending Trial.

As per section 8(3) of Representation of the People Act, 1951, provides for the disqualification of the member of the Legislature in case he is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years.\u201d\n\nThe Court noted that \u201cthe special circumstances are attracted in this case as the disqualification of the appellant from the State Legislature would also make the people of his constituency unrepresented.

He also served five terms as the chief minister (head of government) of Punjab (1970\u201371, 1977\u201380, 1997\u20132002, 2007\u201312, and 2012\u201317).\n\nBadal was born into a family of landowning farmers in what is now western Punjab state and earned a B.A. degree from Forman Christian College in Lahore (now in Pakistan). His first foray into politics was in 1947 when he was elected the leader in his village. In 1957 he was elected to the Punjab legislative assembly as a member of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party). He left the party a few years later over differences with the chief minister of Punjab and joined the SAD.\n\nBadal left office after he was defeated in the 1967 state assembly elections, but he returned after winning in 1969 and joined the state\u2019s SAD-led government. A year later he was named the chief minister. His term lasted for only a year, however, as the party was beset by infighting and the government was dissolved by and transferred to the central authorities in New Delhi.\n\nBadal was reelected to the Punjab legislative assembly repeatedly from 1969 until 2012\u2014the only exception being in 1992, when the SAD boycotted state elections\u2014although there were periods during those years when he was out of office because the state was under the rule of New Delhi. In addition, Badal was imprisoned at various times, including a stretch during the 1975\u201377 emergency that had been decreed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In early 1977 he was elected to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the parliament) and was tapped to serve in the administration of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. Badal\u2019s tenure in national office was brief, however, as the SAD insisted that he return to Punjab state politics. Shortly thereafter he began his second term as chief minister.\n\nMore jail time followed in the 1980s during the period of Sikh agitation for greater autonomy. Badal was arrested in conjunction with protests against a plan to divert river water from Punjab to neighbouring Haryana state. Another time he tore pages of the constitution of India during a protest event, though he later made an apology for having done that. He won back his seat in the 1985 state assembly elections, which were dominated by the SAD, but one of his fellow party members, Surjit Singh Barnala, was named chief minister.\n\nBadal maintained a relatively low public profile politically during another period of central-government rule (1987\u201392) and after the SAD boycott of the 1992 state assembly elections. He remained one of the top officials of the party, however, and in 1996 he was elected party president. The following year the SAD secured a large majority of seats in state assembly elections, and Badal was chosen for the third time to be chief minister. He served out his full five-year term for the first time, but after the party lost to the Congress Party in the 2002 assembly elections, he left office.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nFor the 2007 state elections, the SAD allied itself with the Bharatiya Janata Party and won a comfortable majority of assembly seats; Badal was again named chief minister and once more served his full term. The two parties remained allied for the 2012 assembly polls and again secured a majority. Badal, retaining his post, became the first person to serve two consecutive terms as chief minister in Punjab. He also became the country\u2019s oldest chief minister\u2014this after having been the youngest in that post when in 1970 he took office for the first time. In 2008, however, he had stepped down from the party presidency and had been succeeded by his son, Sukhbir Singh Badal. During the 2012 campaign, the senior Badal announced that it would be his final election.\n\nThroughout his long political career, Badal was seen as a moderate, even-tempered, and liberal leader, and both his public life and his private life had been generally noncontroversial. In 2003, however, corruption charges were filed against him and his family. They were finally acquitted of the charges in 2010."}, {"url": "https://punjabassembly.nic.in/index.php/ministers/knowyourminister/22", "page_content": "Elected to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha in 2007, 2012 and now again in 2017.
