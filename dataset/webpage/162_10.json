{"In 2018, Bryan McClendon returned to Georgia as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.": [{"url": "https://theathletic.com/3104844/2022/02/01/what-bryan-mcclendon-and-mike-bobo-bring-back-to-the-georgia-football-program/", "page_content": "ATHENS, Ga. \u2014 There was a school of thought, when Kirby Smart became Georgia\u2019s coach six years ago, that he should leave the Mark Richt era entirely behind. Make a clean break with the previous staff, which didn\u2019t have the right mentality anyway. At least the right mentality to become a national champion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuckily, Smart did not think the same way, or else a few years ago he would not have brought in Todd Hartley, who had been a Richt staffer at Georgia and then Miami. Hartley went out and recruited a series of major tight end recruits, including a kid from Napa Valley named Brock Bowers.\n\nThe past is not the past if it\u2019s also the present, and helping you for the future.\n\nThat brings us to the news of the past few days: Welcome back Mike Bobo, as an offensive analyst, and welcome back Bryan McClendon, receivers coach and passing game coordinator. Boom, boom. (In addition to Coach Boom himself, Will Muschamp having come on last year.)\n\nThis all makes for a sweet story. Georgia boys coming home, brought home by the Georgia boy who just won the national title.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than just a feel-good story. Smart has some sentimentality in him, but he\u2019s got cut-throat, business sense in him, too. Which is the more important reason he\u2019s brought Bobo and McClendon back:\n\nAs coaching hires, they\u2019re no-brainers.\n\nWhen Smart took over at Georgia, he spoke to McClendon about staying on. The two decided to go in opposite directions, which led to the idea in some quarters there was some frostiness. But a few months later I witnessed the two embrace at a satellite camp (ah, remember those days), and when Smart\u2019s staff added Muschamp \u2014 who employed McClendon at South Carolina from 2016-18 \u2014 and then Bobo \u2014 who worked with McClendon at Georgia \u2014 the return of B-Mac became an inevitability.\n\nBobo\u2019s role as an analyst means he\u2019s not calling plays, recruiting on the road or coaching quarterbacks during practice. But he can still do plenty more, whether it\u2019s cutting up film of opponents or assisting offensive coordinator Todd Monken in game-planning, and can evaluate prospects on tape and help recruit them on visits.\n\nMike Bobo returns to Georgia as an analyst after spending the last seven seasons at Colorado State, South Carolina and Auburn. (Daniel Shirey / AP)\n\nThere will also be the question of a future successor to Monken, in the event he leaves for an NFL coordinator job. (That\u2019s becoming increasingly unlikely in this cycle, but Georgia won\u2019t be able to hold onto him forever.) Bobo could easily slide from the analyst role to coordinator. McClendon could also do it: He was South Carolina\u2019s offensive coordinator in 2018 and 2019. And Buster Faulkner, who has been an offensive analyst for Georgia the past two years, was Southern Miss\u2019 offensive coordinator, and appears to be headed for a Power 5 play-caller role at some point in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut so much about this is recruiting.\n\nMcClendon, while at Georgia, was listed as the main recruiter for Sony Michel, Nick Chubb, Isaiah Wynn, Natrez Patrick and Lorenzo Carter \u2014 so arguably he deserved a ring for the 2017 SEC championship and Rose Bowl. Now he gets a chance to play a part in what comes next at Georgia.\n\nTodd Gurley and Isaiah Crowell are also on McClendon\u2019s ledger, and of particular interest to Georgia now may be the names Tony Franklin and Dont\u2019e Thornton, a pair of top-100 receivers who McClendon pulled for Oregon in the 2021 class despite being hired less than a year before they signed. McClendon also got Isaiah Brevard, another highly-regarded receiver (No. 173). Those three hailed from California, Baltimore and Mississippi, showing that when you put McClendon on a position he recruits it nationally and recruits it well, which is what Smart wants.\n\nBobo, meanwhile, knows the state of Georgia as well as anyone. Literally, his contacts may rival only Smart, his fellow son of a high school coach. Throw in Muschamp and Dell McGee, the former high school coach, and you have people on this Georgia staff whose institutional knowledge of high school football is ridiculous. Name a high school and they can tell you principal, the custodian, and drive there without the help of the GPS.\n\nBobo was far more than a recruiter of quarterbacks. He used his south Georgia contacts to reel in the No. 1 ranked player in the 2015 class, defensive lineman Trenton Thompson from Albany. Bobo can\u2019t go on the road in the analyst role, but he can use his array of contacts in plenty of ways.\n\nGeorgia may not seem like it needs any more recruiting help, but Smart knows it\u2019s an ever-present battle: Alabama is still Alabama, Texas A&M has become a recruiting power, and schools like Florida are figuring out they need to prioritize recruiting in ways they have not been. Georgia can\u2019t rest on its new championship laurels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also some other benefits to bringing McClendon and Bobo home.\n\nNot that Smart needs the help anymore, but the head coaching experience on his staff is now bordering on excessive: Muschamp and Matt Luke combine for 12 years of SEC head coaching experience, Monken and Bobo combine for eight years of Group of 5 head coaching experience, and McGee and McClendon combine for three stints as interim head coaches. (They\u2019re 2-1 as bowl head coaches.)\n\nBobo and McClendon also should offer up plenty for chemistry around the building. Not that it\u2019s been a problem. But anyone who was around the program during the notorious 2015 season, and all that staff dissension, knows two things:\n\nBobo\u2019s departure the year before was a big reason things broke down, because he had the personal skills to manage things behind the scenes. A Richt loyalist, but close friend of Pruitt, and someone who knew almost everyone in the building, football and otherwise.\n\nMcClendon got the interim role after Richt\u2019s departure for a reason: Basically everyone liked him. When McClendon was tabbed I texted two staff members, one from each of the factions, and both immediately replied that McClendon was a great choice.\n\nAs Smart enters the post-championship phase of his career, the trick may be keeping the intensity up, while keeping the heart in it, too. It\u2019s a business, yes, but it\u2019s also a mission. As they chased the ring the past few years, staff members talked about \u201cgetting over the hump,\u201d so it\u2019s moved to \u201cnow what?\u201d It seems a good way to keep the momentum going by making this about Georgia, rather than \u201cthe next Alabama.\u201d And what a great way to do that by strengthening the connection to the past by bringing in two key figures from the Mark Richt era, who like Smart went away, learned more, and can now come back as better coaches.\n\nThey\u2019re good recruiters. They\u2019re good coaches. They\u2019re Georgia men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd they\u2019re back home.\n\n(Top photo of Bryan McClendon: Jamie Gilliam / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://georgiadogs.com/sports/football/roster/coaches/bryan-mcclendon/3151", "page_content": "Four-year University of Georgia letterman and coach Bryan McClendon was named passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach in February of 2022.\n\n\n\nHe is part of a coaching staff that led the 15-0 Bulldogs to the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship with a 65-7 victory over TCU in the title game following a semi-final win over Ohio State in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl semi-final, 42-41.\n\n\n\nThe Georgia offense ranked among the top five nationally in both scoring offense (41.1 ppg) and total offense (501.1 ypg).
