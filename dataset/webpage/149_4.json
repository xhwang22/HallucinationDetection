He was a soldier under Cromwell, and a participant in the battle of Marston Moor. He settled in Providence, Rhode Island, 19 November, 1645, was admitted a resident of the town with a quarter interest of the original proprietors of the Providence purchase, and founded a numerous family, whose members are now found in nearly every state and territory of the United States. He was pastor of the 1st Baptist church in Providence from 1678 till his death, preaching and officiating in that capacity for about forty years without remuneration. At his own expense, in 1700, he built the first meeting-house of this religious society, the oldest in America of its denomination. Mr. Tillinghast in 1711, \"for and in consideration of the love and goodwill\" he bore the church over which he was then pastor, executed \" to them and their successors in the same faith and order\" a deed of the meetinghouse and the lot on which it. stood. In the deed of conveyance he describes the faith and order of the church by quoting Hebrews vi., 1, 2, showing it to be the same as that now held by the Six Principle Baptists. In addition to his pastoral duties and his occupation of a merchant, he found time to serve the infant colony many times as member of the house of deputies, and the town of Providence twenty-five years, in various posts of honor and trust.--'His great-grandson, Thomas, jurist, born in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, 21 August, 1742; died in East Greenwich, L. I., 26 August, 1821, was 8 member of the legislature from 1772 till 1780, and one of the committee that it appointed in 1777 to estimate the damage done by the British soldiers on the islands of Conanicut and Rhode Island during the war of the Revolution. In 1779 he was elected judge of the court of common pleas for Kent county, and a member of the council of war. In September, 1780, he was chosen associate justice of the supreme court, which post he held by annual elections until 1787, sitting in the famous paper-money case of Trevett vs. Weeden. His firmness and decision in this case, notwithstanding its unpopularity in the state at the time, ought, says a writer, \"to cause his name to be inscribed in letters of gold.\" He was again a judge of the supreme court from 1791 until his resignation in December, 1797, in which year he was elected a member of congress, serving from 13 November, 1797, till 4 March, 1799, and in 1801-'3. Joseph Leonard, lawyer, fifth in descent from Pardon, born in Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1790; died in Providence, Rhode Island, 30 December, 1844, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1811. In 1819 he received the honorary degree of A. M. from Brown, of which he was elected a trustee in 1833. He filled many other public stations, was for many years a member of the general assembly, and was repeatedly elected speaker of the house, where he was the earnest advocate of public instruction and judicial reform. Elected to congress as a Whig, he served from 4 September, 1837, till 3 March, 1843. In congress he was one of the most useful mere-bets, few men equalling him in the extent of his political information. At the age of eighteen he published in the Providence \"Gazette.\" over the signature \"Dion,\" a series of political essays that attracted wide attention; and he also contributed poetry to journals over the signature of \" Carroll.\"\n\nsource:\n\nfamousamericans.net/pardontillinghast/\n\nMawney also had this to say, which gives us some clue about the residence of the Capt. Tillinghast involved.\n\n'When I came on deck I saw Capt. Tillinghast, and some others. We got into the boat and rowed up the river a certain distance and went by land to town, when Capt. Tillinghast, who was then living with me, after taking breakfast, went on the hill to view the smoking ruins of the vessel, which was all in flames soon after we left it.\"\n\nThe Tillinghasts were a prominent family in Rhode Island and Providence at the time preceding the Revolutionary War. Pardon Tillinghast, the first American of this line, born in Seven Cliffs near Beachy Head, now Eastborn, Sussex, England, in 1622, served in the English army under Cromwell, and fought in the battle of Marston Moor. The Tillinghasts were an example of the American families that had immigrated at the era of the Civil War in England in which the argument was that the King was constrained by an unwritten constitution and could not act in matters of such items as taxation without the consent of the governed.\n\nPardon later came to New England, and in 1645 settled in Providence, R.I., where he bought a quarter interest in the original Providence purchase. He became a merchant in Providence, and was exceedingly active in public affairs. He built the first substantial wharf in Providence for ships to use, and was successful as a merchant importing and exporting goods. He was widely known as a man of great religious zeal. With his own money he built in 1700, the First Baptist Church at Providence, R.I., the oldest church of this denomination in America, and for over forty years (1678-1718) without any remuneration acted as pastor of that society. For over twenty-five years he held various posts of honor in the town and he also served the colony many times as deputy to the General Court. So to be a Tillinghast in Providence marked the person as a person of status.\n\nFor examples, Thomas Tillinghast was a Colonial Deputy (State Representative) from West Greenwich, and Nicholas Tillinghast helped Governor Stephen Hopkins redress grievances to the King against the Stamp Act in 1764.\n\nIn 18th century England, status was all-important in governing the population. Hence the pre-Revolutionary War status of the Tillinghast was important to the English in thinking about the importance of those resisting the customs collections. Had the royal commission investigating the Gaspee attack known that it was people of status like the merchants Tillinghasts, Browns, and Greenes, they would have been shocked. To them it was almost unthinkable that men of such family status could be involved. In fact, the simple act of having the English navy crewmen look at these reputable colonial merchants would have been repugnant to English nobility and gentry thinking.\n\nLet us now discuss which Tillinghast it was that was on the raid. We do know that there was a the ship captain Tillinghast that was a ship captain of John Brown, and a prominent ship captain after the Revolution. [Off Soundings] This is probably the Captain Joseph Tillinghast that was on the raid. The John Brown ship captain and investor in many ships is the one most likely to have been the person to be in charge of a longboat in a John Brown matter. References in square[ ] or curly{} brackets] on any page in this website are to books, or other materials, listed in the Joseph Bucklin Society Library Catalog.]\n\nThere was only one Capt. Joseph Tillinghast listed in Providence in the pre-revolutionary war period, on the land ownership tax assessments before 1770. He was one of the persons assessed for fire protection in the \"compact part of Providence\" in 1759. He was assessed 12 pounds. [Cf. Capt. Joseph Bucklin's (born 1720). assessment of 20 pounds.] No Joseph Tillinghast shows up as a property owner in the 1770 tax assessment. But in 1772, three Joseph Tillinghasts show up as being taxed in one way or another in Providence. [Courtesy Wayne G. Tillinghast, see infra.] All three were ship captains.\n\nThere is only one Joseph Tillinghast listed in the 1777 Rhode Island Military Census, which shows a man able to bear arms in the age range of 16 to 50 years old. But there are four Joseph Tillinghasts listed in the Rhode Island Historical Cemetery Database with dates corresponding to being possibly present in 1772. All four are listed as Captains. All we have to do is determine which was the one of the four that was living in Providence in 1772. The choices are.\n\n1. TILLINGHAST, JOSEPH E, CAPT 1739c - 18 DEC 1781 (who would have been about 32 years old at the time of the Gaspee raid), buried at the Tillinghast family lot in Providence on Benefit street at Transit street.\n\n2. TILLINGHAST, JOSEPH, CAPT 1720c - 14 FEB 1797 EG018 (who would have been about 52 years old at the time of the Gaspee raid), buried in the Tillinghast family lot in East Greenwich.\n\n3. TILLINGHAST, JOSEPH, CAPT 1728c - 6 SEP 1789, buried in Providence's Old North Burial Ground where many Gaspee raiders have been buried.\n\n4. TILLINGHAST, JOSEPH, CAPT 1734 - 14 NOV 1816, buried in Providence's Old North Burial Ground where many Gaspee raiders have been buried. This Joseph was the brother of Thomas Tillinghast (noted above as a Colonial Deputy in the state assembly.) Joseph and Thomas' parents were John Tillinghast (born 1690, died Oct. 21, 1777) and Anne Allin (born July 2, 1699, died March 5, 1739)) This Joseph married Mary Earle, daughter. of John and Mary (Watts) Earle, in 1776. After he became married, he shows up as having an ownership interest in ship registries regarding the ships: Polly, Brig. Reg. 1776 ; Sloop Reg. 1783 ; Polly, Lic 1793 ; Polly and Betsey, Reg. 1794 to Wm E. and Joseph Tillinghast (in this list hereafter as \"Wm and Jos\"); Argus, Brig Reg. 1804 Wm and Jos; Commerce, Reg. 1796 Wm and Jos; Hunter, Brig. Reg. 1796 Wm.and Jos; Planter, Brig Lic. 1802 Wm. and Jos; Joseph, Schooner Lic. 1815 Heirs of Joseph part owners . [Ship Registers 1941].\n\nTodd Lawrence, Genealogist of the Tillinghast Family Society, tells us the following.\n\nCapt. Joseph Tillinghast, [# 4 above] born Jan 09, 1735 in East Greenwich (Source = Arnold Vital records of RI), died Nov. 14, 1816 in Providence (Source = Charles Tillinghast Straight genealogy in RI Historical Society library). Rose Tillinghast, in her 1972 \"Tillinghast Family\" genealogy, lists a lot of information on the ships that this Joseph Captained - she also guessed that he was the Gaspee raider - no concrete proof however.\"\n\nGaspee history researcher John Concannon, with a different line of substantial reasoning, also picks the Joseph Tillinghast # 4 above. See http://www.gaspee.org/JosephTillinghast.htm Concannon works on the theory that if Mawney says \" Capt. Tillinghast, who was then living with me,\" Tillinghast must have been unmarried at the time. Liberally paraphrased (not exactly quoted), Concannon says:\n\nJoseph Tillinghast [# 4 above] born in 1734 in East Greenwich, married a Mary Earle from Providence in 1776. Joseph and Mary who had a child named William Earle Tillinghast (c1777/8 - 25 APR 1817) who married an Amey Mawney, daughter of Pardon Mawney, John Mawney's brother. Since the Tillinghast-Earle marriage did not take place until 1776, this Joseph Tillinghast would've been free to room with John Mawney in 1772 at the time of the Gaspee attack. All are referenced by our old friend Weldon Whipple at www.whipple.org and by his source, Stanley W. Arnold, Jr., \"A Mawney Line of Descent,\" Rhode Island Genealogical Register, v. 11 (1988), p. 206\n\nWayne G Tillinghast, in his well researched article The Three Captains Joseph Tillinghast of Providence, Rhode Island Roots, June 2004, 30:57-86 has accurately determined which was the Captain Tillinghast was the Gaspee raider, to wit 1734 - 14 NOV 1816, the son of John Tillinghast. Part of what he says is paraphrased below.\n\nIn 1772 John Mawney was living in Providence with his widowed mother Amey (Gibbs) Mawney, and although there is no specific entry for June of 1772, the account books of Joseph Tillinghast, son of John Tillinghast, reflect that he occasionally paid rent to Mrs. Amey Mawney. A letter that Joseph, son of John, wrote to his father-in-law, William Earle, a few days after his marriage in 1776, confirmed that he still had some furniture at Mrs. Mawney\u2019s house. Additionally, this Joseph Tillinghast John Mawney were related, being grandson and great-grandson, respectively, of Pardon Tillinghast of East Greenwich.\n\nJoseph was a charter member of the Charitable Baptist Society, an organization formed in 1774 for the purpose of acquiring the land and constructing the new meetinghouse for the First Baptist Church of Providence.\n\nOn 19 July 1776, Joseph Tillinghast, Nicholas Brown, William Wall, Richard Salter, Elijah Shepardson, and John B. Hopkins, as owners of the sloop Yankee Ranger, and John Warner, commander, on 19 July 1776, applied for and received a \u201cLetter of Marque,\u201d (essentially a commission as a privateer). Thereafter, On 13 Aug. 1776 Joseph as commander of John Brown\u2019s sloop Polly, and under written orders from John Brown, \u201cburthened about Seventy Tons, \u2026 Six Carriage Guns Four Pounders and Swivel Guns, with Twenty Men and fitted with a suitable Quantity of Small Arms, Pistols, Cutlasses, Powder Ball and other Military Stores,\u201d received a Letter of Marque. Thereafter, until 1777, Captain Joseph Tillinghast was at sea as a privateer attacking British ships.\n\nThe Charitable Baptist Society records in Providence as of The July 1777 note that he was \u201cat Smithfield,\u201d and indeed his Bible records reflect that his oldest son William Earle Tillinghast was born at Smithfield 5 Sept. 1777. Several Providence residents, fearing an attack from the enemy, left Providence during the British occupation of Newport. Commodore Esek Hopkins reported to the Continental Marine Committee on 8 Apr. 1777 that he was seriously concerned with the safety of the Rhode Island coast, and particularly Providence, because of the reluctance of the militia to tolerate the high price of goods and the low wages, and \u201cthe princable men that have maid fortens by Priviteren have bought estates back in the Cuntrey & have and are now moving away which must leave the town in a Defencless Condition.\u201d[ ]\n\nWe conclude that Concannon, Rose Tillinghast and Wayne Tillinghast are right in picking the Gaspee raider longboat captain. So we list this Tillinghast, Joseph, Capt 1734 -1816 as the Gaspee raider.\n\n1.

He was a Baptist minister in america, but always refused to accept any salary. He built and equipt the first meeting house in Providence, R.I., and persented it to the society. He died in Jan. 29, 1718, at age 96 in Providence. He was a soldier in Cromwell's Army. His first wife was a Butterworth, his second wife was Lydia, daughter of Phipip and Lydia (Masters Taber) Children by first wife were Sarah, John, Mary. Second wife: Phillip, Benjamin, Abigail, Joseph, Mercy, Hannah, Elizabeth, Lydia and Pardon. He was a prominent merchant of his day, and a very useful citizen, being Deputy six years and overseer of the Poor, a member of the Town Council, etc. In 1681 he became pastor of the Baptist Church\n\nPardon Tillinghast (2) in direct line, was born Feb. 16, 1666, died Oct. 15, 1743. Married Mary Keech who died Feb 7, 1726. Children were John born 1690, Thomas and James born November 24, 1816. Their father, according to the daughter Cora Warren Hendricks, was a cobbler. They liven in or near the mountains in New York. The mother died when they were quite small and the father remarried. Thomas was \"bound out\" to a farmer. I believe because family tradition was that Thomas was often hungry. At this place and while the owners were away, Thomas would take milk from the container and then replace it with water so the missing milk would not be discovered. The daughter says Thomas ran away from the people he was bound to and worked on the Erie Canal. He settled in Stephenson County, Illinois in 1838. Later he came to Kansas in 1874 - Jewell County, Sinclair Township. Mary born 1694, Joseph born 1706 and Phillip born 1710.\n\n\n\nPardon Tillinghast (1622-1717) was an early pastor of the First Baptist Church in America and a public official in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n2 Family\n\n3 References\n\n4 See also\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1625 Tillinghast was baptized in Streat Parish Church, Streat, East Sussex, England[1]. He may have been born in Seven Cliffs, near Beachy Head (now Eastbourne), Sussex, England.[2] It is believed that he served as a soldier under Oliver Cromwell and participated in the battle of Marston Moor. Tillinghast settled in Providence, Rhode Island and on November 19, 1645 was admitted a resident and allotted a share as a proprietor. He served as pastor of the First Baptist Church in Providence without remuneration from 1678 until his death in 1717. He was the author of Water-Baptism Plainly Proved by Scripture to Be a Gospel Precept (Boston, 1689). In 1700 at his own expense, Tillinghast built the first meeting-house of the First Baptist Church, the oldest Baptist congregation in America. In 1711 Tillinghast deeded the building to the church and described the church as adhering to Six Principle Baptist principles. Tillinghast worked as a merchant and served as a member of the house of deputies (representatives), and in various official posts within the town of Providence. Tillinghast died in Providence, Rhode Island, 19 January, 1718. [3]\n\nFamily\n\nRev. Tillinghast was married twice and he was an ancestor of most persons in the United States with his surname. A little before 1654 he married a Miss Butterworth, whose given name may have been Sarah. They had 3 children. On 16 April 1664 he married Lydia Tabor, and they had 9 children. [4]\n\nHis granddaughter Mary Tillinghast married Richard Ward, colonial governor of Rhode Island. Their son Samuel Ward was a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was an ancestor of Julia Ward Howe.\n\nNicholas Brown, Jr., for whom Brown University was named, was a great great grandson.\n\nThe name Pardon was Rev.

A cooper by profession, he immigrated to New England about 1645, and became a successful merchant. Later in life he became a clergyman, serving without compensation for nearly four decades. He died in 1718 aged about 96, and was buried in a family cemetery on Benefit Street in Providence that remains extant. Among his thousands of descendants are many of great prominence, including Continental Congress delegate Samuel Ward; Julia Ward Howe who wrote the Battle Hymn of the Republic; and Stephen Arnold Douglas who was involved in a series of famed debates with Abraham Lincoln in 1858, prior to a Senate race, and later lost to him in the 1860 presidential election.\"\n\nFrom the WikiTree, \"Pardon Elisha Tillinghast II (abt. 1625-abt. 1718\": \"He was the author of Water-Baptism Plainly Proved by Scripture to Be a Gospel Precept (Boston, 1689). At his own expense, he built the first meeting house of the First Baptist Church in 1700. In 1711 he deeded the building to the church and described the church as adhering to Six Principle Baptist principles. The importance of this gift becomes appreciable considering that for 50 years the only places of meeting were in many of the groves surrounding Providence. The building was erected on the corner of what is now North Main and Smith streets. Tillinghast worked as a merchant and served as a member of the house of deputies (representatives), and in various official posts within the town of Providence.\"\n\nGEDCOM Note\n\n<u><b>Pardon Elisha Tillinghast </b></u> 2 January 1625 \u2013 20 January 1718 \u2022 MQ7Q-P6N\n\n<b>Sex</b> Male\n\n<b>Birth</b> 2 January 1625\n\nSeven Cliffs, Sussex, England\n\n<b>Christening</b> 3 January 1623\n\nStreat, Sussex, England\n\n<b>Death</b> 20 January 1718\n\nProvidence, Providence, Rhode Island, United States\n\n<b>Burial</b> Swan Point Cemetery, Providence, Providence, Rhode Island, United States\n\n<b>Occupation</b> Successful Merchant\n\nNew England, United States\n\nCooper, Shopkeeper\n\nNew England\n\n<b>Custom Fact</b> Built the first wharf in Providence\n\n<u><b>Family Members\n\n</u>Spouse</b> Sarah Butterworth 1633-1661 \u2022 LK8M-GL5 \u200b\n\n<b>Marriage:</b> 1654\n\nSwansea, Bristol, Massachusetts, USA\n\n<b>Children</b> John Tillinghast 1657-1690 \u2022 L8MB-8GG \u200b\n\nMary Tillinghast 1659-1711 \u2022 LD54-4K4 \u200b\n\nLydia Tillinghast 1666-1707 \u2022 LHZD-98N \u200b\n\nPardon Tillinghast 1668-1743 \u2022 LCTX-GFH \u200b\n\nPhillip Tillinghast 1669-1732 \u2022 LVX7-YCJ \u200b\n\nBenjamin Tillinghast 1671-1726 \u2022 LH93-MFW \u200b\n\nMercy Tillinghast 1673-1769 \u2022 LVJ3-Y44 \u200b\n\nAbigail Tillinghast 1674-1744 \u2022 MSMC-8CQ \u200b\n\nJoseph Tillinghast 1677-1763 \u2022 L8B5-JQ8 \u200b\n\nHannah Tillinghast 1682-1731 \u2022 M6TL-P5W \u200b\n\nElizabeth Tillinghast 1685-1750 \u2022 LHQS-FJS \u200b\n\nSarah Tillinghast 1654-1742 \u2022 LZWQ-XYY \u200b\n\n<b>Spouse</b> Lydia Taber 1640-1718 \u2022 M87T-LM7 \u200b\n\n<b>Marriage:</b> 16 April 1664\n\nProvidence, Providence, Rhode Island, United States\n\n<b>Spouse</b> Lydia Taber Tillinghast Deceased \u2022 MCLG-17V \u200b\n\n<b>Spouse</b> Lydia Taber 1602-Deceased \u2022 MZ6Z-1W5 \u200b\n\n<b>Spouse</b> Lydia Tabor 1650-Deceased \u2022 9SFV-C61 \u200b\n\n<b>Parents</b> Pardon John Tillinghast 1600-1665 \u2022 L69Y-JMD \u200b\n\nSarah Browne 1600-1653 \u2022 MCL3-ZQ6 \u200b\n\n<b>Marriage:</b> 26 November 1622\n\nCharlwood, Surrey, England\n\n<b>Siblings</b> John Tillinghast 1623-Deceased \u2022 L4QN-ZFF \u200b\n\nRev.

On 21 Dec 1722 he married Hope Power [1701-1792], and they produced one daughter and five sons. James died at sea when his children were young, and they were raised by his brother, Obadiah Brown [1712-1762]. His eldest son, James III would also die at sea at a young age, but the four others, Nicholas, Joseph, John, and Moses became known collectively as the \"Four Brown Brothers\". They vastly strengthened the family's place in the ranks of rich, powerful New Englanders, via their dedication to the mercantile empire founded by their father and uncles. They all made names for themselves in business, philanthropy, and patriotism, all of them connected to the notorius Gaspee Affair. His grandson, Nicholas Brown II, used the wealth that his family accumulated and that he himself acquired to endow the university which now bears their name.\n\n\u00a9Rhode Island Historical Society Manuscripts Division\n\nR.I.H.S.

His father was\n\nElder James Brown (1666-1716), a pastor on the First Baptist Church; his mother was\n\nMary (Harris) Brown. James II established himself early in the mercantile business, trading in rum, molasses, slaves and less controversial wares. He seems to have been the owner of only one slave ship, the Mary, which sailed for Africa in 1736, sold its cargo in the West Indies and then returned to Providence. It was apparently the first slave ship ever to sail from Providence, but did not yield much profit. No other slave ships sailed from the town until 1749, and the Brown family remained out of the trade until 1759. The remainder of James Brown's business was extremely successful. Upon his death, he left a considerable fortune to his sons, who followed him in business under the tutelage of their uncle Obadiah Brown (1712-1762). James II married Hope Power (1702-1792), daughter of Nicholas, in 1723. They had six children. Mary (1731-1795), the one daughter, married Dr. David Vanderlight. James III (1724-1750), the eldest son, was a sea captain who died young. The other four were Nicholas (1729-1791), Joseph (1733-1785), John (1736-1803) and Moses (1738-1836).

Several stones on the north facade are carved with the initials of local citizens and probable assistants of Jeremiah Brown, Sr. in the construction of his house, including that of the probable stonemason, Morris Reese. The north facade of the stone portion features 12/12 sash windows in the eastern bays and a door with a transom in the west bay. Beneath the windows are cellar windows with segmental brick arches. The second floor windows are replacement 1/1 sash. The first and second stories were originally separated by a pent roof, whose supporting joist sockets are still visible. The east gable end holds two small square attic windows flanking the interior brick chimney. The south facade holds replacement 1/1 sash windows on the second floor, and a single window in the east bay. The two western bays are covered by an enclosed frame porch. Some of the interior woodwork, particularly the staircase, dates from 1757. The rest of the woodwork dates from the Federal period when the fireplaces on the east wall were rebuilt. A two-story, two-bay frame west wing was built in 1904 with materials salvaged from the original 1702 log house built on this site. To the west of the house is a small 19th century bank barn.\n\nApproximately 1000 feet southeast of the house are the stone foundations of the 1734 Brown Water Corn and Gristmill. A reconstruction of the original mill has been built on top of these foundations. Portions of the original mill race remain. Due north of the mill are the foundations of an 18th century saw mill.\n\nSignificance: The Jeremiah Brown House is architecturally significant as a firmly dated, unrestored survivor of the distinctive Pennsylvania Quaker building tradition brought to Maryland in the Colonial period. The remains of pent roofs and a second-story door are two distinctive features of this tradition.\n\nThe most unusual feature, however, is the set of local initials carved into the stonework of the 1757 half of the house; very few buildings in Cecil County offer as much insight into the building process. The house also contains a wealth of original woodwork as well as woodwork from the Federal period.\n\nHistorically, the house is important as having been built by one of the original settlers of the Nottingham Lots laid out in 1701 by William Penn. Jeremiah Brown was also responsible for the important 18th century mills, foundations of which are still on the property. Together with the Jeremiah Brown House, they comprise a significant commercial complex from the Colonial era."}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Brown-82990", "page_content": "Elisha John Brown Jr.\n\n20 Jul 1823 in Hawkins, Tennessee, United States Bornin\n\nDescendants\n\n8 Nov 1875 at age 52 in Webster, Missouri, United States Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 15 Jan 2023 | Created 27 Nov 2018\n\nThis page has been accessed 119 times.\n\nBiography\n\nElisha John Brown was a son of Elisha John Brown and Martha Standley.

Sawyer to serve as New Hampshire representative at the Centennial Celebration of George Washington's Inauguration, to be held in Washington, D.C., a logical choice perhaps since Elisha's father was still Superintendent of Government Buildings. But Elisha and Charles were also close friends and associates, serving together on several local boards, and in the early 1900s they combined to underwrite the purchase of 4 acres of land on or near Dover Point Road that preserved the site of Dover's early meeting hall and church, and in turn conveyed the property to the First Parish Church, an area which, in the present day, is the subject of an ongoing architectural dig (recently described in one of Dover 400th Committee's online presentations).\n\nElisha became owner of 50 Silver St. by virtue of marrying Fannie, the youngest daughter of Dr. Alphonso Bickford, a local physician, who also served as Dover's Mayor in 1861-62, the start of the Civil War and a time of military recruitments and political uncertainty. Bickford died in 1869, Elisha and Fannie married the following year, and Elisha, still a lowly clerk at the National Bank, and his bride moved in with her now widowed mother. She died in 1896. Elisha and Fannie stayed and created the elegant home described in the earlier article.\n\nElisha's oldest son was Alphonso, who after graduating from Harvard Medical School, opened a practice in Newburyport. But he had interests other than medicine because in 1894 he was a member of the Frederick Cook Arctic expedition off the coast of Greenland, which ended with the scuttling of the expedition ship, the Miranda, and the successful recovery of the crew and passengers by another vessel.\n\nThis may explain Elisha's interest in the National Geographic Society. Although he managed to survive this experience he did not survive a later appendectomy, passing away following surgery in 1906 at age 34. His widow, Edith (who happened to be the daughter of a Mayor of Newburyport), and their daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1903, moved to Dover and resided at 45 Silver, one side of a double house, across the street from Elisha.\n\nElisha's second son, Harold, joined him at Strafford Savings after college and he and his family lived next door to Elisha at 38 Silver, the house with the window in the brick chimney. Upon Elisha's death in 1922, Harold, who by now had followed Elisha in becoming president of the bank, his wife and daughter moved into 50 Silver St. Then Harold's wife died in 1926 and after a suitable passage of time, he married Edith, his brother's widow, and she and Elizabeth moved to 50 Silver, too. At some point, Elizabeth married G. Allen Huggins who was employed as a \"clerk\" at the Savings Bank, and for several years they took over the space at 45 Silver. In 1934, Harold and Edith sold 50 Silver to Roy B. Ireland and they moved to the other side of the double house, being 43 Silver. (Are you still with me here?) By 1936, Allen (now Assistant Treasurer at the bank) and Elizabeth Huggins had purchased Back River Farm, the former Emerson Farm at the end of Bay View Road (that was featured in an earlier article about Dover's National Historic Register properties), and by way of maintaining the family tradition, their son was named Elisha.\n\nAnd then there was Philip, one of Elisha's twins. He had married Marguerite, daughter of Frank B. Williams, who lived at 103 Silver, who was the head of I.B. Williams (the \"I.B.\" was for Isaac Bartlett, by the way, Frank's father). Philip, who became an executive in the family business, and Marguerite made their residence across the street at 98 Silver. And by odd happenstance, Marguerite's sister, Dorothy Williams, married a young man whose family lived on Rutland Street, and his last name was\u2026Brown. Dorothy and Leroy moved next door to her parents at 107 Silver. (Many years later Dorothy, then a widow, moved back to the original family home at 103.)\n\nThe surname of Brown was very popular in Dover in the early part of the century. For example, there were 20 or more entries for Brown in the City Directory of 1924. Elisha and his offspring seemed to dominate Silver Street, but there were others, unrelated, who were close by. There was Arthur Brown, the proprietor of Newman's Pharmacy at the beginning of the street at Tuttle Square; he lived for a time at 55. George W. Brown was the owner of 43-45, and lived in one side of the house, listed as \"retired\". (He may have been related, but I couldn't find the connection.) Ernest B. Brown was identified as a \"salesman, Nashua\", and resided at No. 60 with two children, Philip R. and Viola H., both \"students,\" which might include all the way up to college graduation. All of these Browns within four blocks.\n\nJust as a footnote: When Harold Brown moved next door to his parent's home, he sold No. 38 which became known as the Dover Convalescent Home, operated by Rhonda Comiskey. Numbers 43-45 (which has special historical significance as one of the oldest houses in Dover, built in 1781) was the site of the Dame Tibbetts Tavern. According to a description from the Dover Library, \"Daniel Webster was among the tavern's regular clientele when he was in Dover presiding over the court.\" This later became the law office of Gregoire, Calivas, Morrison and Indorf, now of Atty. Thomas Torr.\n\nNumber 50 remained in the Ireland family well into the current century. Roy Ireland, who purchased the property from Harold Brown, was owner of a local shoe manufacturer, but consistent with the \"bank\" connections of the former owners, Ireland also was president of Dover's Merchants National Bank.\n\nNumber 103, the Williams family homestead is now the Silver Street Inn: Dorothy Brown died in 1977, age 85. Number 98, the home of Philip and Marguerite Brown (she died in 1981, age 97), is now the residence of City Councilor and Mrs. Dennis Ciotti.\n\nAnd one final note: in my list of spiffy vehicles registered in Dover in 1912, Frank B. Williams appears as an owner of a 38.4 h.p. Pierce Arrow. Several years prior, Pierce Arrow had been chosen by President Taft as the official White House vehicle, so this was a clear symbol of a successful man.\n\nTony McManus is a Dover native.

John Lawrence Esq. in the chair when the following resolves were unanimously agreed to: Resolved. That it is our first wish to live in unison with Great Britain, agreeable to the principles of the Constitution; that we consider the unnatural civil war which we are about to be forced into, with anxiety and distress but that we are determined to oppose the novel claim of the Parliament of Great Britain to raise a revenue in America and risk every possible consequence rather than to submit to it. Resolved. That it appears to this meeting that there are a sufficient number of arms for the people. Resolved. That a sum of money be now raised to purchase what further quantity of Powder and Ball may be necessary; and it is recommended that every man capable of bearing arms enter into Companies to train, and be prepared to march at a minutes warning; and it is further recommended to the people that they do not waste their powder in fowling and hunting. A subscription was opened and one hundred and sixty pounds instantly paid into the hands of a person appointed for that purpose. The officers of four companies were then chosen and the meeting broke up in perfect unanimity. Elisha Lawrence, Clerk [7]\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Ronald V. Jackson.

This couple had eleven children: Aaron Welborn Mashburn Saville C. Mashburn Melville Monroe Mashburn John Henry Mashburn Sarah Agnes Mashburn Noah Strong Mashburn Martha Jane \"Mattie\" Mashburn/Chambers Warren Edward Mashburn Frederick Jackson Mashburn Oliver/Olin Mashburn Clarke Mashburn.\n\nPrivate CSA. Wounded March 10, 1862 and captured at Baker's Creek, Mississippi.\n\nBio written by Grave Whisperer on Jan 8 2015:\n\nElisha J Mashburn, Jr. was the son of Elisha Mashburn Sr and his wife whose name has not yet been confirmed. He did not marry Joicy Twiggs until 1821 in Burke County, NC. There was a first wife, whom apparently died after Elisha, Jr was born in 1815. Elisha Jr. was born about 1815 in what was probably Burke County, North Carolina. Elisha Jr. is found as late as the 1880 census for Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nThe Atlanta City Directory lists Sarah A Mashburn as a widow in 1888, 1890, and 1893. Elisha is listed in the 1878, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 1886 directories in Atlanta. So, based on these directories, between 1886 and 1888, Elisha died in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1839 the family removed from Burke County, NC and lived in Forsyth County, Georgia. We know this because Elisha married Sarah Ann Welborn on December 8, 1839 in Forsyth County. His brother, Reverend John Harvey Mashburn performed the wedding.\n\nE J Mashburn is found in the 1840 census for Forsyth County Georgia where Elisha is the one male between 20-30 and Sarah is the female between 15-20 years old.\n\nIn 1850 they were still in Forsyth County in August. Elisha was a carpenter at 35 years old. Sarah was keeping house at 25 years old. They had Aaron Welborn 8, Saville C 7, Melvin 5 and John H 2 years old.\n\nIn 1860 the family is listed in Decatur, DeKalb County, Georgia in June. Elisha was still a carpenter at the age of 65. Sarah was 55, Mattie J was 19, Warren Edward was 17, Frederick was 15, Oliver was 14, and Clarkie was 11. By this time, many of the older children were married with families of their own.
