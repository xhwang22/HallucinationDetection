The band claims straight edge on searing numbers like \"Count Me Out\" and \"Wasted on the Young,\" but they don't demand any particular lifestyle of their fans -- to the contrary, their overall message is one of unity and acceptance for people from all walks of life. Bane will treat ticket buyers to their intense live show on their latest tour, tearing through their epic sets with ferocity and passion to spare.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND SNAPSHOT:\n\n\n\nBane was formed in Massachusetts in 1995, recording their first demos that same year and following up with their debut EP a year later. Another EP and extensive touring followed, leading up to their 1999 full-length debut It All Comes Down to This. The album was a hit with critics, landing the band on tour with hardcore rockers Death By Stereo. Bane's intense live sets on the road further boosted their reputation, paving the way for more touring in support of 2001's Give Blood and 2005's The Note. Following the release of 2014's highly anticipated Don't Wait Up, the band will hit the road for another series of electrifying dates."}, {"url": "https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/best-bane-quotes-the-dark-knight-rises/", "page_content": "Bane Quotes \u2022 Raiding the Stock Exchange\n\nThis Bane quote is an absolute favorite of mine.

Why does Bane wear the mask?\n\nAccording to the director of The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan:\n\nBane is someone ravaged by pain from a trauma suffered long ago, and the mask dispenses a type of anesthetic that keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function. He was injured early in his story. He's suffering from pain, and he needs gas to survive. He cannot survive the pain without the mask. The pipes from the mask go back along his jawline and feed into the thing at the back where there are two canisters of whatever it is\u2026the anesthetic.\n\nHowever, according to DC Comics, Bane wears the mask because he has to be dosed with a supply of a drug called \"venom\".\n\n2. How does Bane become Bane?\n\nAccording to DC Comics, this is Bane's history that describes how he became a villain:\n\nBorn in a prison on a remote Caribbean island, Bane was raised without pity or compassion. As an adult, he served as a test subject for the super-steroid called Venom. Superhumanly strong, Bane escaped his hell and headed to Gotham City\u2014where he chose to make his mark by defeating the Batman. Though he succeeded, their initial battle was far from their last. Since then, Bane has repeatedly tried to amass not only power, but territory, whether it's Gotham City or his home of Santa Prisca. Often at war with his personal dependence on the super-serum that gives him his strength, Bane will never stop fighting to prove he deserves to rule.\n\n3. What does Bane sound like?\n\nThere are many jokes about how Bane sounds like. In the film, this character is played by Tom Hardy, but he does not just sound like Tom.\n\nAccording to critics (information obtained from indiewire.com), this is what Bane from The Dark Knight Rises sounds like:\n\n\u2026Vincent Price talking through a window fan. (Nick Pinkerton, Village Voice)\n\n\u2026somewhere between Yoda post-testosterone patch and Sean Connery on appletinis.

What is the story of The Dark Knight Rises?\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 film set eight years after The Joker's reign of anarchy. The film follows the protagonists (Batman and Catwoman) who join forces to save Gotham City from Bane, a terrorist.\n\nBane defeats Batman in combat and proceeds to manipulate the citizens of Gotham City until Batman's recovery and return to save the city.\n\nTom Hardy plays Bane. Other prominent stars in the film include Christian Bale, who plays Batman, and Anne Hathaway, who portrays Catwoman.\n\nThe film's writers are Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan. The latter directed the film.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises has been nominated for one BAFTA Film Award (2013) under the Best Special Visual Effects category. The film has also won 38 awards and it has 101 nominations.\n\nBane quotes remind fans of The Dark Knight Rises of how the villain terrorized the citizens of Gotham City and also of how his past shaped him. The quotes are a true reflection of who the villain is and what inspires him.\n\nSource: Legit.ng"}, {"url": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/security-crime-science/news/2019/nov/research-ucl-crime-scientists-drill-music-shows-positive-lyrics-are-more-popular", "page_content": "UCL crime scientists have found that positive lyrics in 'drill music' - a type of hip hop - are more popular than negative ones and attract more views and comments on YouTube.\n\nDrill music with positive lyrics is more popular than negative songs. That's the main finding of a piece of research by Dr Bennett Kleinberg and Dr Paul McFarlane, both based in UCL Security and Crime Science. New Scientist magazine picked up the story this week in their technology section, and interviewed both researchers. Drill music is a form of hip hop known for its gritty lyrics, and in 2018 Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick linked it to an increase in gang violence.

The so-called \u201cposi-core\u201d scene has plenty of fantastic bands to brighten your day and lift your mood when the world\u2019s got you down and you need some words of encouragement.\n\nTake a look below for 20 hardcore bands to uplift your spirits.\n\nH2O\n\n\u201990s New York punk crew H2O bring a kicked-up energy while laying down lyrics about friends supporting each other, their local scene and unity above all. The band are a light for even the darkest of times to remember that people can have each other\u2019s back.\n\n7 Seconds\n\nHardcore punk pioneers 7 Seconds had a massive influence in injecting some positivity into punk, particularly at a time when so much of the scene was focused on politics given the state of the U.S. in the \u201980s. If you want positive lyricism layered on classic skate-punk sounds, these are the guys to check out.\n\nYouth Of Today\n\nWith a penchant for pushing straight edge and vegetarianism, Youth Of Today bring uplifting vibes along with an agenda for furthering discussions that branch outside of music. The band were a driving force in combating negativity in the scene while keeping the music as aggressive as some of the hardest bands of the early \u201980s.\n\nGood Clean Fun\n\nWashington, D.C. hardcore crew Good Clean Fun owe a lot to Descendents (most of all their name), and the uplifting energy of the coffee-chugging pop-punk pioneers shines through in their music. Their sound may be a touch harder than their influences, but their promotion of feminism, straight-edge culture, veganism and optimistic attitudes is what fans took away above all.\n\nComeback Kid\n\nCanadian melodic hardcore vets Comeback Kid have been a staple of the scene up north for years, and their message of overcoming adversity is exactly what people need in dark times. Their music is filled with catchy hooks and sing-along choruses built for crowds to band together for a unifying message of hopefulness.\n\nHave Heart\n\nHave Heart saw a colossal resurgence in popularity through their reunion shows last year, and there\u2019s a good reason why. The straight-edge crew were a massive source of positivity and hope for so many people in their heyday and are often cited as one of the best positive hardcore bands of the 2000s.\n\nUplift\n\nDisbanded Toronto posi-core crew Uplift were only around for a short while, but their music still holds up good values worth revisiting in times of hardship. Their sound is heavy and captivating to boot, but their positive vibes shine above all in their music.\n\nWith Honor\n\nWith Honor are homing in the posi-core scene\u2019s energy that has been somewhat lost in the past decade or two through their old-school hardcore energy and powerful lyrics. Their sound is modern while rooted in their predecessors, bringing together multiple eras for a positive message.\n\nDown To Nothing\n\nSharing members of Terror and Trapped Under Ice, Down To Nothing bring a hard-hitting sound, but their lyrics are a motivating force with a message to carry on in spite of adversity. The straight-edge band bring their morals out in their message while keeping a grounded level of addressing societal issues with a positive counterpoint.\n\nStretch Arm Strong\n\nMelodic hardcore act Stretch Arm Strong were champions of bringing positivity into the hardcore scene throughout the \u201990s and early 2000s. Their lyrics deal with the lives and hardships rooted in the community while offering fun and lighthearted words of wisdom.\n\nFinal Fight\n\nIn a similar vein to bands such as Comeback Kid, Rise Against or Thrice, Final Fight draw out melodic hardcore punk with a hopeful vibe. Their punchy sounds are coupled with inspiring lyrics about persevering through darkness.\n\nGorilla Biscuits\n\nHardcore punk vets Gorilla Biscuits have been a longstanding force of positivity in hardcore and are considered leaders of the posi-core movement. Looking back at any of the lyrics across their discography (particularly Start Today), the band are introspective about seeing problems in the world and offer a relatable message of pushing through no matter what.\n\nMindset\n\nStraight-edge crew Mindset give a ton of praise to Youth Of Today, and it\u2019s evident in their push for taking hardcore fans\u2019 anger and distilling it down to the collective mindset so many DIY bands have by working together. Their lyrics push for sticking tight with your crew and looking out for each other, which is something we all need sometimes.\n\nSet It Straight\n\nWhile they were short lived, Set It Straight are a quintessential band to boost your mood when you\u2019re looking for forward-thinking hardcore. Their melodically tinged instrumentals are brought together with lyrics that tear down all of the crappy things the working class faces on a daily basis.\n\nIn My Eyes\n\nIn My Eyes were a part of the \u201990s youth crew revival movement, with that scene primarily looking to the stick-tight moto promoted heavily by the previous decade\u2019s group of acts focusing on banding together. Their straight-edge values and morals inform their messaging by setting an example of not giving into pressures and standing together through hardship.\n\nFastbreak\n\nFastbreak started off when they were just teenagers, and that youthful sense of hope in the world is still a message worth revisiting. The band are cognizant of the world\u2019s problems but look for hope in the future, and although the lyrics coming from today\u2019s scene is a stark contrast, they\u2019re able to dig into an emotional side while sparking hope.\n\nRead more: Top 20 rising hardcore bands you need to hear right now\n\nOne Step Closer\n\nNewcomers One Step Closer are a bright force with a hard-hitting yet melodic downbeat hardcore style, driving home that anger isn\u2019t everything, and we can prevail through tough circumstances. Their sound reaches back to the mid-2000s melodic hardcore scene, with inspiration from bands such as Have Heart or Comeback Kid.\n\nChain Of Strength\n\nChain Of Strength are one of the most prominent straight-edge bands from the early days of the scene, and their heavy-and-fast approach to songwriting is worth revisiting. The band pushed for an understanding that hardcore music is much more than music for many of the people involved, and it informs their daily interactions, values, morals and what gives them hope.\n\nJudge\n\nThe members of Judge have been so deeply ingrained in the hardcore scene since the \u201980s that it\u2019d be surprising if you haven\u2019t heard of them or at least one band they\u2019re attached to. The New York act drew from metal as much as they did punk, giving them a heavier sound than many of their peers at the time while still driving home that personal perseverance is something to believe in.\n\nSide By Side\n\nSharing several members of Gorilla Biscuits, Side By Side are an obvious choice for people looking for positive energy in hardcore music. With the band\u2019s name promoting their message, they push for unity and working together for a better life in their lyrics while tossing out the notion that we\u2019re alone in this world."}, {"url": "https://www.maniacsonline.com.au/news/15-most-intense-live-bands-208971", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nPhotos (left to right) - (The Dillinger Escape Plan) Chelsea Laurence / (Behemoth) Francesco Prandoni / (Slipknot) J. Shearer - Getty Images\n\nMost of the time, an artist's recorded music is only one half of the puzzle - and there's no better feeling than finding out that your favourite band also happen to put on an insane live show to boot, then catching it for yourself.\n\nOver the years, some artists have used the concert as a means of pushing physical and creative boundaries that have resulted in some of the most intense experiences to witness. Some are euphoric and some are downright terrifying, but they all evoke their own powerful energy that is hard to find anywhere else.\n\nIn no particular order, these are 15 of some the most intense bands to have ever taken the stage!\n\nSlipknot\n\nWhen you get nine guys in masks going berserk on stage simultaneously while playing equally chaotic music, you've got a recipe for some of the most intense concerts out there.\n\nOver the years we've seen Slipknot members fight each other on stage, catch fire, trash gear, a giant rotating drum platform carrying Joey Jordison and way more.\n\nThat same vehement energy always spills into the crowd, who give it right back in a venue-sized surge of adrenaline. There's no doubt that a massive part of Slipknot's enormous success comes from their live show spectacle, and if you haven't watched their Disasterpieces live DVD, that should definitely be on your list!\n\nSunn O)))\n\nSunn O))) use a different kind of intensity to punish audiences, using colossal walls of noise, feedback and slow rumbling guitars to create an oppressive atmosphere which is an experience to endure on its own.\n\nThe band perform in black robes live, fill venues with fog and play at extremely high volumes for over an hour at a time; those who have witnessed Sunn O))) in person will often claim that there's nothing else like it.\n\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan\n\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan might be the very definition of a band that just doesn't give a fuck, and while they're sadly no longer together anymore, their live shows have become the stuff of legend.\n\nWe'll never forget when vocalist Greg Puciato pulled a GG Allin by defecating into a bag during their televised Reading Festival set, throwing it into the crowd only to have the crowd throw it right back at him and smear himself with it.\n\nOr the time they played live at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards, setting fire to their gear and bleeding in front of a bewildered audience. Even Deftones vocalist Chino Moreno, who briefly joined them onstage as a guest vocalist, quickly made his exit with a concerned expression once Greg Puciato started fire breathing.\n\nThere are so many videos out there showcasing Dillinger's insane gigs, but we decided to go with the classic clip of their 2005 performance inside a Virgin Megastore, where Puciato immediately breaks all hell loose by launching himself onto the heads of the audience. Seriously - how does a band play such technical music while going so crazy?\n\nHanatarash\n\nThis one goes back a little further in time and a little deeper underground, but Japanese noise band Hanatarash put on some dangerous shows during the 1980s that have gone down as some of the most infamous in live music.\n\nThe band's vocalist Yamantaka Eye (also vocalist of Boredoms) was known to have carried out some pretty wild acts including cutting a dead cat in half with a machete (yikes), strapping a circular saw to his back and infamously ramming a bulldozer through the venue's walls.\n\nThere was one show in 1985 in Tokyo which required audience members to fill out a waiver before entering, and it was stopped early due to Eye lighting a molotov cocktail to throw on stage.\n\nSure, it's more performance art than music per se, but the lack of footage and concrete info around Hanatarash has added to their infamy over the years.\n\nWatain\n\nSwedish band Watain complete their evil black metal trimmings with a live show that incorporates a plethora of Satanic symbolism, ritualistic fire and theatrical costumes that invoke a terrifying atmosphere around them.\n\nAt one infamous Brooklyn show in 2014 (and their only US show for that year), Watain covered their audience in pig's blood which caused a few members to vomit from the stench.\n\nTheir scheduled 2019 concert in Singapore was also canceled by authorities before it could take place because it would \"affect their religious and social harmony\", so they're definitely achieving what they set out to do!\n\nGG Allin and The Murder Junkies\n\nYes, GG Allin was a bad human who did some deplorable things throughout his life. And yes, his shows have become infamous for being some of the most dangerous and extreme that have ever taken place.\n\nPerforming naked, defecating, self-harm, assaulting audience members and threats of suicide were a standard affair at GG's gigs which frequently landed him behind bars or in hospital.\n\nHis stint with The Murder Junkies became his most notorious, as fans would flock to see what acts of depravity they would end up witnessing in person.\n\nRammstein\n\nWhat can be said about Rammstein's spectacle of a live show that you don't already know? The gods of hellfire pack some of the most (if not the most) insane pyro, rigging and props you'll get at a rock concert, turning into something you'd expect to see in a Mad Max film.\n\nFlamethrowers on guitars? Check. Till Lindemann floating with giant metallic wings that shoot fire? Check. Giant dick props that spray the crowd with white foam? Check.\n\nThere are just too many crazy things to mention here, and it can take up to an entire week just to set a Rammstein stage up!\n\nIt's a performance that blows minds from the front row to the nosebleeds, and they are definitely worthy of nabbing a spot on this list.\n\nMayhem\n\nMayhem are arguably the most legendary band in black metal with a controversial history of their own, and some of that notoriety stemmed from their intense live shows over the years that involved impaling animal heads on spikes at the front of the stage and self-multilation.\n\nWhile more recent Mayhem shows have pulled back a little bit on that front, their well-documented and sinister history of church burnings and murder still lends itself to a frightening atmosphere whenever they take the stage.\n\nThe Chariot\n\nMuch like The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Chariot were known for putting on some of the most chaotic performances one could experience. That chaos often manifested in smaller venues, which made for some unforgettable moments over the years.\n\nThe official video for the song 'Teach' above does a pretty good job of capturing the essence of a Chariot show, showing instruments being thrown up in the air, a plethora of stagediving fans, dismantling of drum kits mid-performance and more.\n\nTheir Perth show during their 2011 Australian tour was stopped early after a bowl of pears was accidentally smashed at the venue, prompting them to take the festivities to a fan's house instead!\n\nThe Chariot broke up in 2013, but vocalist Josh Scogin is now one half of '68, while guitarist Stephen Harrison plays in Fever 333 - both of which are explosive live bands in their own right.\n\nGWAR\n\nIf you ever find yourself at a GWAR concert, you're not going to leave in the same state you entered. If not mentally, at least physically; the costumed intergalactic barbarians put on a visceral stage show that almost always involves spraying the audience with tons of fake blood, urine and semen.\n\nGWAR have also known to bring out \"celebrities\" on stage to mutilate, including the likes of Tony Abbott (during Soundwave 2014), Jerry Springer, OJ Simpson, Michael Jackson, Osama Bin Laden and countless other political/social figures.\n\nNot only do you get to witness and become a part of many offensive, yet tongue-in-cheek acts of violence, but you get a pulse-raising dose of killer punk, power metal and thrash metal at the same time!\n\nBatushka\n\nEverything about Batushka's live concerts oozes mystery and evil, feeling like a Satanic ritual with occultic black metal as the backing track for it all.\n\nUnknown (until recently) robed members use candles, censers, skulls and more to carry out foreboding ceremonies during the show. What's more is that all of their lyrics are written in the Old Church Slavonic language, which makes everything feel that much more authentic.\n\nBatushka recently split into two different versions of itself following a dispute between key members, but that rabbit hole is probably best left for you to explore here.\n\nIron Maiden\n\nIron Maiden probably don't have much in the way of financial or resource constraints when it comes to hatching their elaborate stage shows, and they've created some of the most insane concert experiences over the years as a result.\n\nEven their latest (and ongoing) Legacy Of The Beast tour has featured a massive, 90% scale replica of a WWII Spitfighter plane hovering above the stage, sword fighting, Bruce Dickinson shooting fire from his arms, the venue turning into a church and more.\n\nIt's just crazy that these guys are in their 60's and still pulling off shows far more physically-demanding than bands half their age, and there's nothing else like it.\n\nBehemoth\n\nBehemoth know how to put on a brutal and diabolical display for fans - a costumed Nergal standing at his signature microphone stand while staring down his audience, Inferno's planet-shaking drum work and a sinister stage presence are enough to send chills down the spine of anyone in attendance.\n\nThe band also frequently use creepy audio of things like children chanting before they take the stage, which sets a palpable mood in whatever venue they find themselves at.\n\nCode Orange\n\nIt's been interesting to watch Code Orange go from playing modest venues years ago to arenas now, where they've opened for the likes of System Of A Down and Deftones, but their frantic energy on stage has always been a part of their ethos, resulting in some explosive performances from every member.\n\nCode Orange were actually one of the first bands to stream a live show once lockdown hit, and their intensity was still felt through our screens even though they were playing to an empty venue.\n\nWith primary vocalist Jami Morgan now stepping out from behind the drum kit to focus solely on vocals, and the addition of a new touring drummer, there's now the potential for an even more chaotic stage presence. We'll have to wait and see once concerts are back!\n\nMarilyn Manson\n\nYou just can't do a list like this without giving the god of shock rock his spotlight! During Manson's peak of notoriety at the turn of the millennium, there was no telling what you'd get if you attended one of his controversial shows.\n\nLet's see - there was that time Marilyn was arrested for grabbing a security guard's head and gyrating against it, assaults on his own bandmates and the generally unhinged behaviour that would make fans go bananas.\n\nIn 2003, Marilyn Manson ended his Kansas City set after the barricades in front of the stage were broken by rowdy fans, who ended up rushing the stage and throwing bottles at cops after it was shut down.\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nGorgoroth\n\nNine Inch Nails\n\nDaughters\n\nWhich is the most intense band you've ever seen live? We love hearing your stories about live music while we wait for it all to return post-pandemic!"}, {"url": "https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/10-famous-musicians-kicked-original-bands/", "page_content": "Regret is one of the strongest feelings a human being can have. It may come from wishing you hadn\u2019t done something, or from a missed opportunity, but any way you experience it, it\u2019s unpleasant, and sometimes it leads to rockers getting kicked out of their bands.\n\nIn the world of music, regret can come from a number of things, such as not recording that idea you had that was surely going to be a big hit, or even more heartbreaking: kicking out a member of your band who went on to become really famous.\n\nWe thought we\u2019d take a look at some tales of talented musos who got kicked from big-name bands, only to carry on with very successful careers on their own terms.\n\nNick Oliveri\n\nNick Oliveri has been a staple of the stoner-rock scene for decades now, having appeared in bands such as Kyuss, Dwarves, and Vista Chino, but it was with Queens Of The Stone Age that he gained the majority of his fame. Having joined former Kyuss bandmate Josh Homme in Queens Of The Stone Age soon after its inception, Oliveri would go on to perform with the group for a further six years, appearing on the legendary records Rated R, and Songs For The Deaf. However, due to some animosity between the two of them, Oliveri was kicked out of Queens Of The Stone Age, much to the dismay of fans.\n\nHowever, this new freedom allowed Oliveri a lot of opportunities, namely the ability to cultivate his solo career, and to go back to his group Mondo Generator, that he had intitally formed during the wake of Kyuss\u2019 dissolution. With a slew of solo records under his belt now, and a few more forays into the world of Queens Of The Stone Age, Oliveri has gone on to become one of the most underrated musicians in the stoner-rock genre.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nLet\u2019s be fair, Jimi Hendrix needs absolutely no introduction. As a legendary musician, his legacy and influence precedes him in a way that most musicians dream of. However, in the year\u2019s before his famous career with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix made a name for himself with some of the 1960\u2019s famous musicians. Originally performing with they Isley Brothers and playing guitar on their single \u2018Testify\u2019, Hendrix left the group after being tired of playing the same music every night.\n\nSoon after, he joined the backing band for Little Richard, The Upsetters. After a short period in the band, Richard grew tired with Hendrix\u2019s lateness, his onstage antics, and his flamboyant wardrobe, and enlisted his brother to fire Hendrix from the group. Let\u2019s be fair though, it was probably for the best, because if it wasn\u2019t for his overtly wild fashion choices, we wouldn\u2019t have the brilliance of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and aspiring musicians all over the world would be left with nothing to play as they test out their new guitars.\n\nLove Classic Rock?

Forming in the late 1950\u2019s, The Teen Kings saw a lot of success in their native Texas, and even received a suggestion from Johnny Cash to approach Sun Records, Elvis Presley\u2019s record label, in hopes of recording with them. After a few years, Orbison was reportedly kicked from the band and the group dissolved soon after.\n\nHowever, luck was on Orbison\u2019s side and he found himself recording \u2018Uptown\u2019 his first single, which was released at a time when a lot of music\u2019s big stars were out of the scene, such as Elvis, who was in the army at the time. This allowed to Orbison to get his foot in the door, and soon after, he released tracks such as \u2018Only The Lonely\u2019 which saw people sit up and listen to the amazing voice that he possessed. Orbison went on to release countless singles in the following months and years and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nBlack Sabbath are one of the seminal bands in the heavy metal genre. In fact, countless bands and academics state that if it wasn\u2019t for Black Sabbath, we wouldn\u2019t have the heavy metal genre as we do today. Forming in 1968, the group quickly made a name for themselves thanks to their dark sound, and the exceptional vocals of frontman Ozzy Osbourne. However, following the release of their eighth album, Never Say Die!, the group were forced to have Osbourne kicked out due to his excessive consumption of alcohol and drugs, and the group\u2019s inability to perform due to this.\n\nOzzy however, proved resilient and managed to control his drug consumption to a level where he was able to perform without difficulty. Osbourne embarked on a solo career which saw him reach levels of fame that rivalled the success he saw with Black Sabbath. With singles such as \u2018Crazy Train\u2019, \u2018Mr. Crowley\u2019, and \u2018Bark At The Moon\u2019, Osbourne would go on to cement himself as one of the greatest rock musicians of all time. 2011 did see Osbourne reunite with Black Sabbath, and they would go on to release one final album before breaking up in early 2017.\n\nNeal Schon\n\nAt first glance, the name Neal Schon might not mean much to you, but his resum\u00e9 is enough to make any rock fan stand to attention. Schon first gained fame in the early 1970\u2019s as a member of the group Santana. Lead by legendary guitarist Carlos Santana, Schon provided rhythm guitar for a couple of albums, and performed on hits such as \u2018Everybody\u2019s Everything\u2019 and \u2018No One To Depend On\u2019, all while at the tender age of 17. Schon was soon kicked out and would go on to form a group which was intended to serve as a backing group for a number of famous San Francisco musicians.\n\nSoon after forming, the group abandoned this idea and focused on more of a jazz-fusion sound. It was also around this time that the group decided to settle on the name Journey. After a few years of relative popularity, the group recruited Steve Perry as their lead singer, and would then go on to record such legendary rock tracks such as \u2018Lovin\u2019, Touchin\u2019, Squeezin\u201d, \u2018Any Way You Want It\u2019, and \u2018Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d, rightfully placing them among the ranks of \u2018legendary rock group\u2019.\n\nLemmy\n\nIan Kilmister, better known as Lemmy to legions of adoring fans, was the bassist and frontman for heavy metal group Mot\u00f6rhead. One of the most prominent members of the English heavy metal scene, Mot\u00f6rhead are legendary for their intense live shows and crushing albums, but their origins lie within the space-rock group Hawkwind.\n\nLemmy, who was Hawkwind\u2019s bass player in the early 1970s, had a reputation for being a big party animal with an appetite for drugs. During the group\u2019s North American tour in 1975, the group were stopped at the Canadian border after they found amphetamine in Lemmy\u2019s possession. Mistaking it for cocaine, they jailed the rocker, which forced the group to cancel a number of their shows. Having become tired of his behaviour, the group decided to have Lemmy kicked out, who quickly formed the group Mot\u00f6rhead, which he named after the last song he had written for Hawkwind.\n\nDave Mustaine\n\nOne of the most famous musicians to fall into this category, Dave Mustaine is one talented son of a gun. Having served as one of the founding members of Metallica, Mustaine was ejected from Metallica prior to the recording of their debut album Kill \u2018Em All due to his excessive consumption of drugs and alcohol. To replace him, they brought in former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet the very same day. Mustaine is one of the most famously bitter of all these musicians, but able to channel his anger into something very positive, going on to form the group Megadeth shortly after.\n\nTwo years after him being kicked from Metallica, Mustaine\u2019s new group released their debut album, Killing Is My Business\u2026 And Business Is Good!. Comprised of material that Mustaine had initially planned to use with Metallica, the album got the group\u2019s foot in the door, and they would soon go on to release a number of highly influential albums in the genre, such as Peace Sells\u2026 But Who\u2019s Buying?, and Rust In Peace. While Mustaine held great disdain for Metallica for years afterwards, the groups are now on far more amicable terms, and Mustaine no longer attempts to top Metallica with everything he does.\n\nPhil Lynott\n\nPhil Lynott started his career as the founding vocalist of the Irish group Skid Row. Soon after the group\u2019s formation, they introduced the talents of guitarist Gary Moore. However, the group\u2019s bass player Brendan Shiels wanted to shake some things up, and decided to have Phil Lynott kicked out as a way to make the group a power trio, oh, and so that he could take over the role of vocalist.\n\nThe following year, Lynott would go on to form his own band, one which went by the name of Thin Lizzy. Thin Lizzy saw fame soon after forming thanks to the success of their cover of the traditional song \u2018Whiskey In The Jar\u2019. The band\u2019s fame only continued to rise thanks to tracks such as \u2018Jailbreak\u2019, and \u2018The Boys Are Back Again\u2019, making them one of Ireland\u2019s most successful music groups, or at least until U2 decided to get together.\n\nJesse Lacey\n\nJesse Lacey is a name that almost any indie or emo-rock fan would be aware of. Having gained fame as the guitarist and frontman for US band Brand New, Lacey\u2019s lyrics and music have found worldwide audiences thanks to his highly literate, and deeply emotional lyrics. Lacey originally had played in a group called The Rookie Lot back in the late 1990\u2019s, who broke up, leaving Lacey looking for a new band to play with. Joining school friend John Nolan, they joined the group Taking Back Sunday, who had only recently formed.\n\nFollowing the recording of a demo EP, tensions within the group lead to Lacey being given the boot, and again looking for a band to join. Disheartened, he recruited friends from previous bands to come together so they could make music. Soon after, the initial incarnation of Brand New was formed, giving birth to songs that would soon soundtrack breakups around the world.\n\nCourtney Love\n\nCourtney Love is famous for a number things, most notably for being the leader of alternative rock group Hole, for being famously married to Kurt Cobain, and for having a relatively poor film career. Her career in Hole is just as well-known as her relationship with Cobain, but many fans aren\u2019t aware of the bands that she played with prior to Hole. See, in 1982 Love was just your regular music fan, and after going to see an early performance of Faith No More, she convinced the group to let her become the lead singer.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know what her career trajectory would\u2019ve been like in Hole, we do know that she recorded a few tracks with the group before being kicked out, since they needed more \u2018male energy\u2019 within the group, whatever that really means. A few years later, and after playing within a number of different bands, Love formed Hole. After releasing their first record in 1991, the group were put on the back-burner while Love married Cobain, only to release their next album, the landmark Live Through This, a week after Cobain\u2019s death."}, {"url": "https://hearinnh.org/top-new-hard-rock-bands/", "page_content": "Top New Hard Rock Bands 9 min read\n\nReading Time: 7 minutes\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of great hard rock bands out there these days, but here are five of our favourites that you might not have heard of yet.\n\n1.

Long famous for their live shows, which featured blood spitting, fire breathing, guitar smoking (and smashing), and drums elevating, KISS were in dire straits in 1975, having produced three lackluster records for the nearly bankrupt Casablanca Records. This last ditch attempt at fame and fortune paid off massively. Alive! cemented KISS\u2019s reputation as one of the greatest performing acts of the era, and paved the way for future successful albums. It documents the stage antics of the band at the top of their game, and even spawned a successful series of \u201cAlive\u201d albums, the most notable of which is 1977\u2019s Alive II.\n\nIt is most known for its live version of \u201cRock and Roll All Nite,\u201d which became a hit single, as well as for Paul Stanley\u2019s exclamations and introductions which get the crowd riled up on the record and still have an energizing effect on contemporary listeners. Live versions of KISS fan favorites populate the double disc set, and without a weak cut in the package it was eventually named among Rolling Stone\u2019s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."}]}
