He was educated at an endowed school in Alfreton, near Derby. He entered business in Ripley, Derbyshire, but in 1863 was sent to join the Wesleyan Conference of New South Wales and Queensland. After serving on several circuits in New South Wales, in April 1873 he joined the Brisbane circuit, where he quickly made an impact as a forceful and eloquent preacher. He became chairman of the Queensland district, where he was prominent in the formation of a strong loan fund which was to prove important in extending Wesleyan Methodist work in Queensland. He served also in the circuits of Fortitude Valley and Ipswich, and at the Ann Street Church in Brisbane, before a throat infection forced him to retire from the ministry in 1883.\n\nIn 1875, towards the climax of the education controversy in Queensland, Brentnall was instrumental with three other clergymen in establishing the Queensland Evangelical Standard, a journal dedicated to a system of secular education, and thus anti-Catholic in tone. Viewing the 'squatting party' as allies of the Catholics, the Standard adopted a clear political posture, championed the cause of (Sir) Samuel Griffith, a Liberal and son of a Congregational cleric, and poured invective on 'Land Rings and Railway Kings'. Brentnall used his pen with telling effect against the McIlwraith ministry in its handling of the steel rails contract of 1881 and soon afterwards of the land-grant railway proposal.\n\nBrentnall's activity in the business world seems to have been recognized as early as 1881. The Daily Observer, 28 February, openly attacked him in an advertisement: 'Wanted for the Christian Ministry \u2026 Special advantages are now offered to worldly-minded men to join the ranks \u2026 Men of business turn of mind specially eligible for this ministry, and always come to the front. \u201cFervency of spirit\u201d not at all necessary. Shareholders in gold mines, tin mines, newspaper companies, land speculating, and such like heavenly pastures, will always be accepted as specially qualified'. The Standard, smarting under the sarcasm, responded so sharply that its reply led to a libel case. On his retirement from the church Brentnall joined the Telegraph, in which he was a minor shareholder, as a journalist. In 1885 he greatly increased his holdings in the company and became chairman of directors, a position he retained until May 1893, after which he continued to hold a large financial interest. He became increasingly active in business affairs, his directorships included the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society, and the Queensland Trustees (later becoming chairman of directors of both companies), Queensland General Insurance, Finney Isles, Coolgarra Tin Mining, Queensland Exploration and Queensland Copper Freeholds. He speculated widely, sometimes successfully, sometimes disastrously, in Queensland mining ventures. He was one of the earliest settlers and landholders at Coorparoo and sold some of his blocks in the boom year of 1888 as it began to emerge as a prestige suburb. He was a member of the Bulimba Divisional Board and for two years first chairman of the Coorparoo Shire Council, where he acted also as shire clerk in 1888-92. In 1886 he had been nominated to the Legislative Council, where he remained active until it was abolished in 1922; in 1893-1902 he was chairman of committees. His political views had gradually become more conservative since the Standard days, especially after the rise of the Labor Party, of which he was an uncompromising enemy. He vigorously opposed 'advanced' legislation and abolition of the Legislative Council. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (Queensland). He maintained his interest in church life, served on church committees, made settlements on various Methodist institutions, giving them an annual income, and in his will left substantial sums to the Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1867 he married Elizabeth Watson, daughter of a store-keeper in Mansfield, Nottingham. She had left her position as headmistress of a large Wesleyan day school for girls at Bacup, Lancashire, and followed Brentnall to Sydney to marry him. She was the first president of the Queensland Women's Christian Temperance Union, holding office in 1885-99, and then honorary president until her death in 1909. Brentnall died in Brisbane on 11 January 1925, survived by two daughters: Flora, who in 1893 married Edgar Bridal Harris, a shipping agent, and Charlotte Amelia. He left substantial holdings in the Telegraph Newspaper Co. to his family, and his grandson later became chairman of directors."}, {"url": "https://peopleaustralia.anu.edu.au/biography/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this website contains names, images, and voices of deceased persons.\n\nIn addition, some articles contain terms or views that were acceptable within mainstream Australian culture in the period in which they were written, but may no longer be considered appropriate.\n\nThese articles do not necessarily reflect the views of The Australian National University.\n\nOlder articles are being reviewed with a view to bringing them into line with contemporary values but the original text will remain available for historical context."}, {"url": "https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2010/07/familys-fourth-generation-uq", "page_content": "WHEN Joshua Keyes-Liley received his Bachelor of Arts this week, he was the fourth generation of his family to receive a degree from The University of Queensland.\n\nJoshua's UQ connections actually go back six generations, as his great-great-great-grandfather Frederick Thomas Brentnall was a member of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1910 when the University was established, and often spoke on education issues in the House.\n\nJoshua's great-great-grandmother Flora Harris - FT Brentnall's daughter - was a patron and founder of The Women's College.\n\nJosh's parents, grandmothers and one set of great-grandparents all gained UQ degrees.\n\nHis father, Bill Liley, a doctor at Cairns Base Hospital, has three UQ awards: a Bachelor of Physiotherapy (1983), a Diploma of Education Studies - Counselling (2004) and a Bachelor of Medicine/ Bachelor of Surgery (2008).\n\nDr Liley's mother Margaret Liley (n\u00e9e Price) received her UQ Bachelor of Science in 1957, a Diploma of Education in 1978 and a Bachelor of Education Studies in 1985.\n\nJosh's mother Mary Keyes, a Professor of Law at Griffith University, has two UQ degrees: Arts (1988) and Law (1993).\n\nProfessor Keyes' mother Lynette Keyes (n\u00e9e Denmead) gained her BA from UQ in 1959, and then went on to gain a Diploma of Education in 1960 and a Bachelor of Education in 1963.\n\nMrs Keyes' parents - Josh's great-grandparents - Noela Denmead (n\u00e9e Brentnall) and Alan Knox Denmead both had UQ Science degrees, specialising in Geology.\n\nJosh Keyes-Liley, 20, said there had been no family pressure for him to attend UQ, but it was a good choice.\n\n\"It wasn't a given - I just chose UQ,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been enjoyable and stimulating.

Besides the need to substitute wood for gardening and recreational use, the main driver was the need for an economic and fireproof building material. The development of modern cement and steel during the first half of the 19th century made this invention possible.\n\nDuring the 1850s 1860s, two French horticulturalists, Lambot and Monier, started very empirically to build planters and other appliances with cement reinforced with iron or steel mesh. Lambot took a patent in 1855, and Monier a series of patents during the 1860s and later.\n\nIn parallel, people with closer connections with the construction industry started to develop floor systems associating cement with iron or steel beams, in most case with the intention to protect steel from fire: Wilkinson in England, F. Coignet in France, Ward and Hyatt in both the USA and England.\n\nAfter the early works of these pioneers, this invention was widely developed in some countries, in particular in Germany by Freytag, Wayss, and Koenen, in France and Belgium by Hennebique, and in the United States by Ransome.\n\nIn the early days, the construction industry establishment was skeptical about this strange association of cement or concrete and steel, and theoretical approaches started only in 1886 with the works of Koenen. They were followed by those of E. Coignet, Tedesco, Consid\u00e8re, M\u00f6rsch and others.\n\nIt is in the early years of the 20th Century that a theory shared by most scientists and practitioners started to appear, along with the first codes.\n\nThis paper presents this period of invention and early developments of reinforced concrete, with a global view, on the basis of internationally available literature.\n\nKeywords"}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/lifesummary/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this website contains names, images, and voices of deceased persons.\n\nIn addition, some articles contain terms or views that were acceptable within mainstream Australian culture in the period in which they were written, but may no longer be considered appropriate.\n\nThese articles do not necessarily reflect the views of The Australian National University.\n\nOlder articles are being reviewed with a view to bringing them into line with contemporary values but the original text will remain available for historical context."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Frederick-Thomas-Brentnall", "page_content": "Hon.
