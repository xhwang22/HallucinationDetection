Partly, he grew up in southeastern-most Bavaria near Berchtesgaden, for much of that time in an Alpine chalet (Thalerwinkel) where the young Al Fischer was allowed to wander freely in the beautiful surroundings, thereby developing a profound love of nature. Many years later, he still referred in conversations to \u201cmeine beiden alten Tanten in B\u00f6rchtesgaden\u201d that he loved to visit over many decades.\n\nLater, he spent 5 years at high school in Wiesbaden (Hesse). In 1935, after Hitler had taken over Germany, along with his parents he moved at age 15 to his relatives in the USA and attended college in Watertown, Wisconsin. He studied geology at the University of Wisconsin, where he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1939 and a master\u2019s degree in 1940, when he was not yet 20 years old.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943 he worked at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In 1943\u20131944, he was a geologist for Stanolind Oil and Gas in Kansas, and from 1944 to 1946 a geologist in Florida. In 1947, he taught at the University of Rochester and from 1948 at the University of Kansas, where he was an assistant professor. In 1950, he gained a doctorate at Columbia University.\n\nFor 5 years from 1951 to 1956, he was a senior petroleum geologist for Esso in Peru, first in Talara and then in Lima, before becoming assistant professor in 1956 and professor in 1963 at Princeton University (Blair Professor 1970\u20131984). In 1984, he was appointed professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, becoming emeritus professor in 1991. He also spent a year as a visiting professor at Innsbruck University (1962\u20131963), in particular, to interact with Bruno Sander whom he greatly admired, and he also had sabbatical leaves at the University of T\u00fcbingen, the University of Naples (1970), and the Technical University of Berlin (1973).\n\nFollowing his graduation, on August 26, 1939, he married Winnifred \u201cWinnie\u201d Varney, a graduate student in geography, rooted in Southern California, who died in 2010, 100 years old, after having been married to Al for more than 71 years. Al and Winnie are survived by their children Joseph Fred \u201cFritz\u201d (also a petroleum geologist), George William \u201cBill\u201d, and Lenore Ruth Fischer, four grandchildren, and five great grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://www.moma.org/artists/26130", "page_content": "If you would like to reproduce an image of a work of art in MoMA\u2019s collection, or an image of a MoMA publication or archival material (including installation views, checklists, and press releases), please contact Art Resource (publication in North America) or Scala Archives (publication in all other geographic locations).\n\nMoMA licenses archival audio and select out of copyright film clips from our film collection.

After 9 years in a city office he relinquished business for art and studied at Lambeth, South Kensington and Paris under Laurens and Constant.\n\n\n\nOn 29th July 1907 he was chosen by the Visual Instruction Committee to illustrate lecture materials about the Empire for use in British schools. His appointment was for up to three years from 1st September at a salary of \u00a325 a month, plus traveling and subsistence allowance. The Committee reserved to themselves absolute control over the work produced by him during his engagement. It was thought that the scheme would need some 1800 slides, elected from an average of 3 original each. Priority was to be given to Canada, India and South Africa, with Australia and New Zealand, the West Indies, East and West Africa, the Mediterranean and ocean routes as further areas. Fisher would work under the direction of Sir Halford Mackinder, who was to be paid a salary of \u00a3300 for his general oversight of the project, in addition to fees for preparing lectures. As Fisher was an artist and not a photographer, he was trained in photographic techniques by the two senior employees of Emery Walker of Sussex House, at a fee of 5 guineas for 10 lessons.\n\n\n\nThe original aim was to send Fisher to Ceylon and India, then through East Asia to Canada, returning to the United Kingdom in May 1908, with a subsequent journey on the reverse route returning via the Mediterranean; this would enable him to photograph India and Canada at different seasons. However, it was later decided to cover the whole of India in one visit, and Canada the following year. Mackinder issued detailed instructions to Fisher in October. His itinerary included several stops of two or three days in one place since it was thought that he would be able to absorb the atmosphere better than at too rapid a movement from place to place, and he was given authority to purchase photographs for important areas he could not visit. He was to have the educational rather than the pictorial aspect in mind and was to present both the 'native characteristics of the country' and the 'super-added characteristics due to British rule'. He was advised to give a feeling of movement where possible by having people engaged in some activity in the foreground rather than static views of buildings etc. The negatives were to be sent to Newman and Guardia, who would develop them and prepare one print each; the list of photographs taken and the paintings were to be sent direct to Mackinder.\n\n\n\nFisher's journey to Ceylon, India and Burma was originally intended to include Somaliland, Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar, but he was instructed to omit the last two in order to arrive back in London in time for a projected showing of slides in the presence of the Princess of Wales. This did not in fact take place. Fisher resumed his travels on 24 July 1908 and went to Canada, in which he followed a rather complicated route before sailing from Vancouver on 28 October to visit Wei-hai-wei, Hong Kong, part of the Chinese mainland, Singapore and North Borneo. March 1909 found him back in Canada where he saw something of the end of the winter.\n\n\n\nDuring the summer of 1909 the Princess of Wales attended a meeting on the project at Caxton Hall. \u00a3150 was spent on renewing and improving Fisher's equipment and he spent six weeks in the U.K. trying out the apparatus and taking photographs of British scenes for use in lectures for Canada and South Africa. At this time too he married Lillias Wyman.\n\n\n\nHis final tour was via Gibraltar and Malta to New Zealand, the Pacific and Australia, but money was running out; he was instructed to omit Papua and in 1910 he was informed that no more money was available for expenses and he could not be offered a further engagement. Fisher produced vivid and interesting descriptions of his journeys. His later writings appear to have been chiefly poetry. Lillias Fisher died in 1930 and Hugh Fisher died 2 July 1945.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n\nTypescript copy of 'Index to Photographers'.\n\nFound in 36 Collections and/or Records:\n\n1\n\n2\n\nGo to page (1-2):\n\nFile Diary letters, 1907 - 1910 Reference Code: GBR/0115/RCS/RCMS 10/1 Scope and Contents Letters written by Fisher to Halford Mackinder describing his travels (circa 2,000 pages).

He was 96.\n\nFischer died July 2 at Maravilla Senior Living Community in Santa Barbara.\n\nFischer made major contributions to the understanding of environmental cyclicity, characterized by repetitive patterns of different rock layers, or strata, in the Earth.\n\n\u201cAl Fischer was one of the most globally prominent sedimentary geologists of the second half of the 20th century,\u201d said David Bottjer, professor of Earth sciences, biological sciences and environmental studies at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. \u201cAt USC he was a wonderful colleague who sparked many innovative research interactions at the intersection of Earth and life evolution, and was the prototype faculty member for our department\u2019s now leading program in geobiology.\u201d\n\nThe breadth of Al\u2019s influence spans generations and is global. The Earth sciences community has lost an icon. William Berelson\n\nDescribing Fischer as a renaissance scholar, William Berelson, professor of Earth sciences and environmental studies and chair of Earth sciences said, \u201cThe breadth of Al\u2019s influence spans generations and is global. The Earth sciences community has lost an icon.\u201d\n\nFischer studied marine sedimentology and marine fossil fauna and was a leading scientist in the Deep Sea Drilling Project. In 1964, he described the phenomenon of rhythmically recurring sequences of sedimentary rock layers in some Keuper Formations of the Alps, first discovered in the Dachstein-Kalk (Dachstein limestone) found in the Austrian province of Salzburg. In the 1970s, he propagated the existence of global biorhythms in the fossil record and in 1977 the concept of cycles of low and high levels of biodiversity in the marine fauna over 32 million years. In 1982, he spoke in favor of the Earth\u2019s climate alternating between ice ages and warm periods due to the Icehouse-Greenhouse concept.\n\nFischer\u2019s work at USC Dornsife, and earlier at Princeton University, concentrated on the little-understood area of stratigraphy \u2014 the branch of geology concerned with the order and relative position of strata and their relationship to the geological time scale. He was probably one of the first people to recognize the importance of Milankovitch cycles, or orbital forcing, which show the variable amounts of sunlight hitting the Earth at a particular point over a period of time and how that changes as the Earth goes through a series of cycles. Fischer was able to show that these sequences, which were calculated theoretically in the orbital characteristics of the Earth, are mirrored in the sedimentary sequences \u2014 a huge advance in the understanding of sequence stratigraphy.\n\nAn inspirational role model for students\n\nFischer was also a generous and devoted teacher. His elder son, Joseph Fred \u201cFritz\u201d Fischer, recounted how after giving a guest lecture at Yale University in the late 1970s, his father turned down an offer to tour the university\u2019s geology department in favor of talking to its graduate students.\n\n\u201cThe moment the students heard about it, they dashed off to quickly read up on his literature,\u201d Fritz Fischer said. However, rather than talking about his own work, Al Fischer concentrated on the students\u2019 efforts, sitting down with each student individually and asking about their thesis or dissertation, then making suggestions.\n\n\u201cThe students were utterly amazed,\u201d Fritz Fischer said. \u201cHere\u2019s this great man, he\u2019s made such a name for himself and he wasn\u2019t there to talk about himself. He was there to find out what they were doing. They all walked out of there saying, \u2018Oh my God, I want to be like that man.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom Germany to the U.S.\n\nBorn on Dec. 10, 1920, in Rothenburg, Germany, Al Fischer was the son of George Fischer, a traveling shoe salesman who made a fortune in the American Old West, retired at a young age and moved to Germany with his wife, Thea. Both parents were of German extraction, but born in the United States. The family lived in Germany for 14 years, for much of that time in an Alpine chalet where young Al Fischer developed a profound love of nature.\n\nThe family, deeply concerned by the direction Germany was taking, returned to the U.S. in 1935, settling in Watertown, Wis. Fischer spent a year in a U.S. high school before being admitted to a local college. He completed his sophomore year there, then transferred to the University of Wisconsin in 1938 with the expectation that he would become a forester. However, he rapidly fell in love with geology and graduated a year later, at the age of 19, with his bachelor\u2019s degree in that discipline.\n\nFollowing his graduation, on Aug. 26, 1939, he married Winnifred \u201cWinnie\u201d Varney, a graduate student in geography. Fischer then pursued a master\u2019s degree in geology at the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1940.\n\nFischer then began studying for his PhD, but the birth of his first child in 1941 forced him to temporarily abandon his studies and take a job teaching geology at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg. He remained until 1943, when the institute converted to an officer training school.\n\nWartime and postwar years\n\nAs a pre-Pearl Harbor father with a young son to look after and poor eyesight, Fischer was exempted from military service. Instead, he joined Stanolind Oil and Gas as a geologist, working first in Wichita, Kansas, and then in Tallahassee, Fla., and supporting the war effort by seeking much-needed petroleum resources in the U.S.\n\nIn 1946, Fischer enrolled in Columbia University, completing the PhD qualifying examination the same year. In 1947, he taught at the University of Rochester and from 1948 at the University of Kansas, where he was an assistant professor. During the summers of 1949 and 1950, Fischer managed a research program on the Capitan Reef Complex in the Guadalupe Mountains of West Texas, leading 15 to 20 geologists and graduate students. In 1950, he was awarded his PhD from Columbia.\n\nAt the University of Kansas, he wrote a textbook on paleontology with two fellow professors, Raymond Moore and Cecil Lalicker. Published in 1952, Invertebrate Fossils (McGraw-Hill) has endured in popularity for more than 60 years.\n\nFrom 1951-56, Fischer served as a petroleum geologist for Esso in Peru, first in Talara and then in Lima.\n\nImportant contributions in academe\n\nIn 1956, he returned to the U.S. to join Princeton. During his 28-year stay at the university, Fischer conducted substantial research in the Austrian and Italian Alps, worked in the Green River Basin \u2014 the watershed of the Green River, the Colorado River\u2019s chief tributary \u2014 and drilled a core in Southern Colorado that was the focus of extensive study. He also served as visiting professor in Innsbruck, Austria, and in Berlin and T\u00fcbingen in Germany.\n\nAn avid reader of The New York Times and books on geology, Fischer also enjoyed reading fiction, writing poetry and watercolor painting. He was a keen traveler, deriving immense enjoyment from research trips, including a two-year journey around the world to look at deep sea sediments from 1970\u201371, armed with a 1969 Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\nPrinceton\u2019s mandatory retirement at age 65 did not suit Fischer, who was not ready to retire, and in 1984 he joined USC Dornsife.\n\nFischer was the recipient of more than 30 awards, including the 2009 Mary Clark Thompson Medal; the 1992 Gustav-Steinmann-Medaille for his pioneering insights into the rhythms of life and the Earth\u2019s climate; the 1992 Lyell Medal; the 1982 William H. Twenhofel Medal and the1972 Leopold-von-Buch-Plakette award of the German Geological Society. The honor that meant the most to him was his 1991 induction into the Academia Nazionale dei Lincei (the Italian Academy of Sciences), one of the oldest scientific academies in the world and which counts Galileo as an early inductee.\n\nFinally retired, but not really\n\nFischer officially retired from USC Dornsife in 1991 at the age of 71, but maintained an office on campus and continued to offer advice and help to students, even participating in field trips. It was not until the early 2000s that he began to slow down, spending more time working from home.\n\nHowever, even then Fischer continued to spearhead new research. During a 2011 field trip to look at the Monterey Formation near Morro Bay, which he attended as part of a celebration of the A. Eugene Fritsche Lifetime Award from the Pacific Section of the Society for Sedimentary Geology, Fischer discovered that reversals in polarity of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field bore a resemblance to some cyclic sedimentation patterns. As a result, Fischer spent the last years of his life working to determine if a relationship exists between the cycles in sedimentation and the changes in polarity in the Earth\u2019s field and trying to relate that back to orbital forcing and the Milankovitch Cycles.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, he wasn\u2019t able to carry this through to a conclusion before his death,\u201d Fritz Fischer said. \u201cOthers are following up on it, and it will be interesting to see where this goes. This was a whole new window that my father was looking into and it is typical of the man that he would do that.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Al Fischer\u2019s wife died four years after suffering a stroke. Fischer is survived by his children: Fritz Fischer, George William \u201cBill\u201d Fischer and Lenore Ruth Fischer; his grandchildren Jon Karl Fischer, Kristina Michele Fischer, Bella Walsh and Jennifer Walsh; and great grandchildren Alexander, Nicolas and Madison Fischer, and Braiden and Justin Stanert.\n\nFischer was cremated in a private ceremony in Santa Barbara on July 14. A memorial is being planned for a later date.\n\nMore stories about: Earth Sciences, Environment, Obituaries"}, {"url": "https://museum.timaru.govt.nz/explore/scroll/profile?id=6159", "page_content": "Aliases First Rank Last Rank\n\nBirth\n\nDate 12 October 1888 Place of Birth Timaru, New Zealand\n\nEnlistment Information\n\nDate 8-Jun-18 Age 29 years Address at Enlistment Nome, Alaska Occupation Ship's carpenter Previous Military Experience Marital Status Single Next of Kin Religion Medical Information\n\nMilitary Service\n\nServed with United States Forces Served in Army Military District\n\nEmbarkation Information\n\nBody on Embarkation Unit , Squadron, or Ship Date Transport Embarked From Destination\n\nOther Units Served With Last Unit Served With\n\nMilitary Awards\n\nCampaigns Service Medals Military Awards\n\nAward Circumstances and Date No information\n\nPrisoner of War Information Date of Capture Where Captured and by Whom Actions Prior to Capture PoW Serial Number PoW Camps Days Interned Liberation Date\n\nDischarge Date Reason\n\nHospitals, Wounds, Diseases and Illnesses\n\nPost-war Occupations Dredgemaster; builder\n\nDeath\n\nDate 1-Nov-78 Age 90 years Place of Death Greymouth, New Zealand Cause Notices Memorial or Cemetery Memorial Reference N ew Z ealand Memorials\n\nBiographical Notes\n\nAlfred Friedrich Fischer, known as Fred, was born on 12 October 1888 at Timaru, the second son of well-known photographer Adolf Gottlieb Fischer, from Switzerland, and his Bavarian-born wife, Katherina n\u00e9e Blab, who had come to New Zealand in 1879-80. He was baptised on 12 February 1889 at St Mary\u2019s Anglican Church, Timaru. Alfred, who may have been known as Frederick, was educated at Timaru and at Sydenham School in Christchurch.\n\nAlfred Fischer, a jioiner, was called up in Christchurch in 1916, but . . . As a young man Alfred went to Alaska, and while there he registered with the United States Forces for World War I, on 8 June 1918. He was single and noted that his mother, Catherine Fischer, Christchurch, NZ, was solely dependent on him. It was while living at Nome, Alaska, that he was naturalized on 19 July 1918. On 10 November 1922, George Fredrick Fischer applied for a United States passport. He intended to leave the United States from the port of Vancouver, sailing on board the \u201cNiagra\u201d on 24 November 1922. He was then a miner residing at Nome, Alaska, and wanted to visit relatives in New Zealand and Australia. He had been residing in Alaska for ten years unterruped, from 1912 to 1922, having emigrated from Glasgow, Scotland to the United States about Spring 1912. He stated, moreover, that his father was by then (1922) deceased. He probably returned to Nome in May 1923, and again in May 1926 after a visit home.\n\nBack in New Zealand he married Glaswegian Mary Coulter Toal in 1932. Alfred Frederich Fischer died on 1 November 1978 at Greymouth, predeceased by his wife in 1974. Two brothers served in World War I \u2013 Emil Gottlieb Henry Fischer (Harry) with the Australian Forces and Albert George Fischer with the New Zealand Forces.\n\nSources\n\nNZ BDM Indexes (Department of Internal Affairs) [13 April 2020]; School Admission record [13 April 2020]; US Passport application (ancestry.com.au) [25 April 2020]; US WWI Draft Registration Card (ancestry.com.au) [25 April 2020]; NZ Electoral Rolls (ancestry.com.au) [25 April 2020]; canterburyphotography.blogspot.comm\n\nExternal Links\n\nRelated Documents\n\nResearched and Written by\n\nTeresa Scott, SC branch NZSG\n\nCurrently Assigned to\n\nNot assigned."}]}
