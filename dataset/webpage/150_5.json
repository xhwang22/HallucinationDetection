{"Joe Walsh has represented England at international level.": [{"url": "https://www.qpr.co.uk/news/club-news/joe-walsh-called-up-to-england-training-camp-070421/", "page_content": "QPR youngster Joe Walsh has been called up to an England Goalkeeping Development Camp at St George\u2019s Park.\n\nThe 19-year-old shotstopper, who joined the R\u2019s in January from Gillingham, will have the opportunity to showcase his potential to the national team during a three-day stay between 19th and 21st April.\n\nThe camp, which has been running for over a decade, is designed for young players to develop areas of their game and experience how the national team prepare for international football.\n\nJordan Pickford, Jack Butland, Joe Hart and Dean Henderson are notable former attendees, and QPR Goalkeeping Coach Gavin Ward told www.qpr.co.uk: \u201cWe are all delighted for Joe to receive an invite to the training camp.\n\n\u201cHe is a smashing lad who works hard every day. He is very inquisitive, always asking questions, and that\u2019s something I like and encourage.\n\n\u201cThis training camp is a fantastic opportunity for Joe to learn, as well as show his potential.\u201d\n\nWard, who has been at QPR since 2016, played a major role in Walsh\u2019s arrival at the club but says the efforts of the Board and Les Ferdinand were critical to getting it across the line amid Premier League interest.\n\nAnd Ward feels Walsh\u2019s decision to turn down the opportunity to join a top-flight club is a good indicator of the youngster\u2019s desire to develop his game.\n\n\u201cWe are always keeping an eye on young goalkeepers, looking at who is coming through,\u201d Ward explained.\n\n\u201cLike everyone, we want to be one step ahead and that means bringing players in who can develop in time.\n\n\u201cJoe came on our radar quite some time ago, it was my colleague Erbil Bozkurt who initially identified him.\n\n\u201cI watched him play for Gillingham against Arsenal\u2019s U21s in the EFL Trophy last year and he impressed me - he was very mature, very calm.\n\n\u201cHe had all the attributes we look for.\n\n\u201cThere were opportunities for him to join Premier League clubs but he wanted to see a clear pathway to first-team football, and that\u2019s something that really worked in our favour.\n\n\u201cLook at Joe Lumley and Seny Dieng \u2013 they both joined us as youngsters before going on to make a lot of first-team appearances here.\n\n\u201cIn that respect, the club sold itself.\n\n\u201cLes spent time talking with Joe too, and I know that meant a lot to him - and the Board didn\u2019t hesitate in supporting us, which is fantastic.\u201d\n\nWard also revealed Lumley was a key part of the process. Having spent a month on loan at the Gills last season, he had worked with Walsh and was in a position to give a reference on him.\n\n\u201cLumers couldn\u2019t speak highly enough of him,\u201d Ward explained, \u201cand since he has come in, he has done great. Just like Murphy Cooper, who is another young keeper we have, Joe is dedicated and focused.\n\n\u201cI am sure the training camp will be a great experience for him.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://uk.soccerway.com/players/joe-walsh/591626/", "page_content": "Matches of J.

Joe Walsh of Illinois, now a conservative talk radio host, will challenge incumbent President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nWalsh, 57, narrowly defeated a three-term Democrat in the Tea Party wave election of 2010. He served a single term in Congress before losing his seat.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take four more years of Donald Trump. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President,\u201d Walsh tweeted the morning of Aug. 25. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, but bravery is never easy. But together, we can do it.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Walsh, known for inflammatory language, was a vocal backer of Trump\u2019s first presidential bid. \u201cOn November 8th, I\u2019m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. You in?\u201d he tweeted shortly before the election.\n\n\n\nWalsh subsequently turned into a persistent critic of the president and apologized for \u201cthe role I played in helping to put an unfit con man in the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump boasts high approval ratings from Republicans and has been raising money for his re-election bid since the moment he took office, making any primary challenge a long-shot. But Walsh sees it differently: the president is \u201cripe for a primary challenger,\u201d Walsh wrote in a New York Times opinion piece earlier this month. Walsh is joined in the Republican primary by former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who himself announced a challenge to Trump in February but has earned little interest among prospective GOP voters.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s more on Walsh\u2019s political and financial history:\n\n\n\nIn 2012, outside groups such as FreedomWorks for America collectively spent roughly eight times more \u2014 more than $5.2 million \u2014 to boost Walsh\u2019s congressional campaign as they did to support his opponent, Democrat Tammy Duckworth. But she won.\n\nWalsh raised a little more than $2 million for his 2012 bid, with the biggest chunk of the money \u2014 about $860,000 \u2014 coming from Illinois donors.\n\nIn 2011, Walsh\u2019s ex-wife sued him, alleging he owed more than $117,000 in back child support payments, and said he had failed to pay what he owed even as he loaned money to his own campaign. The former couple later settled the dispute and issued a joint statement saying they \u201cnow agree that Joe is not and was not a \u2018deadbeat dad\u2019 and does not owe child support.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Walsh was taken off the radio for using racist slurs on the air, something he said he did in an attempt to have an \u201chonest discussion\u201d about them. He has also been asked to account for past tweets when he said, among other things, that he believed former President Barack Obama is a Muslim (he is not) and accused Obama of \u201chatred toward Israel.\u201d\n\nWalsh\u2019s personal finances have been tumultuous in other ways, according to a 2011 Chicago Tribune investigation. The newspaper reported Walsh\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended after he allowed his high-risk car insurance to lapse. It also said he had previously been subject to state and federal tax liens and lost a condo to foreclosure.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., waits for the start of a televised debate against then-challenger Democrat Tammy Duckworth at the WTTW studios Thursday, Oct. 18, 2012, in Chicago. (AP file/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nWalsh\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure form, filed in 2013 at the end of his time in Congress, showed he owed between $50,000 and $100,000 in legal fees and $10,000 and $15,000 in student loan debt.\n\nAfter leaving office, Walsh launched the Grow and Be Free Super PAC, which he said would back conservative candidates and act as an alternative to Republican super PACs backing more establishment candidates. The group raised nearly $30,000 in 2013, including $5,000 from GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein, and then fizzled, officially shutting down in 2015.\n\nWalsh at one point worked for the libertarian Heartland Institute, which amplifies questions about scientific consensus on climate change, and has been prominently featured at Heartland Institute events since leaving Congress.\n\nWhen Politico asked Walsh if he could raise enough money for a primary challenge to Trump, Walsh\u2019s response: \u201cAbso-freaking-lutely.\u201d\n\nSources: The Center for Responsive Politics, Federal Election Commission records, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Huffington Post, POLITICO and Salon.\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nHelp support this work"}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-joe-walsh-believe-where-the-candidate-stands-on-issues", "page_content": "Joe Walsh is a one-term Republican congressman from Illinois and conservative radio host who is known for his inflammatory comments and tweets, including promoting falsehoods about former President Barack Obama and using racial slurs on his show.\n\n\u201cI felt a big part of my job [as a radio host] was to provoke and get people thinking about a number of issues. Oftentimes, I went over the line,\u201d Walsh told PBS NewsHour anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff in August.\n\nA former social worker in inner-city Chicago, Walsh was elected to represent Illinois\u2019 8th Congressional District in 2010 as part of the tea party movement. He was defeated by Democratic challenger \u2014 now Senator \u2014 Tammy Duckworth in 2012, before turning to conservative talk radio in 2013.\n\nHere is where Walsh stands on key issues in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHealth care: Replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a congressman, Walsh voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but later spoke out against Republican efforts to repeal the plan in 2017 in the absence of a GOP alternative. As president, Walsh would repeal Obamacare \u2014 a program he says the country cannot afford \u2014 as part of a broader move to re-conceptualize health care coverage in America.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to a place\u2026where Medicare and government-provided health care is always there for people in need, but the rest of the American people need to begin assuming the responsibility for the day-to-day costs of our health care,\u201d Walsh told the NewsHour. \u201cWe cannot, as a nation, afford to pay for, in essence, government-run health care for everybody.\u201d\n\nImmigration: Build a border wall, process asylum cases more quickly.\n\nWalsh believes in building a wall at the border, but told Woodruff he would not separate families. He said President Donald Trump\u2019s moves have made a humanitarian crisis worse. \u201cPeople coming to claim asylum \u2014 that has nothing to do with a wall.\u201d Walsh also said that the United States has to devote resources to deal with asylum cases more urgently.\n\nEconomy and Trade: Reverse Trump\u2019s trade war and promote free trade.\n\nWalsh has been outspoken in rejecting Trump\u2019s trade war with China. \u201cI believe in free trade. Everybody loses in a trade war,\u201d Walsh told Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe. Walsh also wrote in his op-ed in the New York Times: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a tax increase on middle-class Americans and are devastating to our farmers. That\u2019s not a smart electoral strategy.\u201d\n\nClimate Change: Acknowledge global warming is a problem.\n\nWalsh told Woodruff that he does believe humans have played a role in climate change and that the Republican Party needs to acknowledge that a warming planet is a problem. That position is at odds with an earlier moment in his career, when Walsh worked for the libertarian Heartland Institute, which works to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change. He has also tweeted his own skepticism of climate change in the past.\n\nSocial Issues: Accepts same-sex marriage as law, opposes abortion.\n\nWalsh has flipped on gay rights a few times over his career. During his unsuccessful 1996 campaign for a House seat in a liberal Illinois district, Walsh said that he would support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. \u201cIf there\u2019s a more gay-friendly Republican around, I\u2019d like to meet them,\u201d he told the Windy City Times that year.\n\nFast forward to his reemergence as a tea party figure, when Walsh voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and said that children of husband-and-wife households perform better socially and academically.

You learn to appreciate that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season saw him spend a fifth loan spell away from Stamford Bridge, making 10 Championship appearances in his second stay with Birmingham City.\n\nLB: Kyle Walker-Peters\n\nWalker-Peters was on the fringes of Tottenham\u2019s first team for three seasons after enjoying glory at the Under-20s World Cup, making 24 appearances in all competitions, including the Champions League.\n\nIn January 2020, the full-back joined Southampton on loan and made the move permanent that summer. He has since established himself as a solid Premier League full-back, making 62 apperances over his two seasons as a full-time Saint.\n\nWere he born in any other generation, the 24-year-old may well be pushing for a spot in England\u2019s senior side.\n\nRM: Kieran Dowell (Sheyi Ojo, 62)\n\nAnother of the six squad members who also won the European Under-17 Championship in 2014, and another of five Everton players in this World Cup-winning squad.\n\nBut Dowell struggled to fit into the Toffees first-team set-up after flying home and, after four spells away on loan, moved permanently to Norwich City in the summer of 2020. He scored five goals as the Canaries were promoted straight back to the top flight but played just seven times in the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s Ojo, meanwhile, is another serial loanee and most recently spent the 2021-22 campaign at Millwall.\n\nCM: Josh Onomah\n\nAfter threatening to break through at Spurs only to be loaned out to Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday, Onomah joined Fulham on a permanent basis as part of the deal that saw Ryan Sessegnon move in the opposite direction.\n\nThe attacking midfielder helped Aston Villa to the play-off final in 2017-18, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make Martin Lipton of the Daily Mirror\u2019s 2014 prediction come true.

He came back in October 2021, however, and played 28 games as Bournemouth sealed promotion.\n\nHe won his first, and to date only, senior cap as a substitute against Italy in 2018, and the former Leeds United man certainly won\u2019t have given up hope of a return to Gareth Southgate\u2019s set-up just yet.\n\nLM: Ademola Lookman\n\nHaving already made 49 appearances for Charlton, Lookman joined Everton in January 2017 just three months after turning 19.\n\nDespite occasional moments of promise, the forward failed to establish himself on Merseyside and made the eye-catching move to RB Leipzig, having impressed on loan at the Bundesliga outfit.\n\nThat permanent move didn\u2019t work as planned though and Lookman\u2019s since been sent on loan twice, most recently to Leicester City.\n\nST: Dominic Solanke\n\nSolanke had already agreed to join Liverpool from Chelsea when he helped England win the Under-20 World Cup, collecting the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.\n\nSince then he has made his senior England debut and earned a \u00a319million move to Bournemouth, but seriously underwhelmed in the top flight for the Cherries.\n\nThe drop into the Championship did him a world of good, however, as banged in 29 league goals in their 2021-22 promotion campaign. If it hadn\u2019t been for Aleksandr Mitrovic\u2019s Fulham heroics, Solanke might have made more headlines.\n\nST: Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Ainsley Maitland-Niles, 76)\n\nHe scored the winner in the final in 2017 and will be hoping to do the same for the Three Lions at the big boys\u2019 World Cup later this year as Harry Kane\u2019s understudy.\n\nHe\u2019ll have to recover his 2020-21 form and do so quickly if he wants a place in the squad though. After scoring 16 goals in 33 games for Everton in 2020-21, he only managed five in his most recent campaign, with injuries restricting his progress.\n\nFor a while, Maitland-Niles looked like being the next big thing to graduate from Arsenal\u2019s academy, but he appears to be on his way out of the Emirates. He spent the second half of last season out at Roma and helped them to the Europa Conference League title, but a place in Mikel Arteta\u2019s first team looks a long way away.\n\nRevisiting the \u201920 future England stars\u2019 picked by The Guardian in 2008\n\nYearning for the Wayne Rooney we all fell in love with at Euro 2004\n\nCan you name England\u2019s Xl from their first game at new Wembley?\n\nA tribute to David Beckham, England\u2019s man for the big occasions"}, {"url": "https://www.rugbypass.com/players/joe-walsh/", "page_content": "FEATURED\n\nUnbeaten Leinster come from behind to see off Ospreys\n\nOspreys pushed leaders Leinster all the way but two late tries saw the Dubliners maintain their unbeaten record in this compelling URC clash."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/25/rugby-league-world-cup-2017-team-by-team-guide", "page_content": "Group A\n\nAustralia\n\nCaptain Cameron Smith Coach Mal Meninga\n\nFourteen World Cups, 10 titles.

John Stones (Man City) Age: 23, Caps: 24, Goals: 0\n\nA firm favourite of Southgate\u2019s and likely to be England\u2019s sweeper in a back three, owing to his composure in possession and ability to bring the ball out of defence.\n\n12. Kieran Trippier (Tottenham) Age: 27, Caps: 5, Goals: 0\n\nA potential starter at right wing-back after emerging as Tottenham\u2019s first-choice at the end of the season. He has also provided Harry Kane with numerous assists at club level\u2026\n\n2. Kyle Walker (Man City) Age: 27, Caps: 34, Goals: 0\n\nArguably one of Southgate\u2019s most important players, Kyle Walker is being tipped to play in a central defensive role after impressing in that position against the Netherlands in March.\n\n18. Ashley Young (Man Utd) Age: 32, Caps: 33, Goals: 7, Squad number: 18\n\nOut of the squad for four years, Ashley Young has clawed his way back in after being successfully re-positioned as a left-back by Jose Mourinho.\n\nMidfielders:\n\n20. Dele Alli (Tottenham) Age: 22, Caps: 23 Goals: 2\n\nDele Alli wasn\u2019t quite able to replicate his 2016-17 form last season but he still made a valuable contribution to a Spurs side that finished 3rd in the Premier League.\n\n17. Fabian Delph (Man City) Age: 28, Caps: 9, Goals: 0\n\nSome were surprised to see Fabian Delph make the cut but he featured prominently for Manchester City as they won the title, albeit in an unfamiliar left-back role.\n\n4. Eric Dier (Tottenham) Age: 24, Caps: 25, Goals: 3\n\nA useful player to have at a major tournament due to his ability to cover a variety of positions. Eric Dier will predominantly be used in central midfield and has captained England under Southgate.\n\n8. Jordan Henderson (Liverpool) Age: 27, Caps: 38, Goals: 0\n\nCaptained Liverpool to a Champions League final but missed out to Kane on the armband for the World Cup. Thought highly of by Southgate and should be one of the first names on the teamsheet.\n\n7. Jesse Lingard (Man Utd) Age: 25, Caps: 10 Goals: 1\n\nWell-regarded by both Southgate and Mourinho. Jesse Lingard was the match-winner in England\u2019s 1-0 win over the Dutch and has scored crucial goals in finals for his club.\n\n21. Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea) Age: 22, Caps: 2, Goals: 0\n\nA man-of-the-match display on his debut against Germany certainly helped Ruben Loftus-Cheek as did a strong season with Crystal Palace. Potential starter?\n\nForwards:\n\n9. Harry Kane (Tottenham) Age: 24, Caps: 23, Goals: 12\n\nThe leading English goalscorer in each of the last four Premier League seasons, Kane will have the honour of leading his country out in Russia. Undoubtedly England\u2019s biggest goal threat.\n\n19. Marcus Rashford (Man Utd) Age: 20, Caps: 17, Goals: 2\n\nSuffered at times with Manchester United last season but a potential match-winner on his day. Likely to play the role of impact-sub.\n\n10. Raheem Sterling (Man City) Age: 23 Caps: 37, Goals: 2\n\nOne of the few players in the squad guaranteed a starting place off the back of his finest ever season where he played a key role in Manchester City\u2019s title win.\n\n11. Jamie Vardy (Leicester) Age: 31, Caps: 21, Goals: 7\n\nEnjoyed his second-most productive goalscoring season with 20 Premier League goals and always offers a threat when he plays for England.\n\n14. Danny Welbeck (Arsenal) Age: 27, Caps: 37, Goals: 15\n\nMuch-derided by supporters of Arsenal and England, Danny Welbeck is a manager\u2019s dream and actually has a very impressive international record.\n\nHow FA announced the squad\n\nWhat Southgate says\n\n\u201cI believe this is a squad which we can be excited about,\u201c the England boss said. \u201cIt is a young group, but with some really important senior players so I feel the balance of the squad is good, both in terms of its experience, its character and also the positional balance. \u201cWe have a lot of energy and athleticism in the team, but players that are equally comfortable in possession of the ball and I think people can see the style of play we\u2019ve been looking to develop. \u201cThe selection process has been over months really, it\u2019s not just been the last few weeks. We feel the team are improving and we want to continue that momentum.\u201d\n\ni told you so\u2026\n\nOur football correspondent Sam Cunningham correctly predicted all 23 men who would be picked by Southgate:\n\nGareth Southgate\u2019s 23-man World Cup England squad, as per today\u2019s @theipaper pic.twitter.com/50IHlJRyfm \u2014 Sam Cunningham (@samcunningham) May 16, 2018\n\nWhy they missed out\n\nWilshere failed to prove his fitness to Southgate after withdrawing from the last squad in March while Hart has suffered a miserable downturn in form over the past two seasons.
