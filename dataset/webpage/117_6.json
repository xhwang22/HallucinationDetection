{"Stereophonics have been nominated for five Brit Awards.": [{"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/2021-brit-award-nominees-full-list-9549017/#!", "page_content": "For the first time in the history of the Brit Awards, female solo artists account for four of the five albums nominated for album of the year (branded Mastercard album).\n\nArlo Parks, Celeste, Dua Lipa and Jessie Ware are vying for the award, along with one male contender, J Hus. The nominations were announced on Wednesday (March 31).\n\nDua Lipa\u2019s nominated album, Future Nostalgia, was also Grammy-nominated for album of the year, though it lost to Taylor Swift\u2019s Folklore.\n\nLipa received three Brit nods this year, which put her in a five-way tie for the lead, along with the aforementioned Arlo Parks and Celeste; a male dance artist, Joel Corry, and a hip-hop group, Young T & Bugsey. Lipa is the only artist nominated for both the top album and single award.\n\nLipa could be headed for her second win for British single. She is nominated this year with \u201cPhysical.\u201d She won two years ago for \u201cOne Kiss,\u201d a collab with Calvin Harris. If she wins, she\u2019ll join Adele as the only female artist to win twice in the category.\n\nAnother of this year\u2019s nominees, Harry Styles, could also be headed for his second win in the category. He is nominated for \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d As part of One Direction, he won in 2012 for \u201cWhat Makes You Beautiful.\u201d If he wins, he would join Robbie Williams as the only artists to win both solo and with a group. Williams won the award three times on his own and three times with Take That.\n\nCeleste, who won the Brits\u2019 rising star award last year, is nominated for an Oscar for best original song for co-writing \u201cHear My Voice\u201d from The Trial of the Chicago 7 with composer Daniel Pemberton. The Oscars will be presented April 25.\n\nRelated Griff Wins Brit Award for Rising Star Over Buzzy Finalist Rina Sawayama\n\nSeveral of this year\u2019s nominees have won in those categories in the past. Foo Fighters, nominated for international group, are four-time winners in that category. The 1975, nominated for British group, are two-time winners in that category. Lipa, nominated for female solo artist, won in that category in 2018.\n\nThree of the nominees for international female artist have won previously in that category \u2014 Billie Eilish last year, Ariana Grande in 2019 and Swift in 2015. Bruce Springsteen is the only one of this year\u2019s nominees for international male artist who has won previously in that category (in 1986).\n\nThe Brits reinstated the award for international group after a one-year lapse \u2014 BTS\u2019 popularity might have had something to do with that \u2014 but tabled the category of British producer of the year this year.\n\nThe Brits are set to air on May 11, nearly 15 months after the last show, which was held on Feb. 18, 2020. It was one of the last major awards shows to air before COVID-19 shut down award shows and most other public gatherings for more than a year.\n\nComedian, actor and writer Jack Whitehall will host the show for the fourth year in a row. That equals James Corden\u2019s four-year stint as host from 2011-14. Current plans are for the show to be held at the O2 Arena in London. Lipa and Griff are the first artists confirmed to perform on the show.\n\nThe eligibility period for this year\u2019s Brit Awards was Dec. 13, 2019 to March 11, 2021.\n\nThe nominations were announced by Griff and BBC Radio 1\u2019s Nick Grimshaw. They were announced across all @BRITs official social platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram).\n\nThe Brits have just 10 categories, one of which they already announced (Griff as the winner of the fan-voted rising star award). By contrast, the Grammys have had 84 categories the past five years.\n\nThe Brits have separate male and female categories for British solo artists and international [defined as non-British] solo artists. By contrast, the Grammys did away with gendered categories as part of a major 2011 category overhaul.\n\nAnd the Brits\u2019 eligibility year ended March 11, just two months before the May 11 show. By contrast, the Grammys\u2019 eligibility year ended on Aug. 31, 2019, more than six months before their March 14 show.\n\nThere are at least three other differences between the Brits and the Grammys. The nominees for British single with Mastercard are the top 10 singles from the eligibility period based on chart-eligible sales success. (Academy voter will determine the winner.) Grammy nominees are not based on charts. Also, six of these Brit awards have corporate sponsors. The Grammys have never sold naming rights. Finally, the Brits don\u2019t count featured credits towards artists\u2019 awards tallies; the Grammys do.\n\nRelated The 8 Best Moments From the 2020 Brit Awards\n\nSee the complete list of Brit Award nominees below.\n\nBritish Single with Mastercard (Supported by Capital FM)\n\n220 Kid & Gracey, \u201cDon\u2019t Need Love\u201d\n\nAitch & AJ Tracey featuring Tay Keith, \u201cRain\u201d\n\nDua Lipa, \u201cPhysical\u201d\n\nHarry Styles, \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d\n\nHeadie One featuring AJ Tracey & Stormzy, \u201cAin\u2019t It Different\u201d\n\nJ Corry featuring Mnek, \u201cHead and Heart\u201d\n\nNathan Dawe featuring KSI, \u201cLighter\u201d\n\nRegard & Raye, \u201cSecrets\u201d\n\nSimba featuring DTG, \u201cRover\u201d\n\nYoung T & Bugsey featuring Heady One, \u201cDon\u2019t Rush\u201d\n\nMastercard Album\n\nArlo Parks, Collapsed in Sunbeams\n\nCeleste, Not Your Muse\n\nDua Lipa, Future Nostalgia\n\nJ Hus, Big Conspiracy\n\nJessie Ware, What\u2019s Your Pleasure\n\nFemale Solo Artist \u2013 in association with Amazon Music\n\nArlo Parks\n\nCeleste\n\nDua Lipa\n\nJessie Ware\n\nLianne LaHavas\n\nMale Solo Artist \u2013 in association with Amazon Music\n\nAJ Tracey\n\nHeadie One\n\nJ Hus\n\nJoel Corry\n\nYungblud\n\nBritish Group\n\nBicep\n\nBiffy Clyro\n\nLittle Mix\n\nThe 1975\n\nYoung T & Bugsey\n\nBRITs Rising Star supported by Radio 1 (fan-voted)\n\nGriff (winner)\n\nPa Salieu\n\nRina Sawayama\n\nBreakthrough Artist in association with TikTok\n\nArlo Parks\n\nBicep\n\nCeleste\n\nJoel Corry\n\nYoung T & Bugsey\n\nInternational Female Solo Artist\n\nAriana Grande\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nCardi B\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nInternational Male Solo Artist\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nBurna Boy\n\nChildish Gambino\n\nTame Impala\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nInternational Group\n\nBTS\n\nFontaines D.C.\n\nFoo Fighters\n\nHaim\n\nRun the Jewels"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/12/brit-awards-2023-wet-leg-and-harry-styles-lead-male-dominated-nominations", "page_content": "A year after the Brit awards abandoned the gendered categories, the nominations for the replacement artist of the year prize are entirely male, comprising Central Cee, Stormzy, Fred Again, George Ezra and Harry Styles.\n\nThe awards ceremony, run by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) did away with the best British male and best female awards in 2022 following criticism that the non-binary pop star Sam Smith would not be eligible for either prize despite their massive commercial success.\n\nThis year, Smith received a nomination for song of the year for Unholy \u2013 their collaboration with German pop star Kim Petras \u2013 and pop/R&B act, one of the genre categories first introduced in 2022, which will be decided via a public vote on TikTok from 19 January.\n\nStyles joins first-time nominees Wet Leg in leading the nominations for this year\u2019s Brit awards with four nods apiece. The breakout Isle of Wight indie duo and the ubiquitous pop icon and former One Direction member will go head to head in the category for album of the year, joined by fellow multiple nominees the 1975, Stormzy and producer Fred Again.\n\nWet Leg had not yet released their debut album at the time of the 2022 Brit awards: their self-titled effort, released on the independent label Domino, was hailed by the Guardian as \u201ca collection of 90s and 00s-era indie that is by turns dreamy, lush, hooky and thunderous, and layered with lyrics saturated with millennial disaffection, anxiety and overwhelm\u201d. They have been nominated for five awards at this year\u2019s Grammys, which takes place a week prior to the Brit awards.\n\nWomen-led acts made up 33% of the overall nominations. Following Wet Leg, the only other female artists to receive multiple nods are producer Eliza Rose, whose collaboration with Interplanetary Criminal, Baddest of Them All, was a smash hit in summer 2022, and saw her nominated for song of the year and best dance act; rock duo Nova Twins, nominated for group of the year and best alternative/rock act, and songwriter Cat Burns, nominated for song of the year and best pop/R&B act.\n\nEliza Rose and Interplanetary Criminal: BOTA \u2013 video\n\nLast year, Little Simz won the best new artist prize, despite having released her debut album six years prior; however, she only became eligible for the award after her 2021 album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert became her first to place in the UK albums chart, reaching No 4. This year, the rapper Kojey Radical appears in a similar position: he has been active since 2014, but his 2022 album Reasons to Smile was his first chart placing, reaching No 11.\n\nThe best new artist category is also notable for the inclusion of British-Japanese pop star Rina Sawayama. In 2020, she highlighted that she would be ineligible for the Brit awards and the Mercury prize, both run by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI): born in Japan and raised in the UK since the age of four, she does not hold a British passport but has indefinite leave to remain. In February 2021, the BPI changed the rules to stipulate that artists who have been permanently resident in the UK for five years will qualify for British categories. Sawayama was previously nominated for the 2021 Rising Star award.\n\nThere are first-time nominations for Wet Leg, Nova Twins, Bad Boy Chiller Crew, Eliza Rose, LF System, Kim Petras, Blackpink, Fireboy DML, Gayle, Jack Harlow, Lost Frequencies and Bonobo.\n\nIn the international categories, Beyonc\u00e9, Lizzo and Taylor Swift lead the pack with two nominations apiece.\n\nOther noteworthy nominations include Bradford bassline collective Bad Boy Chiller Crew, up for group of the year \u2013 and liable to add some welcome chaos to the live broadcast \u2013 Eurovision star Sam Ryder for best new artist, and Ed Sheeran and Elton John\u2019s 2021 festive hit, Merry Christmas, for best song.\n\nBritish girl band Flo were previously announced as winners of the Rising Star award. The prizes for producer and songwriter of the year will be announced at a later date.\n\nThis year\u2019s Brit awards will be presented by comedian Mo Gilligan and take place live at the London O2 Arena on 11 February.

The Welsh band, currently made up of Kelly Jones, Richard Jones, Jamie Morrison and Adam Zindani, are hit the road later in 2022 in support of their new album.\n\nBut how did Stereophonics get famous? And how did they get their band name? We've taken a trip down memory lane to pull out the band's biggest moments right here.\n\nStereophonics: How did they get famous?\n\n1992: The band is born Kelly and Stuart lived on the same street in Cwmaman, Wales, and began jamming together as teenagers, recording a demo under the name Zephyr. After going their separate ways, Kelly and Stuart reunited a few years later, bringing in Richard Jones as bass guitarist - and thus, the line-up was complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1992, the trio - then known as Tragic Love Company - began to write together, performing in working men's clubs before landing a gig at the Borderline Club in London. They were spotted by producers Marshall Bird and Steve Bush, and recorded demo 'A Thousand Trees'.\n\n1992 - 1996: Career beginnings and name change Promoter Wayne Coleman organised gigs in South Wales after hearing their demo, and whilst he loved the music - he hated the band name, and said they wouldn't play if they kept it. He then spotted a gramophone manufacturer called Falcon Stereophonic, and the band became The Stereophonics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played the Coliseum Theatre in nearby Aberdare with Catatonia, and were approached by John brand afterwards who immediately became their manager. Just two months later, they were the first artists to sign to label V2, dropping 'The' from the band name.\n\n1997: Debut album and BRIT Award The band's debut album 'Word Gets Around' was released in August 1997, spawning singles 'A Thousand Trees', 'Local Boy in the Photograph' and 'Traffic' to name but a few. In 1998, they won the Best New Group BRIT Award, and released 'The Bartender and the Thief' - the first single from their follow-up, 'Performance and Cocktails', which in turn was released in March 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band played to 50,000 people at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea that year, and also collaborated with Welsh legend Tom Jones on a cover of 'Mama Told Me Not To Come'. They toured Europe, Australia and America in 1999, and performed at Cardiff Castle - later released on DVD.\n\n2001: 'Have A Nice Day' After headlining Reading and Leeds in 2000, third album 'Just Enough Education to Perform' was released in 2001, featuring two of their most famous songs: 'Have a Nice Day' and a cover of 'Handbags and Gladrags', which was included in the re-release in 2002. The band performed a two-day festival, 'A Day at the Races', at Donington Park and Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to promote the album, and also headlined Glastonbury Festival in 2002, as well as V Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band put out their fourth album 'You Gotta Go There to Come Back' in 2003, spawning singles 'Maybe Tomorrow', 'Madame Helga' and 'Since I Told You It's Over'. This was the last album to feature drummer Stuart Cable, who was let go from the band in September 2003. They also had their first headline slot at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2004, which they returned to in 2009.\n\n2005: A new line-up Stereophonics released their fifth album 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' in 2005, the first to feature new drummer, Javier Weyler. The album's single 'Dakota' became their first UK Number 1, and they performed that year at Live 8 in Hyde Park, London.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly pictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009.\n\n2007: Kelly goes it alone Kelly also released his first solo album, 'Only the Names Have Been Changed', in 2007. He explained how it came about, \"We were recording the sixth Stereophonics album... And in-between takes I started doing these songs off the cuff. Three or four tracks in I realised that this could actually be something... Strange how it's always little things that makes big things happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly is pictured performing at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2007 - 2010: \u2018Pull The Pin\u2019 'Pull the Pin' was released in October 2007, spawning single 'It Means Nothing' which was written about the London 7/7 attack. Kelly told The Guardian it was \"about the feeling of unease in the city and people realising what was important in their lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey performed at the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver, and released seventh album 'Keep Calm and Carry On', playing a UK tour throughout 2010 to promote it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band are pictured here at a session for Absolute Radio in 2009.\n\n2010: Stuart Cable's death Sadly, former member Stuart Cable passed away in June 2010, and Kelly decided to take a break from writing and releasing albums every two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band released song 'Before Anyone Knew Our Name' in 2017 in memory of Stuart. Kelly said of the song, \"I think, you know, Stuart left the band and we were still friends for seven years. And then he passed away tragically, and of course people have opinions about what happened and all this sort of stuff. We kept it very private because we were like brothers.\"\n\n2009: Isle of Wight Festival We met the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2009, where they kindly signed a guitar for us. It's still up on the wall.\n\n2011: New music and another personnel change The band announced on Facebook in 2011 that they were back in the studio, but in 2012 announced that Javier had left the group. Jamie Morrison of The Noisettes replaced him, and they released eighth album 'Graffiti on the Train' in March 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at Hyde Park in 2012 at the Olympics Opening Ceremony concert.\n\n2012: Isle of Wight Festival Our presenter Sarah Champion caught up with Kelly backstage at the Isle of Wight festival 2012 and the pair chatted away in our camper van. As you do.\n\n2015: 'Keep the Village Alive' Stereophonics impressively released a ninth album in September 2015, entitled 'Keep the Village Alive' which topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained singles 'C'est la Vie' and 'I Wanna Get Lost with You'. They also performed a set for us at the Dingwalls venue in Camden (pictured).\n\n2016: Backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival We had a chat with the band backstage at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016 - but there was a slight mishap when guitarist Adam Zindani fell through the deck chair...\n\n2016: Backstage at Isle of Wight Festival take two Thankfully, we were able to get Adam a different chair and complete the interview... Oops!\n\n2017: 'Scream Above the Sounds' The band made their 10th album in 2017, releasing 'Scream Above the Sounds' in October. This realised Kelly's dream that they would put out their 10th studio album in the 20th anniversary year of their debut, instead of releasing a Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured here performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2016.\n\n2019: 'Kind' But they didn't stop there, getting straight back in the studio to record their eleventh album, 'Kind', which was released in October 2019 and reached Number 1 in the UK. They also embarked on their tour to promote the album, kicking off in Liverpool on 18th January and concluding in Cardiff on 15th March.\n\n2020: Kelly Jones 'Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day' 2020 saw frontman Kelly Jones release his album 'Don't Let The Devil Take Another Day'. The work contained 21 reworked tracks from throughout the Stereophonics' career, and even had its own documentary! The 90-minute feature tells the heartfelt story of the Stereophonics frontman/songwriter, following his personal uphill battle as he rediscovered his voice.\n\n2022: Stereophonics release 12th album 'Oochya!' and UK tour On 6th September 2021, Stereophonics announced that their 12th studio album will be titled 'Oochya!', and released it on Friday 4th March 2022! They later went on a huge tour to support the album's release throughout March and April.\n\n2023: Far From Saints Kelly teamed up with Austin's Patty Lynn and Dwight Baker to create new band Far From Saints, who released their debut single 'Let's Turn This Back Around' in January 2023. They're planning to release their album later this year and also preparing to tour the new music.\n\n\n\nNOW WATCH: Kelly Jones \u2013 Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day (Documentary Teaser)\n\nYou can hear Stereophonics on the Absolute Radio playlist.\n\nNow read:\n\nStereophonics: All your questions answered\n\nThe changing sound of Arctic Monkeys' albums through the years\n\nFeeder: A guide to the anthemic indie-rockers\n\nHow to listen to Absolute Radio:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio on DAB nationwide, on our free app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen, via your smart speaker (\u201cPlay Absolute Radio\u201d) and on Freeview, Sky, and Virgin Media TV."}, {"url": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/entertainment/2022/02/22/its-like-starting-all-over-again--stereophonics-kelly-jones-on-getting-back-to-work/", "page_content": "Stereophonics 2021\n\nGigs were axed, tour plans postponed and the cycle of album-tour-album-tour that had been normal throughout his adult life was brutally curtailed.\n\nCovid put the music industry out of business \u2013 or, as good as \u2013 as we were told to stay home, not mix and definitely not stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 10,000 other like-minded souls as we sang anthemic tunes at the top of our voices.\n\nAnd now we\u2019ve got a pass. Live is back and Stereophonics can get back to business. There\u2019s a new album, Oochya!, due on March 4 while an arena tour this spring will work its way to Birmingham\u2019s Resorts World Arena on April 2. Stadium dates will follow when the band play Cardiff\u2019s Principality Stadium for two nights in June. 60,000 will flock to see them each night and the God of Welsh music, Tom Jones, will be their support. It sure feels good to be back.\n\nThe signs are good. Stereophonics\u2019 new single Forever, the third instalment from Oochya, is a magnificent slice of radio-friendly pop-rock, the type of tune that made us fall in love with the band when their debut, Word Gets Around, dropped 25 years ago. Ten million record sales followed.\n\nForever followed the previously released Hanging On Your Hinges and Do Ya Feel My Love?, which received widespread national radio support added to A-lists across all key networks, and has now received over two million streams across all platforms.\n\nForever reminds us why Stereophonics have been one of the cornerstones of British music for a quarter of a century. It oozes with glistening guitar and sweeping vocal melodies, paired with romantic storytelling. A reflective track that evokes freedom and the open road, the bridge builds to a euphoric chorus where frontman Kelly Jones is heard bellowing \u201cI wish I could fly away forever, I wish I could take away the pain from you and release you\u201d. Letting go is felt in the heights of his singing, as much as it is when Kelly puts pen to paper.\n\nKelly says: \u201c\u2018Forever\u2019 is about escapism. It\u2019s about longing for a freedom for someone and taking away the pain they\u2019re going through, it\u2019s about taking a bullet for them. It\u2019s about wanting to free the ones you love of pain, but we can\u2019t \u2013 life\u2019s pain is where we find growth. So the song has a lot wrapped up in it. People are feeling a lot of that these days.\u201d\n\nOochya! calls upon certain tones, feelings and themes that\u2019ll resonate with fans young and old alike. Kelly Jones explains: \u201cIt\u2019s quite an emotional record. At times it\u2019s very nostalgic. The whole album is melodic. You put it on and it\u2019s one of those albums you don\u2019t really want to turn off because it keeps going onto different styles and the songs hold your attention. It shows a lot of styles of the band.\u201d\n\nWith Oochya!, Kelly Jones continues to cement his place amongst the great British songwriters. Having now achieved seven UK Number 1 albums, 10 Top 10 albums, 23 Platinum Sales Awards, 8.5 million albums sold in the UK alone, five BRIT Award nominations and one BRIT Award win, Stereophonics stand as undeniable giants of British music.\n\nJones is pleased with the reaction to his new work. \u201cI had the lyrics for Forever for quite a long time, years back, but it didn\u2019t fit on anything until now. I don\u2019t think of songs as being old or new, some carry over to the next project depending on how they do or don\u2019t fit in. It\u2019s dressed up in a very poetic way. It came out really well.\u201d\n\nOochya! is a more diverse and eclectic collection of songs that we might previously have expected. Lockdown gave Jones the opportunity to explore the band in a new way.\n\n\u201cThe record is a collection of lots of different styles of music. There are songs written recently, some songs didn\u2019t find a home, some songs were begun and not completed. They take people through rock\u2019n\u2019roll stuff, there\u2019s darker stuff, there\u2019s soul stuff. There\u2019s a lot of different sides of what the band is capable of. It wasn\u2019t intended to be an album. I booked a session and we recorded the guts of it in seven days. We had a good time because we hadn\u2019t seen each other for a long time. I brought it back to work on it with the guy I\u2019d worked with on Performance and Cocktails.\u201d\n\nOochya! wasn\u2019t the only new arrival during lockdown. Jones also welcomed his fourth child. A notable family man, who gives his kids as-normal-as-possible an upbringing, he was delighted to become a father again.\n\n\u201cI had my fourth child in the lockdown. So most of our time was with the kids. I have kids from 17 downwards. They\u2019ve all got things to do like college and GCSEs so lockdown was all about that, really.\n\n\u201cLockdown is weird because singing itself was a huge release. I wasn\u2019t doing it. It became quite a strange thing for a year. It was the first time we stopped. Physically we stopped. It was the first time in 25 years I wasn\u2019t going from town to town or country to country. I learned a lot about myself and did a lot of work on myself.\u201d\n\nThere were other projects, including the remarkable and heartfelt documentary, Don\u2019t Let The Devil Take Another Day. The film told the human story of one of Britain\u2019s most-loved artists who, when confronted with a revelation that had threatened to undermine his career and future music making, rediscovers his distinctive voice and experiences a remarkable 2019.\n\nThe episode was transformative. Jones had, after all, been singing on stage since the age of 12. From the working men\u2019s clubs of the Welsh valleys, to headlining Glastonbury with his band Stereophonics, to 20 years of sold-out arena tours, he had released more than 150 songs, across 11 albums, and counted such heroes as Bob Dylan and David Bowie as fans of his music.\n\nA personal uphill battle that remained secret from the public, however, Kelly\u2019s recovery was recorded for that film, providing a triumph over adversity and offering hope in unprecedented times. A beautifully authentic, life-affirming and inspiring story, it was Jones at his best.\n\n\u201cThat project came around when I was looking at solo shows. I\u2019ve always had an interest in doing some solo shows where I can be in an environment and communicate better with the audience. I wanted to get down and deliver those songs in a very different way and tell a few anecdotes in between and bring them back up in the storytelling. You had to be completely fully present, it\u2019s like climbing a mountain face. If you lost your concentration for a minute, you\u2019d mess it up. You couldn\u2019t go into autopilot on any level. There were 20 shows and it was amazing working with different musicians.\n\n\u201cIt was out of my comfort zone. We did six shows with Just Enough Education To Perform, where we talked about it. I could feel my guts going and I was getting tight. You feel like you\u2019re not doing something you are familiar with. I think that\u2019s a good sign. Going forward, I want to do something different. My passion for the band won\u2019t go away, though, both things are important.\u201d\n\nJones has enjoyed a remarkable career and is happy to be back. His hunger and passion are undiminished by the past two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very fortunate. We\u2019ve had lots of great moments. All our idols who we brought records from, they took us on the road, from the Stones to U2 and the Chilli Peppers. We were really lucky to be able to have five minutes with those people and let them tell us a story, or to just be in the same room as them. To watch the Stones warm up before a show is ridiculous. It never gets normal. I still feel like that kid in a pub, playing covers. You learn a lot. You learn from being around them.\u201d\n\nThere will be more albums after this one and Jones doesn\u2019t rule out eventually releasing his own solo work \u2013 something that fans would welcome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never written a studio album for myself but the solo tour and releasing the live record was received really well. So going forward I have another record coming out at some point this year, with two of the guys from that tour \u2013 The Wind And The Wave \u2013 I\u2019ve made an album with them, that\u2019s Country and Americana. I think they\u2019ll start releasing some of those songs. I\u2019ve got some ideas for things I write on the piano. I feel there\u2019s some stuff outside the \u2019Phonics camp.\u201d\n\nFor now, he\u2019s thrilled that the pandemic is passing and there\u2019s a new album to promote and a tour to look forward to. The connection with fans never becomes tiresome.\n\n\u201cI like getting back to the band. That\u2019s what makes it special. It\u2019s been a great response to the new album. It feels like starting fresh all over again.\n\n\u201cThe album is a mixture. It\u2019s got some beautiful songs. There\u2019s some great rock\u2019n\u2019roll songs. There\u2019s dark stuff. It\u2019s like a greatest hits that people haven\u2019t heard.\n\n\u201cThe tour will be great. We\u2019re doing the stage designs now and using some of the pop art stuff that we\u2019ve got on the cover. We\u2019re going to do some new songs from the album then there\u2019ll be all the big hits. Twenty-five years back then felt like a long time. But it\u2019s gone by very, very fast. We just wanted a catalogue that stood the test of time.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.radiox.co.uk/news/brit-awards/can-you-believe-these-bands-never-won-brit-award/", "page_content": "Can You Believe These Bands Have Never Won A BRIT Award?\n\nWell, not yet, anyway.

(US stars Miley Cyrus and Normani make guest appearances in the song category.)\n\nAll five of the nominees for the top prize, best British album, are solo male artists: Stormzy, Michael Kiwanuka, Lewis Capaldi, Dave and Harry Styles. Of the 198 albums on the longlist for best British album \u2013 drawn up from chart successes and record label submissions \u2013 which are then voted on by the Brits Academy of music industry figures to create the shortlist, only 36 were by women or female-fronted acts.\n\nThe Brits\u2019 recognition of musicians of colour is vastly improved following the \u201cBritsSoWhite\u201d criticisms of recent years. More than half of the best album and British male and female nominees are non-white, partly due to the good health of British rap and R&B music this year, but also due to the increased diversity of the Brits Academy in a 2016 shakeup that brought in 700 new members. Those changes also made the gender split of voters almost equal, but the skewed gender balance in this year\u2019s nominations will raise questions about how female British talent is being nurtured.\n\nBest album and best British male nominee \u2026 Harry Styles. Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PA\n\nNominees for best British group \u2013 long a bastion for male artists \u2013 were also all men: Coldplay, Foals, Bring Me the Horizon, Bastille and the rap duo D-Block Europe. None of those artists received any other nominations, and it\u2019s only the second time in Brits history that no group has been nominated for album of the year, the first time being in 2018.\n\nSouth London rapper Dave, and Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi were the most nominated artists, with four each \u2013 best album, British male, new artist and song. Each of them had a very successful 2019. Dave won the Mercury prize for his album, Psychodrama, a candid, often bleak exploration of race, poverty, family and mental strife, which topped the UK charts. \u201cWhat an honour, and what a way to end the most incredible year. I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he said. His song nomination was for Location, featuring Burna Boy, the Nigerian artist who also picks up a nomination in the best international male category alongside Bruce Springsteen, Dermot Kennedy, Post Malone and Tyler, the Creator.\n\nCapaldi topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with his power ballad Someone You Loved, nominated in the song category, which was the biggest-selling song of 2019 in the UK (accounting for streams and downloads). His album, Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent, was also the UK\u2019s biggest selling album.\n\nBest international female solo artist nominee \u2026 Ariana Grande. Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision\n\nChasing them with three nominations each are Mabel, the daughter of Neneh Cherry who had two Top 10 hits in 2019, and Stormzy, who will be much fancied after a blockbuster year in which he headlined Glastonbury and topped the singles chart three times. The Croydon-raised rapper will be hoping to add a second album of the year award, having previously won in 2018. Harry Styles continues a strong post-One Direction career with two nominations \u2013 best album and best British male \u2013 with soul singer Michael Kiwanuka also receiving two in the same categories.\n\nThe best British female category is split between chart-friendly pop \u2013 Mabel, balladeer Freya Ridings and R&B star Mahalia \u2013 and the more experimental artists Charli XCX and FKA twigs. \u201cIt\u2019s really surreal to be nominated for 3 awards this year,\u201d Mabel said. \u201cThird year in a row to be nominated so fingers crossed it\u2019s the 3rd time lucky and I can take one home this year.\u201d\n\nArtists who may feel snubbed include Taylor Swift, left out of the international female artist running in favour of Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Camila Cabello, Lana Del Rey and Lizzo, and Ed Sheeran, who despite releasing a new album in 2019 earned only one nomination, for his No 1 song with Justin Bieber, I Don\u2019t Care.\n\nLiam Gallagher, Rita Ora, Mumford and Sons, the Chemical Brothers, Rod Stewart, the Who, Muse and Emeli Sand\u00e9 are among the eligible major British artists who didn\u2019t receive any nominations.\n\nAwards for best video and best international group have been removed for 2020.

Kelly Jones continues to cement his place amongst the great British songwriters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving now achieved eight number 1 albums, 10 top 10 albums, 23 Platinum Sales Awards, 8.5 million albums sold in the UK alone, five BRIT nominations and one BRIT Award win, Stereophonics stand as undeniable giants of British music.\n\nListen to Oochya! below:"}], "Stereophonics won Best British Group in 2002 at the Brit Awards.": [{"url": "http://awardsandwinners.com/category/brit-awards/2002/", "page_content": "2002 BRIT Awards Brit Award for British Male Solo Artist Robbie Williams Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Robbie Williams\n\nAphex Twin\n\nCraig David\n\nElton John\n\nIan Brown\n\nBrit Award for British Female Solo Artist Dido Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Dido\n\nGeri Halliwell\n\nPJ Harvey\n\nSade Adu\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor\n\nBrit Award for British Group Travis Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Travis\n\nGorillaz\n\nJamiroquai\n\nRadiohead\n\nStereophonics\n\nBrit Award for British Breakthrough Act Blue Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Blue\n\nGorillaz\n\nZero 7\n\nMis-Teeq\n\nSo Solid Crew\n\nBrit Award for British Album of the Year Dido Honored for : No Angel Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Dido No Angel\n\nCraig David Born to Do It\n\nGorillaz Gorillaz\n\nRadiohead Kid A\n\nTravis The Invisible Band\n\nBrit Award for International Male Solo Artist Shaggy Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Shaggy\n\nBob Dylan\n\nDr. Dre\n\nRyan Adams\n\nWyclef Jean\n\nBrit Award for International Female Solo Artist Kylie Minogue Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Kylie Minogue\n\nAlicia Keys\n\nAnastacia\n\nBj\u00f6rk\n\nNelly Furtado\n\nBrit Award for British Single S Club Honored for : Don't Stop Movin' Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work S Club Don't Stop Movin'\n\nGeri Halliwell It's Raining Men\n\nHear'Say Pure and Simple\n\nRobbie Williams Eternity / The Road To Mandalay\n\nAtomic Kitten Whole Again\n\nBrit Award for International Breakthrough Act The Strokes Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work The Strokes\n\nAnastacia\n\nThe Avalanches\n\nLinkin Park\n\nNelly Furtado\n\nBrit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music Sting Brit Award for International Album Kylie Minogue Honored for : Fever Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Kylie Minogue Fever\n\nAlicia Keys Songs in A minor\n\nDaft Punk Discovery\n\nDestiny's Child Survivor\n\nThe Strokes Is This It\n\nBrit Award for International Group Destiny's Child Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Daft Punk\n\nLimp Bizkit\n\nR.E.M.\n\nThe Strokes\n\nDestiny's Child\n\nBrit Award for Pop Act Westlife Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Westlife\n\nBlue\n\nHear'Say\n\nKylie Minogue\n\nS Club\n\nBrit Award for British Dance Act Basement Jaxx Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work Basement Jaxx\n\nGorillaz\n\nCraig David\n\nFatboy Slim\n\nFaithless\n\nBrit Award for British Video So Solid Crew Honored for : 21 Seconds Nominations \u00bb Nominee Nominated Work So Solid Crew 21 Seconds\n\nFatboy Slim Weapon of Choice\n\nBasement Jaxx Where's Your Head At?\n\nDido Thank You\n\nTravis Sing\n\n"}, {"url": "http://awardsandwinners.com/winner/?mid=/m/015_8p", "page_content": "Awards by Stereophonics\n\nCheck all the awards nominated and won by Stereophonics.\n\n2014\n\nNominations 2014 \u00bb Award Nominated Nominated Work World Music Award for World\u2019s Best Album Graffiti on the Train\n\n\n\n2005\n\nNominations 2005 \u00bb Award Nominated Nominated Work Kerrang!

Last night the Scottish singer came up trumps again at the Brit awards with two major wins - best female solo singer and best album.\n\nSand\u00e9's debut album Our Version Of Events became the most popular album of 2012, selling 1.4m copies. Alexandra Topping writes today:\n\nThe Scottish singer, whose debut album Our Version of Events overtook Adele's 21 to become the bestselling album of 2012 in September, accepted awards for British album of the year and best female solo artist. A year ago, she was presciently named rising star at the Brits in the critics' choice awards. With only the Beatles spending more consecutive weeks in the charts, Sand\u00e9 has been the standout success story of the year, with her brand of turbo-powered soul and R&B filling the airwaves and propping up album sales in the UK.\n\nWinning best single for the James Bond theme Skyfall, Adele accepted her award via video from Los Angeles where the singer is busy rehearsing for a performance at the upcoming Oscars ceremony on Sunday. Mumford and Sons won best British group and Coldplay were named best live act.\n\nBeating Rita Ora, Ben Howard was a surprise winner of the best British breakthrough act, the singer also took home an award for best British male solo artist.\n\nAnd it wouldn't be the Brits without an appearance from a teen pop sensation - One Direction were awarded a Brit for global success (for international sales in 2012) which as Alexis Petridis points out:\n\neven the most devoted opponent of their Simon Cowell-assisted brand of pop would have a hard time arguing that they aren't a global success, given that they've sold about 22m records worldwide.\n\nThere were also international honours at last night's ceremony. Lana Del Ray received a Brit for best international female solo artist, The Black Keys received best international group and Frank Ocean won best international male solo artist.\n\nThe critics' choice award, last year handed to Sand\u00e9 herself, went to Tom Odell this year.

In fact, there has been no shortage of British rock bands, even fast-forward several decades and into the 2000s\u2014some with unforgettable hits, others with not-so-memorable ones, but always there was something new.\n\nBut who were those that were most influential and literally rocked the airwaves with their sound? Read on to learn about 11 of the greatest and most famous British Rock Bands of the 2000s.\n\n1. Coldplay\n\nOur first British rock band, Coldplay, emerged on the music scene in 1997. They played mainly small gigs before signing with Parlophone. Soon after, the group released their first album, Parachutes, which won them a Grammy award and an award for Best British Album of the Year 2001.\n\nTheir second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, released in 2002, is considered one of the greatest records of all time, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame even has it on their 200 Definitive Albums list.\n\nColdplay has since sold over 100 million albums and is widely known as one of the best and most influential indie rock groups of the 21st century.\n\n2. Arctic Monkeys\n\nConsisting initially of Alex Turner, Jamie Cook, Nick O\u2019Malley, and Matt Helders, Arctic Monkeys started in a garage in 2002 and began recording demos shortly after.\n\nFor their demo album Beneath the Boardwalk, they recorded 18 songs. These were burned on blank CDs and distributed to fans outside their concerts. This kind of promotion helped gain them a following after fans began file-sharing their songs.\n\nAfter releasing their first official album, Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not, in 2006, it quickly rose to the top of the UK charts and became one the fastest-selling indie rock albums by a British artist.\n\n3. Muse\n\nHailing from Devon, Muse began making their mark on the rock music scene in 1998 when they began playing gigs all around London. The following year, they released their debut album and started to gain popularity.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Muse produced three chart-topping albums\u2014Absolution, Black Holes and Revelations, and The Resistance. These debuted their unique take on alternative rock music.\n\nLead singer and multi-instrumentalist Matt Bellamy enjoyed experimenting with instruments and sounds, and this experimentation won the band several awards over the decades, including two Grammys, Brit awards, and several MTV music awards.\n\n4. Radiohead\n\nFormed in 1985, Radiohead was already a popular band name in the UK by the time the 2000s rolled in. However, it wasn\u2019t until their third album, OK Computer, in 1997 that the band gained international fame. This would help push them to even greater heights in the next decade.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Radiohead released four albums\u2014Kid A, Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief, and In Rainbows. Each ranked #1 in the UK charts, and all won the band Grammy Awards. Some even landed a place in Rolling Stone\u2018s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.\n\nRadiohead has not stopped there, however. They\u2019ve continued to sell charting singles and albums worldwide even until now.\n\n5. Stereophonics\n\nFormed in 1992 in a small village in Wales, Stereophonics rapidly topped the UK charts with the release of their debut album. However, mainstream success did not come until near the end of the \u201990s.\n\nFrom then on, the band constantly hit #1 on the charts with their albums, like 2001\u2019s Just Enough Education to Perform, and 2003\u2019s You Gotta Go There to Come Back. Some of their singles also reached the top five, with \u201cDakota\u201d ranking at the top in 2005.\n\nStereophonics also spent most of the 2000s touring Europe with other big names like Blur and Oasis, which helped push them further up the popularity ladder.\n\n6. Kaiser Chiefs\n\nAn indie band from Leeds, Kaiser Chiefs, had a rough start to their journey into stardom. The band began creating music under the name Parva. After several failed attempts to sign a record deal and the loss of their label, the band decided to change their name to Kaiser Chiefs.\n\nIn 2004, they began performing live across the UK, and Kaiser Chiefs quickly became best known for their live performances and hit songs like \u201cRuby.\u201d By 2007, the band was playing sold-out shows of 30,000 audiences.\n\nKaiser Chiefs are still active today and has recently released a single, \u201cHow 2 Dance,\u201d in 2022.\n\n7. Kasabian\n\nAnother one of Britain\u2019s well-known live performers is the band Kasabian. They were first known as Saracuse, but after signing with BMG, they changed their name to what they\u2019re currently named.\n\nSince Kasabian\u2019s first album release in 2004, the band has been playing shows and putting out continuous hit records. They\u2019ve won several awards, mostly for their live performances.\n\nKasabian continues to rock stages all across Europe today. They receive many reviews calling them the best live performance in the UK and have made a name for themselves as a must-see act.\n\n8. Blur\n\nOur next British band, Blur, was formed in the late 1980s. During the \u201990s, they had chart-topping albums. However, they struggled to keep their fanbase growing. Each album released differed from the last in an attempt to find the right sound for the band.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Blur released only one album. \u201cThink Tank\u201d was dropped in 2003, and the group\u2019s popularity increased more as they began experimenting with sound again. The album featured Blur\u2019s most unique sound, which was a mix of soft electronica with some classic rock sound.\n\nThe band then went on a hiatus as members went on to pursue personal plans. Then in 2009, Blur reunited for a concert and decided to tour again.\n\n9. Keane\n\nFrom East Sussex, alternative rock band Keane came onto the rock scene already at #1 with their first album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004. This album rapidly topped the charts, receiving the title of one of the best rock albums of all time.\n\nTheir second album, Under the Iron Sea, was equally as successful, earning the band a spot in Britain\u2019s best next to bands like the Beatles, Oasis, and Radiohead.\n\nIn 2009, Keane became the first band to ever perform live in 3D on their world tour. In 2013, the band decided to split for some time to work on solo projects and didn\u2019t reunite until 2019.\n\n10. Manic Street Preachers\n\nIn 1986, a group of friends started playing music together and named themselves Manic Street Preachers. By the time the 2000s came in, they had already released five studio albums, with one at the top of the UK charts.\n\nThey had already attracted a large following throughout the UK for their wild lifestyles and media coverage. In the 2000s, Manic Street Preachers continued to ride their wave of success.\n\nThough the albums dropped during that decade were not chart-toppers, they were all within the top 15, and their singles were in the top 20s, with 2000\u2019s \u201cThe Masses Against the Classes\u201d their top hit.\n\nManic Street Preachers are still touring today, and they have made a name for themselves as one of the best bands to come out of Wales.\n\n11. The Verve\n\nAn influencing alternative rock band in the \u201990s, The Verve began having internal conflicts and disbanded in 1999. However, the band reunited with its original lineup in 2007 and released the album Forth.\n\nFans were ecstatic. The reunion brought The Verve almost immediately to the #1 spot on the UK charts, and their 2007 tour announcement sold out within minutes.\n\nThe excitement of this get-together was short-lived, though. In 2009, The Verve decided to disband for the third time as many of the members pursued solo careers.\n\nSumming Up Our List Of 2000s British Rock Bands\n\nAnd there you have it, dear readers, the best rock bands from the UK during the 2000s. If you\u2019ve listened to any of their music, you would know why they have been considered influential.\n\nEach of their music styles and techniques are unique, but they all stem from one genre loved by many: rock music.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our list. As mentioned, there were so many popular British rock bands during the 2000s, so we might have missed a few. Let us know who, and we\u2019ll add them!"}, {"url": "https://www.radiox.co.uk/global-awards/stereophonics-honoured-global-special-award/", "page_content": "Stereophonics honoured with Global Special Award\n\namie Morrison, Adam Zindani, Kelly Jones and Richard Jones of Stereophonics during The Global Awards 2020.

The band also closed the show with a 20 minute set that featured their hits Dakota, C'est La Vie, Bust This Town and Maybe Tomorrow.\n\nIn a special video, stars such as Sir Tom Jones and James Dean Bradfield from Manic Street Preachers paid tribute to the band's incredible career. Sir Tom said: \"\"All the best boys, congratulations. I remember when you were opening for someone else, but let's not get into that. You're from Cwmaman, I'm from Pontypridd. Big town, Pontypridd.\"\n\nIt was the second award for the Welsh band, who also walked home with Best Indie, beating off stiff competition from Sam Fender, The 1975, Twenty One Pilots and Florence + The Machine.\n\nStereophonics in 2018: Adam Zindani, Rchard Jones, Kelly Jones and Jamie Morrison.

Picture: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images\n\nStereophonics burst onto the scene with the single Local Boy In The Photograph, a moving tale of life in South Wales, and the accompanying debut album, Word Gets Around, made the Top 10 in the summer of 1997.\n\nStereophonics - Local Boy In The Photograph\n\nA triple platinum seller, the LP would spawn the hits A Thousand Trees, More Life In A Tramp's Vest and Traffic.\n\nThe trio quickly established themselves as one of the key post-Britpop artists, headlining a huge show at Cardiff Castle in June 1998. Their second album Performance And Cocktails hitting the top of the album charts on its release in March 1999.\n\nIt was the first of five consecutive number 1 albums for Stereophonics - they also made the top with Keep the Village Alive in 2015 and Kind in 2019.\n\n2005's Language. Sex. Violence. Other? gave the world Stereophonics' first number one single: Dakota, a wistful, passionate tune that brought the Phonics to the US airwaves and beyond and went Platinum in the UK.\n\nStereophonics - Dakota (Official Video)\n\nStereophonics have gone on to have ten Top 10 singles, have sold over ten million albums across the world and have headlined Reading & Leeds, V, Isle Of Wight and Glastonbury festivals among many others.\n\n\n\nThey have won the BRIT Award for Best British Breakthrough Act and the Nordoff Robbins Silver Clef Icon Award.\n\nNow, Kelly, Richard, Adam Zindani and Jamie Morrison see in the 2020s with their eleventh studio album, Kind, a huge UK tour and festival appearances across Europe.\n\nThey are one of British rock's most respected, hard-working and loved bands with a back catalogue full of incredible songs like Just Looking, Maybe Tomorrow, Indian Summer and I Want To Get Lost In You."}, {"url": "https://www.musewiki.org/Brit_Awards", "page_content": "2008\n\nBritish Live Act\n\nThe nominees were chosen by a panel of experts.[1] The winner was chosen by listeners of BBC Radio 2.[1]\n\nMuse were nominated.[2] Also nominated: Arctic Monkeys, Kaiser Chiefs, Klaxons, Take That.[1]Take That won.[1]\n\n2007\n\nBest Album\n\nBlack Holes and Revelations was nominated.[3] Also nominated: Back to Black (Amy Winehhouse), Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (Arctic Monkeys), Alright Still (Lily Allen) and Eyes Open (Snow Patrol).

The artist heads the Brit Awards winners' list for 2012, with 21 selling a copy every seven seconds - and has just won a clutch of Grammys too. Someone Like You has now been seen more than 85m times on YouTube and sales of 21 are already at 17m and expected to top 20m.\n\nThe awards have been going since 1977, when the Best British solo act was Shirley Bassey and the Beatles when a prize for Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - already a decade old then. Now the prize is the major award for British music acts, competing only with the Mercury Award for best album. So, how does the 2012 winner's list compare?\n\nSinger-songwriter Ed Sheeran shared the honours \u2013 also winning two awards, for best British male solo act and best breakthrough act.\n\nSearch for winners by year\n\nBest British single, voted for by the public, was won by One Direction for What Makes You Beautiful. Rihanna \u2013 who performed on the night \u2013 took home best international female award and singer-songwriter Bruno Mars was named best international male solo artist.\n\nLana Del Rey was international breakthrough act, after the huge success of her single Video Games.\n\nOlder groups also succeeded. The Foo Fighters were named best international band while Coldplay took home the prize for best British group. And Blur won the award for outstanding contribution.\n\nThe awards have changed a lot since 1977. In that year, there were only seven categories - now there are 13. Each awards reflects the industry of the time, at least recently. Last year, the winners were Take That and Mumford and Sons; in 2005 it was Joss Stone, the Scissor Sisters and Robbie Williams. Some of the older awards appear to be a little more, er, mainstream: in 2000, Tom Jones won Best British Male Solo Artist.\n\nThe full data is below.

The name was originally a shortened form of \"British\", \"Britain\", or \"Britannia\" (in the early days the awards were sponsored by Britannia Music Club), but subsequently became a backronym for British Record Industry Trusts Show.[2] In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the Classic BRIT Awards, is held in May. The awards were first held in 1977 and originated as an annual event in 1982 under the auspices of the British record industry's trade association, the BPI. In 1989, they were renamed The BRIT Awards.[3] Mastercard has been the long-term sponsor of the event.[4]\n\nBritish popular music awards\n\nExterior of the O 2 Arena in London (host venue since 2011) for the 2020 Brit Awards\n\nThe highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK, the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture, such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury, the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson, the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur, the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls, and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.[5][6][7][8] These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being \u201ca little shambolic, unpredictable and, at times, anarchic\u201d with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and \u201cevolved into a more polished, sanitised affair.\u201d[9]\n\nThe BRIT Awards were broadcast live until 1989, when Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood hosted a widely criticised show in which little went as rehearsed.[10] From 1990 to 2006, the event was recorded and broadcast the following night. From 2007, The BRIT Awards reverted to a live broadcast on British television, on 14 February on ITV.[10] That year, comedian Russell Brand was the host and three awards were dropped from the ceremony: British Rock Act, British Urban Act and British Pop Act.[10] For the last time, on 16 February 2010, Earls Court in London was the venue for The BRITs. The BRIT Awards were held at the O 2 Arena in London for the first time in 2011.[11]\n\nThe BRIT Award statuette given to the winners features Britannia, the female personification of Britain. Since 2011, the statuette has been regularly redesigned by well known British artists, architects, and designers including Vivienne Westwood,[12] Damien Hirst,[13] Tracey Emin,[14] Peter Blake,[15] Zaha Hadid,[16] Anish Kapoor,[17] David Adjaye,[18] Yinka Ilori and Es Devlin,[19] Pam Hogg,[20] and Oluola Slawn.[21] In 1992, KLF opened the show and invited extreme metal band Extreme Noise Terror on stage, complete with flame-throwers, and fired machine gun blanks over the crowd. The group sent a dead sheep to the aftershow party, and later buried their BRIT Award statuette at Stonehenge signifying their abhorrence of the music industry.[9] Robbie Williams holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a solo artist and another five as part of Take That.[22] Girl group Little Mix made history at the Brit Awards 2021, when they became the first female group to receive the award for Best Group at the ceremony after 43 years since it was first introduced.[23]"}]}
