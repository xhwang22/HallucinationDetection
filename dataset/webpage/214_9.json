He served his country as a hero, seeing action in two world wars and accepting the full responsibility of command over Allied air forces during World War II.\n\nArthur Tedder was born on July 11, 1890 in the Scottish town of Glenguin. He began his military career in 1913 when he joined the British Army. In 1916, he transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF), serving during World War I in France from 1915 until 1917 and Egypt from 1918 to 1919. He received his permanent commission in the RAF in 1919 and remained there after the war, serving as a director of training from 1934 to 1936. In 1936, Tedder was promoted to RAF commander in the Far East where he remained until 1938, when he became director general of research in the Air Ministry.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nTedder's early experience with the RAF would prove invaluable during the war years. In his role as commander in the Far East, he would amass even more knowledge of military strategy. One of his first opportunities to apply his strong planning skills came in May 1941, when Tedder participated in the British evacuation of Crete. As German strength grew in the Middle East, British troops were forced back toward Canea and an evacuation of Crete was ordered. While the Royal Air Force at Egypt, under Tedder's command, promised fighter cover for the ships evacuating British ground troops, support was limited by the fact that few aircraft at his disposal had the necessary range to fly from Egypt to Crete. The operation suffered many casualties.\n\nIn November 1941, Tedder participated in Operation \"Crusader,\" in Africa. The plans for attack on Tobruk were scheduled for November 23, 1941. On the 19th, Tedder reported to Prime Minister Winston Churchill that the initial air battle of November 18th had gone satisfactorily, although bad weather had adversely affected plans for neutralizing the enemy. He assured Churchill that the weather had also limited German action against the Allies during the first two days of the battle.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, when Germany's General Erwin Rommel launched an attack of Gazala west of Tobruk. Tedder communicated to Churchill that he had foreseen the attack and was ready for it. Rommel's attack on Tobruk failed and his troops were pummeled by Tedder's air forces. Unfortunately, the victory was short-lived, as Rommel turned the tide of battle from defeat to victory. With the loss of the tank battle, an immediate withdrawal of the 1st South African and 50th Division was ordered. The success of that withdrawal was due, in large measure, to the protection of Allied troops by the RAF.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Churchill commended Tedder for his successful direction of the RAF. During August Tedder accompanied Churchill to Moscow where they met with Russian leader, Josef Stalin. Churchill proposed placing British and U.S. air troops at Russia's southern flank as a means of strengthening Russian air power and showing air superiority. Tedder's proposed plan received approval from Churchill with a recommendation that a similar proposal be drafted for presentation to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThe Battle of El Alamein\n\nIn October 1942, the battle against Rommel's forces for El Alamein [in North Africa] was launched. In contrast to battles fought earlier that same year, the British had the advantage of far superior forces. On the ground, Sherman tanks arrived from the United States, outnumbering the equipment of the enemy. In the air, Tedder, now air commander-in-chief in the Middle East, had air squadrons that included U.S., South African, Rhodesian, Australian, Greek, French, and Yugoslav forces assisting the RAF. The planes at his disposal numbered over 1,500, with 1,200 of those based in Egypt and Palestine in support of a ground attack on Alamein. By comparison, German and Italian serviceable aircraft numbered only 350.\n\nTedder applied this superior air capability to harassing the Panzerarmee supply flow, while also protecting the supplies of the Eighth Army. Working closely with the Royal Navy, he extended the harassment of the Panzerarmee's sea-artery supply and aided in the sinking of German supply ships. By September 1942, a third of Germany's supplies had failed to cross the Mediterranean, either sunk or returned to their source. The following month more than half of Germany's supplies failed to arrive. In a memo from Churchill to Tedder, the prime minister commended the commander for his leadership.\n\nThe Casablanca Conference\n\nDuring the Casablanca Conference at the beginning of 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill's combined chiefs of staff agreed that taking Tunis should be the next point of focus. It was at this conference that leadership of the Allied forces was conferred upon General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Naval command was placed under Admiral Cunningham and Tedder was named air marshal. Tedder assumed command of the front in February 1943, with the Battle of Tunisia at its height. Roosevelt suggested that it would be strategically advantageous for the Allies to stress these appointments and ensure that the leader's plans and duties be filtered to the enemy. Churchill agreed, but expressed concern that no favoritism be shown toward Eisenhower at the expense of commanders Alexander and Tedder, lest the general public be discouraged.\n\nThe Italian Campaign\n\nIn May 1943, Tedder, Alexander, and Cunningham met and voiced agreement with Churchill and Brooke that Italy should be invaded. To convince Eisenhower, they met with Eisenhower, Marshall, and Bedell Smith to discuss the proposed taking of the island of Pantilleria as the southern assault on Sicily to begin this campaign.\n\nBy the summer Tedder's command had solidified in preparation for the invasion of Sicily. His forces included those of General Spaatz, U.S. Army Air Force; and Air Marshal Coningham. With a driving need to take ports and airfields early in the attack, Tedder argued to narrow the attack and seize the southeastern group of airfields. This was successfully employed through the use of amphibious load carriers.\n\nAs 1943 came to a close, Churchill proposed to Roosevelt a remodeling of leadership after discussion with Eisenhower, Alexander, and Tedder. For Operation \"Overlord\"-also known as \"D-Day\"-Churchill recommended Tedder as Eisenhower's deputy supreme commander because of the role planned for the air forces. Roosevelt gladly accepted this recommendation. As plans for D-Day began to solidify, Tedder's role became even more vital. Recent experiences had proven that success could best be achieved through a cooperative effort of all the military forces.\n\nD-Day Approached\n\nThe next step was implementing the \"Transportation Plan.\" This operation was designed to use bombers to paralyze the French railway on the eve of Overlord. Eisenhower had worked closely with Tedder in the Mediterranean and he liked and admired the man enormously. Despite some opposition to the plan, he named Tedder to personally supervise the campaign. Tedder identified over 70 railroad targets in France and Belgium, intentionally directing traffic away from lower Normandy in order to maintain secrecy about the invasion site. Although opposition remained strong, Eisenhower was convinced that the Transportation Plan was necessary to the success of Overlord. The success of these attacks, in turn, convinced Tedder that they should be continued into Germany, where the collapse of the German rail system would result in the collapse of its economy.\n\nWith only hours left before the final decision had to be made on whether to begin Operation Overlord, bad weather raged across the English Channel and Eisenhower solicited his subordinates for their opinions. Tedder recommended postponement, concerned that poor visibility would have a devastating affect on the ability of his bombers to provide the cover needed. The decision, however, was to move ahead on June 6.\n\nHistorians generally agree that under the direction of Tedder, the Allied air forces commanded the skies. Their paralyzing effect on the enemy was a decisive factor in getting the Allied troops to shore on June 6. By destroying bridges over the Seine and Loire rivers, they effectively isolated Normandy, forcing the Germans into long detours and endless delays.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Overlord, additional operations were planned to keep the enemy off balance. One of these, which Montgomery had characterized as a major \"break-out,\" resulted in the Allies' failure to take advantage of heavy enemy casualties. In an attempt to break through enemy lines and open the way to Paris, Eisenhower pushed Montgomery to take action and was assured that a \"big show\" would occur on July 9. Montgomery asked for and got air support from Tedder. However, Montgomery's attack failed and he called it off, angering both Eisenhower and Tedder. Two days later, Montgomery again promised an offensive he named Operation \"Goodwood.\" Tedder arranged for a sensational show of support, bringing together 1,600 British and U.S. heavy bombers and 400 medium bombers, dropping a total of 7,800 tons of bombs on German defenses; 2,500 tons sited for the German fortifications at Caen; and 650 tons for Cagny. Tedder carefully coordinated the air attack with ground attacks in order to avoid any lulls that could give the enemy an opportunity to regroup.\n\nThe saturation bombing started the offensive, but it quickly failed. After sustaining heavy losses, Montgomery called it off. Tedder was furious at this second failure and demanded that Montgomery be fired, which did not come to pass.\n\nThe Tide Turns\n\nThroughout the last year of the war, the Allies achieved air superiority and the success of D-Day turned the tide of the war in Europe. In January 1945, Eisenhower sent Tedder to Moscow to seek assistance from the Russians, as a way of relieving pressure on Allied forces in the west. By May a total and unconditional surrender occurred with formal ratification by the German High Command in Berlin. Tedder signed on behalf of Eisenhower, Marshal Zhukov signed for Russia, and Field-Marshal Keitel signed for Germany.\n\nPeacetime Honors\n\nIn 1942, Tedder had been knighted. At the war's end, in 1946, he was elevated to the peerage and named a baron. Tedder served as Great Britain's first peacetime chief of air staff and as a senior member of the Air Council from 1946 until 1950. In 1950, he became chancellor of Cambridge University. Tedder published his memoirs, With Prejudice: The War Memoirs of Marshal of the Royal Air Force, Lord Tedder. in 1966.\n\nTedder was married to Rosalinde Maclary, who died in 1943. At Rosalinde's request Tedder married again, to his young service driver, \"Toppy\" Seton. In his last years he became severely crippled with Parkinson's disease and died at Well Farm in Banstead, Surrey, England, on June 3, 1967.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAmbrose, Stephen E., Citizen Soldiers, Simon & Schuster, 1997.\n\nAmbrose, Stephen E., June 6, 1944, D-Day: The Climactic Battle of World War II, Simon & Schuster, 1994.\n\nBlumenson, Martin, Liberation, Time-Life Books, 1978.\n\nChurchill, Winston S., The Grand Alliance, Houghton, 1950.\n\nChurchill, Winston S., Hinge of Fate, Houghton, 1950.\n\nChurchill, Winston S., Closing the Ring, Houghton, 1950.\n\nChurchill, Winston S., Triumph and Tragedy, Houghton, 1950.\n\nKeegan, John, Six Armies in Normandy, Viking Press, 1982.\n\nLiddell Hart, B.

He joined the Dorsetshire Regiment in 1913 and was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1916. During WW1, he served in France between 1915 and 1917 and then in Egypt until 1919. After the war, he was transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force as a squadron leader. He was promoted to the rank of group captain in 1931, and served as Director of Training from 1934 to 1936. Immediately before the outbreak of the European War, he was the commander of the RAF Eastern Forces and was director general for research in the Air Ministry.\n\nAfter Britain entered WW2, Tedder served as the head of the RAF Middle East Command, which also covered the battlefields in the Mediterranean Sea and in North Africa. While the forces under his command experienced both victories and defeats, his reputation as an effective air commander grew. He was increasingly known for the deployment of \"Tedder Carpet\" tactic, which involves multiple bombers committing a rolling barrage with high explosive and napalm bombs ahead of advancing friendly forces. He was knighted in 1942 and was promoted to the rank of air marshal by the end of the Desert War. He was heavily involved in the planning of the invasion of Sicily and then Normandy. He was named Deputy Supreme Commander in the latter campaign, though he at times found himself without resources because commander of the Allied Air Expeditionary Force Trafford Leigh-Mallory at times deployed forces for objectives that were tactically different than that of Tedder's for the campaign in Normandy. In the last year of the war, he was sent to Russia seeking greater coordination between Russia and the Western Allies, particularly during the Ardennes offensive in the winter of 1944 to 1945. In May 1945, he signed the German surrender instrument on behalf of General Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nTedder lost two family members during the war. His son Richard Tedder died in combat in France during the German invasion. His first wife Rosalinde Maclardy, who was beside him during the Desert War, died in an air crash in Egypt in 1943.\n\nAfter the war, Tedder gained peerage as First Baron Tedder. He served as the Chief of the Air Staff between 1946 and 1950. In 1950, he served as the British representative on the military committee of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Washington, DC, United States. On the civilian side of his life, he was the chancellor of Cambridge University between 1950 and 1967, served some time on the board of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and authored his memoirs and a historical study of the Royal Navy.\n\nAfter several years of struggle with Parkinson's Disease, Tedder passed away in Surrey, England, at the age of 76.\n\n\n\nPromotions:\n\n-Army\n\n2nd Lieutenant: September 2nd, 1913\n\nLieutenant: January 110th, 915\n\n(T) Captain: March 21st, 1916\n\nCaptain: June 13th, 1916\n\n(T) Major: January 1st, 1917\n\n\n\n- RAF\n\nMajor: April 1st, 1918\n\n(T) Lieutenant-Colonel: June 24th, 1918 - April 2nd, 1919\n\nSquadron Leader: August 1st, 1919\n\nWing Commander: January 1st, 1924\n\nGroup Captain: January 1st, 1931\n\nAir Commodore: July 1st, 1934\n\nAir Vice-Marshal: July 1st, 1937\n\nActing Air Marshal: November 29th. 1940\n\n(T) Air Marshal: June 1st, 1941\n\nAir Marshal: April 14th, 1942\n\n(T) Air Chief Marshal: July 1st, 1942\n\nAir Chief Marshal: June 6th, 1945\n\nMarshal of the RAF: September 12 th, 1945\n\nDo you have more information about this person?

He held high command during World War II and after the War he served as Chief of the Air Staff before retiring from the RAF and taking up the Chancellorship of the University of Cambridge.\n\nEarly life\n\nArthur Tedder was born in Scotland at the Glenguin Distillery (now Glengoyne) north of Glasgow in 1890. He was the son of Sir Arthur John Tedder and Emily Charlotte Bryson. His father was distinguished as the Commissioner of the Board of Customs who devised the old age pension scheme. His father's occupation meant that the young Tedder saw different parts of the British Isles, spending 1895 to 1898 in Lerwick on the Shetland Isles and 1899 to 1901 in Elgin, in the County of Moray. In 1902 the family moved to Croydon in Surrey and Tedder attended the Whitgift School until 1909 when he went up to Cambridge. Tedder spent his university years (1909\u201313) at Magdalene College, where he read history. He was awarded a lower second-class honours in June 1912.\n\nTedder spent the summer of 1912 in Berlin studying German. With the start of a new academic year, he decided to return to Magdalene for a fourth year in order that he might prepare himself for a career as a diplomat. During his last year at Magdalene, Tedder gained a reserve commission as a second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment. Later in the academic year Tedder changed his mind, deciding against a diplomatic career.\n\nAfter university, Tedder joined the Colonial Service as a cadet and departed England in February 1914, serving in the administration in Fiji. He did not find colonial life in Fiji to his liking and when war was declared, found a reason to return to England so that he could join the regular Army.\n\nMilitary career\n\nFirst World War\n\nTedder arrived back in England in December 1914. He was commissioned as a regular officer in the Dorsets in January 1915 and was promoted to lieutenant on 10 January. He was posted to a reserve unit at Wyke Regis on the Dorset coast where he seriously injured his knee in February. Tedder was consigned to light duties and although he was posted to Calais in July, he remained unable to carry out full infantry duties. During this time Tedder applied for a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps. In October Tedder was permitted to return to England where he continued to press for a transfer to the Flying Corps.\n\nIn January 1916, Tedder was accepted into the Royal Flying Corps and he first attended the No. 1 School of Aeronautics. In April he attended the Central Flying School where he learned to fly and gained his 'wings'. In June 1916, Tedder served as a pilot with No. 25 Squadron RFC flying the Bristol Scout C on the Western Front. Less than two months later, Tedder was given additional responsibilities as he was made a flight commander on 25 Squadron. The first day of 1917 saw Tedder promoted to major and appointed commander of No. 70 Squadron RFC. Tedder remained on the Western Front and his new squadron was equipped with the Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter. On 25 June 1917, he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 67 Squadron. This new command was in Middle East and although Tedder spent under a year as OC No. 67 Squadron, he remained in Middle East when he was made the commander of the School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping which was based in Egypt. Another change soon followed and on 24 June 1918 Tedder was temporarily promoted to lieutenant colonel in the recently formed RAF and appointed Officer Commanding 38th Wing, also based in Egypt.\n\nInter-war years\n\nAfter the War, Tedder accepted a permanent commission in the new Royal Air Force (RAF) as a squadron leader and commanded Nos 207 and 274 Squadrons, both based at RAF Bircham Newton. No 207 Sqn (equipped with DH9a bombers) was briefly deployed to Turkey in 1922/3 during the Chanak Crisis. No 274 Sqn was equipped with the Handley Page V/1500, the largest RAF bomber of its time. From 1923, Tedder was involved in training, both as a pupil at the RN Staff College and the Imperial Defence College and on the staff at the Directorate of Training. In 1926 as a Wing Commander, he was station commander at RAF Digby and Commandant of No. 2 Flying Training School there, later attending the RAF Staff College and the Air Armament School (as officer commanding in 1932). By 1931, Tedder had reached the rank of group captain and from 1934 to 1936 he served as Director of Training, gaining promotion to air commodore early in his tour.\n\nIn 1936, Tedder was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Far Eastern Forces which gave him command over RAF units from Burma to Hong Kong and Borneo. In 1938 he became Director General for Research in the Air Ministry.\n\nSecond World War\n\nAt the outbreak of war in 1939, Tedder's department was transferred to the newly created Ministry of Aircraft Production, but Tedder was unable to form a good working relationship with the minister, Lord Beaverbrook, and consequently with Prime Minister Churchill and in November 1940, he became Deputy Air Officer Commander in Chief, RAF Middle East Command.\n\nTedder was appointed as Air Officer Commander in Chief, RAF Middle East Command in June 1941, with the temporary rank of Air Marshal (made permanent in April 1942). He had not been Churchill's first choice for the role but when the preferred choice (Air Vice-Marshal O T Boyd) was captured, Tedder was appointed. As head of the RAF Middle East Command, he commanded Allied air operations in the Mediterranean and North Africa, covering the evacuation of Crete in May 1941 and Operation Crusader in North Africa in late 1941. In January 1942 Tedder was knighted, being appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Tedder oversaw the build up of the air arm in the Western Desert and, more importantly, the development of new more effective operational and administrative policies which turned it into a highly effective force which was key to the Allied victory at the decisive Battle of El Alamein. One of his bombing tactics became known as the \"Tedder Carpet\".\n\nIn December 1943, by now a temporary Air Chief Marshal, Tedder took command of Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean. He was involved in the planning of the Allied invasion of Sicily.\n\nWhen Operation Overlord\u2014the invasion of France\u2014came to be planned, Tedder was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander beneath U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Finding himself with little responsibility in this new role he wrested control of the air planning for D-Day from the commander of the Allied Air Expeditionary Force, Trafford Leigh-Mallory. He developed an antipathy towards the British General Bernard Montgomery and during the difficult Battle of Normandy and later, he was a critic of Montgomery's performance and advocated Montgomery's removal from command.\n\nIn the last year of the war, Tedder was sent to Russia to seek assistance as the Western Front came under pressure during the Battle of the Bulge. When the unconditional surrender of the Germans came in May 1945 Tedder signed on behalf of General Eisenhower.\n\nKnighted in 1942, Tedder was granted a peerage at the war's end. He followed Charles Portal as Chief of the Air Staff and served in that post from 1946 to 1950. In 1947 he delivered the Lees Knowles Lecture, which was then published as Air Power in War.\n\nAlthough the nature of his war service denied him gallantry awards, Tedder received several significant foreign awards from Belgium, France, the United States and elsewhere.\n\nLater life\n\nLord Tedder was the author of a historical study of the Royal Navy and also composed his war memoirs. In 1950 he became Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. In 1950 he served as the British representative on the military committee of NATO in Washington DC. He also served as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC. He received at least six honorary LLD degrees, and was avidly interested in astronomy. In his later years he contracted Parkinson's Disease and died in Surrey in 1967, aged 76 years.\n\n[edit] Family life\n\nTedder married Rosalinde Maclardy who was killed in an aircraft crash in Egypt in 1943, an event that Tedder witnessed. Tedder remarried but his second wife, Marie (Toppy) de Seton Black, predeceased him by about two years, in 1965. Tedder was the parent of: Dick (killed in France 1940), John Michael (1926\u20131994; Late Purdie Professor of Chemistry, University of St. Andrews), and a daughter Mina. His stepson Alasdair was also killed.\n\nStyles\n\n1890\u20131913: Arthur William Tedder 1913\u20131915: Second Lieutenant Arthur William Tedder 1915\u20131916: Lieutenant Arthur William Tedder 1916\u20131917: Captain Arthur William Tedder 1917\u20131918: Major Arthur William Tedder (Temporary rank in Army from 1 Jan 1917 \u2013 1 Apr 1918; full rank of Major in RAF after then) 1918\u20131919: Major RAF (Temp.

In 1909 he entered Cambridge at Magdalene College where he studied. He is passionate about history and achieves an excellent academic level. At the same time, he enlisted as a reservist in the British Army and served as a second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment. In the summer of 1912 he went to Berlin to learn German. It is perhaps the preponderant role of the Foreign Ministers at this time that makes him want to pursue a career as a politician.\n\nBut entry into the First World War changes its destiny. In February 1914, when the war seemed inevitable, he joined the colonial troops as an aspirant and served in Fiji. In September 1914, he decided to return to England. Appointed lieutenant on January 10, 1915, he was seriously injured a month later while serving at Wyke Regis in Dorset.\n\nSet aside from many physical activities, he asks for his transfer to the Royal Flying Corps, the predecessor of the Royal Air Force. Having been accepted to be trained as a pilot, he trained for a whole year and in June 1916, his squadron (No. 25 Squadron Royal Flying Corps) was deployed in France. Promoted to Major on 1 January 1917, he was transferred to Egypt where he took command of No. 67 Squadron on 25 June 1917.\n\nAfter the war, he served as a squadron commander at Bircham Newton and flight instructor from 1923 until 1936, at various ranks and positions. Appointed Air Officer Commanding of the Air Force in the Far East, he took command of British units deployed in the region, both in Burma, Hong Kong and Borneo. In 1938, Arthur Tedder served as General Manager for Research at the Air Force Ministry.\n\nShortly after the start of the Second World War and despite the fact that his relations with Prime Minister Winston Churchill were not optimal, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the British Air Force in the Middle East.

He served his country as a hero, seeing action in two world wars and accepting the full responsibility of command over Allied air forces during World War II.\n\nArthur Tedder was born on July 11, 1890 in the Scottish town of Glenguin. He began his military career in 1913 when he joined the British Army. In 1916, he transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF), serving during World War I in France from 1915 until 1917 and Egypt from 1918 to 1919. He received his permanent commission in the RAF in 1919 and remained there after the war, serving as a director of training from 1934 to 1936. In 1936, Tedder was promoted to RAF commander in the Far East where he remained until 1938, when he became director general of research in the Air Ministry.\n\nThe Middle East\n\nTedder's early experience with the RAF would prove invaluable during the war years. In his role as commander in the Far East, he would amass even more knowledge of military strategy. One of his first opportunities to apply his strong planning skills came in May 1941, when Tedder participated in the British evacuation of Crete. As German strength grew in the Middle East, British troops were forced back toward Canea and an evacuation of Crete was ordered. While the Royal Air Force at Egypt, under Tedder's command, promised fighter cover for the ships evacuating British ground troops, support was limited by the fact that few aircraft at his disposal had the necessary range to fly from Egypt to Crete. The operation suffered many casualties.\n\nIn November 1941, Tedder participated in Operation \"Crusader,\" in Africa. The plans for attack on Tobruk were scheduled for November 23, 1941. On the 19th, Tedder reported to Prime Minister Winston Churchill that the initial air battle of November 18th had gone satisfactorily, although bad weather had adversely affected plans for neutralizing the enemy. He assured Churchill that the weather had also limited German action against the Allies during the first two days of the battle.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, when Germany's General Erwin Rommel launched an attack of Gazala west of Tobruk. Tedder communicated to Churchill that he had foreseen the attack and was ready for it. Rommel's attack on Tobruk failed and his troops were pummeled by Tedder's air forces. Unfortunately, the victory was short-lived, as Rommel turned the tide of battle from defeat to victory. With the loss of the tank battle, an immediate withdrawal of the 1st South African and 50th Division was ordered. The success of that withdrawal was due, in large measure, to the protection of Allied troops by the RAF.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Churchill commended Tedder for his successful direction of the RAF. During August Tedder accompanied Churchill to Moscow where they met with Russian leader, Josef Stalin. Churchill proposed placing British and U.S. air troops at Russia's southern flank as a means of strengthening Russian air power and showing air superiority. Tedder's proposed plan received approval from Churchill with a recommendation that a similar proposal be drafted for presentation to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThe Battle of El Alamein\n\nIn October 1942, the battle against Rommel's forces for El Alamein [in North Africa] was launched. In contrast to battles fought earlier that same year, the British had the advantage of far superior forces. On the ground, Sherman tanks arrived from the United States, outnumbering the equipment of the enemy. In the air, Tedder, now air commander-in-chief in the Middle East, had air squadrons that included U.S., South African, Rhodesian, Australian, Greek, French, and Yugoslav forces assisting the RAF. The planes at his disposal numbered over 1,500, with 1,200 of those based in Egypt and Palestine in support of a ground attack on Alamein. By comparison, German and Italian serviceable aircraft numbered only 350.\n\nTedder applied this superior air capability to harassing the Panzerarmee supply flow, while also protecting the supplies of the Eighth Army. Working closely with the Royal Navy, he extended the harassment of the Panzerarmee's sea-artery supply and aided in the sinking of German supply ships. By September 1942, a third of Germany's supplies had failed to cross the Mediterranean, either sunk or returned to their source. The following month more than half of Germany's supplies failed to arrive. In a memo from Churchill to Tedder, the prime minister commended the commander for his leadership.\n\nThe Casablanca Conference\n\nDuring the Casablanca Conference at the beginning of 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill's combined chiefs of staff agreed that taking Tunis should be the next point of focus. It was at this conference that leadership of the Allied forces was conferred upon General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Naval command was placed under Admiral Cunningham and Tedder was named air marshal. Tedder assumed command of the front in February 1943, with the Battle of Tunisia at its height. Roosevelt suggested that it would be strategically advantageous for the Allies to stress these appointments and ensure that the leader's plans and duties be filtered to the enemy. Churchill agreed, but expressed concern that no favoritism be shown toward Eisenhower at the expense of commanders Alexander and Tedder, lest the general public be discouraged.\n\nThe Italian Campaign\n\nIn May 1943, Tedder, Alexander, and Cunningham met and voiced agreement with Churchill and Brooke that Italy should be invaded. To convince Eisenhower, they met with Eisenhower, Marshall, and Bedell Smith to discuss the proposed taking of the island of Pantilleria as the southern assault on Sicily to begin this campaign.\n\nBy the summer Tedder's command had solidified in preparation for the invasion of Sicily. His forces included those of General Spaatz, U.S. Army Air Force; and Air Marshal Coningham. With a driving need to take ports and airfields early in the attack, Tedder argued to narrow the attack and seize the southeastern group of airfields. This was successfully employed through the use of amphibious load carriers.\n\nAs 1943 came to a close, Churchill proposed to Roosevelt a remodeling of leadership after discussion with Eisenhower, Alexander, and Tedder. For Operation \"Overlord\"-also known as \"D-Day\"-Churchill recommended Tedder as Eisenhower's deputy supreme commander because of the role planned for the air forces. Roosevelt gladly accepted this recommendation. As plans for D-Day began to solidify, Tedder's role became even more vital. Recent experiences had proven that success could best be achieved through a cooperative effort of all the military forces.\n\nD-Day Approached\n\nThe next step was implementing the \"Transportation Plan.\" This operation was designed to use bombers to paralyze the French railway on the eve of Overlord. Eisenhower had worked closely with Tedder in the Mediterranean and he liked and admired the man enormously. Despite some opposition to the plan, he named Tedder to personally supervise the campaign. Tedder identified over 70 railroad targets in France and Belgium, intentionally directing traffic away from lower Normandy in order to maintain secrecy about the invasion site. Although opposition remained strong, Eisenhower was convinced that the Transportation Plan was necessary to the success of Overlord. The success of these attacks, in turn, convinced Tedder that they should be continued into Germany, where the collapse of the German rail system would result in the collapse of its economy.\n\nWith only hours left before the final decision had to be made on whether to begin Operation Overlord, bad weather raged across the English Channel and Eisenhower solicited his subordinates for their opinions. Tedder recommended postponement, concerned that poor visibility would have a devastating affect on the ability of his bombers to provide the cover needed. The decision, however, was to move ahead on June 6.\n\nHistorians generally agree that under the direction of Tedder, the Allied air forces commanded the skies. Their paralyzing effect on the enemy was a decisive factor in getting the Allied troops to shore on June 6. By destroying bridges over the Seine and Loire rivers, they effectively isolated Normandy, forcing the Germans into long detours and endless delays.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Overlord, additional operations were planned to keep the enemy off balance. One of these, which Montgomery had characterized as a major \"break-out,\" resulted in the Allies' failure to take advantage of heavy enemy casualties. In an attempt to break through enemy lines and open the way to Paris, Eisenhower pushed Montgomery to take action and was assured that a \"big show\" would occur on July 9. Montgomery asked for and got air support from Tedder. However, Montgomery's attack failed and he called it off, angering both Eisenhower and Tedder. Two days later, Montgomery again promised an offensive he named Operation \"Goodwood.\" Tedder arranged for a sensational show of support, bringing together 1,600 British and U.S. heavy bombers and 400 medium bombers, dropping a total of 7,800 tons of bombs on German defenses; 2,500 tons sited for the German fortifications at Caen; and 650 tons for Cagny. Tedder carefully coordinated the air attack with ground attacks in order to avoid any lulls that could give the enemy an opportunity to regroup.\n\nThe saturation bombing started the offensive, but it quickly failed. After sustaining heavy losses, Montgomery called it off. Tedder was furious at this second failure and demanded that Montgomery be fired, which did not come to pass.\n\nThe Tide Turns\n\nThroughout the last year of the war, the Allies achieved air superiority and the success of D-Day turned the tide of the war in Europe. In January 1945, Eisenhower sent Tedder to Moscow to seek assistance from the Russians, as a way of relieving pressure on Allied forces in the west. By May a total and unconditional surrender occurred with formal ratification by the German High Command in Berlin. Tedder signed on behalf of Eisenhower, Marshal Zhukov signed for Russia, and Field-Marshal Keitel signed for Germany.\n\nPeacetime Honors\n\nIn 1942, Tedder had been knighted. At the war's end, in 1946, he was elevated to the peerage and named a baron. Tedder served as Great Britain's first peacetime chief of air staff and as a senior member of the Air Council from 1946 until 1950. In 1950, he became chancellor of Cambridge University.

France at the time was occupied by the armies of Nazi Germany, and the amphibious assault\u2014codenamed Operation Overlord\u2014landed some 156,000 Allied soldiers on the beaches of Normandy by the end of the day. Despite their success, some 4,000 Allied troops were killed by German soldiers defending the beaches. At the time, the D-Day invasion was the largest naval, air and land operation in history, and within a few days about 326,000 troops, more than 50,000 vehicles and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed. By August 1944, all of northern France had been liberated, and in spring of 1945 the Allies had defeated the Germans. Historians often refer to D-Day as the beginning of the end of World War II.\n\nPreparing for D-Day\n\nAfter World War II began, Germany invaded and occupied northwestern France beginning in May 1940. The Americans entered the war in December 1941, and by 1942 they and the British (who had been evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940 after being cut off by the Germans in the Battle of France) were considering the possibility of a major Allied invasion across the English Channel. The following year, Allied plans for a cross-Channel invasion began to ramp up. In November 1943, Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), who was aware of the threat of an invasion along France\u2019s northern coast, put Erwin Rommel (1891-1944) in charge of spearheading defense operations in the region, even though the Germans did not know exactly where the Allies would strike. Hitler charged Rommel with finishing the Atlantic Wall, a 2,400-mile fortification of bunkers, landmines and beach and water obstacles.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, more than 156,000 American, British and Canadian troops stormed 50 miles of Normandy's fiercely defended beaches in northern France in an operation that proved to be a critical turning point in World War II. Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill knew from the start of the war that a massive invasion of mainland Europe would be critical to relieve pressure from the Soviet army fighting the Nazis in the east. Since Operation Overlord was launched from England, the U.S. military had to ship 7 million tons of supplies to the staging area, including 450,000 tons of ammunition. Here, ammunition is shown in the town square of Morten-in-Marsh, England ahead of the invasion. The D-Day invasion began in the pre-dawn hours of June 6 with thousands of paratroopers landing inland on the Utah and Sword beaches in an attempt to cut off exits and destroy bridges to slow Nazi reinforcements. U.S. Army infantry men approaching Omaha Beach, Normandy, France on June 6, 1944. The first waves of American fighters were cut down in droves by German machine gun fire as they scrambled across the mine-riddled beach. At Omaha Beach, U.S. forces persisted through the day-long slog, pushing forward to a fortified seawall and then up steep bluffs to take out the Nazi artillery posts by nightfall. Shown, wounded U.S. soldiers lean against chalk cliffs after storming Omaha Beach. Anticipating an Allied invasion somewhere along the French coast, German forces had completed construction of the \u201cAtlantic Wall,\u201d a 2,400-mile line of bunkers, landmines and beach and water obstacles. Here, a land mine is blown up by Allied engineers. Shown are massive landings at Omaha Beach after it was secured by U.S. troops.

Less than a year later, on May 7, 1945, Germany would surrender. 1 / 8 : Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\n\nIn January 1944, General Dwight Eisenhower (1890-1969) was appointed commander of Operation Overlord. In the months and weeks before D-Day, the Allies carried out a massive deception operation intended to make the Germans think the main invasion target was Pas-de-Calais (the narrowest point between Britain and France) rather than Normandy. In addition, they led the Germans to believe that Norway and other locations were also potential invasion targets. Many tactics were used to carry out the deception, including fake equipment; a phantom army commanded by George Patton and supposedly based in England, across from Pas-de-Calais; double agents; and fraudulent radio transmissions.\n\nA Weather Delay: June 5, 1944\n\nEisenhower selected June 5, 1944, as the date for the invasion; however, bad weather on the days leading up to the operation caused it to be delayed for 24 hours. On the morning of June 5, after his meteorologist predicted improved conditions for the following day, Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for Operation Overlord. He told the troops: \u201cYou are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you.\u201d\n\nLater that day, more than 5,000 ships and landing craft carrying troops and supplies left England for the trip across the Channel to France, while more than 11,000 aircraft were mobilized to provide air cover and support for the invasion.\n\nD-Day Landings: June 6, 1944\n\nBy dawn on June 6, thousands of paratroopers and glider troops were already on the ground behind enemy lines, securing bridges and exit roads. The amphibious invasions began at 6:30 a.m. The British and Canadians overcame light opposition to capture beaches codenamed Gold, Juno and Sword, as did the Americans at Utah Beach. U.S. forces faced heavy resistance at Omaha Beach, where there were over 2,000 American casualties. However, by day\u2019s end, approximately 156,000 Allied troops had successfully stormed Normandy\u2019s beaches. According to some estimates, more than 4,000 Allied troops lost their lives in the D-Day invasion, with thousands more wounded or missing.\n\nLess than a week later, on June 11, the beaches were fully secured and over 326,000 troops, more than 50,000 vehicles and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed at Normandy.\n\nFor their part, the Germans suffered from confusion in the ranks and the absence of celebrated commander Rommel, who was away on leave. At first, Hitler, believing the invasion was a feint designed to distract the Germans from a coming attack north of the Seine River, refused to release nearby divisions to join the counterattack. Reinforcements had to be called from further afield, causing delays. He also hesitated in calling for armored divisions to help in the defense. Moreover, the Germans were hampered by effective Allied air support, which took out many key bridges and forced the Germans to take long detours, as well as efficient Allied naval support, which helped protect advancing Allied troops.\n\nIn the ensuing weeks, the Allies fought their way across the Normandy countryside in the face of determined German resistance, as well as a dense landscape of marshes and hedgerows. By the end of June, the Allies had seized the vital port of Cherbourg, landed approximately 850,000 men and 150,000 vehicles in Normandy, and were poised to continue their march across France.\n\nVictory in Normandy\n\nBy the end of August 1944, the Allies had reached the Seine River, Paris was liberated and the Germans had been removed from northwestern France, effectively concluding the Battle of Normandy. The Allied forces then prepared to enter Germany, where they would meet up with Soviet troops moving in from the east.\n\nThe Normandy invasion began to turn the tide against the Nazis. A significant psychological blow, it also prevented Hitler from sending troops from France to build up his Eastern Front against the advancing Soviets. The following spring, on May 8, 1945, the Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier, on April 30."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Normandy-Invasion", "page_content": "Normandy Invasion , also called Operation Overlord or D-Day , during World War II , the Allied invasion of western Europe , which was launched on June 6, 1944 (the most celebrated D-Day of the war), with the simultaneous landing of U.S. , British , and Canadian forces on five separate beachheads in Normandy , France .

Yet despite Brooke\u2019s procrastination, the British had in fact been proceeding with structural plans, coordinated by Lieut. Gen. Frederick Morgan, who had been appointed COSSAC (chief of staff to the supreme Allied commander [designate]) at the Anglo-American Casablanca Conference in January 1943. His staff\u2019s first plan for Operation Overlord (as the invasion was henceforth to be known) was for a landing in Normandy between Caen and the Cotentin Peninsula in a strength of three divisions, with two brigades to be air-dropped. Another 11 divisions were to be landed within the first two weeks through two artificial harbours that would be towed across the Channel. Once a foothold had been established, a force of a hundred divisions, the majority shipped directly from the United States, were to be assembled in France for a final assault on Germany. In January 1944 Eisenhower became supreme Allied commander, and the COSSAC staff was redesignated SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force)."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/normandy-feature", "page_content": "On 6 June 1944, Canadian forces took part in the greatest amphibious operation in military history. Over 10,000 Canadian sailors in 110 warships, 15 RCAF squadrons and 14,000 soldiers took part in D-Day. Juno Beach, one of five assault beaches, was assigned to the Canadian Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division and 2nd Armoured Brigade.\n\nThe invasion had been years in the planning. The Canadian disaster at Dieppe proved what an extreme challenge lay ahead. Finally, a target date was set, and the planners settled on the coast of Normandy. It would be risky. German forces in Normandy, led by the experienced General Erwin Rommel, had been strengthening the Atlantic Wall with millions of mines and obstacles.\n\nWho were the Canadian soldiers? \u201cYou have to remember that we were young, irresponsible, and slowly growing up \u2014 but not normal growing up,\u201d recalled Rolph Jackson of the Queen\u2019s Own Rifles, \u201cbecause we joined the army as kids and four years later we were at the beach.\u201d Jackson was one of many veterans interviewed for Lance Goddard\u2019s D-Day: Juno Beach, Canada\u2019s 24 Hours of Destiny (2004).\n\nThe flotilla of some 7,000 ships crossed the English Channel in churning seas and lashing winds. \u201cEverybody was sick,\u201d recalled Jack Martin of the Queen\u2019s Own Rifles. \u201cOur platoon commander\u2026had to run to the side, and he puked and lost all his false teeth and everything there.\u201d\n\n(L to R) Lieutenant E.M.

We had never felt so alone in our lives,\u201d wrote Charlie Martin in Battle Diary: From D-Day and Normandy to the Zuider Zee and VE (1994), his memoir of the campaign. \u201cThere was mist and rain. Berni\u00e8res-sur-Mer became visible. Fifteen hundred yards of beach stretched from the far left to the far right. Everything was dead quiet. It could have been a picture postcard of any one of a hundred tiny French beaches with a village behind \u2014 not the real thing.\u201d\n\nThe order rang out: \u201cDown ramp.\u201d The moment the ramp came down, heavy machine-gun fire broke out from somewhere back of the seawall. Mortars were dropping all over the beach\u2026 I said to Jack, across from me, and to everyone: \u201cMove! Fast! Don\u2019t stop for anything. Go! Go! Go!\u201d We raced down the ramp, Jack and I side by side, the men closely following. We fanned out as fast as we could, heading for that seawall. (Charlie Martin, Battle Diary)\n\nDespite the massive bombardment from the Allied battleships, the German bunkers and pillboxes, built of thick concrete reinforced with steel, proved resistant to anything but a direct hit. The soldiers would have to take them out one by one.\n\nThe first to reach the shore were the engineer units, which were tasked with clearing mines and obstacles from the beaches. The Germans responded with intense fire against both men and landing craft. At 0745 hours the tanks of the 1st Hussars, a regiment from London, Ontario, landed on the beach facing Courseulles-sur-Mer, followed by the Royal Regina Rifles. A few minutes later, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles landed west of Courseulles. Unlike the Regina unit, they landed before any tanks. Many died before they even reached the shore.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t stand still,\u201d recalled Francis Godon of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, \u201cbecause if you stand right there the machine guns are going to be after you...

(courtesy Francis Godon/The Memory Project)\n\nBy 0800 hours the Canadians had secured their first beachhead at Courseulles-sur-Mer. The Royal Regina Rifles seized most of the German strong points. They had trained for house-to-house combat and now put that training to use, battling the Germans street by street.\n\nFurther west, the Canadian Scottish landed and quickly captured a German emplacement. They pressed inland towards Graye-sur-Mer, where they joined the Royal Winnipeg Rifles. The North Shore (NB) Regiment came under intense fire at St. Aubin-sur-Mer, where they faced a high seawall lined with German fortifications. It took most of the morning to move along the wall and outflank the defences.\n\n\u201cI was scared to death, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d recalled Frank Ryan of the North Shore Regiment, \u201cAnybody that says they weren\u2019t scared, they\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\nAt 0812 the Queen\u2019s Own Rifles landed at Berni\u00e8res-sur-Mer. Many of the landing craft could not get all the way to shore because of sandbars and other obstacles and the men were forced to disembark in deep water. They waded in and raced across an open beach while under fire. The regiment lost 65 casualties in the first few minutes. Once they had secured the beach, they worked inland, crossing minefields while under attack from German defenders armed with machine guns and mortars.\n\nAs the tide rose, the beach became narrower, causing congestion of men and materials. Royal Engineers worked feverishly to open gaps or exits from the beaches, including the construction of ramps over the seawall. At the same time, Canadian soldiers moved inland, picking their way through the nests of snipers.\n\nBy 1000 hours the Canadians had succeeded in capturing all their preliminary objectives along the coast of Juno Beach, from St. Aubin to Courseulles. By noon every unit of the 3rd Canadian Division was on shore and the Royal Regina Rifles were engaged in a ferocious battle with the last great obstacle, a German fortification at Courseulles.\n\nAlthough the invasion was a success, the planners had been overly ambitious. Only one Allied unit \u2014 Canada\u2019s 1st Hussars \u2014 achieved all of its overall objectives that day, capturing the Caen-Bayeux highway intersection late in the afternoon.\n\nAs the adrenaline wore off, the men began to feel hungry. Many had not eaten for 24 hours. They did not exactly enjoy a feast. \u201cMost of the time it was just eating these biscuits and sardines,\u201d recalled Ernie Jeans of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion. \u201cGot sort of sick of eating biscuits and sardines.\u201d\n\nAs the light faded, many Canadian units began digging in for the night. Some slept while others kept watch, prepared for a German counter-attack. Around the same time, the North Nova Scotia Highlanders and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers fought their way into Villons les Buissons and Anisy. As darkness fell on Normandy, a wide stretch of land, 10 to 16 km deep, was controlled by Canadian forces. Operation Overlord was a success. The Atlantic Wall had been breached.\n\nCanadians figured prominently in the victory and had paid a dear price as 359 soldiers had been killed, 584 wounded and 131 taken prisoner.\n\nInfantrymen of Le R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re resting behind a Universal Carrier in a low ground position along the Normandy beachhead in June 1944.

Please refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions.\n\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc./Kenny Chmielewski\n\nThis infographic shows facts and figures about the landings on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, during World War II. The following text , which is taken from a lightly edited narrative description of this infographic, provides more details and background.\n\n(Read Sir John Keegan\u2019s Britannica entry on the Normandy Invasion.)\n\nOverview\n\nOn the morning of June 6, 1944, two U.S. infantry divisions, the 1st and the 29th, landed at Omaha Beach, the second to the west of the five landing beaches of D-Day. It was the bloodiest fighting of the morning. The troops went ahead and, in many cases, had to fight through waist-deep water, being fired upon by German strong points throughout. In many cases, the landing craft were hung up on beach obstacles that could not be cleared because of the way the tide had rolled in that day. There were mines. There were large steel obstacles that ended up actually providing cover, the only cover that was available on the beaches for the landing American troops that day.\n\nAnd by the end of the day, the initial assault had not carried through to the final positions that were called out in the initial D-Day plan. But they did have a minor toehold on the beach. Things were so close that Allied commanders had actually considered pulling the troops back because fighting on Omaha had gone so badly throughout the day. It was only carried when initial waves were able to make it to final positions later in the afternoon.\n\nSome of the heaviest fighting occurred when an American Ranger group took the high points at Pointe du Hoc, which looked down on the beach and provided a strong firing position for the Germans as well as for the German spotters calling artillery onto the beach from a distance behind the landing beaches.\n\nFacts and figures\n\nAllied forces involved in the landings on Omaha Beach were the U.S. 1st and 29th infantry divisions.\n\nGerman forces involved in the defense of Omaha Beach consisted of the 352nd Infantry Division.\n\nThe landings on Omaha Beach started at 0630 hours.\n\nThe width of Omaha Beach is less than 10 km (6 miles).\n\nAllied troops landed numbered 34,000; they suffered 2,400 casualties.\n\nMap of the planned assault\n\nThe map in the top left of the infographic illustrates the plan and the believed disposition of German forces for the landings in Omaha Beach. This was not carried out on the morning of June 6.\n\nThis map shows the planned landing force movements along with the planned landing force objectives. Spots of German resistance are shown along the coast.\n\nSections of Omaha Beach are labeled (from west to east) Charlie, Dog Green, Dog White, Dog Red, Easy Green, Easy Red, Fox Green, Fox Red.\n\nMap of the initial assault\n\nThe initial landing was a mess. Landing craft were mixed up. Individual units were blended together, if they survived the initial landing at all. And what you saw were mixtures of troops from different units combining to achieve objectives that were shifting as the battle carried on throughout the day. You saw troops from the 1st and 29th infantry divisions doing whatever they could to get out of the killing zone that was Omaha Beach. And by the end of the day, those troops did come together under whatever officers could be found to achieve some of the initial goals for that day.\n\nYou have just concentrations of troops landing wherever they came ashore and getting into groups of a dozen, 20, a half dozen, and trying to make it through the worst parts of the beach and up onto the high ground above. The difficulty there was that, in some cases, troops were landing in areas that they hadn\u2019t been briefed on. They had gone over some of the basics of the initial assault. But you had troops that were supposed to be going through one specific exit point from the beach, and they were hundreds of yards from that point. The intelligence that they had on the German defenders was useless from the standpoint of where they actually were.\n\nThe green areas that you see on this map (in the lower left of the infographic) and the lines that you see going into the towns that are just beyond the initial beachhead illustrate where those units went as they were breaking through in the hours after the initial landings. The final positions of U.S. troops behind Omaha Beach show that they had not made it to many of their final objective points. There were key strong points of German resistance that were stopping advances further inland. The troops that landed at Omaha had been so bloodied that they simply lacked the strength to push further.\n\nThe German artillery that were firing onto the beach had hampered the landings and the additional landings throughout the day. While you saw a stronger beachhead established at other beaches, such as the British beaches and the Canadian beach and Utah Beach, Omaha was a hard-fought battle even until midnight on D-Day.\n\nIn this map, the initial U.S. assault (until noon) is shown just off the beach as arrows point inland with bluffs indicated. The German resistance is also shown. This map also includes the sections of Omaha Beach: Charlie, Dog Green, Dog White, Dog Red, Easy Green, Easy Red, Fox Green, Fox Red (from west to east).\n\nMap of the final positions: midnight on D-Day\n\nThis map, in the lower right of the infographic, shows troops\u2019 final positions on D-Day. The red arrows represent paths taken by organized breakouts from the beach.\n\nIn many cases, these arrows recapitulate the routes that you see on the initial assault map. But in some cases, these are just the largest organized breakouts that took place from concentrations of troops. The pink areas represent where large bodies of U.S. troops were gathered, often in opposition to remaining German strong points. And those positions were cleared out in the ensuing days as more troops were landed, Especially with armor support, which was sorely lacking at Omaha Beach on June 6.\n\nCasualties on Omaha Beach were the worst of any of the invasion beaches on D-Day, with 2,400 casualties suffered by U.S. forces. And that includes wounded and killed as well as missing. There is no concrete number for the German forces that were killed at Omaha Beach. Those records simply did not exist, and entire German units were wiped out virtually to a man. Any best estimate at the German losses on D-Day is a guess.\n\nIn this map, arrows of later U.S. movements point further inland and lead to areas of the final U.S. positions (as of midnight). The German resistance is also shown further inland than on the initial assault map.

While the weather on D-Day was far from ideal, postponing would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable.\n\nThe men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous.\n\nAdolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of the invasion.\n\nThe Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St. L\u00f4, and Bayeux remained in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June. However, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months.\n\nLosses to merchant ships during the invasion were much lower than had been anticipated. Many ships plied back and forth between English ports and the beaches at Normandy. Some ships made as many as three trips in June alone.\n\nThe U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command describes how a modern, artificial port was built at Omaha and Utah beaches. Armed Guards on some 22 merchant ships which were scuttled to make a breakwater played a vital part in the operation. For days they endured the early fury of the German counter-attack and helped give fire protection to the forces ashore from their partly submerged ships.\n\nCarrying out the time-honored task of saving lives, albeit under enemy fire on a shoreline thousands of miles from home, the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s cutters involved in the invasion of Normandy saved more than 1,400 souls, but the day was also one of the bloodiest days in Coast Guard history.\n\nGerman casualties on D-Day were around 1,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.\n\nLarge landing craft convoy crosses the English Channel on June 6, 1944.\n\nRoyal Marine Commandos attached to 3rd Infantry Division move inland from Sword Beach, June 6, 1944.\n\nCarrying equipment, U.S. assault troops move onto Utah Beach.
