He is among the eight of 118 Padma Shri awardees under this discipline.\n\nPadma Awards are one of the highest civilian Awards in India. The Awards are given in various disciplines spanning the fields of art, social work, public affairs, science and engineering, trade and industry, medicine, literature and education, sports and civil service. \u2018Padma Vibhushan\u2019 is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service; \u2018Padma Bhushan\u2019 for distinguished service of a high order and \u2018Padma Shri\u2019 for distinguished service in any field. Among the 7 Padma Vibhushan, 16 Padma Bhushan and 118 Padma Shri Awards that the President of Indian approved this year, only 33 have been awarded to women.\n\nProf K. S. Manilal is a botanist and taxonomist, best known for his research, translation, and annotation of Hendrik van Rheede\u2019s 17th century Latin botanical treatise, Hortus Malabaricus. The document extensively details the biodiversity and medicinal properties of over 700 indigenous plants in the Malabar region of Kerala.\n\nBefore Manilal\u2019s translation of this enormous 12 volume document into English and Malayalam, most of the information in this Latin treatise had largely remained inaccessible to the world. Manilal also authored 198 published research papers and 15 books on taxonomy and botany, of which a significant proportion was devoted to discussing the medico-botanical aspects, or the historical, socio-political and linguistic significance of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nAlong with his students, Manilal has discovered around 14 species of flowering plants and recorded the existence of nearly 1,000 flowering plant species, including some like the Malabar Daffodil, which was previously thought to be extinct. Currently, he is an Emeritus Professor of botany at Calicut University, Kerala. He is also credited for establishing the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy.\n\nEarlier, Prof K S Manilal was featured under Ek Pradarshini - The Best of Indian Science exhibits during the Nobel Prize Series - India 2018 held at Goa. The National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) at Bengaluru had also held an exhibition of Hortus Malabaricus in 2008."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/k-s-manilal/", "page_content": "Professor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal (Malayalam: \u0d15\u0d3e\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7d \u0d38\u0d41\u0d2c\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d39\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02 \u0d2e\u0d23\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d3e\u0d7d) (born 17 September 1938) is an Emeritus of the University of Calicut, a botany scholar and taxonomist, who devoted over 35 years of his life to research, translation and annotation work of the Latin botanical treatise Hortus Malabaricus. This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language..\n\nDespite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nManilal efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word by word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by Van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms.\n\nWhilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads:\n\nBotanical and Medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and\n\nHistorical, Political, Social and Linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nManilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and co-author. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 species of flowering plants, varieties and combinations new to science. Manilal is the Founder President of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT).\n\nBirth, early life and interest in Hortus Malabaricus\n\nManilal was born in Cochin on 17 September 1938. He is one of three children born to his parents; father Advocate Kattungal A. Subramaniam (b:1914~d:1973) and mother K. K. Devaki (b:1919~d:1989). Manilal's father, K. A. Subramaniam, was besides being a practising advocate, also a writer, who authored the biography of Sahodaran Ayyapan. Manial's Kattungal family members are natives of North Paravur in Kerala, India.\n\nAs a young boy, Manilal's interest in Hortus Malabaricus was inspired by his father, whose avid reading habits and enthusiasm for sociology exposed Manilal to a collection of books, and more specifically newspaper cuttings on Hortus Malabaricus during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nManilal schooled initially at the Government Boys\u2019 High School, Kodungallur and later at the Government S.R.V. Boys\u2019 High School, Ernakulam. He enrolled for undergraduate studies in Botany at the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam, following which, he secured MSc Botany and PhD Degrees from University Teaching Department, Sagar, in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nDuring his post-graduate studies, while on a study tour to the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun, Manilal was able to see, for the first time, a set of volumes of the original Hortus Malabaricus. This was set of volumes acquired by the Institute's library during the days of the British Raj, when the Institute was called the Imperial Forest College. Manilal remarks \u201cit fired my imagination!\u201d on seeing a Latin book in which the names of plants were also written in native Malayalam language. Manilal maintained his interest in the book through his studies and professional life until 1969, when he commenced serious work on the transliteration of Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nMajor research and academic achievements\n\nBotanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nFrontispiece of the original Latin Hortus Malabaricus Frontispiece of the original Latin Hortus Malabaricus\n\nAs Hortus Malabaricus is a pre-Linnaean book, the scientific names of plants, equivalent to local Malayalam names, were not included. Since voucher specimens for the book are also not known to exist, the correct identity of many of the plants described was unclear and not verifiable to original specimens. Earlier attempts, over three centuries, by European and Indian botanists to correctly identify all specimens were futile. Under two research projects; one sponsored by the U.G.C. (1975\u20131978) and the other by the Smithsonian Institution (1984\u20131987), Manilal collected all plants, described in Hortus Malabaricus, from localities in Malabar from where they were originally collected in the 17th century. Specimens were subjected to detailed studies and their correct identities were established in consultation with research institutes in Europe and USA. Based on this work, initially a concise reference book: An Interpretation of Van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus, was published (with his collaborators) from Berlin (1988), by the IAPT. This remains the only book by Indian authors published by them (IAPT) till date and is an essential resource in study on the taxonomy of Southeast Asian plants.\n\nHistorical, political, social and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nThe compilation and publication of Hortus Malabaricus is intimately connected with the history of India, politics of the 17th century Netherlands and the then social conditions of Malabar. It is also an important source of information, and the oldest printed, authentic document, on the evolution of Malayalam language and script. Manilal studied these aspects for over 35 years bringing to light many interesting facts, some of which were included in his book: Botany & History of Hortus Malabaricus, published from Rotterdam and Delhi (1980). Another book, in Malayalam: A study on the role of Itty Achudan in the compilation of Hortus Malabaricus, was published from Kozhikode in 1996.\n\nVan Rheede's motivation to compile a book on the natural plant wealth of Malabar was to prove his belief that Malabar is self-sufficient in all requirements of military and commerce and hence that Cochin was better suited to be the south east Asian Headquarters of the Dutch overseas forces, compared to Colombo in Ceylon.\n\nInformation is also available in the text of Hortus Malabaricus not only about the vegetation in 17th century Malabar, but also about the general social conditions prevalent in those days. Significant inferences could also be drawn on some of these matters, indirectly from the data available in the book. Several research papers have been published by Manilal on these topics. Some more, particularly on the different Numerals and Numerical Systems used in Hortus and their sociological implications and significances in the Indian society, are under preparation.\n\nTaxonomic and biodiversity studies in Kerala\n\nManilal pioneered taxonomic research and biodiversity studies in Kerala by training a genre of young taxonomists and identifying and cataloguing local plants in biodiversity-rich South India. A comprehensive study on the flora of the Greater Kozhikode area, consisting of the western sectors of the present day Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, covering an area of about 600 km2. was started in 1969. When completed in 1975, this work resulted in recording about one thousand species of flowering plants from the region, including several species recorded for the first time in India and importantly seven species new to science. Based on this work, a book: Flora of Calicut, was published (from Dehra Dun), and was taken as a model for subsequent research in India.\n\nResearch and revelations at Silent Valley\n\nIn the 1970s, when a proposal to build a hydro-electric project in Silent Valley triggered political controversy in Kerala due to an impending ecological disaster, the Government of Kerala appointed an experts\u2019 committee of scientists to study, inventorise and report on Silent Valley's flora and fauna. The experts\u2019 committee reported that the forests there could not be classified as tropical evergreen rainforests and that they contain only 240 species of flowering plants, which are also found elsewhere, and also that the Valley does not possess any new or rare species. Despite protests by environmentalists the State Government was about to go ahead with the project, only awaiting a clearance form the Central Government. At this juncture, the Department of Science and Technology (India) accepted Manilal's proposal to study the flora of Silent Valley and also required him to make a general study of the ecological status of the forests.\n\nOver a four-year period commencing 1981, Manilal and research assistants undertook a study that brought to light:\n\nA record of nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants;\n\nSeven species new to science;\n\nSeveral plants believed to be found only in Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc.;\n\nSome species which were believed to be extinct, such as the Malabar Daffodil , which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named Thomas C. Jerdon in Nilgiris;\n\n, which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named Thomas C. Jerdon in Nilgiris; Rare medicinal plants until then known to grow only in the islands of Philippines;\n\nMany endemics of the neighbouring countries, where their existence was threatened, were found to have migrated to these forests for safety.\n\nFurther Manilal's study found that the Silent Valley forests fulfilled required parameters of tropical evergreen rainforests and, therefore, could be rightly so classified. His work was soon considered as model of how taxonomists could assist in solving socio-environmental issues; and many scientists and journalists from Europe, Africa and South America visited Silent Valley to study the working of this project.\n\nOrchids of Kerala\n\nDetailed studies of the orchid wealth of Kerala were started by Manilal in the late 1970s, including their taxonomy, anatomy, biology and floral evolution, which are essential for any further studies on their hybridisation. During these studies, contrary to the highest expectations, over 215 species of orchids were collected, including species that were till then believed to be extinct, like the ladies' slipper orchid Paphiopedilum druryii.\n\nOrigin and evolution of the flower\n\nManilal has led studies on the directions of evolution of flowers and the structure and anatomy of various floral organs in cash crops such as coconut palms, grasses (rice), orchids, compositae (sun flower), rubiales (coffee), etc. Many enigmas in these subjects could be solved, and results were published in around 45 research papers. These studies have, besides seeing the flower as the most significant part of the plant, with biological, commercial, aesthetic, evolutionary and taxonomic importance, also promoted success in hybridisation and breeding experiments, to create new high-yielding varieties.\n\nRadioactive resistant marine phyto-planktonic algae\n\nAs the beaches in southern Kerala and Tamil Nadu (particularly in the Districts of Kollam and Nagarcoil) have natural deposits of radioactive minerals causing genetic damage to flora and fauna, Manilal undertook studies to familiarise with the techniques of research in the field of radiation ecology. These studies were undertaken at the Marine Biology Laboratory of North Wales University at Menai Bridge, Wales. The Royal Society of London granted Manilal a Visiting Scientist-ship for this work for two years in 1971\u20131972.\n\nTwo species of marine phyto-planktonic algae were discovered, which could withstand a very high degree of radioactivity. It was found that these species could absorb and adsorb as much as 40 times their body weight of the radioactive Thorium compounds from surrounding seawater, and continue to live normally. In the 1970s these findings were farfetched to be accepted for publication in a journal in U.K. However, on Manilal's return to India, a part of these findings was published in the journal Current Science (1975), by the Indian Institute of Science. About ten years later, some British scientists did a similar work and their results were published in the prestigious U.K. journal Nature, and wide publicity in the press as a biotechnological break-through. Manilal's experiments (and the subsequent work by the British scientists) show that such marine planktonic algae could be used to quickly and safely clean up ocean surfaces where radio-active materials have accumulated, by cultivating such algae in a specific area and later removing them from there.\n\nIndian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT)\n\nManilal was instrumental in establishing the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT). Manilal, as founder President, established IAAT in the year 1990 with its Headquarters located at the Department of Botany, University of Calicut, Kozhikode, India. The IAAT works to promote the science of Angiosperm Taxonomy in India, to provide a common forum for Angiosperm taxonomists in India to organise meetings, hold discussions and exchange ideas on scientific and academic matters, and encourage collaborative work among taxonomists. The IAAT publishes a journal Rheedea (named after Hendrik van Rheede). The Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy works as an affiliate of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy.\n\nFrom 1969 Manilal commenced training research students in Taxonomy (leading to PhD degree in the subject), with a view to attain self-sufficiency in Taxonomy. During the years 1972\u20131998, he and his students discovered over 240 new species of flowering plants and several new records for India from Kerala, and published many research papers in Taxonomy in national and international journals.\n\nBiomass Research Centre\n\nA Biomass Research Centre was established by Manilal in the University of Calicut, with funding from the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources. The Centre does research and field experiments to establish the (taxonomic) identification of fast-growing fuel-wood trees suitable for various agro-climatic zones of Kerala.\n\nSummary of Manilal's discoveries\n\nNew species and varieties discovered, and combinations established by Manilal and his research associates are summarised are follows:\n\nNew species discovered in Silent Valley\n\nLiparis indiraii Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nEria tiagii Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nHydnocarpus pendulus Manilal, Sabu & Sivar.\n\nRobiquetia josephiana Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nSauropus saksenianus Manilal, Sabu & Sivar.\n\nCucumella silentvaleyii Manilal, Sabu & Mathew\n\nOberonia bisaccata Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nNew species discovered under biodiversity studies\n\nHedyotis erecta Manilal & Sivar.\n\nCinnamomum nicolsonianum Manilal & Shylaja\n\nBulbophyllum rheedei Manilal & S.Kumar\n\nHeliotropium keralense Sivar. & Manilal\n\nBorreria malabarica Sivar. & Manilal\n\nPhyllanthus kozhikodianus Sivar. & Manilal\n\nHabenaria indica S.Kumar & Manilal\n\nNew varieties of flowering plants discovered\n\nBorreria stricta (L. f.)

Manilal's copyright, as author of the English and Malayalam versions, was bequeathed, free of royalties, to the publishers, the University of Kerala. This assignment of rights was a gesture by Manilal in good faith and in response to a specific appeal from the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala, that the University wanted to generate funds from this publication for utilisation of such royalty incomes toward re-publication of old Malayalam classical works, which are out of print, and not forecasted to generate a viable level of income due to limited sale of such classical works.\n\nBook-release functions conducted by the publishers\n\nIn a recorded interview with Manilal in August 2008, he expressed his regret and frustration at the manner in which the publishers subjected him to digression from the publication project soon after he legally assigned his rights as author. Apparently there was a move to exclude Manilal's name from the book (2003), but was reinstated on account of questions raised by the academic community. On 14 August 2008, the University of Kerala officials again conducted a function at Thiruvananthapuram to formally release the Malayalam edition of Hortus Malabaricus. The book was released by the Governor of Kerala (also Chancellor of the University), at the function; where due recognition was not given to Manilal as author of the book, nor were arrangements in place to felicitate the author at the function. [1]. The former Vice-Chancellor of University of Kerala who initiated the project, B. Ekbal, was also not invited to this function.\n\nBooks authored by K. S. Manilal\n\n2012. MANILAL, K.S.

This remains the only book by Indian authors published by them (IAPT) till date and is an essential resource in study on the taxonomy of Southeast Asian plants.\n\nHistorical, political, social and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus\n\nThe compilation and publication of Hortus Malabaricus is intimately connected with the history of India, politics of the 17th century Netherlands and the then social conditions of Malabar. It is also an important source of information, and the oldest printed, authentic document, on the evolution of Malayalam language and script. Manilal studied these aspects for over 35 years bringing to light many interesting facts, some of which were included in his book: Botany & History of Hortus Malabaricus, published from Rotterdam and Delhi (1980). Another book, in Malayalam: A study on the role of Itty Achudan in the compilation of Hortus Malabaricus, was published from Kozhikode in 1996.\n\nVan Rheede's motivation to compile a book on the natural plant wealth of Malabar was to prove his belief that Malabar is self-sufficient in all requirements of military and commerce and hence that Cochin was better suited to be the south east Asian Headquarters of the Dutch overseas forces, compared to Colombo in Ceylon.\n\nInformation is also available in the text of Hortus Malabaricus not only about the vegetation in 17th century Malabar, but also about the general social conditions prevalent in those days. Significant inferences could also be drawn on some of these matters, indirectly from the data available in the book. Several research papers have been published by Manilal on these topics. Some more, particularly on the different Numerals and Numerical Systems used in Hortus and their sociological implications and significances in the Indian society, are under preparation.\n\nTaxonomic and biodiversity studies in Kerala\n\nManilal pioneered taxonomic research and biodiversity studies in Kerala by training a genre of young taxonomists and identifying and cataloguing local plants in biodiversity-rich South India. A comprehensive study on the flora of the Greater Kozhikode area, consisting of the western sectors of the present day Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, covering an area of about 600 km2. was started in 1969. When completed in 1975, this work resulted in recording about one thousand species of flowering plants from the region, including several species recorded for the first time in India and importantly seven species new to science. Based on this work, a book: Flora of Calicut, was published (from Dehra Dun), and was taken as a model for subsequent research in India.\n\nResearch and revelations at Silent Valley\n\nIn the 1970s, when a proposal to build a hydro-electric project in Silent Valley triggered political controversy in Kerala due to an impending ecological disaster, the Government of Kerala appointed an experts\u2019 committee of scientists to study, inventorise and report on Silent Valley's flora and fauna. The experts\u2019 committee reported that the forests there could not be classified as tropical evergreen rainforests and that they contain only 240 species of flowering plants, which are also found elsewhere, and also that the Valley does not possess any new or rare species. Despite protests by environmentalists the State Government was about to go ahead with the project, only awaiting a clearance form the Central Government. At this juncture, the Department of Science and Technology (India) accepted Manilal's proposal to study the flora of Silent Valley and also required him to make a general study of the ecological status of the forests.\n\nOver a four-year period commencing 1981, Manilal and research assistants undertook a study that brought to light:\n\nA record of nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants;\n\nSeven species new to science;\n\nSeveral plants believed to be found only in Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc.;\n\nSome species which were believed to be extinct, such as the Malabar Daffodil, which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named Thomas C. Jerdon in Nilgiris;\n\nRare medicinal plants until then known to grow only in the islands of Philippines;\n\nMany endemics of the neighbouring countries, where their existence was threatened, were found to have migrated to these forests for safety.\n\nFurther Manilal's study found that the Silent Valley forests fulfilled required parameters of tropical evergreen rainforests and, therefore, could be rightly so classified. His work was soon considered as model of how taxonomists could assist in solving socio-environmental issues; and many scientists and journalists from Europe, Africa and South America visited Silent Valley to study the working of this project.\n\nOrchids of Kerala\n\nDetailed studies of the orchid wealth of Kerala were started by Manilal in the late 1970s, including their taxonomy, anatomy, biology and floral evolution, which are essential for any further studies on their hybridisation. During these studies, contrary to the highest expectations, over 215 species of orchids were collected, including species that were till then believed to be extinct, like the ladies' slipper orchid Paphiopedilum druryii.\n\nOrigin and evolution of the flower\n\nManilal has led studies on the directions of evolution of flowers and the structure and anatomy of various floral organs in cash crops such as coconut palms, grasses (rice), orchids, compositae (sun flower), rubiales (coffee), etc. Many enigmas in these subjects could be solved, and results were published in around 45 research papers. These studies have, besides seeing the flower as the most significant part of the plant, with biological, commercial, aesthetic, evolutionary and taxonomic importance, also promoted success in hybridisation and breeding experiments, to create new high-yielding varieties.\n\nRadioactive resistant marine phyto-planktonic algae\n\nAs the beaches in southern Kerala and Tamil Nadu (particularly in the Districts of Kollam and Nagarcoil) have natural deposits of radioactive minerals causing genetic damage to flora and fauna, Manilal undertook studies to familiarise with the techniques of research in the field of radiation ecology. These studies were undertaken at the Marine Biology Laboratory of North Wales University at Menai Bridge, Wales. The Royal Society of London granted Manilal a Visiting Scientist-ship for this work for two years in 1971\u20131972.\n\nTwo species of marine phyto-planktonic algae were discovered, which could withstand a very high degree of radioactivity. It was found that these species could absorb and adsorb as much as 40 times their body weight of the radioactive Thorium compounds from surrounding seawater, and continue to live normally. In the 1970s these findings were farfetched to be accepted for publication in a journal in U.K. However, on Manilal's return to India, a part of these findings was published in the journal Current Science (1975), by the Indian Institute of Science. About ten years later, some British scientists did a similar work and their results were published in the prestigious U.K. journal Nature, and wide publicity in the press as a biotechnological break-through. Manilal's experiments (and the subsequent work by the British scientists) show that such marine planktonic algae could be used to quickly and safely clean up ocean surfaces where radio-active materials have accumulated, by cultivating such algae in a specific area and later removing them from there.\n\nIndian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT)\n\nManilal was instrumental in establishing the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT). Manilal, as founder President, established IAAT in the year 1990 with its Headquarters located at the Department of Botany, University of Calicut, Kozhikode, India. The IAAT works to promote the science of Angiosperm Taxonomy in India, to provide a common forum for Angiosperm taxonomists in India to organise meetings, hold discussions and exchange ideas on scientific and academic matters, and encourage collaborative work among taxonomists. The IAAT publishes a journal Rheedea (named after Hendrik van Rheede). The Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy works as an affiliate of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy.\n\nFrom 1969 Manilal commenced training research students in Taxonomy (leading to PhD degree in the subject), with a view to attain self-sufficiency in Taxonomy. During the years 1972\u20131998, he and his students discovered over 240 new species of flowering plants and several new records for India from Kerala, and published many research papers in Taxonomy in national and international journals.\n\nBiomass Research Centre\n\nA Biomass Research Centre was established by Manilal in the University of Calicut, with funding from the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources. The Centre does research and field experiments to establish the (taxonomic) identification of fast-growing fuel-wood trees suitable for various agro-climatic zones of Kerala.\n\nSummary of Manilal's discoveries\n\nNew species and varieties discovered, and combinations established by Manilal and his research associates are summarised are follows:\n\nNew species discovered in Silent Valley\n\nLiparis indiraii Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nEria tiagii Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nHydnocarpus pendulus Manilal, T.Sabu & Sivar.\n\nRobiquetia josephiana Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nSauropus saksenianus Manilal, Prasann. & Sivar.\n\nCucumella silentvaleyi Manilal, T.Sabu & P.J.Mathew\n\nOberonia bisaccata Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nNew species discovered under biodiversity studies\n\nHedyotis erecta Manilal & Sivar.\n\nCinnamomum nicolsonianum Manilal & Shylaja\n\nBulbophyllum rheedei Manilal & C.S.Kumar\n\nHeliotropium keralense Sivar. & Manilal\n\nBorreria malabarica Sivar. & Manilal\n\nPhyllanthus kozhikodianus Sivar. & Manilal\n\nHabenaria indica C.S.Kumar & Manilal\n\nNew varieties of flowering plants discovered\n\nBorreria stricta (L. f.)

Manilal's copyright, as author of the English and Malayalam versions, was bequeathed, free of royalties, to the publishers, the University of Kerala. This assignment of rights was a gesture by Manilal in good faith and in response to a specific appeal from the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala, that the University wanted to generate funds from this publication for utilisation of such royalty incomes toward re-publication of old Malayalam classical works, which are out of print, and not forecasted to generate a viable level of income due to limited sale of such classical works.\n\nBook-release functions conducted by the publishers\n\nIn a recorded interview with Manilal in August 2008, he expressed his regret and frustration at the manner in which the publishers subjected him to digression from the publication project soon after he legally assigned his rights as author. Apparently there was a move to exclude Manilal's name from the book (2003), but was reinstated on account of questions raised by the academic community. On 14 August 2008, the University of Kerala officials again conducted a function at Thiruvananthapuram to formally release the Malayalam edition of Hortus Malabaricus. The book was released by the Governor of Kerala (also Chancellor of the University), at the function; where due recognition was not given to Manilal as author of the book, nor were arrangements in place to felicitate the author at the function.

As the number of accepted papers increased, the journal was bifurcated in 1955 into two parts - Part A (Physical Sciences) and Part B (Biological Sciences). When the National Institute of Sciences of India was renamed as the Indian National Science Academy in 1970, the journal became Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy. It continued to be published in two parts with six issues each in a calendar year. In 1997, the Academy decided to publish only review articles of contemporary scientific interest, evaluating advances and newer approaches in the given field. The emphasis thus shifted from being a vehicle of original research reports into one of reviews, and comprehensive summary reports on chosen topics.

The mind tussles with memory to wrestle out names \u2014 of things, titles and places. K.S. Manilal says it was a paragraph that changed the course of his life\u2019s work. But to remember what it said is an effort for the 75-year-old professor emeritus now. He tries, gives up. But after silence that stretches for a few moments, the words burst out eloquently. \u201cThe plant\u2019s part if applied on the left toe improves the clarity of vision in the right eye.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, when a bunch of incorrigible Latin words he picked out from Hortus Malabaricus, the 12-volume, 17th century work by Dutchman Hendrik Van Rheede became lucid, Manilal knew he had to know what the rest holds. \u201cOf course, they knew the plant\u2019s medicinal properties. But what struck me was the link between the left toe and the right eye.\u201d Translating the volumes of Hortus from Latin to English and Malayalam and interpreting it in modern scientific terms have taken away a large chunk of Manilal\u2019s career \u2014 well over 40 years. For his dogged perseverance with little support from elsewhere, the botanist was honoured by Van Rheede\u2019s country; Queen Beatrix bestowed on him Netherland\u2019s highest civilian order \u2014 Officer of the Order of Orange \u2014 Nassau in 2012. \u201cThe Consul General came to Kozhikode to give him the honour,\u201d pitches in wife Jyotsna, Manilal\u2019s constant aid. She takes baby steps with him as he slowly finds his way after a stroke partially paralysed him eight years ago. She pitches in too when he struggles with names of students and books or to recall incidents.\n\nThere were many things about Hortus that drew Manilal to it. Having grown up in Kochi, tomes on the plant wealth of the region was natural curiosity for any botanist. \u201cAlso nobody really knew anything about it. Their awareness began and ended with the title and to think this was a really important text to us. First-hand information about it was nil. I had to start from scratch.\u201d\n\nHis father, a \u201cvoracious reader\u201d and lawyer, had meticulously piled up whatever paper cuttings he came across of these volumes. Manilal\u2019s first interaction with the physical volumes were at the then Dehradun Imperial Forest Research Institute which he visited for a study tour as a post-graduate student at Sagar University. \u201cIn the first instance, I spent four days there and copied down all the Malayalam names in the 12 volumes.\u201d\n\nLater when he joined Calicut University as faculty in the 1960s, he went back to Hortus . What stood between any scholar and the volumes was intimidating Latin. \u201cIt was not easy; learning Latin then.\u201d Yet he began with the small paragraph which unlocked the co-ordination between the left toe and the right eye. \u201cI had approached Father Pathroni for help. Being busy, he had said if it was a small segment he would help. That is how I went with that paragraph to him,\u201d recalls Manilal.\n\nThe paragraph\u2019s message bolstered Manilal\u2019s conviction to translate Hortus. He banked on Father Anthony Mukkath in Kochi to teach him Latin. \u201cEvery month I would travel to Kochi for 2-3 days and spend time with him. A lot of work was done that way over months.\u201d But soon, Mukkath passed away. \u201cBy then I could manage with the basic language I had learnt. Translating each volume took me 3-4 years. Now I look back and wonder how I did it.\u201d\n\nThe task for Manilal was never of a mere translator, but of a botanist. He scouted the regions mentioned in the volumes searching and verifying the 740-odd species mentioned in it.\n\n\u201cThe location where some plants were found was mentioned. So that helped. In other instances, the plants had migrated. In the sense, they were not found at the location mentioned in the volume but in nearby areas. I could find all except one, a plant called \u2018chentani,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nAfter decades decoding Hortus, when all was done, Manilal bowed to the Kerala University\u2019s request for copyright. He did so shunning offers from other publishers.\n\nThough Hortus took much of his time, other publications and papers complete his repertoire.\n\nAmong it is the Flora of Silent Valley, an extensive study he carried out with three research students, documenting over 950 plant species and thereby preventing the establishment of the controversial hydro-electric project in the ecologically sensitive region. \u201cAn earlier study had recorded only 240 species in the region. Our study, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, took us four years. The terrain was difficult, filled as it was with wild animals and reptiles,\u201d he recalls.\n\nHe also studied the plants of Kozhikode, the city now home.\n\nThe Flora of Kozhikode documents the plants in what he calls Greater Kozhikode region extending till Ponnani along the Chaliyar.\n\n\u201cI did it at a time when no local plants were studied and had documented over 1,000 species.\u201d\n\nAs the botanist who has discovered 18 new plant species struggles with the finer details of his past, Manilal says, \u201cSometimes I do feel recognition has come from outside but not our own people.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://insaindia.res.in/", "page_content": "#NewsCoverage: \"Why boosting FDI in the space sector is the need of the hour.\"The new Indian Space Policy highlights the intention to harness the collaborative potential of both public and private sectors.
