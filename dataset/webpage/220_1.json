Torres began her career in 1984, winning a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay. She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4\u00d7100 free relay in 1992. Tall and strikingly attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue. She also achieved notice as a commercial spokeswoman on an infomercial for a fitness training method. But in late 1998, she elected to return to competitive swimming. With little time to prepare, she returned to the Olympic pool at Sydney, and won five medals, including two golds in relays. She won three individual bronze medals at Sydney \u2013 in the 50 free, the 100 free, and the 100 fly.\n\nAgain retiring after the 2000 Olympics, Torres did not compete in Athina. But in 2006 she began training to make another Olympic team and made the US team for Beijing, winning the Olympic Trials in both the 50 and 100 metre freestyle. But she elected to compete in Beijing only in the 50 and the 4\u00d7100 freestyle and medley relays. Aged 41, the oldest ever female Olympic swimmer, Torres won a silver medal in the 50 free, defeated by only 1/100th of a second. She added silver medals in both relays. Torres finished her Olympic career lacking only an individual gold medal. She swam through 2012, but just missed out making the US Olympic team for the London Olympics. Torres won four Olympic medals of each color, one of only three Olympians to have won four or more medals of each type (Takashi Ono of Japan, and Larisa Latynina in gymnastics are the others)."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/sports/olympics/biotorres.html", "page_content": "Dara Torres\n\nDara Torres, 41, is the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympics and the oldest to qualify for a Games.

Torres talks about that in-depth for the first time in a documentary that airs on the SEC Network on Monday called \u201cOnce Upon A Comeback.\u201d\n\nAs a swimmer at the University of Florida during the \u201880s, Torres says she faced pressure from coaches, particularly Randy Reese, to lose weight. At the time, the coaches didn\u2019t know a lot about eating disorders, she says.\n\nOne coach wanted the team to look intimidating to competitors on the starting blocks and set a weight goal for the swimmers to meet, she says. If someone didn\u2019t make weight, they had to do extra workouts.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, having come from a background where I've never trained like that before in my life, to have to do extra workouts was just, that wasn't going to happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd one thing led to another. I sort of got in this habit of bingeing and purging in my freshman year, and that's kind of how it all started and just sort of snowballed from there.\u201d\n\nThe coaches weighed the girls right on the pool deck, as Torres describes in the film, and sometimes the swimmers would break down in tears if they didn't make weight. The intense pressure to make weight came from an inner desire to please her coaches, she says.\n\nThe cycle of bingeing and purging took over Torres\u2019 life and psyche \u2014 but now she views the difficult experience as a lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a very dark time in my life and I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yet I learned a lot from it and it made me the person who I am today.\u201d\n\nTorres says she tried talking to a male team doctor at the university about her struggles, but the conversation ended with him handing her information on eating disorders.\n\nAfter she graduated college, she went to get a physical and the doctor asked her if she\u2019s ever binged and purged. Torres said no, but later called the doctor back and admitted she had a problem.\n\nThe first step to recovery was opening up about her disorder, she says. Her advice to people struggling with eating disorders is to talk about it.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a lot of work to do after that but it was a huge relief to get it off my shoulders after four years of only me knowing that I had this issue,\u201d she says.\n\nTorres swam in the Olympics in Seoul in 1988, Barcelona in 1992, Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008. When the time to train for Beijing arrived, Torres was pregnant, in her 40s and swimming for exercise.\n\nShe says she received invitations to swim in a few meets, and then people started to ask, \u201cWouldn't it be great to see a middle-aged person in the Olympic Games?\u201d Since she loves a challenge, Torres decided to go for gold once again.\n\nThe swimmer ended up winning three silver medals in Beijing. As she trained, Torres kept the goal of winning a gold medal in her head.\n\n\u201cI kept that thought with me every single day for the almost two years after that I trained for the Olympic trials and Olympic Games,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really think the power of positive thinking can play a role in what you do in your life.\u201d\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how she started swimming\n\n\u201cWell, I have four older brothers, and I was very competitive the minute I was born. It's like, who could be the first one in the car? Who could be the first one done at the dinner table? Just always competing with them. Whatever they would do, I would do. So the minute they started on a swim team, my mom had me in the stands. That didn't go very well because I had a lot of energy. And I think back then they called it hyperactivity, but I'm sure I had ADD. And she put me in the pool just to get the energy out and not have it all around her and just focus it somewhere. So I started swimming and just fell in love with the sport.\u201d\n\nOn whether swimming came easy to her\n\n\u201cIt really did. I really could just get up on the starting blocks and do the start into the water and swim fast and no big deal. And I think that all changed when I started to notice changes in my body, started to become more of a woman, and realized that I actually have to work hard to be fast. It just doesn't come easy anymore. \u201c\n\nOn if she left the sport satisfied after she didn\u2019t qualify for a sixth Olympic team in 2012\n\n\u201cI really did. It's funny because when I got out of the pool after those Olympic trials and I missed the team by nine one-hundredths of a second, I looked in the stands. I saw my daughter crying and I saw my mom crying. I'm like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to go over and console them.\u2019 And, you know, my mom, obviously, she was upset because she's my mom and she wanted to see me make another Olympic team, but my daughter, I'm like, \u2018Tessa, What's wrong? Are you OK?\u2019 She's like, \u2018Now I don't get to go to London and see Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte.\u2019 I'm like, oh, my gosh, she's starting way too early, you know? So it was kind of funny. It was a little bit of a role reversal of, you know, me having to console my mom. But I was OK. I knew that the time that I did Olympic trials, my sixth Olympic trials, was the second-fastest time I've ever done at trials. But the girls are getting faster and I couldn't give it anything else. I gave it all I had.\u201d\n\nOn what she tells her daughter about body image and her experience with eating disorders\n\n\u201cI continuously tell her how beautiful she is on the inside and out and not to base everything off of food. And just to make sure that when you want to eat stuff that, you know, you're maybe not supposed to have, eat it in smaller portions and you'll be fine.\u201d\n\nAlex Ashlock produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Todd Mundt.

Journalism 1984\n\nClad in stylishly torn white jeans, a yellow T-shirt and blue flip flops, Dara Torres, B.S. Telecommunication 1990, runs onto the football field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and promptly does eight pushups, then quiets the crowd. Putting down the orange-and-blue 2-Bits sign, the 12-time Olympic swimming medalist uses her toned arms to point to one side of the massive crowd, then the other, as the honorary Ms. Two Bits for the October 2017 Texas A&M game.\n\nIt was one of her favorite moments at the University of Florida, Torres says. \u201cI got to show my family UF, reminisce and get all nostalgic.\u201d\n\nTorres\u2019 swimming career was nothing short of incredible. While at UF, she earned 28 NCAA All-American swimming awards, the most possible, and was named NCAA Swimmer of the Year and Southeastern Conference\u2019s Athlete of the Year (both in 1988). As an Olympian, Torres won twelve Olympic medals (four gold, four silver, four bronze), tying two other swimmers for the most Olympic women\u2019s swimming medals, and is a former world record-holder in three events. She is the first swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008) and one of a handful of Olympians who won a medal at five games. And, at age 41, she was the oldest swimmer to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team.\n\nTorres recalled back in 1986 how crazy it all seemed during her first Saturday morning swimming practice on the day of a home football game.\n\n\u201cI grew up in California, Los Angeles, and you just aren\u2019t fazed by the colleges there \u2014 there are so many,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget \u2026 after one of my first morning workouts about 5:30, I couldn\u2019t believe it when I walked out \u2026 I was blown away that by the time we got out at 8, I was bombarded by people in orange and blue, with their faces painted. What are these crazy people doing? It was my first eye-opening experience.\u201d\n\nSo weird, she says she thought at the time. \u201cIt was a great atmosphere to be in. The whole entire town was cheering on the Gators. It took me a little while to go to a game, but I did after three or four games. Then I thought: This is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nNow 51, the married mother of 12-year-old Tessa Grace says majoring in telecommunication at the College of Journalism and Communications (UFCJC) prepared her for a job in television and beyond.\n\nShe chose to study at UF because other colleges didn\u2019t have the hands-on program that UFCJC did, she says. \u201cIt was one of the reasons I chose UF. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of being able to direct and produce and do other kind of fun stuff, behind the scenes. It wasn\u2019t just get out a book. We did really cool stuff. To work at the TV station and get that experience that you need was critical because once that little red light goes on, it\u2019s a much different story.\n\n\u201cIt prepared me for life after college.\u201d\n\nTorres says she\u2019s \u201chad so many great gigs,\u201d including her work on a hockey show, a golf show for the Resort Sports Network and more. But don\u2019t label her a color commentator \u2014 something she admits to not being very good at. \u201cI branched out and have done lots of other things. I will say that I enjoyed the whole experience of doing what I loved to do. I was very blessed and honored.\u201d\n\nBeyond TV, Torres has been a model and businesswoman, raised money for cancer research and written two best-selling books: \u201cAge is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life,\u201d a memoir published in April 2009, and \u201cGold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program,\u201d published a year later.\n\nL ooking young and acting young \u2014 through exercise \u2014 are big parts of her life. \u201cI\u2019ve always stayed in shape. I love working out, the way it makes you feel, the way it makes you look,\u201d she says. Even though she just moved back to Parkland, Florida, from Massachusetts, she\u2019ll travel to her Barre Studio up North every four to six weeks to keep her certification as a barre instructor.\n\nShe\u2019s also a spokeswoman for a couple of companies; co-hosts an all-female sports talk show on CBS Sports, \u201cWe Need to Talk\u201d; and does guest appearances as a motivational speaker on topics such as women\u2019s empowerment, never giving up on your dreams and being an Olympian.\n\nToday, she would tell CJC students to take advantage of every opportunity they can to get experience.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to get a job in NBC sports and in the CNN PR department, and then it was a non-paying job,\u201d Torres said. \u201cBut if you get an opportunity to do something, to get the experience, take it. That experience may never come up again. I started as a runner, an intern. There\u2019s a lot of grunt work you have to do, then work your way up.\u201d\n\nShe also feels fortunate to have spent time at UF when Bill Arnsparger was athletic director. \u201cHe was awesome,\u201d she says of the former Miami Dolphins\u2019 defensive coordinator who died in 2015. \u201cHe and his wife sort of became my family away from home. He was very humble. So humble. They were just very sweet.\u201d\n\nHer status as an Olympian is \u201cvery hard to describe,\u201d she says, searching for words. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know what you go through to be the best you can be. Sometimes when they broadcast the Olympics they show something about going to morning practices, the up-close-and personal. What people don\u2019t understand is it\u2019s a lot of hard work. You spent your whole life training for this. For me, it was 24 seconds. The biggest event in the world that happens every four years, and the best athletes in the world go to it. You will never be in a competition at a higher level than the Olympic games. It\u2019s an indescribably amazing experience. You have to take it all in. Before you know it, it\u2019s all gone. It takes you forever and then it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nWill we see her on TV at the 2020 summer Olympic games? She won\u2019t do color commentary, but she wouldn\u2019t mind putting her UF degree to work interviewing swimmers.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s back to UF. It \u201cis an amazing school, amazing campus, amazing community. It\u2019s a big school, but it ends up being a small community once you are there.\u201d\n\nPosted: September 6, 2018\n\nCategory: Alumni Profiles, Profiles, Sports\n\nTagged as: Dara Torres, olympics"}, {"url": "https://www.daratorres.com/about-dara-torres/", "page_content": "About Dara Torres\n\nDara Torres, the most decorated US female Olympic athlete of all-time, NY Times best-selling author, fitness advocate, motivational speaker, entrepreneur, and mother, started her career on the international stage by breaking her first world record at the age of 15.

Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women's team in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay final together with Mitzi Kremer, Laura Walker and Mary Wayte; and won a silver medal for swimming the freestyle leg of the 4x100-meter medley relay in the third heat of the qualifying round for the second-place U.S. team. Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.\n\n1992 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She swam the second leg of the 4x100-meter freestyle relay for the winning U.S. team that included Nicole Haislett, Angel Martino and Jenny Thompson, and earned a gold medal for her efforts in the final event and first-round qualifying heat. Ashley Tappin and Chrissy Ahmann also swam for the team in the qualifying heats of the event.\n\n2000 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but, as usual, saved her best for two of the major relay events of the U.S. Olympic women's team. She swam the second leg for the winning U.S. women's team in final of the 4x100-meter freestyle team that included Amy Van Dyken, Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson, with Erin Phenix and Ashley Tappin also swimming in the qualifying rounds. Torres won a second gold medal for anchoring the winning U.S. team in the 4x100-meter medley relay, together with teammates B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann and Jenny Thompson in the final, and Courtney Shealy, Staciana Stitts, Ashley Tappin and Amy Van Dyken in the qualifying rounds. Torres also earned three individual bronze medals in each of the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle\u2014tying teammate Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event. At 33 years old, Torres was already the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (5) than any other team member.\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\n\nAt age 41, Torres returned to the pool to obtain a spot in her fifth Olympic Games, unprecedented for an American female swimmer, especially given the fact that she sat out the 1996 and 2004 Olympic games. In fact, she is the first woman in history to swim in the Olympics past the age of 40. Her Olympic career spans twenty-four years.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, she qualified for the finals in the 50-meter freestyle that were held on July 6. In that semi-final, she broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds. On July 6, in the finals she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the 50-meter freestyle. On July 7, Torres confirmed that she would be pulling out of 100-meter freestyle swim for her time at the Beijing Olympics to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle. Lacey Nymeyer took over the position from Torres. On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, together with Amanda Beard and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.\n\nIn order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for an enhanced drug-testing program. According to her, when people ask if she is on performance-enhancing drugs, she takes it as a compliment. Torres uses resistance stretching with trainers Anne Tierney and Steve Sierra from Innovative Body Solutions and refers to this training as her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.\n\nTorres won silver on August 10, 2008, at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing as the anchor swimmer of the U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay. This was the fifth time in five tries she has earned an Olympic medal in that event.\n\nOn August 17, 2008, at the age of 41 years and 125 days, she won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07, 0.01 of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. About thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal as part of the U.S. 4x100-meter medley relay team. Torres' split on the 4x100 medley relay (52.27) is the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time a full second faster\u2014fast even for a relay split.\n\nTorres' twelve Olympic medals tie the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer with fellow American Jenny Thompson. Eight of Thompson's medals were gold, compared with Torres' four. However, Torres has won twice as many individual medals (4) as Thompson (2), Thompson having won ten medals in relay team events.\n\n2009 National and World Championships\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle and placed in the 50-met butterfly to qualify to swim at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Italy. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.\n\n2012 Summer Olympics\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, Torres stated in September 2010 that she had begun training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTorres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks such as NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN and Fox News Channel. She now hosts the golf show The Clubhouse, on the Resort Sports Network. She is also an occasional model, having appeared in the Sports Illustrated 1994 Swimsuit Issue. In 2005, she was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen. Her second marriage was also brief from June 2003 to December 2004, to Israeli-born surgeon Itzhak Shasha. Prior to marrying Shasha, Torres officially converted to Judaism (her late father was Jewish) to formalise her status under Halacha.\n\nTorres is no longer dating her reproductive endocrinologist, David Hoffman, but the two remain close friends. Hoffman was the fertility doctor who treated Torres. When Torres and Shasha separated, Torres and Hoffman began dating. Torres and Hoffman are the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in April 2006.\n\nBP Products North America engaged Torres in 2009 to be part of its \"Team Invigorate\" advertising campaign to inspire others to live \"younger for longer.\" She is the author of the inspirational memoir, Age is Just a Number, published in April 2009, and Gold Medal Fitness, published in May 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, The New York Times reported that a sports medicine doctor, Anthony Galea, with whom Torres had previously consulted, was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly distributing human growth hormone and the drug Actovegin to professional athletes. Torres said that Dr. Galea's work was limited to draining fluid from her knee and diagnosing a muscle tear.\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research, in which she has participated for several years.\n\nSee also\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nList of notable Jewish swimmers\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n\nList of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n\nList of United States records in swimming\n\nList of University of Florida alumni\n\nList of University of Florida Olympians\n\nWorld record progression 50 metres freestyle\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nTorres, Dara, & Elizabeth Weil, Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life , Broadway Books, New York, New York (2009).

I'm clean.\"[31] In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor, and two masseuses, Torres used resistance-stretching trainers, calling it her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.[14][32] Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo, Toyota, and Bloomberg L.P.[14]\n\n\"I think this performance ranks up there with the biggest performances in sports ever ... It puts Dara in the ranks of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods.

Torres began her career in 1984, winning a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay. She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4\u00d7100 free relay in 1992. Tall and strikingly attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue. She also achieved notice as a commercial spokeswoman on an infomercial for a fitness training method. But in late 1998, she elected to return to competitive swimming. With little time to prepare, she returned to the Olympic pool at Sydney, and won five medals, including two golds in relays. She won three individual bronze medals at Sydney \u2013 in the 50 free, the 100 free, and the 100 fly.\n\nAgain retiring after the 2000 Olympics, Torres did not compete in Athina. But in 2006 she began training to make another Olympic team and made the US team for Beijing, winning the Olympic Trials in both the 50 and 100 metre freestyle. But she elected to compete in Beijing only in the 50 and the 4\u00d7100 freestyle and medley relays. Aged 41, the oldest ever female Olympic swimmer, Torres won a silver medal in the 50 free, defeated by only 1/100th of a second. She added silver medals in both relays. Torres finished her Olympic career lacking only an individual gold medal. She swam through 2012, but just missed out making the US Olympic team for the London Olympics. Torres won four Olympic medals of each color, one of only three Olympians to have won four or more medals of each type (Takashi Ono of Japan, and Larisa Latynina in gymnastics are the others)."}, {"url": "https://connect.ufalumni.ufl.edu/network/successfulgator/d-torres", "page_content": "Dara Torres\n\n\u00bbBS TELECOMMUNICATION, 1990\n\nDara Torres is known for her age-defying athletic ability. By age 14, she had set her first world record in swimming, and at age 41 she was the oldest swimmer to earn a spot on the United States Olympic team. Torres came to the University of Florida on an athletic scholarship in 1985 and earned 28 All-American swimming honors, the maximum number possible during a collegiate career. She went on to set two additional world records as a five-time Olympian and 12-time Olympic medalist.\n\nHer career of longevity and greatness has placed her among the greatest swimmers of all time. She is the first and only swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games, and is among only a handful of athletes to have earned at least one medal in every Olympics she competed.

After defeating bulimia, which hampered her stamina, she began a career in modeling and TV sports commentary. At age 32, she returned to athletic fitness by following an intense regimen of work-outs, diet, and treatment for chronic asthma. She re-entered Olympic competition and won five more medals\u2014three bronze and two gold. Her career total reached four bronze, one silver, and three gold Olympic medals.\n\nFrom Hyperactivity to Competition\n\nBorn on April 15, 1967 in Beverly Hills, California, Torres was born to former model Marylu Torres, a Miss Rheingold finalist, and real estate broker Edjward Torres. Dara Torres enjoyed a privileged childhood and displayed more than normal energy levels and heightened urges to best her siblings. She as well as her four older brothers\u2014Mike, Kirk, Brad, and Rick \u2014and little sister Lara learned swimming from their mom. Dara entered competitive swimming at age eight and quickly outpaced her elder brothers. After her mother's divorce and remarriage to tournament tennis player Edward Kauder in 1977, Dara rechanneled her hyperactivity, with Kauder's help, into athletic competition.\n\nWhen she was 12 Torres set a national age-group swim record. On entering her teens at the prestigious Westlake School in Los Angeles, she received a \"Most Likely to Break a Record in the Guinness Book\" citation. At age 14, under the guidance of Tandem Swim Club coach Terry Palma of Culver City, California. Up, Torres started collecting a growing list of honors and won national acclaim. Upon entering Mission Viejo High School, to be near her coach and team for daily workouts, she boarded with Flo and Mike Stutzman and their 10-year-old daughter, Heather. Torres practiced regularly at the University of Southern California pool and followed strict house rules that allowed group activities, but no dating. In February 1983, an article in Sports Illustrated remarked on her breaking swim champ Jill Sterkel's world record at Amersfoort, Holland.\n\nAt a Glance . . .\n\nB orn on April 15, 1967, in Beverly Hills, CA.

Website\u2014 http://www.dara-torres.com/\n\nFrom Champion to Olympian\n\nAt 17 years old Torres was already 5' 10.5\". She amazed Coach Marck Schubert of the Mission Viejo swim club with off-the-gun weight shifts, instant reflexes, and fast twitch muscle response, which biopsies the previous year compared with similar reactive tissue in Olympic diver Greg Louganis. She battled bulimia during regular swim meets and still took a first place in the Olympics 400-meter freestyle relay at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Three years later, at the Pan Pacific Championships, she garnered a sweet reward for hard work\u2014three golds in the 100-and 400-meter freestyle and the 400-meter relay. In 1988, she won bronze for the 400-meter freestyle relay and silver for the 400-meter medley.\n\nWhile completing a bachelor's degree in broadcasting and communications at the University of Florida, Torres managed to garner 28 All-America honors for athletic achievement. In 1990 following several years of therapy she finally defeated her eating disorder. At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics she won gold once more in the 400-meter free relay and retired, contented with an additional first place, bringing her total of Olympic medals to six.\n\nIn 1993 Torres was diagnosed with chronic asthma, which she controlled with daily doses of inhalant drugs. Undeterred, she did not venture far from the sports realm. Work as sports commentator and reporter for ESPN, TNT, Fox News, and Fox Sports and as sports research assistant at NBC introduced her to different career goals. She branched out by hosting science and technology programs for the Discovery Channel, fashion modeling, and emceeing tae-bo workout tapes.\n\nTraining Again at 33\n\nIn March 1999 Torres resumed her athletic career after her boyfriend teased that just talking about swimming put a gleam in her eye. Her relationship with the boyfriend faded, but thoughts of a return to the lanes revived the natural competitiveness of the two-time Olympic gold medalist. Her first phone call to swim sprint specialist Richard Quick, the Stanford University and Olympic women's team coach, convinced him that she had reignited the competitive spark. With her savings, private donations, and sponsorship by Speedo and Computer Associates, she shucked a lucrative modeling contract and her work on the tae-bo infomercials and flew to Palo Alto, California. Despite the lapse of seven years and loss of muscle tone, she convinced Quick that she sincerely intended to qualify for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team.\n\nTorres also sought the support of 1992 swim team-mate Jenny Thompson, a five-time gold medalist, who helped her locate temporary residence in Menlo Park, California. At age 32, Torres became the first American swimmer to train for a fourth try for Olympic gold. At Stanford University, she was surprised to feel old and underweight among the svelte, smooth-limbed teen-aged rivals, who dubbed her \"granny,\" according to Newsweek.\n\nQuick began retraining Torres in newer methods of stretching the body, rotating the hips, and gazing down while stroking out. To master the modern freestyle, she attended a youth swim camp and practiced among children who weren't even born when she retired in 1992. To compensate for lost breathing capacity from asthma, she forced a full exhale under water and drew a replacement breath when she surfaced. Workouts matched up to four hours of pool time with spinningand flexibility exercises, weight training, yoga, and Pilates.\n\nBeat the Odds\n\nGlorying in the rebuilding of flaccid limbs, Torres beefed up with 20 pounds of muscle while cross-training and stabilizing abdominal muscles, lower back, hips, thighs, and buttocks. Under the guidance of British strength trainer Robert Weir, an Olympic discus and hammer throw competitor, she increased bench-presses from 105 to 205 pounds. The workouts started her on the way to new challenges. In December of 1999 at the U. S. Open in San Antonio, Texas, she won the 50-meter freestyle against her friend Jenny Thompson. In March of 2000 Torres snagged a national title in the 100-meter freestyle at the Phillips 66 Nationals in Federal Way, Washington. She told Newsweek, \"I am more competitive now than I've ever been in my life.\"\n\nFor 13 months Torres swam, trained, and lifted weights for six hours a day, specializing in kickboard workouts and the Gravitron, her favorite exercise machine. The program demanded one-on-one strength training, dry-land aerobics, flip turn maneuvers, and weekly circuit training by jumping rope, building abs, rope climbing, and doing hundreds of crunches and pullups daily. De-stressing muscles called for pummeling from two trainers who walked in sock feet on her back and legs. The added exertion required six meals per day comprised of 30 percent protein, 30 percent fat, and 40 percent carbohydrates supplemented with 25 pills, Gu carbohydrate powder, Zone bars, Runner's Advantage (liquid creatine), and hydration with Revenge sports drink.\n\nIn view of her fervor, fellow Olympic swimming medalist Donna de Varona surmised that Torres had quit before reaching the greatness she was capable of. The return was a means of completing \"unfinished business.\" Torres warded off a spurious announcement by the New York Post that she was dating New York Senator Alphonse D'Amato. More serious were team-mates' accusations of attention grabbing, which prompted Coach Quick to begin training Torres away from the other Olympic aspirants. She strongly rebutted the implication of USA Today columnist Christine Brennan that Torres might owe her rapid reduction of lane sprints to performance-enhancing drugs. Torres's mother credited her daughter's performance to a lifelong pattern of overachieving. Quick told USA Today, \"She's packed three years of training into one.\"\n\nA Star with a Future\n\nThe records began to fall to Torres's intense energy and determination. In June of 2000 she set a U. S. record at the 50-meter freestyle trials. In early August of 2000 at the Olympic tryouts in Indianapolis, she thrashed out her fastest times to qualify for the Sydney events in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter butter-fly, and 400-meter freestyle relay. Speculators immediately predicted that she would become the oldest U. S. female swimmer to win a medal and the first swimmer to medal at four separate Olympics. Their prophecies came true as she left Sydney with three bronze medals for the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter fly and two gold medals for the 400-meter freestyle and 400-meter medley.\n\nWhile looking for ways to aid young swimmers and give something back to the sport that brought her fame, Torres savored stardom, yet stored her medals under her bed. In November Women's Wear Daily invited her along with gymnast Nadia Comaneci and track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee to the unveiling of a salute to female athletes at New York City's Madison Square Garden. In March of 2001 Torres published a brief memoir, \"The Beauty of Dreams,\" in Rodale's Fitness Swimmer, in which she acknowledged a maturity that enabled her to select and attain worthy aims. Graciously, she recognized Coach Quick for building her cardiovascular endurance and core strength.\n\nTorres showed no intention of abandoning sports. She considered applying her understanding of physiology and nutrition to coaching, sports commentary, and public relations. To keep the hunger for competition under control, she worked for Turner Sports, served Self Magazine as fitness expert, and began pursuing extreme sports, including high-speed race-car driving at the Toyota Grand Prix at Long Beach.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nThe Complete Marquis Who's Who.

As a seven-year-old, she joined her older brothers at the community YMCA for swimming practice; afterward, she signed up for the swimming club in Culver City to train. At 14, she won the national open championship in the 50-yard freestyle by defeating the then-current champion, Jill Sterkel*, a college junior.\n\nShe attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School), and competed for their swim team under Coach Darlene Bible from the seventh grade through her sophomore year in high school. During her 1983\u201384 high school junior year, she left home to swim for the Mission Viejo Nadadores in Mission Viejo, California, while training for her first Olympics under Coach Mark Schubert. After the 1984 Olympics, Torres returned to the Westlake School to graduate in 1985.\n\nDara is a 12-time Olympic medalist (four gold, four silver, four bronze), and former world record-holder in three events. She is the first swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games (Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games, Seoul 1988 Olympic Games, Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games, Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Beijing 2008 Olympic Games), and at age 41, the oldest swimmer to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team. She won at least one medal in each of the five Olympics in which she competed, making her one of only a handful of Olympians to earn medals in five different Games. Torres\u2019 12 Olympic medals tied the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer set by fellow American Jenny Thompson in 2004; American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012.\n\nTorres attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, on an athletic scholarship, where she swam under Coach Randy Reese.\n\nInternational swimming career\n\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Dara Torres was a member of the U.S. women\u2019s 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay team, earning a gold medal in the event final. She was just 17 years old, and had not yet enrolled in college when she won her first Olympic medal. Although Torres burst onto the international swimming stage at a young age, her career was most notable for its incredible longevity.\n\nFor the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. Individually, Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.\n\nTorres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women\u2019s team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. She swam the second leg of the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay and earned a gold medal for her efforts.\n\nFirst comeback: 2000 Olympics\n\nAfter seven years out of competitive swimming, Torres came out of retirement at age 33 to become the oldest woman to win an Olympic swimming medal. She began to train for an Olympic comeback in 1999 under the guidance of Coach Richard Quick.\n\nShe won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Although she was the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, she won more medals (five) than any other U.S. team member.\n\nSecond comeback: 2008 Olympics\n\nOn August 1, 2007, at age 40, Torres won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis. Then she set a new American record in the 50-meter freestyle of 24.53 seconds, breaking her own record of 24.63 seconds set at the 2000 Summer Olympics. She lowered her initial American record by 1.62 seconds. Torres has broken or lowered her own American record in the 50-meter freestyle 10 times, which is the most by any American swimmer in any event.\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, she qualified for the event finals in the 50-meter freestyle and broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds in the semifinal. In the 50-meter finals, she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women\u2019s spot in the event. Torres also qualified in the 100-meter freestyle, but later withdrew from the individual 100-meter freestyle event to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle and 4\u00d7100-meter relay events.\n\nTorres qualified for a spot in the Olympic Games in 2008 at the age of 41, a first for an American female swimmer. She became the oldest U.S. Olympic swimmer in history and the first American swimmer to appear in five Olympic Games. Having given birth two years earlier, her Olympic teammates jokingly referred to her as \u201cMom.\u201d\n\nTorres captured three silver medals. Michael Lohberg, Torres\u2019 coach, when discussing her winning three Olympic silver medals at the age of 41 said, \u201cI think this performance ranks up there with the biggest performances in sports ever \u2026 It puts Dara in the ranks of Michael Phelps, Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods. What she has done is really not measurable.\u201d\n\nTorres says, \u201cAfter I got out of college I was someone who loved to do extra. My mentality was the more you do, the better you do. Starting my second to last Olympics, in 2000, it all changed. I had a hard Friday practice once and my coach told me \u2018go home, go to a movie if you want, but you\u2019re doing absolutely nothing until Monday.\u2019 \u201cI thought that was going to kill me. But when I came back Monday I had one of the best workouts ever.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time I was getting ready for Beijing 2008, I knew I couldn\u2019t do just what everyone else was doing. I was in my late thirties but got my head around recovery being different (for older athletes). You have to listen to your body.\u201d\n\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Torres won a silver medal as the anchor swimmer of the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. It was the fifth time in five tries she earned an Olympic medal in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. With the American relay team\u2019s second-place finish, she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history, surpassing British swimmer William Robinson, who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics.\n\nAlso at the 2008 Olympics she won the silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner. Her second-place time was a new American record and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay. Her split on the 4\u00d7100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women\u2019s 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres\u2019 time more than a full second faster.\n\nAftermath and final retirement\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of middle-aged women and men I know that contacted me, emailed or stopped me in the street to tell me that I am an inspiration to them and (they) are now doing things that they thought they couldn\u2019t do,\u201d Torres said.\n\nHer memoir, Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life, became a top-selling business book upon its publication. \u201cAge is really just a number and I\u2019m hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes, who maybe think they are too old to do something, to get back in or continue in the sport.\u201d Dara\u2019s journey has inspired millions of women to pursue their dreams, she embodies the \u201cYes I Can!\u201d approach to life.\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy, and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce. Only the top-two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career. After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming.\n\nLife outside swimming\n\n*Jill Sterkel was on the U.S. Olympic team in 1976 when the Germans [systematically and state-sponsored] were given anabolic steroids. Jill, along with Shirley Babashoff, Kim Peyton [Portland, Oregon\u2019s swimmer] and Wendy Boglioli won the 4 x 100-meter freestyle relay against great odds from the doped German girls. The 1976 US Olympic girls\u2019 swim team, was the greatest US Olympic team in the world. They were cheated out of gold medals by those who were illegally doped.

She broke one swimming world record by the age of 14\n\nTorres was born in Los Angeles, California. Her mother Marylu was a former American model, and her father was a real estate developer and casino owner who was originally from Cuba. She was the oldest of two females and the fifth of six children. Torres began swimming lessons at the local YMCA when she was seven years old, following in the footsteps of her elder brothers, and then enrolled in the Culver City swimming club to continue her training. At age 14, she defeated Jill Sterkel, a junior in college, the current champion, to win the 50-yard freestyle national open title.\n\n2. She was named Athlete of the Year in the Southeastern Conference and the NCAA in 1988\n\nFrom 1986 to 1989, Torres competed for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in the NCAA under the direction of coach Randy Reese. She won nine Southeastern Conference (SEC) individual titles during her four years as a Gator swimmer, including the 50-yard freestyle (1987, 1988, 1989), 100-yard freestyle (1987, 1988, 1989), 200-yard freestyle (1987), and 100-yard butterfly (1988, 1989). Torres was a member of six of the Gators\u2019 NCAA championship relay teams, including the 400-yard freestyle relay in 1986; the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays; the 400-yard freestyle relay; and the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays in 1989.\n\nIn 1988, Torres won three NCAA individual national championships (50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, and 100-yard butterfly). She received 28 All-American swimming awards, which is the highest amount that can be achieved during a collegiate career, becoming the SEC Female Swimmer of the Year in 1987 and 1989, as well as the SEC Athlete of the Year in 1988.\n\n3. Torres is the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2008)\n\nTorres competed in the first-round qualifying heat of the U.S. women\u2019s 4100-meter freestyle relay team at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and went on to win the gold medal in the competition. She qualified for the American Olympic women\u2019s squad in one individual event and two relay events for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Together with teammates Mitzi Kremer, Laura Walker, and Mary Wayte, Torres won a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women\u2019s team in the 4100-meter freestyle relay final.\n\nTorres competed in just one event to earn a spot on the American women\u2019s Olympic squad for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. She was awarded a gold medal for her efforts.

When she dove back into the pool at age 41 \u2014 24 years after her first Olympic appearance \u2014 she won America's hearts. Now 45, the 12-time medalist is fighting to compete in her sixth Olympics, and to become the oldest swimmer ever to participate in the games. As Marie Claire learned, she is as impressive as ever.\n\nIn 2008, your shocking comeback had the whole country pumped up and rooting for you. What motivated you to return to the Olympics?\n\n\n\nIt was peer pressure. I started swimming when I was pregnant, and just did it for fun. I went to a couple of meets, including the Masters World Championships where there were about 5,000 swimmers. So many of them came up to me and said, \"you should represent us in the Olympics \u2014 us older people.\"\n\nIs that the same reason you're competing in 2012?\n\n\n\nThis time around, I think it is more of a challenge. My age obviously is an issue, as is getting over reconstructive knee surgery. Having these little obstacles in my way makes it more fun.\n\nIs it that you want to be the world's oldest successful Olympic swimmer, or is it more that you are so competitive and want to win again?\n\n\n\nI think it is the challenge of staying in this sport so long, and trying to do something that no one else has done. That was the motivator, to be able to show that you don't put an age-limit on your dreams.\n\nA lot of people say you are an inspiration. How do you respond to that?\n\n\n\nI look at it as an honor. When people do come up to me and tell me that, and tell me their stories about how I've inspired them to do something they put off because they thought they were too old or they couldn't find the time, that inspires me to keep going. So, they are actually my inspirations.\n\nIs your six-year-old daughter swimming yet?\n\n\n\nShe loves to swim. She is really into the girly stuff like dance and ice-skating. But I have her swimming, and she's on a pre-team and that goes to swim meets three times a year. She really seems to enjoy it.\n\nYou look amazing for your age. Clearly, that's partly because you are in such great shape. But what else do you do to take care of yourself? What is your beauty routine?\n\n\n\nI'm in the sun almost every day, so I have to be resilient about taking care of my skin and my hair, and making sure I always stay hydrated. I use a great lotion called AmLactin that really helps with dry skin, and I always fluctuate between different shampoos. One of my favorite conditioners is Gwen's Blends. I also use BENGAY Zero Degrees after my workouts \u2014 after all, you can't look your best if you're sore and limping!\n\nYou're 6' tall. Did you always accept your height, or did you struggle to get comfortable with it?\n\n\n\nIt was hard growing up because I was always taller than all the boys, so I stood out a little bit. As I got older, I grew into being tall and I love it. It's funny: I used to be the tallest, but on our last Olympic team, there were a lot of tall girls out there. I'm proud to be tall \u2014 my whole family is.\n\nHow do you find clothes to flatter your long frame?\n\n\n\nI love stuff that fits on my hips. I don't like wearing stuff higher up, I don't like the way it looks or feels.\n\nFinally, you have the Olympic trials ahead of you in less than two months. Do you feel good about your chances?\n\n\n\nI'm comfortable with whatever happens. If you had asked me that in '08, I'd be like, \"no, I need to make the team.\" But I'm realistic. I am 45-years-old. My goal is to make it, but I've put in all the work and done everything I've needed to do, so now I'm just going to go out there and have fun.\n\nI know it's hard to look beyond London, but do you have any big plans?\n\n\n\nI don't have super-big plans. I just want to spend time with my daughter and be even more of a mom to her than I am now. And, take it easy."}]}
