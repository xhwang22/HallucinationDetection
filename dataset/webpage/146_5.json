She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular.[4] She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen[5] in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944,[6] immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944.[7] [8] They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).[9] Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself.[10] The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years,[11] being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film.[12] The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films,[13] which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film.[14] The success of The Violet Seller surpassed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved on her benefit.[15] She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the 10% of the records sale as royalties.[16] The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.[17]\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar.[18] Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, but many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each film,[19] and the press widely spread it, but this amount is far from what was published back then.

She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).\n\nSara Montiel attending the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Week in 1956.\n\nHollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain.

Later she conquered Mexico starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling after and she was introduced to US moviegoers in the film 'Vera Cruz' (1954) co-starring with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures which she quickly refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she free-lanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in 'Serenade' (1956) directed by Anthony Mann and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's 'Run of the arrow' (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson.\n\nThat same year she married Anthony Mann but returned briefly to Spain to star in a low budget film musical 'El ultimo cupl\u00e9' as a favor to producer-director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a who had helped her career in the early days. In the movie she was the first woman to display a low cleavage openly in Spanish cinema at a time when even a low cut dress was not acceptable. The cover for the album of the same title was censored. This film made her unexpectedly the number one actress-singer of that year in Europe and Latin America and she accepted a multi-million dollar offer for more films and recordings in Europe. Fifteen films followed her Cupl\u00e9 success, including 'La violetera' (1958), 'Mi ultimo tango' (1960), 'Noches de Casablanca' (a 1963 tribute to Hollywood's 'Casablanca'), 'Esa mujer' (1969) and 'Variet\u00e9s' (1971). Her films 'El ultimo cuple' and 'La violetera' netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 50s and 60s.\n\nMost of the movies were accompanied by a soundtrack album which also pushed her career as a singer. During these years she recorded over 30 albums and appeared on stage and television all over the world. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies and continued non-stop performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. She continued at that pace well into the 1990s. In 2000 she released her autobiography Memories: 'To live is a pleasure' followed by a second book called 'Sara and sex', which highlighted her love life. In 2005 Montiel was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' by actor Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as the character Zahara. In 2006 Montiel temporarily put aside her career in order to help her adopted son Zeus with his first recordings. Sarita died at the age of 85 on april 8, 2013.\n\nOn the web:\n\n- http://infomontiel.tripod.com/id17.htm\n\n- http://www.visitingsaramontiel.com\n\nIf you like this, you probably like... / european counterparts:\n\n\n\nWhat do we think:\n\nPR: Sarita Montiel is more actress than singer. But with an oeuvre of more than 30 albums since the late fifties, she is definitely one of Spain's most popular musical artists of the 20th century. And - whatever you may think of her - she still succeeds in claiming a spot in the limelights with her writings. Her material is mostly very traditional Hollywood-with-Spanish-lyrics and her singing is not tremendous. On the other hand, she sung a few beautiful songs that became international classics ('La violetra'). Her latest releases (eigthies & nineties) are over-the-top synthesiser disco albums, probably recorded for the gay-disco's and her die-hard fans.\n\nDB: Everyone who has seen Almodov\u00e1r's 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' will remember transvestite Sahara miming a warmblooded song in the microphone. Well, i do, and it was my first encounter with the music of Sarita, the singer Sahara is impersonating. While in Barcelona I tried to find as much of her orginal material i could lay my hands on including an autographed copy of Ulitmo Cuple (no, not the one with the revealing cover). Sarita made some great music but maybe suffers from some over confidence.
