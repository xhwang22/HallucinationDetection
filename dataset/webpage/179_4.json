He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D. Sewall, a member of the firm.

But the free silver views of Mr. Sewall had at that time caused him to be classed by many of his friends in the East as a man who had gone wild on money questions. As a result of Mr. Cleveland's opposition to silver, Mr. Sewall fought against his renomination. He worked unceasingly for Cleveland's defeat at Chicago, standing for David B. Hill to the end but then came into line and helped elect the nominee. He never ceased to be an active member of the party. He was the unanimous choice of his party in Maine for United States Senator in 1892, and the attempt to turn him down at the State Convention by a resolution denouncing his free silver views failed.\n\nMr. Sewell was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention at Baltimore in 1872; at Cincinnati in 1880 and 1884; at St. Louis in 1888; and at Chicago in 1892 and 1896. At Chicago in July, 1896, he was one of the few advocates from New England of the free and unlimited coinage of silver. He was selected by the convention as their candidate for the office of Vice-president of the United States, and in an interview at the time voiced his sentiments on the platform as follows:\n\n\"There are thousands of business men in the East who are turning away from the single gold standard. It is not a class issue. In my opinion there is not a legitimate business in this country but that would be benefited by the restoration of silver to its rightful place in our national currency.\n\n\"I have been an advocate of silver ever since Congress\n\ndemonetized that metal in 1873. I held at the time that a mistake had been made, and have had no reason since to change my mind. \"There are two sides to every question, and as an individual banker I have a perfect right to take a position opposite to those who constitute the majority in the banking business. As I said before, this is not a technical question nor a class issue.\" Upon his return to his home in Bath he received an ovation from his fellow citizens long to be remembered by the staid people of that maritime town. The mayor warmly welcomed the nominee, and Mr. Sewall in the course of his reply to the warm welcome, said: \"It was a great convention, yet it did not seem to me to be a partisan one. It seemed more like the uprising of the people, and they seemed to be controlled by one idea, and that idea has filled me for years. They knew that this country is in deep distress, that it has been in distress for years, and that the great trouble is with our monetary system; and they believe as I believe, that there is only one remedy. They entertain no dishonest or dishonorable idea, but they demand that we be carried back to the money of our fathers, to that monetary system under which this government flourished for so many years, and they believe that is the only road to prosperity.\" \"The keynote of the Chicago platform is found in the Declaration of Independence. It simply implies that wherever the Government comes in contact with the citizen, wherever the citizen touches the Government, that all stand upon a common level, and there shall be equal rights to all and special privileges to no one. \"\u2014William J.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/arthur.sewall/3762372", "page_content": "Arthur Sewall\n\npolitician shipbuilder statesman\n\nJanuary 25, 1835 (age 65) Bath, Maine, United States\n\nHe began his active shipbuilding career in 1854 as the American merchant marine reached its zenith. With his elder brother, Edward, he formed the firm of E. & A. Sewall and commenced work in the family yard on the Kennebec. The Holyhead, of some 1100 tons, launched in 1855, was the first of his eighty vessels. Upon Edward's death he took a son and a nephew as partners, and the firm in 1879 became A. Sewall & Company. Though English vessels, utilizing iron, steel, and steam, were driving the wooden American sailing vessels out of competition, the Sewalls specialized in the latter type, doing much to keep it alive in the period of decline. They generally retained ownership of the ships they built and at one time owned a fleet of more than twenty-five. Their shipwrights and captains were usually natives of the Kennebec valley. During the Civil War he refused to have his ships take advantage of British registry, and his Vigilant was captured on her maiden voyage by the Confederate raider, Sumter. In the decade following the war, the Sewalls turned out a number of celebrated ships, including the Undaunted, Eric the Red, El Capitan, Occidental, Oriental, Continental, Harvester, Reaper, Thrasher, and Granger. Then came a depression without even the usual \"ship a year, \" but in the early nineties they built their \"Big Four, \" the Rappahannock, Shenandoah, Susquehanna, and Roanoke, averaging more than 3000 tons. The next step was iron. Sewall was interested in Gen. Thomas W. Hyde's Bath Iron Works, organized in 1889, which built the Machias, Castine, and Katahdin for the new navy. After visiting England to study the latest methods he began to build steel sailing vessels, and in 1894 the steel Dirigo was launched. His last ship, launched a month after his death, was the William P. Frye, sunk January 28, 1915, the first American vessel sunk by the Germans in the World War. He was at various times president of the Eastern Railroad and of the Central Railroad, and a director of the Boston and Maine Railroad. From 1871 until his death he was president of the Bath National Bank. He was the most prominent of the Maine Democrats, those constant supporters of forlorn hopes in that Republican stronghold, but the only elective offices he ever received were as councilman and alderman in Bath. He was a delegate to the national conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888; in the next two campaigns he served on the executive committee of the Democratic national committee, and in 1896 he was nominated for vice-president on the fifth ballot and took an active part in the campaign. In 1900 he was stricken with apoplexy at his summer home at Small Point, just below Bath, where he died."}, {"url": "https://bathhistorical.com/", "page_content": "Welcome to the Bath Historical Society\n\nBHS is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting interest in the history and heritage of Bath, Maine: The City of Ships.

The saga of her long final voyage from North America via Australia to Taiwan (Formosa) is related. In particular, the final days of the ship Benjamin Sewall and the fate of her crew are detailed. What is for certain is that she was not wrecked at the Pescadores (Peng-hu), but met her fate some 200 miles to the southeast near the island of Botel Tobago. The foundering of the Benjamin Sewall was to bring upon the islanders precisely the attention they had sought to avoid. Painting of the Ship Benjamin Sewall (Bowdoin College, Brunswick)\n\nShip Benjamin Sewall The ship Benjamin Sewall was built at the shipyard of Pennell Brothers near Brunswick, Maine, in 1874. The Pennell Shipyard had been building wooden vessels for nearly 100 years, and the Benjamin Sewall was the largest and last of these famous Pennell vessels.\n\nThe Benjamin Sewall on the ways at Pennell's Shipyard (Courtesy Pejepscot Historical Society, Brunswick) The ship, with her fine sturdy lines, is shown in the photograph on the left on the 'ways' (slipways) at Pennell Shipyard. Her name, here given as B. Sewall - Boston, can just be seen on her stern. The specifications of the 3-masted square rigger were registered as: length - 202 ft; breadth - 39 ft; depth - 24 ft; with a gross tonnage of 1433 tons. This was about the average size for the square riggers of her time. The Benjamin Sewall was launched from the 'ways' on 27 October 1874, in the presence of the 80-year-old Benjamin Sewall, the prosperous Boston businessman after whom she was named, and whose bust can also be seen in the photograph adorning the scroll on her stern. She could carry around 2,000 tons of cargo, and could stow just over a million board feet of sawn lumber and timbers. Though not a fast boat, the Benjamin Sewall had her moments, once making 336 miles in a day's sailing. Her masters regarded her as a stout ship who handled well.\n\nHer first master was John Pennell under whom she five times rounded Cape Horn. On one voyage she sailed to the Chincha Islands off the coast of Peru to load guano (see the Robert Bowne Story on this site).\n\nWhile off Huanillos Island on the evening of 9 May 1877, the Benjamin Sewall experienced first the violent shaking from an undersea earthquake, and then a terrible tidal wave. After a night of aftershocks, combusting rock falls and surging waters, all to the sound of colliding boats and drowning men, the dawn showed the extent of the damage. The shore settlement had been almost entirely swept away with hundreds drowned, and, of the 23 vessels anchored in the roadstead, 5 were lost and 15 badly damaged: amongst these was the Benjamin Sewall. Yet, after extensive repairs at the nearby port of Callao, the Benjamin Sewall loaded her guano cargo from another guano island, Pabelon de Pica, and sailed round the Cape to Europe. Captain Pennell had struck his head during the earthquake and suffered from severe headaches during the onward voyage around Cape Horn to Europe. After discharging his cargo of guano at Brest, France, Pennell was joined by his wife, Abby, and their two sons, who joined the ship. Proceeding first to Cardiff, Wales, to load a cargo of 2,000 tons coal, the Benjamin Sewall sailed for Rio de Janeiro. Throughout the voyage to Rio, Captain Pennell's headaches worsened and he was taken to the hospital upon arrival. There, at Rio de Janeiro, the first Master of the Benjamin Sewall, John Pennell, died on 5 July 1878. John D Pennell (c.1830-1878) (Courtesy Robert Coffin Jr)\n\nFollowing the death of Captain Pennell, the ship resumed her travels on around Cape Horn and up to Callao under the command of her Chief Mate, William Ryan. Ryan was the nephew of Samuel Sewall, the managing owner of the Benjamin Sewall. The command of the Benjamin Sewall thereafter alternated between Ryan and his uncle Samuel Sewall, who had also sailed on her maiden voyage across the Atlantic.\n\nArthur M Sewall (28 January 1867 - 22 September 1939) (Courtesy Phillip Sewall) In 1888, Samuel Sewall appointed his 21-year-old eldest son, Arthur M Sewall (shown in a contemporary photograph on the left), as Master of the ship Benjamin Sewall. It is probable that the Benjamin Sewall had been extensively overhauled prior to this appointment. Arthur Merrill Sewall was born in North Edgecomb, Maine, on 28 January 1867. After crossing the Atlantic on board the Benjamin Sewall at the age of 12 with his father, Arthur Sewall had shown little interest in schooling on the shore. In 1882, aged 15, he had run away to sea and by the age of 21, in 1888, he had his Master's papers. On his first voyage as master, Captain A M Sewall took the ship from Boston to Australia and then on to Valparaiso, Chile. After discharging his 2,000 tons of Australian coal at Valparaiso, and commencing to load 2,000 tons of nitrate for New York, Captain Sewall was struck down with a serious bout of malaria. While in hospital at Santiago he met a captivating young Chilean girl of Castillian descent, Aurora Alliendes of Rancagua. Her family did not wish their daughter to 'marry a gringo', and so the two of them eloped.\n\nArthur Sewall and his young bride Aurora thereupon sailed away on the ship Benjamin Sewall together, around the Cape Horn and up to New York. For the next 12 years, Captain Sewall and his wife Aurora made their home upon the ship Benjamin Sewall. The Captain's quarters lay immediately forward of the Chart Room. The Chart Room, which served as a day-room in fine weather, is the structure that can be seen on deck at the stern of the ship in the 1888 photograph on the right. Aurora furnished the cabins with 'fine oriental rugs and lace curtains', and also had a piano and sewing machine aboard. The Benjamin Sewall lying at Boston in 1888 (Courtesy Frank Claes)\n\nThe Benjamin Sewall aground at Hong Kong, November 1900 (Courtesy Mrs C D Petersen) While master of the ship Benjamin Sewall, Captain A M Sewall was to meet with two great typhoons in the South China Seas. The first was at Hong Kong in November 1900, when she was driven ashore (see photograph at left). The second typhoon was off Shanghai in August 1901. The ship Benjamin Sewall had been swamped and suffered extensive damage. She limped in to Hakkodate, Japan, for repairs. Captain Sewall, still intermittently suffering from bouts of malaria and with a feeling that he was dogged by bad luck, had had enough. After supervising repairs at Hakkodate, Sewall turned the command over to his Chief Officer for the Benjamin Sewall's return leg across the Pacific to Port Townsend, Washington.\n\nCaptain Arthur and Aurora Sewall boarded a steamer for Vancouver, British Columbia. From Vancouver they travelled down to Port Townsend where they then lived for the next 20 years.\n\nThe Last Voyage of the Ship Benjamin Sewall\n\nIn November 1901, the ship Benjamin Sewall set out from Port Townsend on what was to be her final voyage. She was under charter to a new captain chosen by Captain A M Sewall and was bound for Fremantle in Australia, where she was fixed to deliver a cargo of Canadian lumber. The ship had begun her voyage by loading about one million feet of Canadian lumber from the Moodyville Mills in the Burrard Inlet on the North Vancouver shore (see photograph of Moodyville Mills on right). The Benjamin Sewall was then towed back down the Puget Sound to Port Townsend where she took on some six tons supplies and then cleared to sail to Fremantle, Australia. Ships loading at the Moodyville Mills in 1897\n\nJack Hoelstad (b. 19 November 1866) and wife May (Courtesy Maybelle Piper Haynes) The new commander of the Benjamin Sewall was Captain J H Hoelstad. Jack Hoelstad is shown in the picture below with his wife, May, who travelled with her husband on the ship. Little is known about Jack Hoelstad. He was 34 years old at the start of this voyage, and two months older than Arthur Sewall. His wife's family was certainly from Maine, but he himself may well have been Norwegian. The Benjamin Sewall set out on the afternoon of 3 November 1901, but, after rounding Cape Flattery at the mouth of the Puget Sound, she ran into a series of gales and calms and made slow progress. While the gales would tear away the sails of these large sailing ships, the calms were almost as exhausting. The heavy and powerless vessel would founder and roll her sides under in the troughs of the waves, all the time creaking and groaning as if she would fall apart: sleep became almost impossible. On 27 November 1901 the worst of the gales struck. Yet more sails and part of her deck load of lumber were lost, but worse still the hold remained filled with several feet of water. The Benjamin Sewall had sprung a leak. Captain Hoelstad decided to alter course and head for Honolulu to find and repair the leak. It was a wise decision. As the ship Benjamin Sewall neared Honolulu the situation worsened.\n\nThey spent Christmas Day of 1901 becalmed on the leaking ship within sight of Oahu. The ship was equipped with a windmill pump to remove the water: this only worked when there was a wind, in the calm the crew struggled to stop stabilise the situation. She was now leaking 6 inches an hour and had 11 ft 6 inches of water in her holds. On the 27 December they were still becalmed and the leak was gaining on them. However, the next day a fresh breeze sprang up and the ship anchored outside the reef at Honolulu; she was towed into Honolulu Harbour (see picture below) on 30 December 1901. On the ship Benjamin Sewall was Helen Jackson Piper, the 18 years old niece of Captain Hoelstad. Miss Piper (shown right), from Damariscotta in Maine, kept a journal for the voyage. Helen Jackson Piper (Courtesy Maybelle Piper Haynes)\n\nHonolulu Harbour around 1910\n\nIn her journal, Miss Piper, freed from the confines of the ship, describes Honolulu as being 'simply beautiful' with luxuriant foliage everywhere. She also comments on the 'fine buildings that [had] been built during the last two years'. In fact, Hawaii had been formally annexed by the United States just a few years previously, in 1898. The source of the leak on the ship Benjamin Sewall had proved elusive, necessitating first the tow into port and then a stay of two weeks. However, by 15 January 1902, the Benjamin Sewall was ready to resume her journey down to Fremantle, Australia. Captain Hoelstad was to rue the decision to sail to Fremantle, and vowed not to undertake the voyage again. The journey was to take almost four months to complete, including a month becalmed in the Celebes Sea.\n\nSouth Quay, Fremantle in 1899\n\nThe ship Benjamin Sewall finally arrived at Fremantle on 1 May 1902. It can be assumed that she berthed at South Quay (see photograph above) to discharge her cargo of Canadian lumber. Miss Piper's journal ends upon the Benjamin Sewall's arrival at Fremantle. However, seemingly some 40 years later, Helen Piper added some interesting further detail to her time in Fremantle. Firstly she mentions the arrival of a stricken ship that had lost its propeller whilst carrying horses from Australia to South Africa for use in the Boer War. This ship can be identified as the Boveric, which was towed into Fremantle on 15 May 1902, just two weeks before the end of the Boer War. The Boveric had lost her propeller in the southern Indian Ocean. The chief officer and three of the Boveric's crew had volunteered to take one of the boats and sail to Fremantle for assistance. They covered almost 1000 nautical miles in 26 days before arriving beside the Benjamin Sewall's berth at Fremantle: bizarrely, the Boveric was towed in the very next day. The second noteworthy incident at Fremantle that Miss Piper records is a visit to 'a prominent family' in Perth. She relates that the young son of this family, whom she identifies only as 'Joe', expressed great eagerness to go to sea, and that Captain Hoelstad had signed him up as Third Mate. From Helen Piper's journal we know that the ship Benjamin Sewall, with a young Australian Third Mate and bound for Singapore for the China lumber trade, departed Fremantle in ballast around the end of May 1902. Nothing further is known about the movements of the ship Benjamin Sewall until August 1903, over one year later, though Miss Piper had noted that she was bound to Singapore to partake in 'her great trade in timber with Northern China'.\n\nThe End of the Ship Benjamin Sewall\n\nThe ship Benjamin Sewall departed from Singapore on 25 August 1903, carrying a consignment of teakwood for the Chinese port of Shanghai. As this was typhoon season, Captain Hoelstad decided to chart a course to the east of Taiwan. The shallow waters and numerous reefs and shoals of the Taiwan Straits, to the west of the island, were extremely treacherous for a sailing vessel even though few typhoons actually enter the straits.\n\nDetail of Davidson's 1901 map of Formosa showing the southern tip of Taiwan and Botel Tobago\n\nOn 4 October 1903 the ship Benjamin Sewall passed close to the Garambi (Oluanpi) Lighthouse on the southern tip of Taiwan (see map of Taiwan/Formosa above). The lighthouse, communicating with the Benjamin Sewall, displayed a flag message with a typhoon warning. However, the flag code being used was allegedly unknown to Captain Hoelstad. There were soon clear signs of the approaching typhoon: the barometer was falling rapidly, and the wind and sea were increasing. Captain Hoelstad decided to alter course to the south-east to try to avoid the typhoon's path. Given that most typhoons tend to track up the east coast of Taiwan before arching eastwards towards Japan, and that a massive typhoon is recorded as having struck Japan in October 1903, Captain Hoelstad may have made the right decision; however, it was too late. In the early hours of 5 October 1903 the Benjamin Sewall was struck by mountainous seas and hurricane force winds. Her three topmasts, her bowsprit and her rudder were broken off, leaving the ship at the mercy of the elements. The helpless ship rolled heavily with her rails awash, the seas breaking over her and flooding the cabins and the holds.\n\nWhen the typhoon eased, an inspection of the ravaged ship was carried out. The decks were a shambles of fallen spars, twisted rigging and torn canvas - this could be cleared; but the holds with their cargoes of hardwood were two-thirds full of seawater. Hoelstad believed that, as the water seeped into the wood, the ship Benjamin Sewall would sink. Around noon on 5 October 1903, Captain Hoelstad gave the order to abandon ship. There were 23 persons on board and they all managed to get safely aboard the two lifeboats that remained with a few provisions. One boat was under the command of Captain Hoelstad; the second boat was under the Chief Mate, Joseph Morris. (See below for details of those in each boat). Neither of the boats had fresh water aboard due to the loss of a third boat stocked with provisions as it was being lowered into the seas beside the ship Benjamin Sewall. The Captain's boat was provisioned with some canned pineapple, three cans of milk, some salt meat and a few biscuits; the Chief Mate's boat was in a similar condition with some canned fruit and tinned meat, and a few biscuits. But no water. The southern tip of Taiwan (South Cape) was about 60 miles away to the north-west: in a more northerly direction, and some 35 miles off the Formosan coast, lay the island of Botel Tobago (see map above). Botel Tobago Natives (from Davidson)\n\nBotel Tobago had gained repute as the 'home of savages and cannibals'; and Captain Hoelstad cautioned his Chief Mate Joseph Morris not to land upon the island under any circumstances. In fact, a few years earlier, in March 1896, Botel Tobago had been safely visited by James W Davidson, then a foreign correspondent, later the US Consul at Taipei. Davidson, from whose superb book 'The Island of Formosa Past and Present' the photographs above and below are taken, reported on a peaceful and isolated people, who neither drank alcohol nor smoked tobacco. He does, however, record some of their history and their past contacts with the outside world.\n\nA Botel Tobago boat in the surf (from Davidson) In 1722 some Chinese traders had visited Botel Tobago in the hopes of trade: the islanders were unwilling to part with any of their few possessions. Not to be disappointed, the Chinese traders thereupon slaughtered many of the natives and fled back to Taiwan with their meagre belongings. Years later a second group of Chinese traders ventured onto the island. The Botel Tobago natives, mindful of what had befallen their ancestors, took pre-emptive action. Not one of the trading party ever returned to Taiwan. As for Davidson, he encountered no such belligerence. But Davidson arrived on a 3,000 ton Japanese naval vessel and was prudently accompanied by a Japanese army major and a detachment of Japanese infantry.\n\nDuring the remaining daylight hours of 5 October 1903, the two boats, sailing and rowing, kept within sight of each other. However, during the night of 5 October the two boats lost contact and by dawn were out of sight of each other. On 6 October the Captain sighted Botel Tobago but gave the island wide berth, soon they spotted the lighthouse at South Cape. The shore offered no safe landing place and night was coming on. Bravely, the Second Mate, Mr Stenke, volunteered to swim to shore for help. Within an hour, lights appeared on the shore directing the boat to a small cove on the cape. Those in the Captain's boat were now safe, but of the Chief Mate's boat there was no sign. It was feared that, despite the dire warnings, the Chief Mate's boat had landed on Botel Tobago.\n\nCAPTAIN'S BOAT CHIEF MATE'S BOAT Names Position Nationality Names Position Nationality Captain J H Hoelstad Master U.S. Joseph Morris Chief Mate U.S. May Hoelstad Captain's Wife U.S. Thomas Pickle Third Mate U.S. Helen Piper Captain's Niece U.S. 'Olsa' 3rd Mate's Wife Japanese Mr Stenke Second Mate U.S. Wo Bing Carpenter Chinese S Hanoy Steward Japanese Ah Hing Ship's Cook Chinese (unknown) Cabin Boy Chinese Henry Adams Seaman Negro (U.S.) Clovis Vignot Seaman Mauritius Peter Johnson Seaman Chilean Bartholomew Pinas Seaman Filipino William Reinwald Seaman Russian (unknown) Seaman Japanese Julian Salio Seaman Filipino (unknown) Seaman Japanese Juzo Hayashi Seaman Japanese (unknown) Seaman Japanese Shikatare Iwate Seaman Japanese Yoshize Aoki Seaman Japanese (Data from Egan and US Dept of State Records)\n\nOn the following morning of 7 October the Japanese police on Taiwan sent a boat across to Botel Tobago. On the 8th the policemen returned with two survivors from the Chief Mate's boat: a Russian named Reinwald and a Filipino named Salio. They related a harrowing tale that is recorded below:\n\nUpon nearing Botel Tobago Island, the Mate had insisted on landing. When savages appeared on the beach, they had tried to get away, but were surrounded by four canoes and a horde of savages armed with knives and spears. They were stripped of their clothes to the skin, including the Japanese girl, their watches and belongings taken, then the boat was overturned. They were about half a mile from the shore. The savages then left them clinging to the overturned boat. The Third Mate remained with his wife who could not swim. Then one-by-one the others dropped off, the Chief mate, carpenter, cook and two seamen. Three Japanese seamen struck off for shore and they did not know what had become of them. The Russian and the Filipino, both good swimmers, had managed to reach shore, but were seized by the savages. Meanwhile they had brought in the ship's boat and stripped it of all its fittings and equipment. But a worse fate awaited the two seamen; they were taken into the hills as slaves - still without clothes - and forced to do heavy work of chopping and carrying wood. Without any clothing, their bodies became badly blistered in the hot sun. When found by the police they were more dead than alive. But they recovered. It should be pointed out that the Botel Tobago islanders tell a rather different story. They recount that, as they lined the shore to welcome the lifeboat, someone in the boat, perhaps mistaking their fishing spears for weapons, opened fire with a pistol. It was, say the Yami, these shots that provoked the incident. In any case, this initial report that reached the American consul in Taipei was sufficient to merit a robust response. The US Navy Asiatic Fleet Headquarters in Kobe, Japan, was ordered to despatch gunboats to Botel Tobago. The USS Wilmington and the USS Don Juan de Austria set out for the South Cape of Taiwan under full steam on 13 October 1903. The USS Don Juan de Austria had a curious history. She had been part of the Spanish navy and had been sunk on 1 May l898 during the Battle of Manila Bay. She was then raised from the bay, overhauled and refitted at Hong Kong, and commissioned there into the US Navy on 11 April 1900, retaining her original name. This was a clear indication of the intensified American interest in the Far East after the acquisition of its Pacific island territories. USS Wilmington USS Don Juan de Austria The USS Don Juan de Austria arrived at South Cape on the 17th October, anchoring beside the USS Wilmington at Kwaliang Bay, the anchorage just to the west of South Cape. The USS Don Juan was ordered to proceed to Botel Tobago to discover what had happened to the missing ten persons in the Chief Mate's boat. At noon on the 18th she arrived off the southeast end of the island. A Japanese policemen came out in a native boat and informed the commander, Lt-Com G W Denfield, that three Japanese seamen from the Benjamin Sewall had been found on the 14th October. The edited deposition of one of the Japanese seaman, Yoshize Aoki, is recorded below.\n\n\"My name is Y. Aoki. I am a native of Nagasaki, Ken, Kiushu Island, Japan. I shipped at Singapore on board the American Ship Benjamin Sewall bound to Shanghai, with teak. After a three-day's calm we were struck by a typhoon and lost all three masts. The Captain gave the order for all hands to abandon ship. I went in the boat in charge of the Chief Officer. About half an hour before sunset on the 10th we were about [5 miles] from the North shore of [Botel Tobago] when we were attacked by four canoes, each manned by about twelve savages armed with knives. They ran alongside of us and as many as could clambered on board and stripped us to our skins, not even sparing the [Japanese] woman. We all had some money and the Chief Mate, the cook and one of the seamen had watches. They pried off all the brass work, took out the boat plug and capsized the boat. After this they made off. They were with us about an hour. It was now quite dark and we could not see where they went. Afterwards the moon came up. The Negro and the Chinese cook drowned about ten minutes after the boat capsized and about two hours afterwards the Chief Mate let go and drowned. He was an old man and a Norwegian or American. After the Chief Officer drowned, one of the Manilla men and the Russian struck out for the shore, and after them the other Manilla man and the Chinese carpenter. Then we three Japanese started for the shore. The Japanese woman wanted the 3rd mate to go too as she could not swim so far, we were then about [2.5 miles] from the shore, but he said he did not care to leave her. He was an American. We reached the shore and hid among the mountains as we were afraid of the savages. We did not know that there were any Japanese policemen on the Island. We killed a goat and found plenty of fresh water. We suffered from our naked condition and made some straw mats to shield us from the sun. Altogether we slept five nights in the mountains. Then we were found by a party of natives and brought to the police station where we were fed and clothed. We had no arms, only our jack knives.\""}, {"url": "https://unicourt.com/case/nv-clad-monica-sewall-plaintiff-vs-arthur-sewall-jr-defendant-988569", "page_content": "This case was last updated from Clark County Nevada Court on 01/27/2022 at 08:58:48 (UTC).\n\nCase Summary\n\nOn 09/08/2021 Monica Sewall, Plaintiff filed a Family - Marriage Dissolution/Divorce lawsuit against Arthur Sewall, Jr , Defendant.

But the free silver views of Mr. Sewall had at that time caused him to be classed by many of his friends in the East as a man who had gone wild on money questions. As a result of Mr. Cleveland's opposition to silver, Mr. Sewall fought against his renomination. He worked unceasingly for Cleveland's defeat at Chicago, standing for David B. Hill to the end but then came into line and helped elect the nominee. He never ceased to be an active member of the party. He was the unanimous choice of his party in Maine for United States Senator in 1892, and the attempt to turn him down at the State Convention by a resolution denouncing his free silver views failed.\n\nMr. Sewell was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention at Baltimore in 1872; at Cincinnati in 1880 and 1884; at St. Louis in 1888; and at Chicago in 1892 and 1896. At Chicago in July, 1896, he was one of the few advocates from New England of the free and unlimited coinage of silver. He was selected by the convention as their candidate for the office of Vice-president of the United States, and in an interview at the time voiced his sentiments on the platform as follows:\n\n\"There are thousands of business men in the East who are turning away from the single gold standard. It is not a class issue. In my opinion there is not a legitimate business in this country but that would be benefited by the restoration of silver to its rightful place in our national currency.\n\n\"I have been an advocate of silver ever since Congress\n\ndemonetized that metal in 1873. I held at the time that a mistake had been made, and have had no reason since to change my mind. \"There are two sides to every question, and as an individual banker I have a perfect right to take a position opposite to those who constitute the majority in the banking business. As I said before, this is not a technical question nor a class issue.\" Upon his return to his home in Bath he received an ovation from his fellow citizens long to be remembered by the staid people of that maritime town. The mayor warmly welcomed the nominee, and Mr. Sewall in the course of his reply to the warm welcome, said: \"It was a great convention, yet it did not seem to me to be a partisan one. It seemed more like the uprising of the people, and they seemed to be controlled by one idea, and that idea has filled me for years. They knew that this country is in deep distress, that it has been in distress for years, and that the great trouble is with our monetary system; and they believe as I believe, that there is only one remedy. They entertain no dishonest or dishonorable idea, but they demand that we be carried back to the money of our fathers, to that monetary system under which this government flourished for so many years, and they believe that is the only road to prosperity.\" \"The keynote of the Chicago platform is found in the Declaration of Independence. It simply implies that wherever the Government comes in contact with the citizen, wherever the citizen touches the Government, that all stand upon a common level, and there shall be equal rights to all and special privileges to no one. \"\u2014William J.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}, {"url": "https://slphistory.org/sewall/", "page_content": "Sewall is an old and prominent name in the history of St. Louis Park. At one time there were as many as seven Sewall families living on Goodrich Ave. Our thanks to Sewell descendant Eben W. Graves, who is working on the second volume of the Sewall genealogy, the first having been published in late 2007. Horace P. Sewall, his children and his grandchildren, will be in the second volume.\n\nPark grad Rick Sewall has also taken on the challenge of tracing his family history. An indication of the complexity of this task is that in the first Park directory of 1933-34, there are no less than 10 listings for Sewalls.\n\nFor more about the Sewall family, see \u201cSomething in the Water.\u201d\n\nIn the very early 1900s, brothers Albert, Sam, Frank, and Leon, as well as their father, Horace P. Sewall (1827-1917), lived in St. Louis Park. They were sons of Horace\u2019s second wife, Sarah Jackman (1828-1905). The family moved to Minnesota from Northfield, New Hampshire.\n\nALBERT DEFIANCE SEWALL\n\nAlbert (1860-1931) was the first to move to Minnesota, about 1882, and he was probably in St. Louis Park about 1892. Shortly after 1900 he and his family moved to South Dakota, and before very long some of them had gone on to Medicine Hat, Alberta. Albert\u2019s parents, Horace and Sarah, came to Minnesota in the early 1890s and lived with Albert. Horace and Sarah went with Albert\u2019s family to South Dakota, where Sarah died, and Horace went to Alberta.\n\nCHARLES ORRIN \u201cSAM\u201d SEWALL\n\nSam (born December 1861 in New Hampshire) came to Minnesota in the late 1880s. He was originally named Charles Orrin [with a different spelling] Sewall, but in the early 1900s he starts to appear in the records as Sam. Sam seems to have moved back and forth between St. Louis Park and Minnetonka, where his children Roy and Edna were born, and maybe others. By 1905 Sam was here to stay. He earned his living as a teamster and in 1910 he was listed as a carpenter. He lived in a house at 3690 (aka 3696) Wooddale (built in 1908), which was demolished in 2011 to make room for an expanded fire station.\n\nHome of Sam Sewall, 3690 Wooddale.

Sewall, the son of Sam, was born in March 1884. In 1910 he worked at Monitor Drill. In 1930 he was a steamfitter at the Creosote Plant. The 1930 census noted that the family lived on Goodrich Ave., but did not give an address. He married Ellen L. Johnson, from another early St. Louis Park family. Their children were Clinton H., Fern L., Kathryn A., Loren J., and Willis C. Loren was a long time employee and executive with the Park\u2019s Minnesota Rubber Co.\n\n**Roy Oren Sewall, the son of Sam Sewall, was born in January 1895, and came to St. Louis Park in 1904. In the 1910 Census he was listed as a laborer, but he graduated from Park High in 1913 with a class of 13. In school he was very active in sports. In 1933 he lived at 4800 Vallacher (built in 1927). In the chaos of the 1930s, when beer halls opened all along Excelsior Blvd. with the repeal of Prohibition, Roy waged a strong campaign against the profligate drinking. On that platform he was elected Mayor and served in the 1935 calendar year. He was not re-elected. In 1951 Roy worked at the GM Stewart Lumber Company and served as the secretary of the Lumberman\u2019s Association. Roy\u2019s children were Russell L. Sewall, Grant L Sewall, and Dala Rae. Roy died on February 17, 1973 at Park Nursing Home\n\nFRANK L. SEWALL\n\nFrank was born on April 6, 1866 in Northfield, New Hampshire. He was in Minnesota by 1885 and married Katherine Vleek in 1891 \u2013 family lore is that they met working on Sam\u2019s farm.

He lived for a while in Minnetonka [the records for all Sam and Leon seem to vary between Minnetonka Hills and Minnetonka Beach] before moving, by 1900, to St. Louis Park. Leon was a dairy farmer and built a home in Brookside near Xenwood Ave. In 1900, like many families, the Sewalls had 3 (Norwegian) boarders living with them, all who worked at Monitor Drill. When Leon died in 1913, his wife Gertrude was left with a large family including several small children. A native of Norway, Gertrude was a practical nurse who worked with Dr. James Blake of Hopkins. Among many work experiences, she cared for patients during the 1918 flu epidemic. She was, however, forced to turn to others to help care for her own children. Friend Nellie Carlstrom helped with small daughters Dorothy and Gretchen, although the two young girls also spent some time in an orphanage. Gertrude married for a second time in 1921 and moved to Oklahoma. She returned to St. Louis Park later and lived for many years with her son (in-law?) Jack on Brunswick Ave. in \u201cCenter.\u201d\n\nLeon Sewall and Gertrude\u2019s children were all born in Minnesota:\n\nOrmond Leon: born November 3, 1894\n\nRalph was born in 1898 and worked for Hennepin County. Son Bob was born in a white two-story house behind the Congregational Church, which was torn down for a parking lot. Ralph\u2019s wife died when Bob was two years old, and Bob was taken in by the Peterson family, who lived by a grocery store, ice house, and jail located east of Wooddale at Highway 7. When the Highway was built in 1934 the property was torn down. Bob and the Petersons then moved to a house at Goodrich and Alabama. Mary Peterson made the meals for prisoners in the jail; Bob\u2019s uncle Earl was a policeman. Bob was Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds for the Park school system for 25 years, retiring in 1974. Under his watch eight schools were built.\n\nGordon: Born in 1901, worked for City, grading streets. Married Mae Forbisher; sons Donald (1922), Harvey \u201cRed\u201d (1926) (cook at Jennings), Duane \u201cDuke\u201d (1930) (Insurance). Gordon died in a car accident in February 1948 at age 47. He had been in the Seebees in both the World Wars. Gordon and Mae divorced and she married George White. She died in 1975. In about 1940-41, Gordon was burned badly in a fire and received some of the first skin grafts.\n\nEarl: born in 1904. He and his brothers all began to work at an early age to help support the family. He married Irene in 1923, and the couple raised seven children. In the 1930 census, the family is listed at 3300 Dakota, which would be where the High School is now. In the 1933-35 directories they are listed at 5913 Goodrich.

He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D. Sewall, a member of the firm.

His parents were sent to Siberia during WW2 by Stalin\u2019s brutal regime. The family came to the new world without speaking a word of English and had $400 to their name and 4 suitcases. From an early age, Arthur was instilled with the ideals of hard work and the American dream. After receiving his BSEE from UWM he went to work as an engineer at Square D Milwaukee. Due to him being fluent in both Russian and German, Square D transferred him to their European HQ in Germany. While in Germany Arthur was quickly promoted to manager of Continental Europe, the Middle East and Africa for their automation product lines. Through his curiosity, he noticed the rise of a new technology for electrical CAD, primarily in Germany. Upon his transfer back to Milwaukee and spending a total of 10 years with Square D, he founded ECT International Inc. in 1990. ECT was a software company specializing in electrical CAD software solutions for the electrical controls and power industry. ECT grew rapidly and eventually had offices in Europe, China, Australia and India with headquarters in Brookfield WI. After the software business was sold to Bentley Systems (BSY on NASDAQ), one of the largest software CAD companies in the world, Arthur branched off into real estate development by pure accident, because he needed a hobby.\n\nSawall Development paralleled ECT, as it grew very rapidly and developed properties throughout Southeastern Wisconsin, consisting of multi-families, single-family residential lots, condominium projects, and commercial space."}, {"url": "https://www.mainememory.net/artifact/99338", "page_content": "Contributed by Maine Historical Society\n\nDescription\n\nArthur Sewall, the youngest of Kiah B. and Lucretia Day Sewall's 10 children, was born in Mobile, Alabama in November 1860.
