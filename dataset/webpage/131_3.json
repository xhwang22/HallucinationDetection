The attack was the latest in a wave of violence by Arab assailants since late March. Credit Credit... Ammar Awad/Reuters\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Two assailants, at least one of them armed with an ax, attacked passers-by in an Israeli town on Thursday night, killing at least three, according to initial reports from eyewitnesses, the police and emergency services.\n\nThe Israeli authorities described the assault, in which several other people were wounded, as a terrorist attack.\n\nThe attack followed a wave of violence by Arab assailants that had already killed 14 people in cities across Israel since late March, and came days after a Palestinian militant leader urged Arabs to \u201cget your cleavers, axes or knives ready.\u201d\n\nThursday's attack also came after clashes between Palestinian stone throwers and Israeli police at the Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem over the last few weeks. And it raised the specter that Israel had entered a new period of prolonged violence.\n\nDespite worries of another clash at the mosque on Thursday, Israel\u2019s Independence Day, it was relatively calm there although the Israeli police arrested one Palestinian protester. Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas issued strident statements decrying the police action.\n\nOn Saturday, Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, had warned that any further raids by the Israeli police inside the mosque compound would prompt a response. In a fiery speech, he urged members of Israel\u2019s Arab minority to \u201cget your cleavers, axes or knives ready.\u201d\n\nThe attack on Thursday took place in Elad, a predominantly ultra-Orthodox town in central Israel, just after nightfall.\n\nEmergency responders said they found the first fatality by a traffic circle in Elad and two more in a nearby park.\n\n\u201cWhen we arrived we realized that this was a complex scene,\u201d said Alon Rizkan, a paramedic with the Magen David Adom ambulance service. He described the three people who were pronounced dead at the scene as men, all aged around 40.\n\nSeveral more wounded men were transferred to hospitals, and hospital officials said at least two were in critical condition with head injuries.\n\nHours later, the police said they were still investigating the circumstances of the attack, including how many suspects were involved. Details remained sketchy: Some witnesses reported seeing two assailants, both carrying axes. Others said one was armed with an ax and another with a knife.\n\nThe assailants appeared to have escaped. The police said they had set up checkpoints along several roads, and officers in a police helicopter were searching for a vehicle seen fleeing the scene. The minister of defense, Benny Gantz, said soldiers would assist in the hunt.\n\nNo one claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday, but it was praised by a Hamas spokesman as \u201ca brave and heroic act\u201d and \u201ca natural response to the violations of the occupation against the blessed Al Aqsa Mosque.\u201d\n\nThe Aqsa Mosque compound is the holiest site in Jerusalem for both Muslims and Jews, who revere it as the Temple Mount, the site of two ancient Jewish temples.\n\nUrged on by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, protesters at the compound have tried to prevent visits by Israeli Jews during the hours set for non-Muslim visitors and tourists, and have thrown stones and fired fireworks at the security forces. The police have acted mainly to secure the visitors\u2019 access, but the police actions, including using sponge-covered bullets, sound grenades and tear gas to disperse rioters, have fueled popular anger among Palestinians.\n\nPalestinians view visits by ultranationalist Israelis to the compound, which have increased in recent years, as a provocation, and fear such visits are part of a gradual effort to undermine Muslim access to the site. The Israeli authorities say there has been no change in longstanding arrangements at the site.\n\nHiba Yazbek contributed reporting from Nazareth, Israel, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/middleeast/israel-palestinian-violence.html", "page_content": "TEL AVIV \u2014 The current surge in terrorist attacks in Israel has been framed by Palestinian parties and militant groups as a logical consequence of the entrenchment of Israel\u2019s 55-year occupation of the West Bank, of Israel\u2019s control over sensitive religious sites in Jerusalem, and of the dwindling commitment from some key Arab leaders to the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe attackers\u2019 diverse backgrounds, however, have left both Palestinian and Israeli analysts and officials uncertain about the relationship between the attacks, the motivations of the attackers and the timing of their attacks.\n\nIn the deadliest wave of violence since 2016, there have been four attacks in four Israeli cities since March 22, involving five Arab assailants who have killed 14 people, including two Arab police officers and two Ukrainians. But beyond their lethal outcomes, the four episodes do not fit easily within a simple narrative.\n\nThe two most recent attacks \u2014 in Tel Aviv and Bnei Brak \u2014 were carried out by Palestinians from the occupied West Bank.

(AP Photo/Heidi Levine)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 As rockets from Gaza streaked overhead, Arabs and Jews fought each other on the streets below and rioters torched vehicles, a restaurant and a synagogue in one of the worst spasms of communal violence Israel has seen in years.\n\nThe mayor of the mixed town of Lod, which saw the worst of the violence Tuesday, compared it to a civil war or a Palestinian uprising. Arab experts and activists say the violence was fueled by unrest in Jerusalem that has brought Israel to the brink of another Gaza war , but is rooted in deeper grievances that go back to the founding of the state.\n\nViolence flared again Wednesday night with a wave of apparent revenge attacks. In Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, a large crowd of ultranationalist Israelis pulled a man from a car who they thought was Arab and beat him until he lay on the ground motionless and bloodied. A hospital said he\u2019s in serious condition without identifying him.\n\nEarlier, a group of black-clad Israelis smashed the windows of an Arab-owned ice cream shop in Bat Yam and ultranationalists could be seen chanting, \u201cDeath to Arabs!\u201d on live television during a standoff with Border Police. In the northern city of Tiberias, video uploaded to social media appeared to show flag-waving Israelis attacking a car.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Channel 13 quoted a senior police officer as saying Arabs are suspected of attacking and seriously wounding a Jewish man in the coastal city of Acre amid new clashes there.\n\nIn a late night television interview, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, whose figurehead office is meant to serve as the nation\u2019s moral compass, said the country was gripped by civil war and urged citizens to \u201cstop this madness.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on both Jews and Arabs to cease attacks on each other: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me that your blood is boiling. You can\u2019t take the law in your hands,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice said they arrested nearly 400 people allegedly \u201cinvolved in riots and disturbances\u201d across the country Wednesday.\n\nThe violence comes at a time when Israel\u2019s Arab minority appeared to be gaining new acceptance and influence . Mansour Abbas, the head of an Arab party with Islamist roots, emerged as a kingmaker of sorts after March elections and was poised to play a key role in a coalition that would oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing allies.\n\nBut in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Abbas indicated that coalition talks would be put on hold because of the escalating violence. \u201cIf there is a cease-fire, we will return to the political track to form a government,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent days, Arab citizens of Israel have held mass protests across the country over Israel\u2019s policing of a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem and plans to evict dozens of Palestinian families in the city following a legal campaign by Jewish settlers.\n\nAdding to the tensions are increasingly powerful far-right groups in Israel that won seats in March elections and are allied with Netanyahu. In recent days, far-right politicians have visited the tense east Jerusalem neighborhood where the families are threatened with eviction and staged marches elsewhere in the bitterly contested city.\n\nAfter police broke up a protest Monday night in Lod, a young Arab resident was shot and killed. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the man was with a group of rioters threatening Jewish homes, and that Jewish residents opened fire in a \u201clife-threatening situation.\u201d He said three people have been detained for questioning and police are investigating. Arab residents of Lod disputed the account, pointing out that the slain man was unarmed.\n\nHis funeral the next day drew thousands of people and a heavy police presence. Clashes broke out between the two sides, leading to riots in which several vehicles and a synagogue were set ablaze. A 56-year-old Jewish man was severely wounded after Arabs pelted his car with rocks, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service.\n\nThe violence soon spread to other mixed communities across Israel. In neighboring Ramle, ultra-nationalist Jewish demonstrators vandalized Arab cars. In Acre, protesters torched Uri Buri, a famous Jewish-owned seafood restaurant. Magen David Adom said 46 people were wounded in the riots.\n\nRosenfeld said there were several different instances of Arabs attacking Jews, and that 12 police officers were wounded. He said 270 suspects were arrested at 40 locations across the country where vehicles were set on fire and public property was damaged.\n\n\u201cThe Arabs don\u2019t want us here, but we\u2019re going to stay,\u201d said Avraham Sagron, a Jewish resident of Lod, as he surveyed the charred entrance of the synagogue, the interior of which appeared largely untouched.\n\nNetanyahu visited Lod and Acre, where he pledged to \u201cstop the anarchy\u201d and restore order \u201cwith an iron fist if needed.\u201d He called on Arab and other community leaders to condemn the violence and act to stop it.\n\nAuthorities deployed hundreds of police reinforcements to Lod and other areas, including paramilitary border police who usually operate in the occupied West Bank. They also ordered a nighttime curfew in Lod.\n\nArabs say the violence of the past two days was not directed at Jews, but at religious nationalists with close ties to the settlement movement who have moved into mixed areas in recent years , pushing Arab residents out.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Arab minority makes up about 20% of the population and are the descendants of Palestinians who stayed in the country after the 1948 war surrounding Israel\u2019s creation, when an estimated 700,000 fled or were driven from their homes in towns like Lod. They have citizenship, including the right to vote, but face widespread discrimination.\n\nArab citizens speak Hebrew and are well-represented in Israel\u2019s medical profession and universities, but they largely identify with the Palestinian cause, leading many Israelis to view them with suspicion. Lod\u2019s Arabs, who make up about a third of the city\u2019s population, are among the poorest communities in Israel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about young people who have no horizon, no dreams, who are unemployed and live in a very difficult reality,\u201d said Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, the director of the Arab-Jewish relations program at the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent think tank.\n\nShe said the anger of the last two days was not directed at Lod\u2019s longtime Jewish community but at more ideological recent arrivals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because of who they are. It\u2019s because they are trying to Judaize Lod. They are trying to drive out the indigenous Arab residents,\u201d she said. \u201cThe young people see it as a threat to their presence in the land, to their existence.\u201d\n\nThabet Abu Rass, the co-director of the Abraham Initiatives, which promotes Jewish-Arab coexistence, said the six Arab members of Lod\u2019s municipal council have been sidelined and the city\u2019s budget heavily favors Jews. He accused Mayor Yair Revivo of inciting against Arabs.\n\nRevivo, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party, has courted controversy by complaining about the volume of the Muslim call to prayer in Lod and for remarks that appeared to cast its Arab residents as a national security threat .\n\n\u201cHe should be a mayor for everybody,\u201d said Abu Rass, who lives near Lod and has an office there. \u201cHe\u2019s not giving equal services for all residents.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s spokesman said he was not available for comment. Earlier, Revivo had urged Arab residents to end the violence, saying: \u201cThe day after, we will still have to live here together.\u201d\n\nIsraeli officials often hold up the Arab minority as proof of their commitment to tolerance, frequently pointing out that Arab citizens enjoy civic rights and freedoms that many Arab states deny their own people.\n\nGhassan Munayyer, a Lod-based activist, says the veneer of coexistence conceals deeper disparities, including in housing and infrastructure, comparing its Arab neighborhoods to \u201crefugee camps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Jews love saying there\u2019s coexistence. They go out to eat in an Arab restaurant and they call it coexistence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t see Arabs as equal human beings who have rights that they have to respect.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Moshe Edri in Lod, Israel, and Areej Hazboun and Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem contributed."}, {"url": "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-704105", "page_content": "Soon after the first terror attack last month in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba that launched the current wave of violence, Sheikh Muhammad Abu al-Qiyan, maternal uncle of the terrorist \u2013 also named Muhammad Abu al-Qiyan and a resident of the Bedouin village of Hura, made an appearance on Israel\u2019s Channel 12.\n\nFor more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org\n\n\u201cThe whole tribe condemns this attack. We do not support it at all. We also despise ISIS. This deed and this guy, even though he was my nephew, do not represent us,\u201d said Abu al-Qiyan. He repeated this message several times, speaking to the Hebrew media to explain how it could be that his relative \u2013 a father of five \u2013 was suspected of loyalty to ISIS, was arrested, served four years in an Israeli jail, and then one day woke up and slaughtered four Israeli citizens, two men and two women. But as tension mounted, many in Israel expressed doubts about the sincerity of his condemnations.\n\nIt was not only the heads of the Abu al-Qiyan tribe that denounced the Beersheba terror attack, as well as the next terrorist attack that took place in the northern Israeli city of Hadera and was carried out by residents of the Israeli Arab city of Umm al-Fahm.\n\nAt a conference earlier this month of the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, Mansour Abbas, the leader of the United Arab List-Ra\u2019am party, the first Arab party to become a member of a ruling government coalition in Israel in the last three decades, said, \"The whole of Arab society has come out against the latest wave of terrorist attacks \u2013 even people who are in opposition to me. It does not detract from the severity that Israeli Arab citizens carried out the attacks that opened this wave. It is inconceivable for someone to come and decide that he is taking the lives of innocent people \u2013 this must be a basic value rule that has nothing to do with anything else. Secondly, there is a citizenship contract between us of living together \u2013 such acts violatethe contract.\u201d\n\nAbbas\u2019 words also correlate with a recent survey conducted by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\u2019s aChord Center, which specializes in the social psychology of intergroup relations. According to this survey, 98% of Arab citizens of Israel oppose acts of violence against Jews. Some 93% of Arab citizens think that the perpetrators do not representArab society.\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas speaks during a meeting with journalists in the West Bank cityof Ramallah on July 03, 2019. (credit: FLASH90)\n\nThe researchers also examined the gap between attitudes in Arab society and in Jewish public opinion. It showed that only 56% of Jews in Israel believe that the majority of Arabs oppose violence against Jews. At the same time, 44% of Jews said they believe that the perpetrators are representative of Arab society in Israel as a whole.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of hypocrisy there. The Jews, or at least some of them, always demand that we condemn these acts. And we do it \u2013 I do it \u2013 without being forced by anyone, simply because we believe that it is right. But the Arab public is not a condemnation machine. Also, I almost never see Jewish politicians rushing to condemn after Arabs are being beaten or killed by Jews,\u201d Afif Abu Much, a political analyst and a columnist for Arab media outlets, told the Media Line.\n\nBut despite the explicit condemnations of the terror wave by the leaders of Israeli Arabs, and by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the heads of several Arab states, the situation in Israel remains tense. Thirteen men and women, Jews and Arabs among them, as well as foreign nationals, have been killed in four terror attacks during the last two weeks.\n\nTwo out of four attacks were carried out by Israeli Arabs. Following the attacks, social media was filled with expressions of joy over the killing of Israeli citizens, including by residents of Umm al-Fahm and other Arab cities in Israel.\n\n\u201cThere is great anxiety about the fact that, in the current wave, Israeli citizens have a very dominant presence and in fact this time they were the ones who provided inspiration for other attacks. That\u2019s why Mansour Abbas and others were fast to condemn. Also, there is a lot of concern among the Arab leadership in Israel and among everyone who is considered an enemy by ISIS \u2013 women, Christians, LGBTQ, and even the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum for Middle Eastern and African Studies at the Moshe Dayan Center at Tel Aviv University, and a senior analyst at the Institute for Policy and Strategy, told The Media Line.\n\n\u201cI and many others continue to argue that ISIS is a marginal phenomenon in Arab society.\u201d Milshtein believes that very few individuals or activists are genuinely affiliated with ISIS.\n\n\u201cThe attitude of the majority of the public is complete denial and even nausea of thesetypes, but the effect of their deeds is very harmful,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to Israeli security services, adherence to ISIS among the Arab sector in Israel has never been significant. However, during the Israeli military operation against Hamas in May, one of the most popular figures among the Arab youth in Israel was none other than Hamas leader Muhammad Deif, as well as Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, Samir Saadi, deputy mayor of the northern Israeli city of Nazareth, wrote a Facebook post in which he expressed condolences over the death of the Islamic Jihad operative who was killed by Israeli troops during clashes in Jenin on Saturday. \"Our condolences to the cousins in the Jenin camp. I ask Allah to receive him with the martyrs, the righteous and good friends,\" read the post.\n\nThe post provoked many angry emotions in Israel, where the people have not yet recovered from the long manhunt after the terrorist who killed three Israeli citizens and wounded several others on the streets of Tel Aviv on Thursday night. In addition, the mass funeral of two terrorists in Umm al-Fahm made many Israelis wonder whether their heinous act of hate was a reason for pride and happiness in some Arab citizens of Israel.\n\nThen, Ayman Odeh, the head of the opposition Joint List of predominantly Arab parties made a statement near the Old City of Jerusalem\u2019s Damascus Gate that added more fuel to the fire.\n\n\"It is humiliating for one of our sons to join the security forces of the occupation. The forces here are humiliating our people, humiliating our families, and humiliating everyone who comes to pray. Our position is that we will be with our people to end the murderous occupation so that Palestine will rise, Palestinian flags will be hoisted on thewalls of Jerusalem and peace will spread on the land of peace. The young people must not join the occupying forces. Throw your weapon in their face and tell them that our place is not with you. We will not be part of the injustice and the crime,\" Odeh said in avideo statement posted to social media.\n\nWhile the Knesset House Committee said it will convene \"as soon as possible\" to discuss Likud lawmaker Shlomo Karhi\u2019s request to dismiss Odeh from the Knesset, some Arab leaders were openly blaming him for hypocrisy.\n\nIn an interview with Israel\u2019s Reshet Bet public radio station, Faez Abu Sahiban, the mayor of Rahat, a Bedouin city in southern Israel, said, \"Odeh is living in a completelydifferent country; he must wake up. He must support this government and help the bloody Arab population.\u201d During the interview, Abu Sahiban also suggested that Odeh come to Rahat and collect the illegal weapons there \u201cby himself.\u201d\n\nExperts believe that this spring does not have to be a repeat of the dramatic events of last year. \u201cA lot of what happened last year was triggered by the events in Al-Aqsa Mosque. That is what boils the blood of the Arabs \u2013 in the West Bank, Gaza, Israel, and beyond. As long as nothing happens in Al-Aqsa, it will not develop into a wave of violent events like the ones that shook our lives a year ago,\u201d according to Abu Much.\n\nMohammad Darawshe, director of planning, equality, and shared society at the Givat Haviva center and a head of the joint Arab-Jewish Ma\u2019an party, shares this view. He says the deterioration to violence is still preventable.\n\n\u201cIf the leadership will choose to prevent the violence, it will be able to do it,\u201d Darawshetold The Media Line. \u201cThere are those who want to make a political career out of ridingthe wave of violence, to make a political profit. There is of course Knesset member Itamar Ben-Gvir, he is the most radical one, but also the leader of the opposition,Binyamin Netanyahu, is adding fuel to this fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish that these acts of violence would not happen, but they did. The government today is doing the right thing, trying to prevent a spillover to other places, allowing the Palestinians to come to Al-Aqsa Mosque to pray. It may help to calm the situation down,\u201d Darawshe said."}, {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-israelis-go-on-strike-to-protest-deadly-crime-wave/", "page_content": "Arab Israelis observed a general strike and held protests on Thursday over a wave of deadly violence within the minority community.\n\nSchools and businesses in Arab towns and villages were closed following a call by local and national Arab leaders, and newly elected Arab lawmakers of the Knesset skipped the official swearing-in out of solidarity.\n\nSome 20,000 people joined a rally in the northern town of Majd al-Krum Thursday evening at the height of the protests.\n\nPolice say there have been more than 70 killings in Arab communities this year, nearly as many as in each of the past two years, when Arabs, who are 20 percent of the general population, made up more than half of all murder victims nationwide.

These Saturday rallies have continued despite the fact that the bill has been on ice since the end of March.\n\nBut not far away, in cities and villages north and south of Tel Aviv, the Israeli citizens with the most to lose if the judicial overhaul passes have largely stayed home. For most Arab or Palestinian citizens of Israel, staying home has also become something of a family ritual. This is not only because the protests \u2014 with their sea of flags and Zionist slogans \u2014 have not felt welcoming.\n\nThere is a simple and grim reason for Arab citizens to stay home, and not just on Saturday nights: The streets of their communities are the most dangerous in the country, and they have become much deadlier since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition assumed office at the end of last year.\n\nAs of this writing, according to statistics collected by The Abraham Initiatives, 81 Arab citizens have been murdered since the start of 2023, which is more than double the number from the same time last year. Of these murder victims, 72 were shot with guns that were likely all illegally obtained. In only a minority of cases \u2014 an estimated 15% \u2014 has a suspect been identified, which tracks with the Israel police\u2019s poor record in solving murders in the Arab community.\n\nAmerican Jews standing (or marching) in solidarity with Israeli protesters should also see a threat to democracy in the extreme inequalities between Israel\u2019s Jewish and Palestinian citizens, of which disproportionate murder rates are only one example.\n\nViolent crime in Arab communities has been a rising concern over the last decade, with residents reporting a significant worsening of their quality of life. The causes of this violence are complex. The two that stand out are the profusion of organized crime groups in recent years and a dearth of economic opportunities for Arab youth. A recent report by the Israel State Comptroller found that nearly one-third of Arab citizens between the ages of 18 and 24 are neither employed nor in the process of receiving an education. That young people are disproportionately represented among the victims and perpetrators of crime is hardly surprising.\n\nTo his credit, Netanyahu, under a previous coalition, initially took the problem seriously. In 2016, his government allocated over 2 billion shekels toward public safety in Arab communities. This was on top of a five-year plan approved in 2015 for economic development in Arab localities, which lag significantly behind their Jewish counterparts in almost every positive metric. In 2019, at the urging of civil society organizations (including my employer, The Abraham Initiatives), Netanyahu established an inter-ministerial task force to address violence faced by Arab citizens at the cabinet level.\n\nThe \u201cgovernment of change,\u201d the ruling coalition led by Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, included for the first time in Israel\u2019s history a party representing Palestinian citizens of Israel. During the coalition\u2019s tenure from June 2021 to December 2022, cooperation between Arab communities and the state reached their zenith. Deputy Minister of Public Security Yoav Segalovich, the former head of intelligence for the Israel Police, was personally responsible for the portfolio and was a frequent presence in Arab municipalities. The government made further investments in economic development and community policing.\n\nIn 2022, for the first time in seven years, murders declined in Arab communities, albeit modestly, from 126 victims to 116.\n\nUnfortunately, any momentum from this downward trend has now been squandered. Netanyahu\u2019s new government is completely uninterested in the plight of Arab citizens. The Minister for National Security is Itamar Ben-Gvir, leader of the neo-Kahanist Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party. Ben-Gvir\u2019s record of extremism and anti-Palestinian incitement are well known; his time heading an expanded ministry responsible for the police has now revealed that he is also way in over his head, struggling to manage responsibilities that his professional experience as a demagogue simply did not prepare him for.\n\nHowever, an incompetent Ben-Gvir is not a harmless one. Incentives are set from the top, and the message down the ranks has been crystal clear: under this government, and this minister, Arab lives do not matter.\n\nIn March, Ben-Gvir decided to cancel a successful project run by the Israel office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee aimed at reducing violence in Arab communities. The official reason given for the cancellation, that the JDC failed to file a semiannual report, does not pass the laugh test of anyone who has worked on either side of these public-private partnerships. That Ben-Gvir reportedly called this flagship nonpartisan American Jewish organization \u201cleftist\u201d points to the true, ideological reason behind the cancellation.\n\nThe most disgraceful incident of all came last month, when Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai was quoted on tape, in a conversation with Ben-Gvir, saying, \u201cMr. Minister, there is nothing that can be done. They kill each other. That is their nature. That is the mentality of the Arabs.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being a horrifically racist statement, the disclosure of which should have prompted Shabtai\u2019s immediate resignation, it is also a pathetic excuse for the state failing to do its job. Bigoted tropes cannot explain why the annual murder rate in Arab communities has more than doubled since 2013, when Palestinian citizens of Israel were of presumably the same \u201cnature.\u201d\n\nThe rise in violent crime plaguing in Arab communities will not be easy to reverse, but there are measures the government can take to demonstrate seriousness \u2014 provided it wants to. One would be to stop taking vindictive steps against civil society organizations, such as the JDC, offering to help the government. Another would be to restore cooperation with Arab municipalities, such as Umm al-Fahm, that are struggling with this issue. An Israeli police official told Haaretz in April that there was virtually no contact between local Arab political leaders and the National Security Ministry.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Palestinians citizens are entitled to basic public safety just like Jewish Israelis. They have a right to a police service that takes illegal guns off the street, disrupts organized crime networks and solves criminal cases with the same alacrity it displays in Jewish cities. These were once obvious areas of pragmatic cooperation between political leaders in the Arab community and Israeli governments of all leanings. That there no longer are speaks to how extreme this coalition is.\n\nAs the Biden administration and American Jews watch the Israeli government\u2019s assault on the judiciary with profound anxiety, they should also carefully monitor developments in the country\u2019s Palestinian society. The future of Israeli democracy is not only contingent upon the preservation of judicial checks and balances, but also on the state\u2019s equitable treatment of its largest national minority.\n\nThe current Israeli government is not only failing to provide security for Arab citizens, but believes it is not responsible for them at all. This contradicts a fundamental principle of democracy, that of equality before the law. For Arab citizens, the erosion of democratic rule is not merely a threat but a daily and brutal reality.\n\nWhen Yitzhak Rabin, in his final speech the night he was assassinated, said that \u201cviolence erodes the basis of Israeli democracy,\u201d he was speaking of political violence. The violence Arab communities face today is criminal in nature, but the state\u2019s decision to neglect them is a political choice.\n\nTo contact the author, email [email protected]."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-arabs-palestinians-protests-unrest/2021/05/12/af8df29a-b308-11eb-bc96-fdf55de43bef_story.html", "page_content": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nRAMLE, Israel \u2014 The escalating conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has sparked an outbreak of increasingly volatile protests by Israel's own Arab citizens, who have taken to the streets this week in numbers unseen in two decades.

Police erected roadblocks to prevent people from entering the city.\n\nIsraeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said 270 people were arrested Tuesday across the country in \u201cwide-scale disturbances and riots.\u201d In some cases, he said, Jewish residents who had armed themselves with bats and other weapons were \u201cwalking in the streets to protect themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not seen this kind of violence since October 2000,\u201d said Israeli Police Chief Kobi Shabtai, referring to the Palestinian mass uprising that spanned five years and in which thousands of Israelis and Palestinians were killed.\n\nThe unrest came as Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza continued to exchange rocket fire and airstrikes in some of the worst cross-border violence in years. At least 65 Gazans, including 16 children, and six Israelis, including one teenage girl, have been killed, according to officials on the two sides.\n\nThe surge in violence came amid ongoing efforts by Israeli settlers to evict several Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem, as well as fierce clashes between Palestinians and Israeli \u00adpolice at and around al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHassan Jabreen, the general director of Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, said he had not seen this kind of \u201cfear and concern for safety among Arab populations\u201d in two decades.\n\nBut the unrest in Arab Israeli communities reflects longer-standing grievances about their status and security within Israel, according to analysts and Arab activists.\n\nThe protests are in part \u201cbecause of the anger that\u2019s been building up years and years,\u201d said Rami Younes, an Arab writer and filmmaker who is originally from Lod. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a new generation which is fearless and direct, which is fed up with the aggression and oppression of Arabs.\u201d\n\nArabs make up 20 percent of Israel\u2019s population and are the descendants of Palestinians who remained inside Israel\u2019s borders following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. They have long complained of what they say is institutionalized discrimination against them.\n\nJabreen said that Netanyahu, his public security minister and police share responsibility for the latest unrest because of rhetoric inciting division between Arabs and Jews. Israeli authorities reject that accusation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana defended those \u201claw-abiding citizens\u201d who carry weapons to assist the police, and he criticized the arrest of three suspects in the Lod killing on Monday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Lod braced for more unrest on Wednesday, Arafat Ismail prepared to lay to rest his brother-in-law Khalil Awaad and 16-year-old niece Nadine Awaad. who were killed early in the morning when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip struck beside their home.\n\nA 14-story building in Gaza City known to have housed several local media outlets, including Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV, was hit in an Israeli strike on May 12. (Video: Reuters)\n\nThe family lives in an Arab village called Dahamash down an unpaved road between Ramle and Lod. Ismail said that for seven years, since the last war between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza, his village has been petitioning various authorities for bomb shelters, which none of the homes there have. Israel does not officially recognize the village, where Ismail\u2019s family has long lived.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve requested that there be infrastructure, shelters, just like in the Jewish communities,\u201d he said, leaning on an aging green walker. He added, \u201cWhy not me? Do missiles not target us?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe impact of the rocket struck Awaad and his daughter, who had been sheltering beside two now-incinerated cars. While Israeli authorities urge residents to remain indoors when air raid sirens sound, Ismail said people in his community often prefer to be outside because they worry that the walls of their homes are not strong enough to survive a blast.\n\nAs an Arab citizen of Israel, he said, \u201cyou exist and are invisible at the same time.\u201d\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}, {"url": "https://www.jta.org/2021/05/13/israel/arab-citizens-in-a-jewish-state-what-to-know-about-arab-israelis-as-protests-sweep-the-country", "page_content": "(JTA) \u2014 As Israel has begun yet another round of fighting with Hamas in Gaza, another conflict, inside the country, has caught some by surprise: clashes between Israeli Arabs and Jews.\n\nOn Tuesday, in the central Israeli city of Lod, Arab protesters burned synagogues, shops and cars. Photos showed Torah scrolls salvaged from torched interiors, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in the early morning hours to declare a state of emergency. Crowds of Arab protesters in other cities also gathered and, in some cases, started fires on the street.\n\nThe violence did not end there. On Wednesday, Jewish protesters took to the streets of the coastal city of Bat Yam, chanting \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d and vandalizing a reportedly Arab-owned ice cream shop. A crowd of Jews also protested in the northern city of Tiberias, while clashes resumed in Lod ahead of a curfew. An Arab and a Jew, respectively, were beaten in different cities. And on Thursday, in continuing unrest, a police officer in the city of Ramle was shot.\n\nThe interethnic violence comes following weeks of fighting between Arabs and Jews in eastern Jerusalem \u2014 clashes that sparked the fatal exchange of bombs that began this week and shows no signs of stopping. Arab Israelis also protested Israel\u2019s 2014 war in Gaza, but this week\u2019s violence, which some have worried augurs a civil war, appears to be the most widespread civil unrest among Israeli Arabs in more than 20 years.\n\nThe violence comes at a complex time for Israeli Arabs \u2014 following years in which they complained of rising discrimination and neglect, but also just as an Israeli Arab political party was about to clinch unprecedented influence in Israel\u2019s government.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of who Israeli Arabs are and what the ongoing unrest might mean for their place in Israeli society.\n\nArab Israelis make up about 20% of Israeli society.\n\nThere are nearly 2 million Arab citizens of Israel, roughly one-fifth of the country\u2019s population. The vast majority are Muslim, while fewer than 200,000 are Christian.\n\nIn terms of citizenship and rights, Israeli Arabs are distinct both from West Bank Palestinians and from Arab residents of eastern Jerusalem.\n\nArab Israelis largely descend from Arabs who lived within Israel\u2019s borders before the state\u2019s establishment in 1948, and did not flee or get expelled. They are full citizens of Israel, and have the right to vote and equality under the law. Israeli Arab parties serve in Israel\u2019s parliament and an Arab judge sits on Israel\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nPalestinians in the West Bank have none of those rights. They live under varying degrees of Israeli military control and do not have freedom of movement, the right to vote in Israeli elections or access to Israel\u2019s civilian court system. They cannot obtain Israeli citizenship.\n\nPalestinian residents of Jerusalem are counted as residents of the city, have freedom of movement throughout Israel and can apply for Israeli citizenship. But they do not automatically receive the rights of Israeli citizens despite living in Israel\u2019s capital. Most have chosen not to apply for Israeli citizenship because Palestinians generally view eastern Jerusalem as the site of their future capital and do not recognize Israel\u2019s claims to the area.\n\nThough they\u2019re separated by borders, Arab Israelis and Palestinians often come from the same families and have other social and communal bonds. A segment of Israeli Arabs identifies as Palestinian citizens of Israel.\n\n\u201cWe feel that we are more Israeli and more Palestinian at the same time,\u201d Thabet Abu Rass, the co-director of the Abraham Initiatives, a coexistence organization, told Haaretz. \u201cPersonally, we are more Israeli; collectively, more Palestinian.\u201d\n\nWithin Israel, Arabs have protested structural discrimination.\n\nArabs and Jews in Israel largely live in separate societies. Most cities in Israel are either Jewish or Arab, and Arab and Jewish Israelis attend separate schools, save for a small number who go to a handful of joint Jewish-Arab schools. Unlike most Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis are exempt from mandatory military service following high school.\n\nThe two groups are so separate that there are even programs to take Jewish Israelis on group tours of nearby Arab towns. Several cities in Israel are \u201cmixed,\u201d with large Arab and Jewish populations living side by side. While these cities are sometimes praised as models of coexistence, disparities between their two communities persist, and some of them, like Lod and Ramle, have seen harrowing violence this week.\n\nAlthough they have full rights as citizens, Arab Israelis have long protested discrimination in a variety of fields in Israel as well as funding disparities between Jewish and Arab cities. The poverty rate is higher among Arabs, some of whom have complained about discrimination in employment and elsewhere. Jewish extremists who view Arabs in Israel as a hostile threat have vandalized Arab Israeli schools and mosques as well.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, Israeli Arab society in general has made progress,\u201d Abu Rass told Haaretz. \u201cBut there are a not small number of young people, especially without an education, among whom the anger and frustration is rising.\u201d\n\nAnd Israeli Arabs have also protested what they see as official discrimination from the government. While Arab Israelis have representation in parliament, an Arab Israeli party has never been part of a governing coalition.\n\nIn particular, Arab Israelis objected to a 2018 law that declared Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people, and said only Jews had the \u201cright to national self-determination\u201d in the country.\n\nArabs have been integrating into Israeli society and appeared close to a political breakthrough \u2014 but now there\u2019s fighting in the street.\n\nIn recent years, Israeli Arabs have seen gains in employment and higher education. Despite ideological differences, the data suggested that society was slowly integrating. And because of ongoing Israeli political deadlock, it appeared that an Arab Israeli party would act as kingmaker following the country\u2019s most recent election. If an Israeli governing coalition needed to rely on an Arab party to form a government, it would give Israeli Arabs unprecedented power in Israel\u2019s political system.\n\nBut in the past three days, the situation has changed drastically. Instead of moving into an era in which Jews and Arabs would form a political partnership in an increasingly shared society, Israel\u2019s leaders are pleading for Arabs and Jews not to kill each other.\n\nAnd the violence is happening in Israel\u2019s few Arab-Jewish cities, where the two populations live together. Now, no one can say what the future holds in a society that appears more divided than it\u2019s been in decades."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/02/world/middleeast/israel-arab-crime-killings-police.html", "page_content": "TAIBEH, Israel \u2014 After a day of work in construction, Alaa Sarsour, 25, showered, dressed and walked the short distance to his friend\u2019s pre-wedding henna party in a cobbled alley festooned with ribbons in the old heart of Taibeh, an Arab town in central Israel.\n\nSuddenly, mid-celebration, a wild burst of bullets split the cool night air, hitting Mr. Sarsour and five other guests.

Racketeering, murders linked to loansharking and score-settling have all become more common, according to a study carried out by Baladna in 2022. In 2021, the Abraham Initiatives, an NGO that documents violence within the Arab community, recorded a record 126 murders. The next year, in 2022, an association of Palestinian journalists recorded a total of 75 people killed, including nine women.\n\nIsraeli Arabs are Arabs who have Israeli citizenship and live in Israel. Part of this population is known as \"Inside Palestinians\", Palestinians who remained within Israeli territory after the Arab-Israeli War in 1948.

He requested anonymity for his own security.\n\nThe main reason for the increase in crime is the absence of the state. We have the impression that the police don\u2019t do much. In Arab communities, there is not a large enough police presence. We are also lacking in infrastructure and banks [Editor\u2019s note: this shortage of banking opportunities feeds into the growing problem with loansharking or unsafe loan practices with high interest rates]. The result is that there\u2019s a feeling of impunity amongst the criminals, who think they can do anything. Journalists in these communities live under immense pressure. When there are arrests, they don\u2019t dare to publish the names of the people who have been arrested because they are afraid of reprisals, that someone will go after them or their families. Our population has been taken hostage by organised crime, which makes its money largely through racketeering [Editor\u2019s note: dishonest and fraudulent business dealings]. Many shopkeepers have to pay these gangs each month for protection. They also get money from some local businesses. And people are afraid to talk because of the consequences for them or their families.\n\n'Some of their weapons are stolen from the Israeli army'\n\nThere is also a lot of firearms trafficking within these organised crime structures. Some of these weapons are contraband smuggled in from Jordan and Lebanon. Others were stolen from the Israeli army, mostly from training centres. Over the last few months, there has been a worrying rise in loansharking. Many people living in Arab communities have difficulty getting access to credit. And so they end up having to turn to usurers. It\u2019s a business controlled by organised crime and the interest rates are high. If someone isn\u2019t able to pay back the loan in time, then the criminals go after them and their family. In these communities, there are many young people, between the age of 18 and 22, who don\u2019t have work and aren\u2019t able to continue their studies. Without hope for the future or opportunities, they turn towards crime and are recruited by gangs because they are attracted by this lifestyle \u2014 luxury cars, money and weapons.\n\nMany people accuse the Israeli police of failing to protect Arab communities. In response to this discontent, in August 2021, the Israeli police created a unit dedicated to fighting crime in the Arab community. The government then announced that they were launching a large operation, known as \u201cSafe Route\u201d. The operation was supposed to continue until 2026, but the results are yet to be seen.\n\nSince the start of the year, only 19 percent of murders in the Arab community have been solved, even though the figure is 70 percent in the Jewish community, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. More than 70 percent of homicides take place in the Arab community even though they only make up 20 percent of the population."}, {"url": "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-742132", "page_content": "Darya Leitel.

Abu Rabia was killed by her own brother, and Albana\u2019s husband stabbed her multiple times, all while paramedics tried to get into the locked apartment.\n\nAnd, at 2:34 a.m. on May 1, Massaroa was found dead in her home in Taiba, with her two sons \u2013 six-month-old Amir and two-year-old Adam \u2013 lying dead next to her.\n\nIN 2022, 24 women were killed in Israel in cases defined as femicide or suspected femicide, an increase from 2021, during which 16 women were killed. And in the first quarter of 2023, the worrying trend seems to continue, with the number of women killed in acts of gender-based violence threatening to rise past the limits of the previous year.\n\nSimilarly worrying statistics are emerging from other minority sectors in Israel \u2013 namely, the Arab sector. So far this year, 68 violent murders have been carried out in Israeli-Arab communities, four of them against women. Over the 12 months of 2022, 116 murders were recorded in total, indicating that the total number of lives lost in 2023 will be much, much higher.\n\nPOLICE INSPECT the scene in Taiba where Baraa Massaroa was found dead with her two sons \u2013 six-month-old Amir and two-year-old Adam \u2013 lying dead next to her. (credit: ISRAEL POLICE)\n\nWith one-third of the women who have been murdered so far this year being Israeli-Arab, the link between the rising numbers in both sectors could perhaps serve as an indication of why this is happening.\n\nOn December 29, 2022, Israel\u2019s 37th government was sworn into office, and on January 1, 2023, Otzma Yehudit leader Itamar Ben-Gvir assumed the role of National Security Minister, taking over from his predecessor, former national security minister Omer Bar Lev.\n\nBen-Gvir\u2019s appointment as national security minister was met with concern and fear by women\u2019s organizations and Israeli-Arab organizations alike, with both voicing concerns over his political stances and priorities.\n\nSince taking office, Ben-Gvir has worked to implement several key policies concerning women and Arab-Israelis, while at the same time canceling several others that had been implemented or put forward by the previous government.\n\nRegarding women\u2019s issues, the national security minister decided back in March that the government should vote against a bill that would have required domestic offenders to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet to enforce restraining orders.\n\nThe bill, which had been the work of the previous government\u2019s justice minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar and MKs Merav Michaeli, Naama Lazimi and Merav Ben Ari, fell in a vote of 53-54, with Ben-Gvir saying that it was unbalanced and that an amended version of it would be put forward within a month.\n\nWhile the final details of his new and amended bill have not yet been published, one of the stipulations in it will state that a man must have two previous domestic violence convictions before he can be ordered to wear an electronic tracking bracelet.\n\nFollowing the March 22 vote, Bat Melech, an NGO that assists religious and haredi women who suffer from domestic violence, said that the rejection of the electronic bracelet bill was \u201cdisconnected from the terrible reality of seven femicides since the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons given by Ben-Gvir for his dissatisfaction with the bill was that he believed it to be unfair to men, and said that it failed to safeguard their rights against women who file false complaints.\n\n\u201cIt is important to prevent the possibility of false complaints, which results in harm to innocent men and also to women and their credibility,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nPolicies from previous government canceled in recent months\n\nOver in the Israeli-Arab sector, other policies and plans that were put in place by the previous government have been canceled, or adapted and adjusted to the point where their ability to create change has been cast into doubt.Under the Bennett-Lapid government, a budget to the tune of NIS 2.5 billion was allocated to reduce crime in Arab communities in Israel through a government initiative known as the Safe Route program.\n\nThe goals of the program included dismantling criminal organizations, raising the sense of personal security in the Arab sector, reducing the number of illegal weapons, increasing the Arab sector\u2019s trust in law enforcement and increasing cooperation with Arab leaders.\n\nWhile Ben-Gvir initially said that he would personally lead the efforts to continue the Safe Route program under the new government, these efforts quickly failed to materialize, after the national committee of Arab localities said that they would not hold a dialogue with the national security minister and that they opposed \u201cthe entrustment of the national program for dealing with crime to a convicted criminal.\u201d\n\nOn this topic, Moran Maimoni, codirector of public affairs for the Abraham Initiatives, explained to The Jerusalem Post that not only was the government failing to fill its campaign promises of improving the safety of all citizens, including its Israeli-Arab communities, but that in parts it was actively going against its word.\n\n\u201cBen-Gvir, for example, ran his campaign on the pledge of fighting violence, particularly in the south of the country, but in the end, not only has he done nothing since the moment he took office, but there are also plans that he has really harmed,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cA crucial part of the Safe Route was the building of trust between the government and the Arab leadership, and Ben-Gvir, from the start, arrived in a position where he can\u2019t work with them; they refuse to speak to him. So, essentially, this whole plan that had already been put into motion, to build trust and to work together with the community \u2013 all of that has just stopped.\u201d\n\nProgress from last year has reversed in past four months\n\nBut can the line really be so clearly drawn between the increased murder rates in the Arab sector and Ben-Gvir taking up office?\n\n\u201cIn practice, we are seeing more than two times the number of victims of violent crimes from the start of the year compared to last year,\u201d Maimoni said. \u201cOf course, it is not just Ben-Gvir or the government that has caused this. But we can see that there was an attempt to treat this phenomenon, from which we had begun seeing positive results; we could see that something had started changing.\n\n\u201cIt was a program that was supposed to take place over several years, and, of course, the problem wasn\u2019t ever going to be fixed in the space of a year, but we were able to see in the numbers a freeze in the increase of murder victims.\n\n\u201cBut now we\u2019re in a new place entirely,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about numbers without precedent. We haven\u2019t seen numbers like this, so many deaths in such a short time, since the state was founded. It has never been like this.\u201d\n\nRegarding the increase in gender-based murders, many have also pointed to a correlation between the new government and the rise in deaths.\n\nFor her part, Maimoni points to the cancellation of the electronic tagging legislation as the clearest example of failure to protect women in Israel.\n\n\u201cThere was a law that would have saved lives; it would have, of course, also taken time, and we wouldn\u2019t have seen the results immediately, the day after the law passed. But it was a law that, with time, could have really started to save the lives of women in the country. And Ben-Gvir erased it,\u201d she said.\n\nOthers, too, have shone a light on the cancellation of the legislation as one of the government\u2019s biggest rejections of women\u2019s safety.\n\nFollowing the murder of Massaroa and her two sons, Hadash MK Aida Touma-Sliman, who has been involved with the Women\u2019s Status Knesset Committee since 1992 and has headed it since 2015, placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of the government in general, and of Ben-Gvir specifically.\n\n\u201cThe knife used by the murderer was sharpened by the government, which deliberately acts against women, and by the appointed minister [Ben-Gvir], who harms every plan to protect us,\u201d she said scathingly. \u201cThere is a clear policy that encourages the current situation. We won\u2019t be led to our deaths quietly, like sheep to the slaughter.\u201d\n\nThe urgent need for change that is stressed both by Maimoni and Touma-Sliman is apparent when one examines the statistics concerning the murder rates in both sectors, but is even more so when one steps back to observe the situation among those who live amid the deaths.\n\nA joint project run by the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry with Israeli news company N12\u2019s Data12 department highlights the systemic issue that is domestic violence in Israel.\n\nAccording to weekly statistics that were updated as of May 3, 2023, in the last seven days, 67 calls have been made to a domestic violence hotline from women experiencing abuse at the hands of their partners. Additionally, 20 additional women have left their homes in the last week to seek protection at women\u2019s shelters across the country, and 307 children spent part or all of the last week in a shelter with their mothers after a domestic violence situation.\n\nHowever, Data12 warns in a written message, these numbers may not be exact, and the actual count could be higher. This is due to the fact that, currently, \u201cthere is no government body entrusted with the collection and analysis of data on murder and violence against women.

Drawing on heretofore overlooked archival sources from Israel's State Archives (ISA), the Knesset Archive, the Labor Movement Archive (LMA), and the Historical Jewish Press, this article reveals that during Israel's founding decades, Israeli officials adopted minimum quotas for employing unskilled Arab workers in manual labor jobs; quotas for hiring educated Arabs in the civil service; requirements and incentives for hiring Arabs in government offices, Jewish organizations, and businesses; and earmarked jobs and established vocational training courses for the Arab population. Tracing the use of these mechanisms, not then called \u201caffirmative action\u201d but recognized as such today, to this period of control over a subjected population, complicates our understanding of both this chapter in Israel's history and of affirmative action more broadly.\n\nStarting in the late 1950s, Israeli policy makers, motivated by a host of interests, adopted measures to promote the integration of Arab workers into the civil service and other predominantly Jewish institutions and businesses. Based on these findings, I propose a two-stage periodization of Israel's treatment of its Arab citizens during the first two decades of statehood: first, strict military control and exclusion, followed by, starting in 1957, a regime of \u201chierarchical inclusion\u201d: gradual integration of the majority of Arabs as second-class subjects into the lower tiers of the Israeli economy, with only a minority integrated into higher tiers. Although these measures were not a coherent policy initiative, they nevertheless constituted a significant, yet overlooked, element of this transformation and of the state's approach toward the Arab population.\n\nThe article proceeds in three stages. First, it describes the different mechanisms that Israeli officials used to promote the inclusion of the Arab population into the national workplace. Although Israel never had a formal Jim Crow-like regime, Jews and Arabs were residentially, educationally and economically segregated after the 1948 War.Footnote 3 This separatist structure was mostly kept in place during the first decade of statehood, in which the military regime imposed limitations on the movement of Arabs within Israel and made employment outside the villages in which they lived very difficult. However, with the weakening of military restrictions in 1957 and the economic prosperity of those years, these measures were replaced by efforts to integrate Arabs into the national workforce across the civil service, private companies, and public entities. These policies included hiring quotas, earmarked jobs, vocational training, some preferential treatment in hiring, and stipends and accommodations for Arab university students, as well as requirements and incentives for hiring Arabs in private businesses and governmental offices. This description is supplemented by a survey of the \u201croad not taken\u201d of educational integration.\n\nSecond, this article uncovers the varied motivations of historical actors in adopting affirmative action measures. The two most dominant motivations were instrumental concerns about the security and stability of the young Jewish state and its economy. These were augmented by instrumental concerns about international legitimation and a desire to garner Arab votes, as well as by egalitarian motivations based on liberal or socialist ideologies. This multiple, and sometimes conflicting, host of interests and commitments led policy makers to adopt this set of techniques of employment inclusion, aimed sometimes at furthering and sometimes at countering Jewish domination.\n\nThird, the article evaluates the effects of these measures. With more than 50% of Arab workers joining the \u201cJewish Sector\u201d during the second decade,Footnote 4 affirmative action did improve their material conditions and economic integration. However, integration was limited to \u201chierarchical inclusion,\u201d entailing that Arabs increasingly worked for and with Jews, rather than in their villages, but typically held low-paying, unskilled jobs. Only a small number of qualified Arabs were integrated into better-paying managerial and professional roles and into higher education.\n\nThis article, the first to focus on this topic and to provide a detailed description and analysis of these measures, adds an empirical contribution to the literature on the history, and legal history, of the relationship between the Israeli state and its Arab citizens. Legal scholars have neglected this important history, instead dating the beginning of Israel's affirmative action efforts to the 1990s, when appropriate representation requirements were formally adopted by the legislature and later affirmed and expanded by the Supreme Court.Footnote 5 Similarly, historians have thoroughly studied and debated the state's approach toward the Arab minority in its first decades, but have largely overlooked the measures described in this article and their significance.Footnote 6 More concretely, the historiographical debate on Israel's approach to the Arab population during its founding decades focuses on Israel's dual approach toward its Arab minority, debating the balance between its liberal and democratic commitments, on the one hand, and the state's Zionist, nationalist, or colonialist nature and its security concerns, on the other.Footnote 7 Some historians have seen Israel's early liberal commitments to the Arab population as a source of democratic legitimation,Footnote 8 but most have framed their work as the critical exposure of past wrongs. They often depict formal citizenship as concealing a colonial regime of Jewish domination,Footnote 9 and seek to explain how different social, political, economic, and legal mechanisms were used to sustain Jewish domination and control.Footnote 10 Although some have treated the state's policy as a well-orchestrated plan to sustain the subordination of the Arab population,Footnote 11 Ian Lustick, in his seminal book, proposed the structural framework of \u201ccontrol\u201d to explain the stability of the Israeli regime and pointed to three sociopolitical mechanisms that played a role in keeping the Arab minority docile: the separation of the Arab and Jewish populations, the cultivation of Arab dependency, and the cooptation of the Arab elite.Footnote 12\n\nThe dominant narrative of control that details how the nation's first twenty years were marked by policies that secured Arabs\u2019 subordinated position is insufficiently nuanced. The picture that emerges from the history this article tells is not of a contest between two approaches, but rather of a changing, multivocal, porous, and internally contradictory state.Footnote 13 Focused as they are on the stability of the regime over time and on recognizable tools of oppression, scholars have largely missed the state's deployment of affirmative action.Footnote 14 The few measures that have received scholarly attention were either dismissed as unrepresentative outliers, or been identified as efforts of cooptation of power brokers within Arab communities.Footnote 15 Yet, this article shows that the described measures did not solely target specific individual elites in order to gain their loyalty and cooperation, but rather worked more broadly to promote employment inclusion of different segments of the Arab workforce for a host of reasons and motivations.\n\nBy tracing changes in the state's employment policies over time and demonstrating the prevalence of affirmative action measures during the second decade, the article seeks to revise understanding of Israel's two decades of military control, often described as a monolithic block, into a more fragmented structure: a decade of military control and segregation followed by a second decade of subtler and more stable form of economic subordination. Doing so ties the argument to historical sociology literature on the history of Israel's labor market. This scholarship has described the Arab workers\u2019 incorporation into Israel's segmented labor market in those years \u201cas temporary and casual laborers in jobs characterized by low wages, poor work conditions, frequent violations of workers\u2019 rights, and high occupational insecurity.''Footnote 16 I seek to modify this framework through the concept of \u201chierarchical inclusion,\u201d which captures how a minority of the Arab population was actively integrated into the primary workforce and into higher education.Footnote 17\n\nFinally, by employing the conceptual framework of affirmative action, the article argues that these measures are distinct from familiar measures understood to have coopted Arabs elites; in fact, these measures targeted varied segments of the Arab population and together amounted to an important part of Israel's policy in those years, the effects of which were indeterminate and plastic.Footnote 18 Affirmative action, however, is a loaded term. In contemporary political and scholarly debates over affirmative action, it is often associated with egalitarian commitments to redistribution and remedying past wrongs.Footnote 19 In contrast, for the purpose of this article, I define affirmative action not by its motivating rationale, but rather by the use of a specific set of techniques deployed today in Israel and other countries, commonly recognized as affirmative action: hiring quotas, marked tenders, and other forms of preferential treatment meant to promote the inclusion of disadvantaged groups into the workforce or higher education. This definition is intuitive and controversial at the same time, and, as such, I suggest that it creates a space to re-examine common assumptions about this tool and its contingent relationship to equality. It provides a framework for examining how affirmative action operates outside of its familiar historical context of struggles for equal citizenship, and demonstrates how affirmative action can serve more as a set of administrative tools encompassing a managerial form and logic rather than as measures with inherent egalitarian meaning.Footnote 20\n\nThe story I tell here is also of interest to those who study the contemporary relationship between Israel's Jewish majority and the Arab minority. In recent years, Israel's government has adopted nationalist policies and legislation, marginalizing the Arab minority and undermining its political rights and symbolic status.Footnote 21 However, much as in the past, the very same government has adopted large-scale employment affirmative action measures, including quotas, earmarked positions, and business incentivizing, for hiring Palestinian-Arab citizens of Israel and promoting their inclusion in the national economy.Footnote 22 Tracing the roots of these affirmative action practices to the state's founding decades allows a new and more nuanced perspective on what is often mistakenly considered an unprecedented, bipolar era of economic inclusion and sociopolitical exclusion in Israel's approach to its Arab minority.Footnote 23\n\nThe Five Motivations that Led Israeli Policymakers to Adopt Employment Affirmative Action Measures Policies adopted by Israeli officials during the first and especially during the second decade of statehood that are recognizable today as affirmative action, were not necessarily motivated by egalitarianism, but instead by multiple and often contradictory motives. Of course, the officials\u2019 motivations and their justifications may not have aligned. Yet because the source material reflects internal, private deliberations, it suggests that these officials were likely speaking rather candidly. These discussions therefore offer a unique opportunity to learn about the conflicting rationales that motivated Israeli officials during the founding decades of the state. Internal governmental reports and discussions of policies reveal four types of instrumental rationales for adopting affirmative action measures: ensuring security and social order, advancing economic growth, gaining international legitimacy, and garnering the Arab vote. Also discernible is a fifth type of motivation, revolving around reaching egalitarian ideological goals. Concerns for the security of the young Jewish state and the stability of the regime, as well as aspirations for national economic growth, were the most dominant justifications raised in discussions about affirmative action. Often, however, the same measure was motivated by mixed rationales. Although egalitarian sentiments were expressed in many cases, they rarely stood as an independent motivation for promoting employment affirmative action. Security It is well documented that security concerns and a perceived need to maintain stability played a major role in the state's approach to the Arab minority during its first two decades.Footnote 105 It is less known, however, that security considerations were behind officials\u2019 decisions not only to enact oppressive measures, but also to adopt inclusionary measures. These security-oriented rationales were especially dominant during the first decade, when the status of the Arab minority as citizens was most fragile and unstable. Reducing unemployment and raising the material status of the Arab minority was a way of managing the crisis and the hostile population, preventing political turmoil, and, more generally, maintaining public order and the stability of the newly established Jewish regime. Policy makers acted under the assumption that the Arab population was a security threat, and that steps for improving their material conditions needed to be taken in order to prevent any escalation of the conflict. Reuven Bareket, the architect of Mapai's first 1958 action plan, articulated the security approach clearly. The Arab population, he explained, had connections to hostile foreign populations from Arab countries, and \u201cthe majority of the Arab sector is hostile to the state.\u201dFootnote 106 He then presented three possible approaches for dealing with this situation: \u201cdisplacement, assimilation or liberalism.\u201d Bareket acknowledged that there would be no displacement, and exhorted that hopes for assimilation should also be abandoned.Footnote 107 Consequently, he argued that the state must \u201cdeal with the Arab minority with a liberal line of policy.\u201d Furthermore, in order to fight dangerous separatist trends in Arab society, he declared that, \u201cthe goal should be integration\u2014not complete, but more or less acceptable\u2014of the Arab sector in all aspects of life.\u201dFootnote 108 Making the case for promoting employment integration, Bareket explained that, \u201cif we create cooperation between ten Jews and ten Arabs, these ten Arabs then become a cell of resistance to irredentist activity.\u201dFootnote 109 Bareket further argued that, \u201cthe more the economic interests of the Arab sector are tied to and aligned with those of the state, the more its responsibility for the security of the state will grow.\u201dFootnote 110 Israeli officials on the Mapai Committee for Arab Affairs believed that an Arab population that was increasingly integrated into the national labor force would be less susceptible to identifying with rival Arab states. This would therefore make them more loyal, and render the state less vulnerable to incitement and takeover by hostile forces within and outside Israel's borders.Footnote 111 For example, a 1961 report by the Government Committee for Problems of Employment and Professional Training of Arab Youth recommended implementing a set of affirmative action measures, including prioritizing opening employment centers in Arab towns and integrating Arab youth into previously Jewish professional training courses, which \u201ccould dissolve the bitterness of the Arabs\u201d and \u201cdistance Arab youth from the devastating effects of underground organizations.\u201dFootnote 112 Its authors feared that poor conditions could become a \u201csource of hatred.\u201dFootnote 113 Similarly, in a policy plan that was largely adopted by the government, the advisor for Arab affairs explained that the state must integrate the Arab minority, to \u201cdecrease as much as possible the formulation of an independent dangerous sector . . . . [T]his will not make them loyal citizens, but with time, it will decrease open animosity and its explicit manifestation.\u201dFootnote 114 Rising unemployment was also considered dangerous, as it created negative attitudes toward the state.Footnote 115 Aharon Beker, Chairman of the Histadrut from 1961 to 1969, articulated this view clearly, arguing that the state had to integrate the Arab worker into the national economy, \u201cso he would bear responsibility to ensure and promote its security.\u201dFootnote 116 Others advocated employment affirmative action as a way to promote security and order by fostering loyalty, not via simple material relief, but through the cultivation of a kind of partnership between the Arabs and the state, or at least the appearance of one. For example, an official in the Histadrut explained that \u201cin order to prevent the danger that the minorities left in the state will come to hate it and fight it, [the state] must do everything in order to integrate them, in a way of constrictive organic integration, on the basis of equal rights and duties\u2026 [O]nly such a regime can bring a minimal chance for moral change in the Arabs\u2019 views about themselves and us, and only it can open a crack for a relationship of true peace and mutual benefit.\u201dFootnote 117 Moshe Sharett, who was prime minister from 1954 to 1955, between Ben-Gurion's two terms, articulated the same logic. Sharett acknowledged that the Arabs\u2019 situation \u201cis difficult\u201d because they \u201cfeel themselves to be residents of Israel,\u201d their birthplace. Yet \u201cthey are nationally connected to Arab nations outside of Israel.\u201d Therefore, Israel faced a choice: \u201callow external influences to take over, or must we strengthen our ties with them?\u201d Sharett believed that education, \u201cequality and understanding\u201d would allow Arabs to \u201cgrow closer to us\u201d and push them away, for instance, from the allure of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.Footnote 118 In contrast to the articulated goal of cultivating loyalty by bringing the two communities closer together, another method for enhancing the state's security was to try to prevent the political consolidation of the Arab minority into one national Arab movement by creating divisions between the community's different ethnic groups: Muslims, Druze, Bedouin, and Christians.Footnote 119 One common method used to achieve this goal was breaking up the territorial continuity of Arab communities by building Jewish settlements among them.Footnote 120 Another method involved granting preferential treatment to some subsectors within the Arab population in order to cultivate independent and conflicting interests in each community. As Reuven Bareket explained, in order to secure Israel, it must \u201ccultivate within each sector [within the Arab population] its own sectorial interests, by positive discrimination (aflia letova) and preferential treatment.\u201dFootnote 121 The most prominent illustration of this approach can be seen with respect to the Druze community, whose members enjoyed a somewhat favorable status.Footnote 122 Economy Another leading rationale for adopting employment affirmative action for the Arab community at that time was the health and prosperity of the national economy. In the first decade, officials working to promote the full employment of Jewish immigrants were concerned with competition between Jewish and Arab workers, and therefore worked to exclude Arabs from the national workforce.Footnote 123 However, with the economic prosperity of the late 1950s, and when unemployment among Jewish works was very low, the complete segregation of Arabs from the labor market was no longer an attractive option for the Israeli establishment. Officials interested in the development and flourishing of the state's economy realized that unemployment and the underdevelopment of certain sectors could become unmanageable and would hold back the entire economy.Footnote 124 An additional factor, albeit one less openly discussed, was that the integration of Arab workers into the workforce, especially in the production and construction sectors, could provide cheap labor to support the development of the state's infrastructure.Footnote 125 The economic rationales for taking affirmative action measures were not only these familiar utilitarian ones. Israeli policy makers also began to take an interest in integrating the Arab population into the national economy in order to dismantle the independent Arab economy that predated the establishment of Israel. In 1959 the prime minister's advisor for Arab affairs contended that the integration of Arabs into the state's economy was necessary \u201cin order to prevent the creation of an independent Arab economy that would strengthen Arab autonomy.\u201dFootnote 126 Integration, it was further explained, would prevent future competition between the Arab and Jewish economies.Footnote 127 Furthermore, during the second decade of statehood, there was a growing belief among government officials that the Arab sector had accumulated significant wealth. Therefore, policy makers thought that development, integration, and cooperation would promote consumerism in the Arab sector, which would, in turn, lead to the transfer of funds \u201cback\u201d to the state.Footnote 128 For example, the prime minister's advisor for Arab affairs wrote that any attempt to circulate funds accumulated in the Arab sector back into the state's economy must include modernization to support Arab consumption.Footnote 129 International Legitimacy A third type of motivation for affirmative action involved external considerations, mainly improving the perception of Israel in the eyes of the international community. Israel's democratic and moral commitments to equality were sometimes articulated by Israeli officials as an independent rationale for adopting affirmative action measures. However, these commitments were also often mentioned as a way to bolster international legitimacy, as the international community became increasingly concerned with anti-Arab discrimination over the first two decades. In 1958, advocating for a series of affirmative steps, the chair of Mapai's Committee for Arab Affairs noted that \u201cnot only non-Jewish public opinion has become interested in the Arab problem in Israel, but also certain circles of the global Jewish community . . . . They are starting to show concern and dissatisfaction with the way we are handling this problem.\u201dFootnote 130 Particularly noteworthy is Ben-Gurion's 1960 explanation of the inherently contradictory poles of the Arab problem. The first, he explained, \u201cis the character [the state] needs to present to the world\u2014a principle of equal rights and democracy. The second aspect is the security of the state. . . .\u201d This contradiction, he explained, \u201ccan be minimized by taking the right policy.\u201dFootnote 131 Ben-Gurion then listed a series of integrative measures that could minimize this contradiction, including the integration of Arabs into Mapai itself, the government, the workforce, and even the Jewish kibbutzim and villages.Footnote 132 The Arab Vote During the first decade of Israel's statehood, the Arab population's main avenues for political activity were threefold: satellite Arab parties affiliated with Mapai, Mapam (The United Workers Party), and Maki (the Israeli Communist Party). In 1959, El-Ard, a pan-Arab national movement, was formed by a group of Arab intellectuals with the aspiration of bringing equality to all inhabitants of Israel and finding a fair solution to the Palestinian problem. Although eventually blocked from competing in the national elections, El-Ard, like Mapam and Maki, adhered to egalitarian ideologies and criticized Mapai for its approach toward the Arab minority and the prolonged military regime.Footnote 133 At this point, Mapai started using affirmative action measures in its fight over the Arab vote.Footnote 134 For example, the advisor for Arab affairs explained that parties other than Mapai were buying the Arab vote or providing other benefits in exchange for it. Mapai, the advisor asserted, was losing the Arab vote. Therefore, he recommended that the party should \u201cgradually integrate Arabs within its fold.\u201dFootnote 135 Similarly, in the discussion regarding the integration of Arabs into a youth leaders\u2019 seminar in 1962, one official explained that, without integration, the party would be abandoning the youth, who would soon become voters, to the devastating influences of Maki and Mapam.Footnote 136 Egalitarian Aspirations Although there was no unified egalitarian ideology supporting affirmative action, egalitarian motivations were nonetheless significant during the first and second decade. Liberal and socialist morality led officials to pursue more egalitarian policies and, in some cases, to support affirmative action measures. Some of the universal moral arguments were rooted in liberal aspirations for equal citizenship. As early as September 1948, Israel's first minister of the interior promised the Arab minority that there will be \u201ca single constitution for all inhabitants of Israel. The Jews have suffered too much to allow themselves to deal unjustly with Israel's Arab citizens.\u201dFootnote 137 Yizhak Ben Zvi, Israel's second president, advocated for the inclusion of the Arab minority into society. In a similar vein, he explained that especially after what the Jews had suffered, they must get used to being just rulers.Footnote 138 In another instance, Ben Zvi declared that the idea of removing the Arabs from Israel \u201cis in opposition to the entire democratic and Jewish character of our state,\u201d and that the only option was to work for the integration of \u201cMuslims, Christians, and Druze as citizens with equal rights and as communities with equal rights in the state.\u201dFootnote 139 In 1959, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion explained that the state \u201cshould help the Arab intelligentsia adapt to the national economy and governmental and private clerkship . . . not because . . . it will bring peace with our neighbors . . . but because they are citizens of Israel and they deserve the same entitlements as any other Israeli citizen.\u201dFootnote 140 In 1960, he further explained that there is \u201cantisemitism\u201d in Israel against Arabs, and in order to denunciate it, there is a need \u201cto welcome Arabs to the party, to the Histadrut, to the Kibbutzim\u2014as members and as employees. And not just on election night, we need to welcome them [the Arabs] in all governmental offices, with only one or two exceptions, to welcome them to all businesses, to all institutions, Arab teachers should teach in Hebrew schools and Hebrew teachers should teach in Arab schools.\u201dFootnote 141 In other instances, arguments made mostly by Mapam members emphasized the socialist commitments of fairness and equality for members of the working class.Footnote 142 Reflecting on the coexistence of these contradictory motivations and their manifestation in conflicting policies of economic inclusion and social exclusion, in 1962 Moshe Dayan said that \u201cwhen it comes to security we cannot allow full equal rights, but in other fields of life, probably not education and such, but in the economic field\u2014they are equal to Jews. But between this formula and its formation in real life, the gap is huge . . . for this, we need to take from one and give to the other. Because equality means equality.\u201dFootnote 143\n\nEffects: From Exclusion to Hierarchical Inclusion Thus far, this article has demonstrated that the state employed different mechanisms seeking to promote the inclusion of the Arab population into the national workforce during Israel's first and especially second decade, for various and sometime contradictory reasons. This section tries to assess the effects of these mechanisms on inequality between the Arab minority and the Jewish majority during those years. Given the overall stability and persistence of the control framework over the Arab population during the state's first two decades, and in light of the sustained subordination of the Arab minority, it would seem that affirmative action measures simply served the regime,Footnote 144 or at the very least, that these measures did not disrupt the oppressive regime that clearly persisted long thereafter.Footnote 145 Although some elements of this explanation ring true, a more nuanced understanding is that these mechanisms did not simply threaten or sustain the status quo.Footnote 146 Instead, they were part of a wider transformation, from complete workforce segregation and strict military rule in the first decade of statehood, to a more integrated economic subordination during the second. With the inception of the state and after the end of the 1948 War, Arabs and Jews in Israel were largely segregated in every aspect of life: residential, educational, and employment. More than 90% of the Arab population lived in separate villages or towns.Footnote 147 The schools, which were completely segregated during the British Mandate over Palestine, remained that way after 1948. This segregation was not imposed by a formal Jim Crow-like regime, but instead was a reflection of separate areas of residency as well as a result of recurring decisions by state officials to facilitate Arab-speaking schools for the Arab population.Footnote 148 Pursuing the Zionist ideal of Hebrew Labor, prior to the establishment of the state, the Arab and Jewish labor markets were also largely separated. Although there were some cases of cooperation between Arabs and Jews during the British Mandate, these mostly dissolved with the outbreak of violence following the United Nations Partition Plan in November 1947.Footnote 149 This separatist structure persisted until 1957. Until then, Yoram Ben-Porath noted, high rates of unemployment in the Jewish sector, caused mainly by the influx of Jewish immigrants in the early 1950s, led the Israeli government to continue protecting the Zionist ideal of \u201cHebrew Labor\u201d and limiting the ability of Arabs to work outside their villages and compete with Jewish immigrants striving for jobs. This was mainly done by the military's permit system.Footnote 150 Michael Shalev adds that \u201c[n]ot only was the political constellation at the elite level in support of binational class solidarity rather feeble; but on the ground, in the labor market arena, there were powerful forces in the first decade of sovereignty favoring . . . [the] strategy of Arab exclusion.\u201dFootnote 151 And indeed, as this article showed, measures adopted during the first decade mostly sought to fight acute Arab unemployment and integrate Arabs into the workforce, but were generally not directed at integrating them into predominantly Jewish institutions and businesses or the civil service. Yet, starting in 1957, although educational and residential segregation continued, the state began to move away from the separatist structure of the labor market. Scholars show how, with the economic prosperity and high rate of employment in the Jewish sector, the limitations on movement and the enforcement of employment segregation by the military were significantly eased in those years.Footnote 152 Various affirmative action measures to integrate Arab workers into the national workforce, and specifically into the civil service and Jewish-run institutions and businesses, were important policies toward this same goal. A massive integration of Arab workers into the national economy appears to have occurred in the second decade of Israel's statehood.Footnote 153 Between 1959 and 1968, the number of Arabs working for state or Jewish-owned industries, rather than in Arab villages, increased from 48,000 to 82,800.Footnote 154 Although in 1959, 20% of Arab workers were employed outside their villages, in 1966, 50% of Arabs were employed outside their villages, mostly in Jewish-owned business, kibbutzim and other Jewish municipalities, and the civil service.Footnote 155 Ben-Porath emphasized the rapid nature of this change in the mobility and integration of Arab workers into the Jewish sector.Footnote 156 The second decade witnessed the convergence of what had previously been two separate economies: one Arab, mainly agricultural, and confined to Arab villages, and the other Jewish and diverse. Eventually, half of the Arab workers would be employed by Jewish-owned businesses and by the state, mostly without changing their place of residency. However, this integration was not equally distributed along the socioeconomic ladder. In Haifa, Abba Hushi explained, in the early 1960s, Arabs living outside the city commuted in for work and \u201ctook over entire professions\u201d such as gardening, construction, repair, welding, and refineries. He estimated that \u201c900 Arab women work in household jobs.\u201d But \u201cArab high school graduates\u201d found that the labor \u201cmarket is closed.\u201d Thus, he argued: \u201c[W]e need a transition . . . We need to open the market to Arab workers. We need not just to open it, but to create active equality. We need to work so they would be employed by Solel-Boneh [at the time the largest construction company] for example. Solel-Boneh employs many [Arab] laborers, but not one clerk (Pakid), maybe one or two.\u201dFootnote 157 However, Hushi's hopes went mostly unrealized. The majority of Arabs who started working for Jewish employers or for the state during the second decade were employed in what scholars called the secondary labor force of unskilled manual jobs, mainly in construction.Footnote 158 Approximately 57% of the Arabs who entered the national workforce were employed in agriculture, construction, and other unskilled jobs, compared with only 12% of Jewish workers employed in those occupations during that period. Between 1959 and 1968, the percentage of Arabs employed in commerce and the service industry, such as in Jewish-owned hotels and restaurants, increased by 43%, the percentage of Arabs working in construction increased by 77%, and the percentage of Arabs employed in clerical jobs increased 11%.Footnote 159 Arab workers in the Jewish sector were usually paid less than Jewish workers, albeit still earning more than they would have in the Arab sector.Footnote 160 This shows that although Arabs and Jews started joining integrated workplaces, they held largely different occupations. Scholars described this process as a formation of a segmented labor force.Footnote 161 Yet I argue that this labor force was not completely segmented. Rather it is better characterized as having had hierarchical inclusion, in which the majority was incorporated into the secondary labor force, while a minority was actively integrated into the primary labor force. The percentage of Arabs employed in clerical and related jobs in the civil service increased from approximately 2.3% in 1958 to 2.6% in 1964 and approximately 3.6% in 1969, a notable increase, yet still far lower than their proportion of the population (11.4% in 1961 and 14.1% in 1967).Footnote 162 Similarly, the percentage of Arab university students rose from 0.6% (46 students) in 1957 to 1.7% (607 students) in 1970, but this was still minimal in comparison with their proportion of the population. Furthermore, many of them dropped out before obtaining a degree.Footnote 163 Thus, affirmative action measures did lead to greater inclusion of the Arab population in the national economy, and this should not be taken for granted. These measures contributed to creating a new economic reality, in which Arabs who were either unemployed or worked in agricultural jobs in Arab villages increasingly worked for and with Jews in hotels, factories, hospitals, construction projects, and other enterprises. However, this was a case of hierarchical inclusion, in which Arabs mostly worked for Jews in low-paying and low-skilled jobs. Although their integration into the higher tiers of the civil service, higher education, and better-paying jobs was a considerable improvement from the past, their representation nonetheless remained far from being equal. By benefiting the Arab population and promoting its inclusion, albeit on unequal terms, affirmative action measures took part in advancing the transformation that occurred in those years in Israel's control over the Arab population: from overt military oppression, to a more covert and more stable economic subordination, in which the majority of Arab workers are incorporated into a secondary labor force and only a minority are incorporated into the primary labor force.Footnote 164"}, {"url": "https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-745440", "page_content": "Khaled Khaldi, a 50-year-old man from the Bedouin town of Khawalad near Haifa, was gunned down on Monday, most likely the result of an ongoing criminal dispute, the police said.\n\nAccording to the Abraham Initiatives organization, which tracks murder statistics in the Arab community, Khaldi\u2019s murder marked the 91st Israeli Arab violent death in 2023, compared to 34 at this time last year.\n\nKhaldi was murdered on the same day that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting with a group of Arab MKs and Arab local council representatives to discuss ways to combat the escalating violence in the Arab community.\n\nThere have been more murders in the Arab sector in the first five months of 2023 than there were in all of 2016 (64), 2017 (75), and 2018 (74). The number of people killed in the Arab community this year is on the trajectory to reach more than 200, far outstripping the worst year of violence when 126 Israeli-Arabs were killed in 2021.\n\nThose numbers are astounding, and the representatives of the Israeli Arab sector are crying out for the government and the police to do something to help them. As the violence spiraled out of control in 2021, the Bennett-Lapid government budgeted some NIS 2.5 billion for the task and drew up a holistic approach to tackle the issue.\n\nPRIME MINISTER Naftali Bennett and Police commissioner Kobi Shabtai examine rifles caught during Operation Ocean last month. (credit: ISRAEL POLICE)\n\nThe plan \u2013 called Safe Track, under the responsibility of the then deputy public security minister Yoav Segalovitz \u2013 included steps aimed at dismantling organized crime, hitting the sources of funds for organized crime, cracking down on arms smuggling, strengthening the governance in the Arab sector, and building trust and increasing cooperation with the Arab local authorities.\n\nIt is a long-term plan that would take time to implement, yet by the end of 2022, the murder rates in the Arab sector had dropped by some 13%.\n\n\u201cMr. Minister, nothing can be done. They murder each other. It\u2019s their nature. It\u2019s the mentality of the Arabs.\u201d Kobi Shabtai to Itamar Ben-Gvir\n\nIsrael's government does not prioritize tackling Arab sector crime\n\nThis trend was halted in its tracks in January. According to a study by Ephraim Lavie, Mohammed Wattad, and Meir Elran of the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), part of the problem is that the current government is not prioritizing the problem.\n\nThe fact that Monday\u2019s meeting with Netanyahu took place only some five months after the government\u2019s formation points to the INSS conclusion.\n\nThe lack of trust in the government of the Arab MKs is understandable. Past statements by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich make it clear that their priorities are the Jewish population of Israel.\n\nIn addition, the distrust deepened when a tape of Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai emerged of him telling Ben-Gvir, \u201cMr. Minister, nothing can be done. They murder each other. It\u2019s their nature. It\u2019s the mentality of the Arabs.\u201d\n\nDespite their apparently well-founded distrust, the MKs from Hadash-Ta\u2019al did meet with Netanyahu, and made it clear that they want the issue to be handled by Netanyahu directly, and not by Ben-Gvir, who earlier in the day, announced that he would appoint a special commissioner to handle crime in the Arab sector.\n\n\u201cIn the view of many and rightly so, the fact that our lives are entrusted to that minister is evidence that the subject [of crime in the Arab community] has been dropped from the government\u2019s scale of priorities, and that has to be changed,\u201d the MKs wrote in the preamble to a 12-point proposal they presented to fight the crime scourge.\n\nRa\u2019am chairman MK Mansour Abbas announced his support for the plan minutes later at a press conference ahead of his party\u2019s weekly meeting, but he later said that the party had decided not to join the meeting with Netanyahu, with fellow Ra\u2019am MK Waleed Taha tweeting, \u201cWe will not take part in a false show by Netanyahu.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Netanyahu agreed to the establishment of a ministerial committee, which he would chair, to fight the growing epidemic of violence and crime in Arab society.\n\nThat\u2019s a positive development, but action now needs to take the place of words. As each day goes by, more Arab citizens of Israel are being killed, and the vast majority of law-abiding, peace-loving members of Israel\u2019s Arab society are living in fear.\n\nIt\u2019s not an Arab problem, it\u2019s a national one. Both the government \u2013 and the police \u2013 need to internalize that, and do something about it now."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/world/middleeast/evictions-jerusalem-israeli-palestinian-conflict-protest.html", "page_content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 In confrontations with Palestinian protesters over the past week in Sheikh Jarrah, a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem, the Israeli police sprayed so much skunk water, a noxious liquid used to deter demonstrators, that its stench lingered over nearby streets.\n\nThe symbolism of the neighborhood extends much further. In the space of a week, Sheikh Jarrah has become the centerpiece of spiking tensions between Israelis and Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and has galvanized Palestinians and their advocates across the world, from the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah and Gaza, to lawmakers and officials in nearby Jordan and faraway Washington.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli Supreme Court is set to decide whether to uphold the eviction of six families from the neighborhood in favor of Jewish settlers. The decades-old legal battle over the fate of a few dozen Palestinians, which Israeli officials dismiss as \u201ca real estate dispute,\u201d has become emblematic of a wider effort to remove thousands of Palestinians from strategic areas in East Jerusalem and a stand-in for the whole decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict."}]}
