He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D. Sewall, a member of the firm.

In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on Easter Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening' in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell and talk with angels, demons and other spirits and the Last Judgment had already occurred the year before, in 1757. For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works\u2014and several more that were unpublished.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}, {"url": "https://uspresidentialhistory.com/arthur-sewall/", "page_content": "OVERVIEW:\n\nBORN:\n\nNovember 25, 1835\n\nBath, Maine\n\nDIED:\n\nSeptember 5, 1900 (age 64)\n\nSmall Point, Maine\n\nPOLITICAL PARTY:\n\nDemocrat\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n1884-1893:\n\nPresident of the Maine Central Railroad\n\n1896:\n\nDemocratic Nominee for Vice President\n\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nMaine Historical Society\n\nMaine Encyclopedia\n\nWikipedia"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7232538/arthur-sewall", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

And with less than a month to go in the Democrats\u2019 primary season, either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders (or possibly both) likely will start researching possible running mates \u2013 if they haven\u2019t already.\n\nPresidential candidates get a lot of public scrutiny during the United States\u2019 extended nominating process, but like dandelions or mushrooms after a spring shower, vice presidential candidates seem to pop up suddenly in the political chatter once a party settles on a presidential nominee. We wondered what sort of people have gotten picked for the second spot on national tickets. To find out, we took a ramble through vice presidential history since 1868 (the first post-Civil War election).\n\nOf the 72 people since then who have been nominated for vice president on a major-party (or significant third-party) ticket, most have had a fair degree of political experience on the national, or at least state, level. A third (24) were U.S. senators at the time of their nomination; two more were former senators. Thirteen were current or former governors; 11 were current or former U.S. representatives, including two incumbent House speakers. Two nominees, in fact, had already served as vice president when they were chosen for another go with new presidential candidates: Adlai Stevenson I in 1900 and Charles W. Fairbanks in 1916. And one nominee, Democrat Thomas A. Hendricks, was on Samuel Tilden\u2019s losing ticket in 1876 but won with Grover Cleveland eight years later, though he only served as vice president for nine months before dying in office.\n\nOnly six vice-presidential nominees had held no prior elective or high appointive office. Two were ex-military leaders, Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay and Navy Adm. James Stockdale; both ran on losing third-party tickets (headed by George Wallace and Ross Perot, respectively). Only twice did the major parties nominate a vice president directly from the private sector: banker and shipbuilder Arthur Sewall (Democrats, 1896) and newspaper publisher Frank Knox (Republicans, 1936); both lost.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most presidential candidates had little or no input into the choice of their running mate. Vice presidents typically were picked by party bigwigs to bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket, or to unify disparate wings of the party. On occasion, though, convention delegates stampeded toward a candidate of their own choosing, as in 1920 when they voted for Calvin Coolidge as Warren Harding\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe relationship between presidential candidates and their running mates in this period was perhaps best, if unintentionally, captured by Rutherford B. Hayes, the GOP nominee in 1876. Upon being informed that the convention had picked Rep. William A. Wheeler of New York for the second spot, Hayes reportedly responded: \u201cI am ashamed to say, who is Wheeler?\u201d\n\nThat began to change in 1940, when Franklin D. Roosevelt sought and won nomination for an unprecedented third term \u2013 sidelining his own vice president, John Nance Garner, who had sought the nomination himself. Roosevelt picked Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace to replace Garner. Although many at the Democratic convention opposed Wallace, Roosevelt threatened to decline the nomination unless he was chosen, and the delegates grudgingly went along. Since then, virtually all presidential nominees have chosen their running mates themselves. (Wallace, incidentally, was the last vice president to have held no prior elective office.)\n\nPresidential nominees occasionally pick one of their defeated rivals to join their ticket. In 1980, for instance, Ronald Reagan selected George H.W. Bush, who had battled him throughout most of the primaries; as recently as 2008, Barack Obama chose then-Sen. Joe Biden, whose brief campaign had ended after the Iowa caucuses. But such moves don\u2019t happen very often: By our count, only 18 of the 72 major vice-presidential nominees since 1868 had sought the presidency themselves in that cycle.\n\nNot that several of them didn\u2019t move into the White House eventually. Eight of the 31 men who have served as vice president since 1868 became president themselves \u2013 six by succession and two (Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush) by election in their own right. Four other vice presidents were nominated for president later on but lost. FDR is the only person who, after having been a losing vice presidential candidate (in 1920), succeeded in winning the top job himself (in 1932).\n\nThe vice presidency long was considered, in the words of a Stevenson biographer, as \u201ca final resting place for has-beens and never-wases.\u201d But even if they didn\u2019t become president or run for the job themselves, many vice presidential candidates have had meaningful political afterlives. Paul Ryan, to take the most recent example, was elected House speaker last fall, almost three years after he and Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election. Joe Lieberman, Al Gore\u2019s running mate in 2000, remained in the Senate another 12 years. Five years before being appointed chief justice, Earl Warren was the bottom half of the infamous 1948 \u201cDewey Defeats Truman\u201d ticket."}, {"url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/2001697077/", "page_content": "More about Copyright and other Restrictions\n\nFor guidance about compiling full citations consult Citing Primary Sources.\n\nRights Advisory : See Rights and Restrictions Information Page\n\n: Reproduction Number : LC-USZC2-6263 (color film copy slide) LC-USZ62-21960 (b&w film copy neg.)\n\n: Call Number : BIOG FILE - Bryan, William Jennings, 1860-1925--Campaign [item] [P&P]\n\n: Access Advisory: ---\n\nObtaining Copies\n\nIf an image is displaying, you can download it yourself.

He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D. Sewall, a member of the firm. Arthur Sewall died at Smallpoint, ME, Sept. 5, 1900.\n\n\n\n[Link]\n\nJOB APPROVAL POLLS\n\nBOOKS Title Purchase Contributor\n\nEVENTS Start Date End Date Type Title Contributor\n\nNEWS Date Category Headline Article Contributor\n\nAdd Your 2\u00a2\n\nAgree\n\nDisagree\n\nLaugh\n\nGroan\n\nTroll\n\nBefuddled\n\nWork Complete\n\nPrediction\n\n[close]\n\nDISCUSSION"}], "Arthur Sewall ran on a ticket with William Jennings Bryan.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1896", "page_content": "The nominations\n\nThe presidential campaign of 1896 was one of the most exciting in American history. The central issue was the country\u2019s money supply. An economic depression had begun in 1893, and public opinion\u2014and even the Democratic Party\u2014was split between those who favoured the gold standard and those who favoured free silver, a type of currency inflation, to help alleviate the depression. Most Republicans, as well as Democratic supporters of Pres. Grover Cleveland, were in favour of the gold standard. Southern and western Democrats and Populists (also known as the People\u2019s Party)\u2014many of them farmers who were suffering financially\u2014vied for free silver, which ultimately helped bring those two parties together.\n\nBritannica Quiz All-American History Quiz\n\nIn June at the Republican national convention in St. Louis, Missouri, former Ohio congressman and governor William McKinley, who was popular in his party for his moderate views on gold and silver, easily won the Republican presidential nomination. Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey was chosen as his running mate after Thomas Reed, who had vied for the presidential ticket, rejected the vice presidential nomination.\n\nAt their convention in Chicago the following month, the Democrats chose magnetic orator and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan. Although he was only 36 years of age, Bryan\u2019s famous \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech (July 8), given in closing debate on the party platform and in favour of including a plank endorsing free silver, so electrified the convention that he was nominated for president, winning on the fifth ballot. His solution for the depressed economy was an \u201ceasy money\u201d policy based on the unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio to gold of 16 to 1. On that platform he also received the nominations of the Populist and National Silver parties. Arthur Sewall, an executive from Maine, was chosen as the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential candidate. The Populists, trying to preserve their party as separate from the Democrats, nominated Thomas E.

He was a dominant force in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, standing three times as its candidate for President of the United States (1896, 1900 and 1908). He served in the United States Congress briefly as a Representative from Nebraska and was the 41st United States Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson, 1913-1916.\n\nBecause of his faith in the goodness and rightness of the common people, he was called \"The Great Commoner.\"\n\nHis presidental platforms included items that were later enacted like the 40-hour work week and child labor laws.\n\nHe was known as a great orator. His famous \"Cross of Gold\" speech at the Democratic Convention in 1896 launched his political career at the age of 36.\n\n\"You shall not press down a crown of thorns on the brow of labor. You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold.\" (Note: Bryan favored a \"silver\" standard versus a \"gold\" standard to back the national currency)\n\nHe energetically attacked Darwinism and evolution, most famously at the Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial in 1925. Five days after winning the case, he died in his sleep. The famous American lawyer, Clarence Darrow, defended teacher John T. Scopes.\n\nBryan was a devout Presbyterian, a supporter of popular democracy, an enemy of gold, banks and railroads, a leader of the silverite movement in the 1890s, a peace advocate, a prohibitionist, and an opponent of Darwinism on religious grounds. With his deep, commanding voice and wide travels, he was one of the best known orators and lecturers of the era.\n\nIn the intensely fought 1896 and 1900 elections, he was defeated by William McKinley but retained control of the Democratic Party. With over 500 speeches in 1896, Bryan invented the national stumping tour, in an era when other presidential candidates stayed home. In his three presidential bids, he promoted Free Silver in 1896, anti-imperialism in 1900, and trust-busting in 1908, calling on Democrats to fight the trusts (big corporations) and big banks, and embrace anti-elitist ideals of republicanism. President Wilson appointed him Secretary of State in 1913, but Wilson's strong demands on Germany after the Lusitania was torpedoed in 1915 caused Bryan to resign in protest.\n\nMember of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nfrom Nebraska's 1st district\n\nIn office\n\nMarch 4, 1891 \u2013 March 3, 1895\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan was the Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States in 1896, 1900 and 1908, a lawyer, and the 41st United States Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson. One of the most popular speakers in American history, he was noted for a deep, commanding voice. Bryan was a devout Presbyterian, a supporter of popular democracy, a critic of banks and railroads, a leader of the silverite movement in the 1890s, a leading figure in the Democratic Party, a peace advocate, a prohibitionist, an opponent of Darwinism, and one of the most prominent leaders of populism in the late 19th - and early 20th century. Because of his faith in the goodness and rightness of the common people, he was called \"The Great Commoner.\"\n\nIn the intensely fought 1896 and 1900 elections, he was defeated by William McKinley but retained control of the Democratic Party. For presidential candidates, Bryan invented the national stumping tour. In his three presidential bids, he promoted Free Silver in 1896, anti-imperialism in 1900, and trust-busting in 1908, calling on Democrats, in cases where corporations are protected, to abandon states' rights, to fight the trusts and big banks, and embrace populist ideas. President Woodrow Wilson appointed him Secretary of State in 1913, but Wilson's handling of the Lusitania crisis in 1915 caused Bryan to resign in protest.\n\nHe was a strong supporter of Prohibition in the 1920s, and energetically attacked Darwinism and evolution, most famously at the Scopes Trial in 1925. Five days after winning the case but getting bad press, he died in his sleep.\n\nThe son of Silas and Mariah Elizabeth Bryan, Bryan was born in the Little Egypt region of southern Illinois on March 19, 1860.\n\nBryan's mother was born of English heritage. Mary Bryan joined the Salem Baptists in 1872, so Bryan attended Methodist services on Sunday morning, and in the afternoon, Baptist services. At this point, William began spending his Sunday afternoons at the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. At age 14 in 1874, Bryan attended a revival, was baptized, and joined the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. In later life, Bryan said the day of his baptism was the most important day in his life, but, at the time it caused little change in his daily routine. He left the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and joined the larger Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. His father Silas was born of Scots-Irish and English stock in St.Croix.[3] As a Jacksonian Democrat, Silas won election as a Democrat to the Illinois State Senate. The year of Bryan's birth, his father lost his seat, but shortly won election as a state circuit judge.\n\nThe family moved to a 520-acre farm north of Salem in 1866, living in a ten-room house that was the envy of Marion County.\n\nUntil age ten, Bryan was home-schooled, finding in the Bible and McGuffey Readers support for his views that gambling and liquor were evil and sinful. To attend Whipple Academy, which was attached to Illinois College, 14-year-old Bryan was sent to Jacksonville in 1874.\n\nFollowing high school, he entered Illinois College and studied classics, graduating as valedictorian in 1881. During his time at Illinois College, Bryan was a member of the Sigma Pi literary society, and later initiated the Nebraska Chapter of the Acacia Fraternity. To study law at Union Law College (which later became Northwestern University School of Law), he moved to Chicago. While preparing for the bar exam, he taught high school. While teaching, he eventually married pupil Mary Elizabeth Baird in 1884. They settled in Salem, Illinois, a town with a population of two thousand.\n\nMary became a lawyer and collaborated with him on all his speeches and writings. He practiced law in Jacksonville (1883\u201387), then moved to the boom city of Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nIn the Democratic landslide of 1890, Bryan was elected to Congress and reelected by 140 votes in 1892. He ran for the Senate in 1894, but was overwhelmed in the Republican landslide.\n\nIn Bryan's first years in Lincoln, he traveled to Valentine, Nebraska on business where he met an aspiring young cattleman named James Dahlman. Over the next forty years they remained friends, with Dahlman carrying Nebraska for Bryan twice while he was state Democratic Party chairman. Even when Dahlman became closely associated with Omaha's vice elements, including the breweries, as the city's eight-term mayor, he and Bryan maintained a collegial relationship.[5]\n\nFirst campaign for the White House: 1896 -\n\nIn 1893, the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act resulted in the collapse of the silver market. Bryan stumped the country for free silver in 1894-96, building a grass roots reputation as a powerful champion of the cause.\n\nAt the 1896 Democratic National Convention, Bryan lambasted Eastern monied classes for supporting the gold standard at the expense of the average worker. His \"Cross of Gold\" speech made him a sensational new face in the Democratic party.\n\nThe Bourbon Democrats who supported incumbent conservative President Grover Cleveland were defeated and the party's agrarian and silver factions voted for Bryan, giving him the nomination of the Democratic Party. At the age of 36, Bryan remains the youngest presidential nominee of a major party in American history.\n\nDisappointed with the direction of their party, Gold Democrats invited Cleveland to run as a third-party candidate, but he declined this offer. Cleveland did, however, support John M. Palmer, nominee of the Gold Democrats, rather than Bryan.[6]\n\nIn addition, Bryan formally received the nominations of the Populist Party and the Silver Republican Party. Without crossing party lines, voters from any party could vote for him.[7] In 1896 the Populists rejected Bryan's Democratic running mate Maine banker Arthur Sewall and named as his running mate Georgia Representative Thomas E. Watson. People could vote for Bryan and Sewell or for Bryan and Watson.\n\nThe Republicans nominated William McKinley on a platform calling for prosperity for everyone through industrial growth, high tariffs and sound money (gold). Republicans ridiculed Bryan as a Populist. However, \"Bryan's reform program was so similar to that of the Populists that he has often been mistaken for a Populist, but he remained a staunch Democrat throughout the Populist period.\"[8] This is because, despite having used many of the Populist ideas, Bryan kept all of his Democratic views while simply adding the Populist views to gain their votes.\n\nBryan demanded Bimetallism and \"Free Silver\" at a ratio of 16:1. Most leading Democratic newspapers rejected his candidacy. However, despite this rejection by the newspapers, Bryan won the Democratic vote.\n\nRepublicans discovered in August that Bryan was solidly ahead in the South and West, but far behind in the Northeast. He appeared to be ahead in the Midwest, so the Republicans concentrated their efforts there. They said Bryan was a madman\u2014a religious fanatic surrounded by anarchists\u2014who would wreck the economy.[9] By late September, the Republicans felt they were ahead in the decisive Midwest and began emphasizing that McKinley would bring prosperity to all Americans. McKinley scored solid gains among the middle classes, factory and railroad workers, prosperous farmers and among the German Americans who rejected free silver. Bryan gave 500 speeches in 27 states. McKinley won by a margin of 271 to 176 in the electoral college.\n\nBryan volunteered for combat in the Spanish-American War in 1898, arguing, \"Universal peace cannot come until justice is enthroned throughout the world. Until the right has triumphed in every land and love reigns in every heart, government must, as a last resort, appeal to force.\" Bryan became colonel of a Nebraska militia regiment; he spent the war in Florida and never saw combat. After the war, Bryan opposed the annexation of the Philippines (though he did support the Treaty of Paris that ended the war). Bryan gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in 1900 called \"The Paralyzing Influence of Imperialism.\" In this speech he discusses his views against the annexation of the Philippines, asking what gives the United States the right to overpower people of another country just for a military base. He mentions, at the beginning of the speech, that the United States should not try to be like the Imperialistic British and other European countries.\n\nPresidential election of 1900:\n\nHe ran as an anti-imperialist, finding himself in alliance with Andrew Carnegie and other millionaires. Republicans mocked Bryan as indecisive, or a coward, a point spoofed by the Bryan-like Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in spring 1900.\n\nBryan combined anti-imperialism with free silver, saying:\n\nThe nation is of age and it can do what it pleases; it can spurn the traditions of the past; it can repudiate the principles upon which the nation rests; it can employ force instead of reason; it can substitute might for right; it can conquer weaker people; it can exploit their lands, appropriate their property and kill their people; but it cannot repeal the moral law or escape the punishment decreed for the violation of human rights.\n\nIn a typical day he gave four hourlong speeches and shorter talks that added up to six hours of speaking. At an average rate of 175 words a minute, he turned out 63,000 words, enough to fill 52 columns of a newspaper. In Wisconsin, he once made 12 speeches in 15 hours. Before Bryan held any political office there remained a need for income; public speaking would not become any less of a passion as it also became a source of income for Bryan and his family. Bryan held an estate in Nebraska as well as a 240-acre ranch in Texas, of which both were paid for with earnings from publications of The Commoner as well as speaking fees. Bryan's rates were noted as $500.00 per speech in addition to a percentage of the ticket sales profit. He held his base in the South, but lost part of the West as McKinley retained the Northeast and Midwest and rolled up a landslide. McKinley won the electoral college with a count of 292 votes compared to Bryan's 155. This means that Bryan actually lost more states than he had in 1896.\n\nPresidential election of 1908:\n\nThe 1908 election was Bryan\u2019s third attempt at gaining the presidency. The Democrats nominated Bryan by wide margin at the Democratic convention held in Denver and decided on John Kern, a politician from Indiana, to be his running mate. Bryan ran against the Republicans, and Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s hand-picked nominee William Howard Taft.\n\nThe GOP ran its campaign on the benefits of the Roosevelt administration, creation of a postal service, continuation of \u201cSound Currency\u201d, citizenship for Puerto Rico inhabitants, regulation on big business, and tariff revision in protectionist mode.\n\nBryan and the Democrats\u2019 platform denounced the wrongs done by the Republican party: Congress spent too much money; Roosevelt hand picked Taft in undemocratic fashion; Republicans wanted centralization; Republicans favored monopolies. In response, Bryan unleashed the slogan, \u201cShall the People Rule?\u201d In a time of peace and prosperity, and Republican trust-busting, Bryan fared poorly among the voters. He lost the electoral collage 321 to 162, his worst defeat yet, and did not carry any of the states in the Northeast.\n\nFor the next 25 years, Bryan was the most popular Chautauqua speaker, delivering thousands of paid speeches in towns across the land, even while serving as secretary of state. He mostly spoke about religion but covered a wide variety of topics. His most popular lecture (and his personal favorite) was a lecture entitled \"The Prince of Peace\" which stressed that religion was the solid foundation of morality, and individual and group morality was the foundation for peace and equality. Another famous lecture from this period, \"The Value of an Ideal\", was a stirring call to public service.\n\nIn 1905 speech, Bryan warned: \"The Darwinian theory represents man reaching his present perfection by the operation of the law of hate \u2014 the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak. If this is the law of our development then, if there is any logic that can bind the human mind, we shall turn backward to the beast in proportion as we substitute the law of love. I choose to believe that love rather than hatred is the law of development.\"\n\nBryan threw himself into the work of the Social Gospel. Bryan served on organizations containing a large number of theological liberals: he sat on the temperance committee of the Federal Council of Churches and on the general committee of the short-lived Interchurch World Movement.\n\nBryan founded a weekly magazine, The Commoner, calling on Democrats to dissolve the trusts, regulate the railroads more tightly and support the Progressive Movement. He regarded prohibition as a \"local\" issue and did not endorse it until 1910. In London in 1906, he presented a plan to the Inter-Parliamentary Peace Conference for arbitration of disputes that he hoped would avert warfare. He tentatively called for nationalization of the railroads, then backtracked and called only for more regulation. His party nominated Bourbon Democrat Alton B. Parker in 1904, who lost to Roosevelt. For two years following this defeat, Bryan would pursue his public speaking ventures on an international stage. From 1904-1906, Bryan travelled globally; spreading the Word of God, sightseeing with his wife Mary, lecturing, and all while escaping the political upheaval in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor supporting Woodrow Wilson for the presidency in 1912, he was appointed as Secretary of State. However, Wilson only nominally consulted Bryan and made all the major foreign policy decisions. Bryan negotiated 28 treaties that promised arbitration of disputes before war broke out between the signatory countries and the United States. Bryan had made several attempts to negotiate a treaty with Germany but ultimately was never able to succeed. In the civil war in Mexico in 1914, Bryan supported American military intervention.\n\nWilson's desire to enter the war in Europe brought him to odds with Bryan and eventually led to Bryan's resignation in June 1915 over Wilson's demands for \"strict accountability for any infringement of [American] rights, intentional or incidental.\"\n\nDespite their differences, Bryan campaigned as a private citizen for Wilson's reelection in 1916. When war was declared in April 1917, Bryan wrote Wilson, \"Believing it to be the duty of the citizen to bear his part of the burden of war and his share of the peril, I hereby tender my services to the Government. Please enroll me as a private whenever I am needed and assign me to any work that I can do.\" Wilson, however, did not allow 57-year-old Bryan to rejoin the military and did not offer him any wartime role.\n\nBryan campaigned for the Constitutional amendments on prohibition and women's suffrage. Partly to avoid Nebraska ethnics such as the German-Americans who were \"wet\" and opposed to prohibition, Bryan moved to Coconut Grove in Miami, Florida. Bryan filled lucrative speaking engagements, including playing the part of spokesman for George E. Merrick's new planned community Coral Gables, addressing large crowds across a Venetian pool for an annual salary of over $100,000. He was also extremely active in Christian organizations. Bryan refused to support the party's presidential nominee James M. Cox in 1920, because he deemed Cox not dry enough. As one biographer explains,\n\n\u201c Bryan epitomized the prohibitionist viewpoint: Protestant and nativist, hostile to the corporation and the evils of urban civilization, devoted to personal regeneration and the social gospel, he sincerely believed that prohibition would contribute to the physical health and moral improvement of the individual, stimulate civic progress, and end the notorious abuses connected with the liquor traffic. Hence he became interested when its devotees in Nebraska viewed direct legislation as\n\nBryan's national campaigning helped Congress pass the 18th Amendment in 1918, which shut down all saloons as of 1920. But while prohibition was in effect, Bryan did not work to secure better enforcement. He opposed a highly controversial resolution at the 1924 convention condemning the Ku Klux Klan, expecting it would soon fold. Bryan disliked the KKK but never publicly attacked it. For the nomination in 1924, he opposed the wet Al Smith; Bryan's brother, Nebraska Governor Charles W. Bryan, was put on the ticket with John W. Davis as candidate for vice president to keep the Bryanites in line. Bryan was very close to his younger brother Charles and endorsed him for the vice presidency.\n\nBryan was the chief proponent of the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, the precursor to our modern War on Drugs. However, he argued for the act's passage more as an international obligation than on moral grounds.\n\nBefore World War I, Bryan believed moral progress could achieve equality at home and, in the international field, peace between all the world's nations.\n\nBryan opposed Darwinism for two reasons. First he believed that what he considered a materialistic account of the descent of man through evolution undermined the Bible. Second, he saw neo-Darwinism or Social Darwinism as a great evil force in the world promoting hatreds and conflicts, especially the World War.\n\nIn his famous Chautauqua lecture, \"The Prince of Peace,\" Bryan warned the theory of evolution could undermine the foundations of morality. However, he concluded, \"While I do not accept the Darwinian theory I shall not quarrel with you about it.\"\n\nOne book Bryan read at this time convinced him that neo-Darwinism (emphasizing the struggle of the races) had undermined morality in Germany. Bryan was heavily influenced by Vernon Kellogg's 1917 book, Headquarters Nights: A Record of Conversations and Experiences at the Headquarters of the German Army in Belgium and France, which asserted (on the basis of a conversation with a reserve officer named Professor von Flussen) that German intellectuals were social Darwinists totally committed to might-makes-right.\n\nBryan also read The Science of Power (1918) by British social theorist Benjamin Kidd, which attributed the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche to German nationalism, materialism, and militarism which in turn was the outworking of the social Darwinian hypothesis.[24]\n\nIn 1920, Bryan told the World Brotherhood Congress the theory of evolution was \"the most paralyzing influence with which civilization has had to deal in the last century\" and that Nietzsche, in carrying the theory of evolution to its logical conclusion, \"promulgated a philosophy that condemned democracy... denounced Christianity... denied the existence of God, overturned all concepts of morality... and endeavored to substitute the worship of the superhuman for the worship of Jehovah.\"\n\nBy 1921, Bryan saw Darwinism as a major internal threat to the US. The major study which seemed to convince Bryan of this was James H. Leuba's The Belief in God and Immortality, a Psychological, Anthropological and Statistical Study (1916). In this study, Leuba shows that during four years of college a considerable number of college students lost their faith. Bryan was horrified that the next generation of American leaders might have the degraded sense of morality which he believed had prevailed in Germany and caused the Great War. Bryan then launched an anti-evolution campaign.\n\nThe campaign kicked off in October 1921, when Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Virginia invited Bryan to deliver the James Sprunt Lectures. The heart of the lectures was a lecture entitled \"The Origin of Man\", in which Bryan asked, \"what is the role of man in the universe and what is the purpose of man?\" For Bryan, the Bible was absolutely central to answering this question, and moral responsibility and the spirit of brotherhood could only rest on belief in God.\n\nThe Sprunt lectures were published as In His Image, and sold over 100,000 copies, while \"The Origin of Man\" was published separately as The Menace of the theory of evolution and also sold very well.\n\nBryan was worried that the theory of evolution was making grounds not only in the universities, but also within the church itself. Many colleges were still church-affiliated at this point. The developments of 19th century liberal theology, and higher criticism in particular, had left the door open to the point where many clergymen were willing to embrace the theory of evolution and claimed that it was not contradictory with their being Christians. Determined to put an end to this, Bryan, who had long served as a Presbyterian elder, decided to run for the position of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, which was at the time embroiled in the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy. (Under Presbyterian church governance, clergy and laymen are equally represented in the General Assembly, and the post of Moderator is open to any member of General Assembly.) Bryan's main competition in the race was the Rev. Charles F. Wishart, president of the College of Wooster, who had loudly endorsed the teaching of the theory of evolution in the college. Bryan lost to Wishart by a vote of 451-427. Bryan then failed in a proposal to cut off funds to schools where the theory of evolution was taught. Instead, the General Assembly announced disapproval of materialistic (as opposed to theistic) evolution.\n\nAccording to author Ronald L. Numbers, Bryan was not nearly as much of a fundamentalist as many modern-day creationists, and is more accurately described as a \"day-age creationist\":\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, the much misunderstood leader of the post\u2013World War I antievolution crusade, not only read the Mosaic \u201cdays\u201d as geological \u201cages\u201d but allowed for the possibility of organic evolution\u2014 so long as it did not impinge on the supernatural origin of Adam and Eve.\n\nIn addition to his unsuccessful advocacy of banning the teaching of evolution in church-run universities, Bryan also actively lobbied for state laws banning public schools from teaching evolution. The legislatures of several southern states proved more receptive to his anti-evolution message than the Presbyterian Church had, and passed laws banning the teaching of evolution in public schools after Bryan addressed them. A prominent example was the Butler Act of 1925, making it unlawful in Tennessee to teach that mankind evolved from lower life forms.\n\nBryan's participation in the highly publicized 1925 Scopes Trial served as a capstone to his career. He was asked by William Bell Riley to represent the World Christian Fundamentals Association as counsel at the trial. During the trial, Bryan took the stand and was questioned by defense lawyer Clarence Darrow about his views on the Bible. He was asked questions with no known answers, such as the population of China 5000 years ago (which the Bible does not address) and if the fish in the sea were drowned in the flood. The questions were designed to force him to admit that he did not know, or to guess wildly, or to add questionable explanations to things of the Bible.\n\nThe national media reported the trial in great detail, with H. L. Mencken using Bryan as a symbol of Southern ignorance (despite his not being from the South) and anti-intellectualism. In a more humorous vein, satirist Richard Armour stated in It All Started With Columbus that Darrow had \"made a monkey out of\" Bryan due to Bryan's ignorance of the Bible.\n\nAfter the judge retroactively expunged all of Bryan's answers to Darrow's questions, both sides closed without summation. The jury quickly returned a guilty verdict with the defense's encouragement, as their aim was to take the law itself to a higher court in order to challenge its constitutionality. However, the state supreme court reversed the verdict on a technicality and Scopes went free.\n\nBiologist Stephen Jay Gould has speculated that Bryan's anti-evolution views were a result of his Populist idealism and suggests that Bryan's fight was really against eugenics. However, the biographers, especially Michael Kazin, reject that conclusion, based on Bryan's failure during the trial or at any other time to attack eugenics; Kazin notes that there is a section on eugenics in Civic Biology, which was the biology textbook Scopes was in trouble for using.\n\nImmediately after the trial, Bryan continued to edit and deliver speeches, traveling hundreds of miles that week. On Sunday, July 26, 1925, he drove from Chattanooga to Dayton to attend a church service, ate a meal and died (the result of diabetes and fatigue) in his sleep that afternoon \u2014 just five days after the Scopes trial ended. School Superintendent Walter White proposed that Dayton should create a Christian college as a lasting memorial to Bryan; fund raising was successful and Bryan College opened in 1930. Bryan is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His tombstone reads \"He kept the Faith.\" He was survived by among others, a daughter, Congresswoman Ruth Bryan Owen and her son (by artist William Homer Leavitt) John Bryan Leavitt and daughter Ruth Leavitt, as well as two children by her second husband, Royal British Engineers officer Reginald A. Owen.\n\nInherit the Wind, a 1955 play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, is a fictionalized account of the Scopes Trial written in response to McCarthyism. A populist thrice-defeated Presidential candidate from Nebraska named Matthew Harrison Brady comes to a small town named Hillsboro in the Deep South to help prosecute a young teacher for teaching Darwin to his schoolchildren. He is opposed by a famous trial lawyer, Henry Drummond, and chastised by a cynical newspaperman as the trial assumes a national profile. Critics of the play charge that it mischaracterizes Bryan and the trial.\n\nBryan also appears as a character in Douglas Moore's 1956 opera, The Ballad of Baby Doe and is briefly mentioned in John Steinbeck's East of Eden. His death is referred to in Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Bryan was also mentioned on the May 23, 2007 episode of The Daily Show when fictional comedian Geoffrey Foxworthington (an early 20th century parody of Jeff Foxworthy) quotes, \"If your dream Vice President is William Jennings Bryan, you might be a puzzlewit.\" In Robert A. Heinlein's Job: A Comedy of Justice, Bryan's unsuccessful or successful runs for the presidency are seen as the 'splitting off' events of the alternate histories through which the protagonists travel.\n\nThe sheer volume of political propaganda cartoons featuring Bryan is a testament to the amusement and fear he caused among conservatives. Bryan campaigned tirelessly championing the ideas of the farmers and workers, using his skills as a famed orator to ultimately reshape the Democratic Party into a more progressive one. These political cartoons attacked just about every facet of Bryan\u2019s character and policy. They mocked his religious fervor, his campaign slogans, and even his ability to unify parties for a common cause. As Keen puts it, \u201cThe art of propaganda is to create a portrait that incarnates the idea of what we wish to destroy so we will react rather than think, and automatically focus our free-floating hostility, indistinct frustrations, and unnamed fears\u201d.[33] Bryan embodied these fears of the Republican Party which is clearly evident in the lengths they went to deface his character in these cartoons.\n\nThe most notable cartoons are of Bryan illustrated as a snake, representing Populism, swallowing a donkey, symbolizing the Democratic Party. Another notable Bryan cartoon is one where he is standing atop a Bible, marketing the sales of a \"crown of thorns\" and a \"cross of gold\" both referencing \"The Cross of Gold\" his most popular speech. Other cartoons can analyze overall judgments of Bryan\u2019s continuous failure to win the Presidential Election and Bryan can be seen as some sort of puppet or smaller figure in comparison to other presidential elect opponents.\n\nBryan had an unusually high number of nicknames given to him in his lifetime; most of these were given by his loyal admirers in the Democratic Party. In addition to his best-known nickname, \"The Great Commoner\", he was also called \"The Silver Knight of the West\" (due to his support of the free silver issue) and the \"Boy Orator of the Platte\" (a reference to his oratorical skills and his home near the Platte River in Nebraska). A derisive nickname given by journalist H.L. Mencken, a prominent Bryan critic, was \"The Fundamentalist Pope\", a reference to Bryan's devout religious views.\n\nStatue of Bryan on the lawn of the Rhea County, Tennessee courthouse in Dayton, Tennessee.Kazin (2006) considers Bryan the first of the 20th century \"celebrity politicians\" better known for their personalities and communications skills than their political views. Shannon Jones (2006) on a Socialist website claims Bryan never took a principled stand against white supremacy in the Southern United States. Alan Wolfe has concluded that Bryan's \"legacy remains complicated\". Form and content mix uneasily in Bryan's politics. The content of his speeches leads in a direct line to the progressive reforms adopted by 20th century Democrats. But the form his actions took was a romantic invocation of the American past, a populist insistence on the wisdom of ordinary folk, and a faith-based insistence on sincerity and character.\n\nIn \"They Also Ran\", Irving Stone criticized Bryan as a person who was egocentric and never admitted wrong. Stone mentioned how Bryan lived a sheltered life and therefore could not feel the suffering of the common man. He speculated that Bryan merely acted as a champion of common men in order to get their votes. Stone mentioned that none of Bryan's ideas were original and that he did not have the brains to be an effective president. Stone personally believed Bryan to be one of the nation's worst Secretaries of State. He also feared that Bryan would have supported many radical religious blue laws. Stone felt that Bryan had one of the most undisciplined minds of the 19th century and that McKinley, Roosevelt, and Taft all made better presidents.\n\nHowever, a number of prominent personalities have also defended Bryan and his legacy. In 1962 the journalist Merle Miller interviewed former President Harry Truman. When asked about Bryan, Truman replied that he [Bryan] \"was a great one \u2014 one of the greatest\". Truman also claimed that, in his opinion, \"if it wasn't for old Bill Bryan there wouldn't be any liberalism at all in the country now. Bryan kept liberalism alive, he kept it going.\" In 1900 Truman, then aged 16, had served as a page to the Democratic National Convention in Kansas City. There he had heard Bryan give a speech to the convention's delegates and was deeply impressed. In his biography of Truman, the historian David McCullough wrote that in 1900 Truman and his father \"declared themselves thorough 'Bryan men'...Bryan remained an idol for Harry, as the voice of the common man\". Tom L. Johnson, the famed progressive mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, referred to Bryan's campaign in 1896 as \"the first great struggle of the masses in our country against the privileged classes\". In a 1934 speech dedicating a memorial to Bryan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said \"I think that we would choose the word 'sincerity' as fitting him [Bryan] most of all...it was that sincerity that served him so well in his life-long fight against sham and privilege and wrong. It was that sincerity which made him a force for good in his own generation and kept alive many of the ancient faiths on which we are building today. We...can well agree that he fought the good fight; that he finished the course; and that he kept the faith.\"\n\nBryan was truly one of the greatest speakers of his time, and he became a fixture of the Democratic party and a hero to the common man. He is normally not credited enough for bringing the Democratic party together to make it into the strongest it could be. Even though he only advocated for the rights of white men, he still could not stop his message from reaching all common people of the nation. Starting with his Cross of Gold speech, Bryan brought the populist party into the Democratic, and with his common man message he would inevitably draw the African-American and feminist vote into the party. Bryan became the bridge that brought different factions into the party, and paved for liberal democrats like Franklin D. Roosevelt with his New Deal legislation. He changed the tide of the party, and arguably the party might not be a party of the common people without him.\n\nBryan has been criticized and credited for many things throughout his life. One action that earned Bryan credit and criticism is \u201csaving\u201d or turning the Democratic Party around; thus paving the way for the party in the future. He achieved this by taking populist view points and incorporated them into the already established Democratic beliefs. He was highly criticized for doing this by some, and was even accused of (and still is by some scholars) not have any original thoughts; however ironically he had the \u201coriginal\u201d thought to take the already established views and make them his own, ultimately \u201cre-vamping\u201d a dying party. Bryan took ideas from the Populist Rebellion, such as the notions of unlimited coinage of gold and silver, public ownership of the railroad, and government control of debt and credit; and infused them into the already established Democratic Party. He argued that he was a \u201ccommon\u201d man and worked for the laborers, with a main goal of protection of the majority from the oppression of the minority. One minority that he at times he supported and at other times ignored were the African Americans of the time. During his presidential campaigns of 1896 and 1900 he said little if anything about the \u201ccruel and unequal treatment of black Americans, even when it was a vital matter for his audiences\u201d. While he publicly condemned lynchings and quietly courted African Americans in the North, he at the same time defended his Southern allies who supported \u201csuffrage qualifications\u201d that were designed to favor whites over African Americans. Perhaps his reasoning for this \u201cfence hopping\u201d could be credited to the fact that most of his supporters came from densely white populated areas, who held negative views about African Americans. Despite Bryan\u2019s many criticisms, he is credited with turning around an entire political party, something that does not happen often.\n\nBryan County, Oklahoma was named after him. Bryan Memorial Hospital (now BryanLGH Medical Center) of Lincoln, Nebraska, and Bryan College located in Dayton, Tennessee, are also named for William Jennings Bryan. The William Jennings Bryan House in Nebraska was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1963. The Bryan Home Museum is a by-appointment only museum at his birthplace in Salem, Illinois. Salem is also home to Bryan Park and a large statue of Bryan.

A devout Protestant, his populist rhetoric and policies earned him the nickname \u201cthe Great Commoner.\u201d In his later years, Bryan campaigned against the teaching of evolution in public schools, culminating with his leading role in the Scopes Trial .\n\nEarly Life and Political Career\n\nBryan was born on March 19, 1860 in the small town of Salem, Illinois. His father, Silas, was a dedicated Jacksonian Democrat and a successful lawyer who served in various local elected positions and passed on his politics to his son. After graduating from Illinois College, Bryan earned a law degree from the Union College of Law in Chicago in 1883. He was admitted to the Illinois bar and began practicing law in Jacksonville, marrying Mary Elizabeth Baird in 1884; the couple went on to have three children.\n\nIn 1887, Bryan moved to the fast-growing state of Nebraska, where he settled in Lincoln and established a thriving law practice. At the outset of the 1890s, with drought destroying the livelihoods of many American farmers, the People\u2019s Party (also known as the Populist Party) was growing as a force in U.S. politics by appealing to small farmers, shopkeepers and other less wealthy voters. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1890, when he was just 30 years old, Bryan championed populist causes including the direct election of senators, graduated federal income tax and the \u201cfree silver\u201d movement, which sought to expand the federal money supply by basing U.S. currency on silver as well as gold.\n\n\u2018Cross of Gold\u2019 Speech and Election of 1896\n\nSet off by the collapse of the powerful Philadelphia & Reading Railroad, the Panic of 1893 plunged the nation into a deep economic depression. In August 1893, Bryan earned admiration from free silverites with his three-hour speech in Congress decrying President Grover Cleveland\u2019s (ultimately successful) effort to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 and again tie U.S. currency to the gold standard. After running unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1894, Bryan returned to Nebraska and became editor of the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nIn 1896, Bryan captivated the audience at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago with a passionate oration urging his countrymen to stand up for the common man against big business interests and support free silver. To those who cling to the gold standard, he declared in closing: \u201cYou shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\u201d\n\nThe day after his \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech, Bryan won the Democratic presidential nomination; he also won the support of the Populist and National Silver parties. He campaigned relentlessly, traveling around the country and giving hundreds of speeches to millions of people, while his Republican opponent, Ohio Governor William McKinley, stayed home and gave speeches from his porch. But McKinley\u2019s victory was fueled by a massive influx of campaign cash from Wall Street bankers and other wealthy business interests, all determined to crush Bryan\u2019s radical brand of populism.\n\nProgressivism and Pacifism\n\nNow among the most famous politicians in the country, Bryan would run twice more for president, losing again to McKinley in 1900 and to William Howard Taft in 1908. Rather than continue the free silver battle, he dedicated himself to opposing American imperialism, which he saw as immoral and undemocratic. He also argued in support of a graduated income tax, antitrust laws and other government regulation of business, women\u2019s suffrage and the prohibition of alcohol. Despite his electoral losses, Bryan continued to exert considerable influence through his fervently religious speeches as well as a weekly magazine, the Commoner.\n\nAfter Bryan helped rally support behind Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential election, Wilson chose the now-elder Democratic statesman as his secretary of state. Bryan\u2019s pacifist stance put him increasingly at odds with the president, however, and he resigned in 1915 in protest after Wilson sent a second note to Germany demanding an end to submarine warfare after the sinking of the Lusitania, an action Bryan felt went too far toward violating American neutrality.\n\nAnti-Evolution Crusade, Scopes Trial and Death\n\nThough he continued to publicly oppose U.S. involvement in World War I after his resignation, Bryan changed course after the nation entered the conflict in 1917 due to extensive popular support for the war effort. For the last decade of his life, he largely dedicated himself to reforming the nation\u2019s moral and religious character. At the center of these efforts was a campaign to end the teaching of evolution in public schools.\n\nAs an evangelical Christian and a believer in the literal interpretation of the Bible, Bryan also saw a grave threat in the application of Charles Darwin\u2019s theory to human society. He argued that children being taught the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d would in time stop caring about the poor and otherwise needier members of the population. Bryan\u2019s inability to differentiate between social Darwinism and the scientific theory of evolution galvanized his more fundamentalist, religious supporters but earned him the disdain of many others who shared his progressive politics.\n\nIn 1925, high school biology teacher John Scopes went on trial in Tennessee as a test of the first state law banning the teaching of evolution. Bryan signed on as chief prosecutor, facing off against the criminal defense attorney Clarence Darrow. The Scopes \u201cmonkey trial\u201d in Dayton, Tennessee, played out under the national spotlight, with journalists, religious leaders and onlookers crowding the courtroom. After the defense called Bryan himself as an expert on the Bible, Darrow subjected him to a brutal examination in the sweltering courtroom, revealing his lack of theological as well as scientific knowledge.\n\nThe jury predictably found Scopes guilty, but Bryan\u2019s performance in the trial, and his thrashing in the national press, marked a less than stellar end to his long career as a public figure. On July 26, 1925, five days after the verdict was issued, Bryan died in his sleep after suffering a stroke. His widow accompanied his body in a special train car to Washington, where he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nSources\n\nJill Lepore. These Truths: A History of the United States. (W.W.

They hoped at the very least to win Mississippi\u2019s electoral votes. In the case that neither McKinley nor Bryan obtained an electoral majority, Catchings hoped to become kingmaker. Bryan considered campaigning in the South, but realized that the Midwest was more important. He could rely on his many Southern supporters along with Milford Howard to campaign there on his behalf. Eugene Debs spent most of his time in the larger cities of the Midwest. His arguments were simple; silver has not helped the proletariat, reestablishing the gold standard will not help either, the workers can only be freed by overthrowing capitalism. He argued \u201cwhat difference does it make to the toiling masses, whether the President is a puppet of the gold mine owners or a puppet of the silver mine owners? Neither will be your friend!\u201d While many were convinced by Debs, the majority of American workers rejected his message, hoping that either major party had the answers to improve the economy.In August, a poll was done of several states that were deemed important in the upcoming election. This meant large states and states that were close in 1896. Public opinion polls were much less common and much less advanced at this time than they are today, but they existed. This poll was an aggregate of various local straw polls. The results were disheartening for Democrats to say the least. McKinley was projected to win Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Iowa. But these were states he already won in 1896. He also was projected to win Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, California, and Oregon, states that voted for Bryan four years earlier. Bryan was projected to win Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, and South Dakota. The only silver lining was that North Dakota, which voted for McKinley in 1896, was now projected to vote for Bryan.But the campaign was far from over. Victory in 1900 would hinge on one factor: turnout. Bryan could count on high turnout from his supporters. For Republicans, things were more complicated. Yes, Bryan was not extremely popular in urban areas, but that didn\u2019t mean they would turn out for McKinley in large numbers. Republicans had a difficult time getting people excited to vote for their candidate. This was contrasted with the undying energy of William Jennings Bryan, who gave speeches with the same passion that was present in 1896. McKinley was seen by many as stale and as the candidate for the rich, while Bryan seemed to genuinely care about the plight of the common man. In addition, many of the attacks on Bryan had lost their luster. After the Cuban War it was hard to portray him as weak. And while bimetallism wasn\u2019t off to great start, the doom and gloom predictions of complete financial collapse didn\u2019t come true either.-Excerpt fromby Benjamin Buckley, Harvard Press, 1999.1: Faithless elector from Mississippi2: Mostly the Prohibition Party"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Arthur-Sewall/6000000004565891749", "page_content": "About Arthur Sewall\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Sewall-171\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7232538\n\nWilliam J.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896.\n\nArthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nHis main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee.\n\nSewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900.\n\nSewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked \"the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896.\""}, {"url": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/01/13/atonement-the-story-of-jurist-samuel-sewall/", "page_content": "By undergoing seismic change, many men and women have repeatedly disproved F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s assertion that there are no second acts in American lives. In the case of Samuel Sewall, his later years turned out to be an act of contrition.\n\nSewall, the devout and prosperous Puritan whose diligently kept and richly detailed diary gives us an unrivaled view of life in Colonial New England in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, would be the first to agree that his role as a judge in the Salem witch trials called for heavy penance.\n\nIn her affectionate and affecting retelling of Sewall\u2019s story, Eve LaPlante, a direct descendant of the jurist, offers us a refreshing contrast to the recurrent political theater of our time, when public men caught in flagrant abuses of power trot out self-serving evasions. Instead of the selective amnesia of Alberto Gonzalez and the spread-the-blame-around passive voice of \u201cMistakes were made,\u201d we can contemplate the rewarding if painful process of a man assuming full and sole responsibility for a terrible mistake.\n\nIn the paranoid summer of 1692, Sewall joined the other trial judges in a special court in condemning 20 men and women to death for witchcraft. Nineteen were hanged and one subjected to the barbaric cruelty of being pressed to death under heavy stones. The evidence was flimsy, often absurd, and the Salem witch case would forever stand as an emblem of state injustice.\n\nFive years after the executions, Samuel Sewall stood up in his church and bowed his head as his minister read his apology. Sewall wished to accept \u201cthe blame and the shame of it.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, his 1,000-page diary, which he kept from his student days at Harvard until the year before he died in 1730, is sparse on the matter of the Salem trials. LaPlante gives as much context as she can and suggests that the turn in public opinion against the witch trials did much to precipitate Sewall\u2019s repentance.\n\nHis sense of guilt and shame came at the midpoint of an energetic, successful and deeply devout life. Sewall was born in England in 1652 and immigrated with his family to the Colonies at the age of 9. The Sewalls were already affluent before he married the daughter of Boston\u2019s wealthiest merchant and began his career in the law and government.\n\nFor LaPlante and, of course, her readers, Sewall\u2019s reticence about the Salem case in his diary is a source of frustration. It is to some extent compounded by Sewall\u2019s tendency to think of everything that happened in his life in terms of his profound religious faith and his ongoing struggle toward salvation.\n\nWhatever the impulse that produced his plea for forgiveness, Sewall remained the only one of the trial judges to admit to the miscarriage of justice. The very act of open confession to his community seems to have had a catalytic effect. He remained a pillar of the establishment in Colonial New England, and he continued to work as a judge. But his attention and sympathies turned to those less fortunate \u2014 especially the victims of the thriving slave trade.\n\nLaPlante deftly sketches the background to the publication of \u201cThe Selling of Joseph\u201d in 1700, in which Sewall proposed religious arguments against the slave trade in the Colonies. It was the first abolitionist tract printed in the New World. Sewall deepened his unpopularity with his peers by also championing the rights of women and American Indians.\n\nIf you visit the Massachusetts State House today, you will find a mural depicting Sewall\u2019s apology. Perhaps we will never know all the reasons behind it, but LaPlante\u2019s portrait is finely drawn, and surely as close as we can hope to get.\n\nNONFICTION\n\nTITLE: \u201cSalem Witch Judge: The Life and Repentance of Samuel Sewall\u201d\n\nAUTHOR: Eve LaPlante\n\nPUBLISHER: HarperCollins\n\nPRICE: $25.95; PAGES: 352"}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:William_Jennings_Bryan_presidential_campaign,_1896", "page_content": "This category has only the following subcategory.\n\nMedia in category \"William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1896\"\n\nThe following 38 files are in this category, out of 38 total."}]}
