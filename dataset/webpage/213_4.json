{"Heinz Christian Pander described the three germ layers of the chick embryo, which are the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.": [{"url": "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/ectoderm", "page_content": "Ectoderm\n\nEctoderm is one of three germ layers\u2014groups of cells that coalesce early during the embryonic life of all animals except maybe sponges, and from which organs and tissues form. As an embryo develops, a single fertilized cell progresses through multiple rounds of cell division. Eventually, the clump of cells goes through a stage called gastrulation, during which the embryo reorganizes itself into the three germ layers: endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. After gastrulation, the embryo goes through a process called neurulation, which starts the development of nervous system.\n\nDuring neurulation, ectoderm differentiates into two parts. The first is the surface ectoderm, which gives rise to tissues on the outer surface of the body like epidermis, hair, and nails. The second is the neuroectoderm, which forms the nervous system of the embryo. The neuroectoderm further divides into the neural tube, which acts as the precursor for the embryo's central nervous system, and into the neural crest, a collection of mobile cells shed from the junction between the neural tube and the epidermis after the neural tube forms. The neural crest helps form many of the bones and connective tissues of the head and face, as well as parts of the peripheral nervous system. In fishes, the neural crest helps form dorsal fins, and in turtles is helps from the carapace.\n\nThe discovery of ectoderm tied to the discoveries of the other germ layers. In 1817 Christian Pander, a doctoral student at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, discovered the germ layers in chick embryos, Gallus gallus. Within his dissertation, Pander described how two layers of cells, which he dubbed the serous and mucous layers, give rise to a third layer, which he called the vascular layer. Pander thereby described the process of gastrulation in the chick, and he brought the three layers of the embryo to the attention of the scientific community. In 1825 physician and embryologist Martin Rathke, in Prussia (later Poland), discovered cell layers in the developing crayfish, Astacus astacus, that corresponded to Pander's serous and mucous layers. Rathke's results showed that these two cell layers existed in the embryos of non-vertebrate animals.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, many scientists investigated the germ layers. In 1828 Karl Ernst von Baer at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, in K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia, applied Pander\u2019s concept of germ layers to all of the vertebrates. In England in 1849 Thomas Henry Huxley used germ layers to unite the vertebrate and invertebrate kingdoms. In his article \"On the Anatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusae,\" Huxley compared the anatomy of the jellyfish family and recognized that the two tissue layers he saw in the body plan of the adult jellyfish corresponded with, or were homologous to, the layers in the embryo of the chick that Pander had described. Huxley next coupled the anatomy of an adult organism with the anatomy of an embryo, and he proposed a connection between the study of growth and development, called ontogeny, and the study relationships between organisms or taxa, called phylogeny. The association that Huxley drew between ontogeny and phylogeny, later called recapitulation, influenced other nineteenth century scientists like Charles Darwin, in England, and Ernst Haeckel, in Germany.\n\nIn 1853 George James Allman, a naturalist at Trinity College, Dublin, in Dublin, Ireland, coined the terms ectoderm and endoderm to replace Pander's concepts of serous and mucous layers, respectively. Eighteen years later, Huxley, who had by then become professor of natural history at the Royal School of Mines, in London, England, introduced the term mesoderm in his A Manual of Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the concepts of the germ layers had become the foundation for Germ layer theory, which held that each of the germ layers, regardless of species, gave rise to a fixed set of organs. Many biologists deemed the germ layers homologous across the animal kingdom, effectively uniting ontogeny with phylogeny. Germ layer theory became doctrinal in the late 1860s due to scientists like Alexander Kovalevsky at the University of St. Petersburg, in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Ernst Haeckel, in Germany.\n\nSeveral scientists opposed Germ Layer Theory, including Edmund Beecher Wilson, in the United States, and Wilhelm His, Rudolf Albert von K\u00f6lliker, and brothers Oscar and Richard Hertwig, all in Germany. Most argued that the homology of the germ layers across all taxa was impossible because vertebrates and invertebrates do not all have the same organs.\n\nWidely recognized evidence to disprove germ layer theory came in 1922, from Hilde Proescholdt Mangold and her doctoral advisor, Hans Spemann, working at the Zoological Institute in Freiburg, Germany. Mangold transplanted ectoderm harvested from the dorsal lip, the main organizing tissue of the embryo during gastrulation, between donor and host species of newts. The embryos in which she had transplanted the dorsal lip developed an extra body, head, or other nervous system structure. The resultant newts indicated that the transplanted tissue had induced gastrulation and neurulation of surrounding tissue just as it would have in its parent embryo. Mangold's experiments proved that the germ layers lacked absolutely determined derivatives, a result that dismantled germ layer theory. Additionally, this experiment exemplified a shift in embryological methods that had occurred in the late nineteenth century. Whereas most practitioners had focused on described and compared the anatomy of different embryos, some scientists began to physically manipulate embryos to test hypotheses. These methods helped spur the growth of programs that focused on experimental embryology during the early twentieth century.\n\nFollowing the work of Mangold and Spemann, other scientists experimented on the three germ layers. Among these experimental embryologists was Sven H\u00f6rstadius at Uppsala University, in Uppsala, Sweden. Conducting experiments on echinoderms, a phylum that includes sand dollars and sea urchins, H\u00f6rstadius investigated the ability of the germ layers to transform. Among H\u00f6rstadius' major contributions was his work on the neural crest, which culminated in a book in 1950 titled The Neural Crest: Its properties and derivatives in the light of experimental research.\n\nWilhelm His at the University of Basel, in Basel, Switzerland, had discovered neural crest, a derivative of the neuroectoderm, in the chick in 1868. His noticed that as the neural tube closed, cells began to migrate away from midline; these cells eventually became called the neural crest. Twenty years later scientists had begun to look for the derivatives of the neural crest, especially in the head and nervous system. In 1893 Julia Platt, a doctoral student studying at Munich University, in Munich, Germany, published the results of her research on the ectodermal, specifically neural crest, derivatives in the head. Based on her studies of Necturus maculosus embryos, a type of aquatic salamander, Platt showed that the cartilage of the branchial arches and parts of the teeth developed from ectoderm.\n\nFew scientists acknowledged the role of neural crest in the formation of the skeleton until the 1940s when H\u00f6rstadius and Sven Sellman, in Sweden, and Gavin de Beer, in England, confirmed the role of neural crest in skeletal development. During the 1960s, researchers studied how neural crest cells migrate. Researchers like James Weston at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, and Malcolm Johnston, at the University of Rochester, in Rochester, New York, traced the migration of trunk and cranial neural crest in chick embryos. In the 1970s, Nicole Le Douarin, a researcher at the University of Nantes, in Nantes, France, created chimeric quail and chick embryos to track the migration and derivatives of the neural crest.\n\nAs some researchers investigated the derivatives and movements of neural crest, others examined the interactions of the different germ layers within the embryo. In 1969 Pieter D. Nieuwkoop, at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science, in Utrecht, Holland, published an article that addressed the potential of endoderm and ectoderm to induce the formation of their surrounding tissues. Using embryos of the salamander Ambystoma mexicanum, Nieuwkoop showed that when endoderm and ectoderm interact, the endoderm induces mesoderm to form within the adjacent regions of ectoderm. His experiments also demonstrated that the establishment of the ventral and dorsal regions of the embryo, known as the polarity of the embryo, results from the interactions of the endoderm and ectoderm.\n\nScientists began to research the genetic signals responsible for gastrulation in the mid-1980s. Families of signaling factors, such as Vg1/Nodal, Wnt, and FGF, produce proteins that help to pattern the embryo and to form the three germ layers. In the 1990s, scientists began to show how the signals involved in gastrulation also function in neurulation. In particular, researchers studied the Bone Morphogenetic Protein, or BMP, pathway. This pathway of signals helps cause tissues to differentiate during gastrulation, with inhibition of BMP causing the ectoderm to differentiate into neuroectoderm, the tissue that gives rise to the nervous system. Researchers found that proteins like Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin, and Cerberus block the expression of different members of the BMP family. These BMP-inhibitors help to induce the ectoderm to differentiate into the central and peripheral nervous systems."}, {"url": "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/christian-heinrich-pander-1794-1865", "page_content": "Christian Heinrich Pander, often remembered as the father of embryology, also explored the fields of osteology, zoology, geology, and anatomy. He was born in Riga, Latvia, on 24 July 1794. Pander, with an eclectic history of research, is best remembered for his discovery and explanation of the structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he coined. In doing so, Pander was able to achieve the goal set forth by his teacher, Ignaz D\u00f6llinger, to reinvigorate the study of the chick embryo as a means of further exploring the science of embryology as a whole. His findings paved the way for the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, who would later revolutionize the field of embryology with his research.\n\nPander initially studied in the local schools of his hometown, Riga, and eventually enrolled in the University of Dorpat in 1812. While studying there, Pander attempted to pursue an education in both medical science as well as natural history. It was during this time that Pander began to work with an anatomist named Karl Friedrich Burdach who had previously taught Karl Ernst von Baer. Pander left Dorpat in 1814 and traveled to Germany. It was there in 1816 that Pander met von Baer, who convinced him to study at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under the tutelage of Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. Pander agreed and traveled to W\u00fcrzburg where he received his MD in 1817. It was also here that he published his dissertation, Historia Metamorphoseos Quam Ovum Incubatum Prioribus Quinque Diebus Subit, a study of the components of the chick embryo including detailed illustrations by Eduard Joseph d\u2019Alton.\n\nDuring his work at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Pander discovered the blastoderm of the chick embryo. The blastoderm is the outermost cellular layer of the embryo, which Pander believed contributed greatly to embryonic development. He studied the blastoderm\u2019s role in early embryonic development, describing the outer, middle, and inner layers in detail while only being able to conclude that the development of blood vessels occurred in the middle layer and that important events of embryonic development followed thereafter. Despite the lack of in-depth conclusions, Pander\u2019s discovery and recognition of the blastoderm as well as the layered structure of the embryo provided invaluable information and guidance to his colleagues as well as future embryologists, including von Baer.\n\nDespite promising early research, Pander did not pursue further work in the study of chick embryos or embryology in general. After he obtained his MD and published his dissertation, Pander began traveling through Europe visiting science museums and continuing his work of observation in the fields of biology, paleontology, and geology. His primary goal in doing so was to visit and study the newest and most intricate fossils and skeletons discovered in different parts of the world. Pander eventually began to publish a series of works on osteology, the study of bones, collaborating once again with E. J. d\u2019Alton. Pander became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1821 and a member of the St. Petersburg Zoological Academy in 1826. For the remainder of his life, Pander lived mainly in his estate near his hometown of Riga while still taking time to travel and continue his work in the fields of geology and paleontology, though none of his later work gained significant recognition. Pander died on 22 September 1865 in St. Petersburg. Though somewhat inconclusive, Pander\u2019s work with chick embryos and their components marked the beginning of a more advanced understanding of embryology."}, {"url": "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/endoderm", "page_content": "Endoderm\n\nEndoderm is one of the germ layers\u2014aggregates of cells that organize early during embryonic life and from which all organs and tissues develop. All animals, with the exception of sponges, form either two or three germ layers through a process known as gastrulation. During gastrulation, a ball of cells transforms into a two-layered embryo made of an inner layer of endoderm and an outer layer of ectoderm. In more complex organisms, like vertebrates, these two primary germ layers interact to give rise to a third germ layer, called mesoderm. Regardless of the presence of two or three layers, endoderm is always the inner-most layer. Endoderm forms the epithelium\u2014a type of tissue in which the cells are tightly linked together to form sheets\u2014that lines the primitive gut. From this epithelial lining of the primitive gut, organs like the digestive tract, liver, pancreas, and lungs develop.\n\nThroughout the early stages of gastrulation, a group of cells called mesendoderm expresses sets of both endoderm- and mesoderm-specific genes. Cells in the mesendoderm have the ability to differentiate into either mesoderm or endoderm, depending upon their position among surrounding cells. Scientists have found mesendoderm is widespread among invertebrates, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Within vertebrates, mesendoderm has been found in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, and has been indicated in mice, Mus musculus.\n\nEndoderm, along with the other two germ layers, was discovered in 1817 by Christian Pander, a doctoral student at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. In his dissertation, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Entwickelungsgeschichte des H\u00fchnchens im Eie (Contributions to the Developmental History of the Chicken in the Egg), Pander described how two layers give rise to a third in the chick (Gallus gallus) embryo. Pander's description of the formation of these layers is the first account of gastrulation in the chick, and it grounded future studies of the germ layers. Martin Rathke at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, in K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia (later Poland), soon found evidence in a developing crayfish, Astacus astacus, of the two layers Pander had described. Rathke's finding marked the first discovery of endoderm and ectoderm in an invertebrate, but that information was not further investigated for two decades.\n\nThe germ layers drew the attention of many scientists in the nineteenth century. Karl Ernst von Baer at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, extended the concept of germ layers to include all vertebrates in his 1828 text \u00dcber die Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere. Beobachtung und Reflexion (On the Developmental History of the Animals.Observations and Reflections). Twenty years later, natural historian Thomas Henry Huxley, in England, applied Pander's concept of germ layers to jellyfish. In his 1849 paper \"On the Anatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusae,\" Huxley noted that the two layers of cells he saw in the adult jellyfish related to each other the same way as the germ layers in chick embryos described by Pander. The association that Huxley made between the body plan of the adult jellyfish and the vertebrate embryo connected the study of growth and development, called ontogeny, to the study of relationships between organisms, called phylogeny. Huxley's support for a relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny, later known as the theory of recapitulation, would become fundamental to the works of late nineteenth century scientists, like Charles Darwin, in England, and Ernst Haeckel at the University of Jena, in Jena, Germany. These and other scientists began to look to embryos for evidence of evolution.\n\nBy the 1860s researchers compared germ layers across the animal kingdom. Beginning in 1864 embryologist Aleksandr Kovalevsky, who studied embryology at the University of St. Petersburg, in St. Petersburg, Russia, studied invertebrates. His research showed that invertebrate embryos had the same primary germ layers, endoderm and ectoderm, as vertebrate embryos, and that the layers arose in the same fashion across the animal kingdom. Kovalevsky's findings convinced many about the universality of the germ layers\u2014a result that some scientists made a principle of germ layer theory. Germ layer theory held that each of the germ layers, regardless of species, gave rise to a fixed set of organs. These organs were deemed homologous across the animal kingdom, effectively uniting ontogeny with phylogeny. Scientists like Haeckel in Germany and Edwin Ray Lankester at the University College, London, in London, England convinced many to accept germ layer theory by the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhile germ layer theory garnered broad support, not everyone accepted it. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, embryologists such as Edmund Beecher Wilson, in the United States, and Wilhelm His and Rudolf Albert von K\u00f6lliker, both in Germany, objected to the absolute universality of the germ layers that the theory demanded. These opponents of germ layer theory belonged mainly to a new tradition of embryologist\u2014those who used physical manipulations of embryos to research development. By the 1920s, experiments by scientists like Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold, in Germany, and Sven H\u00f6rstadius, in Sweden, led scientists to dismantle the germ layer theory.\n\nEarly twentieth-century scientists sought to explain the germ layers more fully by investigating how embryos transformed from one cell to thousands of cells. Among these embryologists, Edwin Grant Conklin at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was one of the first to trace cell lineages from the single-cell stage. In his 1905 text The Organization and Cell-lineage of the Ascidian Egg, Conklin mapped the divisions and subsequent specialization of the cells in the embryo of an ascidian, or sea squirt, a type of marine invertebrate that develops a tough outer layer and clings to the sea floor. By creating a plot, or fate map, of the developmental route of each of the cells, Conklin located the precursor cells, traced the formation of each of the germ layers, and showed that even at very early stages of development, the ability of some cells to differentiate becomes restricted.\n\nConklin's fate mapping experiments, along with questions about the capacity of cells to differentiate, influenced scientists like Robert Briggs, at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, and his collaborator, Thomas King, at the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the 1950s Briggs and King began a series of experiments to test the developmental capacity of cells and embryos. In 1957 Briggs and King transplanted nuclei from the presumptive endoderm of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, into eggs from which they had removed the nuclei. This technique, which Briggs and King helped create, called nuclear transplantation, allowed them to explore the timing of cell differentiation, and the technique became a basis for future experiments in cloning. From their nuclear transplantation experiments, Briggs and King found that during endodermal differentiation, the ability of the nucleus to help cells specialize becomes progressively restricted. That result was supported in 1960 by the work of John Gurdon, at Oxford University in Oxford, England. Gurdon recreated Briggs and King's experiments using the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, and Gurdon found that there are significant differences between species in the rate and timing of onset of these endodermal restrictions.\n\nWhile Briggs, King, and Gurdon worked to understand the restriction of endodermal cell fates, other scientists, like Pieter Nieuwkoop, at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science, in Utrecht, Holland, investigated the formation of the germ layers. In 1969 Nieuwkoop published an article, \"The Formation of the Mesoderm in Urodelean Amphibians. I. Induction by the Endoderm,\" in which he examined the interactions of the endoderm and ectoderm. Nieuwkoop divided embryos of the salamander, Ambystoma mexicanum, into regions of presumptive endoderm and presumptive ectoderm. When left to develop in isolation, mesoderm did not form. But when he recombined the two tissues, the endoderm induced the formation of mesoderm in adjacent regions of the ectoderm.\n\nAlthough scientists had traced the fate of the endoderm, investigated the capacity of endodermal cells to differentiate, and had examined the induction potential of said cells, they did not investigate the molecular pathways that specify and pattern the endoderm until the 1990s. From these studies emerged the theory that maternal signals, or developmental effects that the mother contributes to the egg prior to fertilization, act through three main families of protein-coding genes to help regulate the early differentiation of endoderm. These signals are proteins \u03b2-catenin, VegT, and Otx. The molecular pathways involved in later stages of endoderm differentiation and patterning are different across species, especially the transcription factors, or proteins that help regulate gene expression. GATA factors in particular are expressed in mesendoderm and are necessary for the endoderm to differentiate. While there are some genetic elements conserved across the animal kingdom, like \u03b2-catenin, some portions of the endoderm induction pathway, especially signals like the proteins Nodal and Wnt, are vertebrate-specific. In 2002 Eric Davidson and his colleagues at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, announced the full network of genes that regulate the specification of endoderm and mesoderm in sea urchins in their paper, \"A Genomic Regulatory Network for Development.\" Davidson confirmed that network of genes in a co-authored article published in 2012."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-18202-1_7", "page_content": "The idea that animal embryos and adults are built from germ layers has been around for almost 200 years (reviewed in Hall 1998). In 1817, Christian Heinrich Pander described the chick blastoderm as being organized into three layers. He named these layers as germ layers and identified three distinct types of germ layers in the chick embryo, an upper serous (ectoderm), a lower mucous (endoderm), and an intervening vessel layer (mesoderm) (Pander 1817). In 1829, Martin Rathke identified two of the germ layers described by Pander, the serous and the mucous layers, in an invertebrate, the decapod crustacean Astacus (Rathke 1825, 1829). These observations on the presence of homologous germ layers in distantly related animal groups laid the foundation for the germ layer theory. In its simplest form, the germ layer theory therefore was concerned with embryonic structure. Karl Ernst von Baer extended Pander\u2019s idea of germ layers to other vertebrate embryos and thereby further developed the germ layer theory (von Baer 1828). In his seminal work \u201cOn the Development of Animals,\u201d von Baer reviewed vertebrate development and used the information to come up with \u201cvon Baer\u2019s laws of embryology\u201d (Barnes 2014). These laws, as translated by Thomas Henry Huxley, states that (1) the more general characters of a large group appear earlier in the embryo than the more special characters; (2) from the most general forms, the less general are developed until the most special arises at the end; (3) every embryo of a given animal form, instead of passing through the other forms, rather becomes separated from them; and (4) fundamentally, therefore, the embryo of a higher form never resembles any other form but only its embryo (Huxley 1853). Based on these laws, von Baer developed the idea that the more similar the early embryonic stages of animals in different taxa are, the more closely related the animals are, and thus, he argued that the comparative analysis of embryonic development of different taxa would therefore provide insights into phylogenetic history (Hall 1998). These ideas put forward by von Baer now shifted the focus of studying homologous structures previously done in only adults, into embryos also, thus further advancing the germ layer theory (Hall 1995, 1996).\n\nThe next advancement of the germ layer theory came after the publication of \u201cOn the Anatomy and Affinities of the family of the Medusae\u201d by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1849. Here, Huxley showed that the ectoderm and the endoderm of vertebrate embryos were homologous with the two tissue layers found in adult jelly fish (medusae) (Huxley 1849). Based on his findings, Huxley expanded on von Baer\u2019s ideas of homology of germ layers and their relevance to phylogeny. Six years after Huxley published his work on medusae, Robert Remak published his \u201cStudies on the Formation and Development of Vertebrates\u201d in 1855, where he described for the first time the germ layer identified by Pander as the intervening vessel layer as \u201cmesoderm\u201d (Remak 1850). Remak also observed that all three germ layers were produced from a single cell, the fertilized embryo, through cell division and thus, made valuable contributions to the germ layer theory, as well as the cell theory by defining the cell as the fundamental unit in development (Hall 1998; Barnes 2014). The germ layer theory was taken to new heights by the German embryologist Ernst Haeckel and his Russian student Alexander Kowalevsky 20 years after Remak\u2019s discoveries. Kowalewsky\u2019s work on vertebrates, amphioxus, and ascidians showed that different invertebrate embryos were composed of the same embryonic layers described in vertebrate embryos, and the inner layer was formed by the invagination of the outer layer (Kowalevsky 1866, 1867, 1871, 1877, reviewed in Hall 1998). Ernst Haeckel capitalized on Kowalevsky\u2019s observations and used it together with his recapitulation theory to develop the gastrea theory. Haeckel\u2019s gastrea theory stated that the single-layered, hollow ball-like blastula stage (the Blastea) evolved into a two-layered sac containing an archenteron opening to the outside with a blastopore which he named the gastrea (Haeckel 1874, 1875). Based on the germ layer theory, Haeckel argued that all animals passed through this two-layered gastrea stage which was similar in structure to the medusae identified by Huxley, and he proposed the gastrea to be the common metazoan ancestor with a level of tissue organization seen in sponges (Haeckel 1874, 1875). Despite all its shortcomings, Haeckel\u2019s gastrea theory together with the germ layer theory made embryonic development an essential part of the study of animal evolution and phylogenetic reconstruction based on homology in the nineteenth century (de Beer 1958; Wilmer 1990; Brauckmann and Gilbert 2004; Price and Patel 2004).\n\nThe popularity of the germ layer theory among nineteenth century biologists was further enhanced because it provided an alternative explanation to the problem of homology. As proposed by Richard Owen in the 1840s, a homologue is \u201cthe same organ in different animals under every variety of form and function\u201d (Russell 1916). According to Owen, the only way to determine whether an organ is a homologue was through comparative anatomy (Baxter 1977). This argument was based on the presence of archetypes, and if you rejected the existence of the archetype, then the concept of homology became meaningless. It was Charles Darwin who came up with a solution for this problem with his idea of descent with modification, where the vertebrate limb would be a perfect example of a homologous structure. Darwin\u2019s explanation advanced the idea of homology from just a structural similarity into a structural similarity due to common descent (Boyden 1947). However, this concept came with a new set of problems where proving common ancestry of any given structure was no easy task given the incomplete nature of the fossil record. This is where the germ layer theory became extremely useful for biologists. If the germ layers are the same throughout the animal kingdom as stated in the germ-layer theory and if ontogeny was recapitulating phylogeny as proposed by Haeckel (1866), all you had to do to prove that two structure were homologous was to show that the two structures developed from the same germ layer (Baxter 1977). This school of thought was championed by Francis Balfour who used these ideas to investigate the homology of germinal layers and organ systems, discussed in his major work in two volumes, \u201cA treatise on Comparative Embryology\u201d (Balfour 1880\u20131881). However, this assumption, that homologous structures developed from the same germ layers, which made the germ layer theory so popular in the early days of evolutionary embryology resulted in major criticisms of the theory in later years.\n\nOne early critic of the germ layer theory was Edmund Beecher Wilson, who has famously said that he believed he was going to destroy the germ layer theory of development (Lillie 1944). It is interesting to note that during the early part of his career, Wilson was in complete agreement with the germ layer theory. It was only after carefully analyzing the results of his embryological studies focusing on mesoderm evolution using annelids that he realized the generalizations made in the germ layer theory were problematic (Wilson 1892). The main problem Wilson encountered in his studies was that there was no consensus among the scientific community on the exact evolutionary origins of mesoderm (Balfour 1880; Kleinenberg 1886). Wilson\u2019s work on the annelid worm Nereis together with work done on other invertebrate mollusks by Edwin Conklin and Friedrich Blochmann and polyclads by Arnold Lang further complicated the question of which cells gave rise to mesoderm in these different invertebrate species. The expectation was that since all these embryos underwent spiral cleavage, a highly conserved cleavage program, the same cell would give rise to mesoderm in all these different embryos. However, the results showed that compared to the mollusks and annelid, the polyclad embryos produced mesoderm from a different set of cells (Wilson 1892; Blochmann 1882; Lang 1884). Based on these results, Wilson concluded that cells having the exact same origin in cleavage and occupying the same position in the embryo may be fundamentally different when it came to their morphological fate (Wilson 1892). These findings posed serious challenges to the germ layer theory as, until then, it had never considered fate of early blastomeres but, instead, has focused on relatively later morphological feature of different germ layers. These findings led to Wilson claiming that comparative anatomy, and not comparative embryology as the primary standard for the study of homologies (Wilson 1894). By this time, the germ layer theory has lost a lot of its appeal due to these criticisms, and its close association with the recapitulation theory did not make it any easier to support the germ layer theory. However, it was widely understood that it was not easy to either prove or disprove the germ layer theory due to its complex nature. It was clear that more sophisticated, novel experimental techniques were required to carefully address the questions associated with the germ layer theory (Baxter 1977; Oppenheimer 1967). Around the same time, there was a shift in the focus of embryological studies from its former interest in problems in phylogeny to a new and exciting field of inquiry at the time, experimental embryology, which was popularized by pioneering experiments carried out by German contemporaries of Wilson: Wilhelm Roux, Hans Driesch, August Weismann, Oscar Hertwig, and Theodor Boveri (Baxter 1977). This shift of focus onto the experimental embryological analysis of animal development laid the foundation for a revitalization of the field of embryology and resulted in the reinvention of evolutionary embryology in a novel and more invigorated form. Also, this new direction toward which, embryological studies were moving resulted in shedding more light into the evolutionary origins of germ layers and helped to clarify certain criticisms associated with the theory."}, {"url": "https://www.jove.com/v/5153/an-introduction-to-the-chick-gallus-gallus-domesticus", "page_content": "The developing chicken, or chick, formally known as Gallus gallus domesticus, is an important model system for biomedical research. Within each chicken egg is an embryo that can be subjected to genetic and embryological manipulations. Such experimentation is relevant to human health and disease, because of the similarities between human and chick genomes. This video covers an overview of the chick model system, some key discoveries made in chick, and a few exciting examples of how they are used in labs today.\n\nBefore talking about the chick\u2019s scientific value, let\u2019s review some basic chicken biology. Like reptiles and mammals, Gallus gallus belong to the vertebrate clade Amniota, defined by the presence of extraembryonic membranes that support embryo development. The evolution of this system of membranes within the egg allowed the ancestral amniote to inhabit a land environment millions of years ago, which pretty much proves that it was the egg that came first! Within the class Aves, chickens belong to the Phasianidae family of terrestrial birds, which spend most of their life on land. The birds we know as a tasty food source are in fact a subspecies of Gallus gallus, commonly known as the Red Junglefowl, which inhabits southeast Asia. Today, billions of chickens are raised for meat and egg production all over the world. Clearly these birds are a big part of the human diet, but what do they like to eat? Chickens are omnivores that scour the ground for bugs, seeds, and vegetation. Female chickens, or hens, are especially in need of a good meal since they put a lot of energy into making eggs, which are laid almost every day. If a male is around, you\u2019ll know it; roosters are bigger, more colorful, and a lot louder! When roosters and hens get together to mate, the life cycle begins with internal fertilization. An egg is laid 25 hours later, containing a multicellular embryo. After 21 days of incubation, a chick hatches. Sexual maturity occurs by 31 weeks in most chickens, completing the cycle.\n\nNow, let\u2019s see why this common farm animal is popular in scientific research. First, it is easy to obtain fertilized chicken eggs at a relatively low cost, year-round. Second, developmental experiments can be precisely timed by regulating incubation temperature. Third, since the embryo develops externally, scientists only need to cut a window in the shell to access most developmental stages. The embryos also tolerate experimental manipulations quite well, because the egg white, or albumin, is naturally antibacterial. Last, but certainly not least, the chicken and human genomes are highly conserved. Despite the fact that the chicken genome is about a third of the size of the human\u2019s, it packs a similar number of genes. Of these, 60% correspond to a human gene, and are on average 75% identical to their human counterpart.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed what makes chicks a great model, let\u2019s review some key discoveries made in this system. Chick research dates back to ancient Greece, when Aristotle postulated that the extraembryonic membranes he observed in developing chicken eggs, and the human placenta and umbilical cord, both provide crucial nutrition to the embryo. Many years later, in 1672, Marcello Malpighi first described fundamental vertebrate structures in the developing chicken embryo, such as the neural tube, which forms the nervous system; and the somites, which will give rise to multiple tissues, like skeletal muscle. In 1817, Heinz Christian Pander studied early stage chicken embryos and discovered three primordial layers of cells known as the germ layers. Cells from these layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, go on to form all of the tissues that make up an organism. For this work, Pander earned the title: The Founder of Embryology. In 1951, Viktor Hamburger and Howard L. Hamilton published a 46 part staging series to identify embryos based on anatomy, from freshly laid eggs to hatching. The Hamburger and Hamilton staging series provides chick biologists with a way to standardize the staging of the embryos they study, cutting down on variables introduced by differing incubation temperatures. Also in the 1950s, Rita Levi-Montalcini discovered a mysterious factor that caused chick neurons to grow when exposed to engrafted mouse tumors. Stanley Cohen helped identify this unknown compound as NGF, or nerve growth factor. For this work, they won the Nobel Prize in 1986.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed how chick research has led to important discoveries, let\u2019s take a look at how chicks are used in labs today. First, chicken embryos are frequently used to track early cell movements. To be able to distinguish cells from their neighbors, scientists transplant cells from other avian species, like the quail, into chick embryos. Using quail-specific markers, the cells are followed over days as they are incorporated into developing structures. Chicks are also extremely useful for studying neuronal patterning. Neural tissue harvested from an embryo can be used to examine axonal tracing, circuitry and even neuronal activity. Lastly, the chorioallantoic membrane, otherwise known as the CAM, is a highly vascularized membrane that is frequently used for cancer research. Chicken embryos are naturally immunodeficient, which allows transplanted human cancer cells to readily commandeer blood vessels within the CAM to establish tumors. The spread of cancerous cells, or metastasis, can be easily studied in this highly useful assay."}, {"url": "https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:Heinz_Christian_Pander", "page_content": "Short description : Baltic German geologist\n\nHeinz Christian Pander, also Christian Heinrich Pander (24 July [O.S. 13] 1794 \u2013 22 September [O.S. 10] 1865), was a Russian Empire ethnic Baltic German biologist and embryologist.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1817 he received his doctorate from the University of W\u00fcrzburg, and spent several years (1827\u20131842), performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (German: Zarnikau)[1] on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga.

As organs form, a process called organogenesis, mesoderm interacts with endoderm and ectoderm to give rise to the digestive tract, the heart and skeletal muscles, red blood cells, and the tubules of the kidneys, as well as a type of connective tissue called mesenchyme. All animals that have only one plane of symmetry through the body, called bilateral symmetry, form three germ layers. Animals that have only two germ layers develop open digestive cavities. In contrast, the evolutionary development of the mesoderm allowed in animals the formation of internal organs such as stomachs and intestines (viscera).\n\nGastrulation is an early stage of development during which an embryo, then a single-layered ball of cells called a blastula, reorganizes itself into a three-layered ball of cells, called a gastrula. During this process, the primary germ layers, endoderm and ectoderm, interact to form the third, called mesoderm. Early in the reorganization process, a group of precursor cells that hold the potential to become either mesoderm or endoderm may form; this tissue is called mesendoderm. Mesendoderm has been found in species from Echinoderms, such as sea urchins, to mice, Mus musculus. The process that gives rise to the mesoderm also creates a dorso-ventral pattern within the mesoderm. This patterning of the mesoderm organizes cells in specific locations along the dorso-ventral axis, and a cell's location determines what kinds of cell it and its daughter cells can become (cell fate).\n\nMesoderm, along with the other two germ layers, was discovered in the early nineteenth century. In 1817 Christian Pander received an MD from the University of W\u00fcrzburg, in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, after completing his dissertation. \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Entwickelungsgeschichte des H\u00fchnchens im Eie\" (Contributions to the Developmental History of the Chicken in the Egg) described how two layers of the chick embryo give rise to a third, outlining the process of gastrulation in the chick, Gallus gallus. Throughout his text, Pander wrote of both the independence and of the interdependence of these layers\u2014while distinguishable, the layers appeared to work together to form organs.\n\nFollowing Pander's discovery, a series of nineteenth century scientists investigated the formation and derivatives of the germ layers. Karl Ernst von Baer, professor of anatomy at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, in K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia, in his 1828 \u00dcber die Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere. Beobachtung und Reflexion (On the Developmental History of Animals. Observations and Reflections), extended Pander's concept of the germ layers to apply to all vertebrates. In 1849 natural historian Thomas Henry Huxley, in England, expanded the concept yet again, in his article \"On the Anatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusae.\" Through his anatomical investigations of jellyfish, Huxley concluded that the two tissue layers he saw in the adult jellyfish bore the same relation to each other as the layers Pander had described in the chick embryo. When Huxley argued that the body architecture of the adult jellyfish was similar to those of vertebrate embryos, he united the vertebrate and invertebrate kingdoms and connected the study of growth and development, called ontogeny, with the study of relationships between organisms, called phylogeny. Huxley's observation that developmental stages reflected evolution set a trend, in that scientists began to investigate evolutionary questions by studying embryos. Those methods became foundational for the works of nineteenth century scientists like Charles Darwin, in England, and Ernst Haeckel, in Germany. Huxley employed the term mesoderm for the middle germ layer in the 1871 edition of his A Manual of Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals.\n\nToward the end of the nineteenth century, interest in germ layers erupted. As a result of the renewed association of embryology and phylogeny, some argued that universal relationships of the germ layers may exist throughout the animal kingdom. Germ Layer theory held that across all animal species, each of the germ layers gives rise to a fixed set of organs that are homologous between taxa. Scientists like Aleksandr Kovalevsky at the University of St. Petersburg, in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Ernst Haeckel helped make the Germ Layer theory doctrinal for embryologists beginning in the late 1860s.\n\nSome nineteenth century scientists, like Edmund Beecher Wilson, in the United States, and many scientists in Germany, including Wilhelm His, Rudolf Albert von K\u00f6lliker, and Oscar and Richard Hertwig, objected to the Germ Layer theory. These scientists often created their own theories of how the germ layers develop. For example, brothers Oscar and Richard Hertwig formed a concept called Coelom Theory, to explain the source and development of the mesoderm in phylogenetic terms. In their Die Coelomtheorie. Versucheiner Erkl\u00e4rung des mittleren Keimbl\u00e4ttes (Coelom Theory: An Attempt to Explain the Middele Germ Layer) the Hertwig brothers contested homologous relationships between the germ layers across taxa. Instead, the Hertwigs saw the germ layers, especially the mesoderm, as raw materials that could develop into a variety of organs in response to different conditions of existence.\n\nGerm Layer theory remained influential during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However, the doctrine was eventually dismantled in the early to mid twentieth century by scientists like Hans Spemann, at the University of Freiburg in Freiburg, Germany, and his doctoral student Hilde Proescholdt Mangold, as well as by Sven H\u00f6rstadius, working at Uppsala University, in Uppsala, Sweden. These researchers showed that the fates of the germ layers were not absolutely specified and that they varied across species. After such work, scientists increasingly experimented with embryos from different species, and they detailed how the mesoderm arises from the interactions of ectoderm and endoderm.\n\nIn 1969 Pieter D. Nieuwkoop, Director of the Hubrecht Laboratory in the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in Utrecht, Holland, published an article that addressed the question of how mesoderm develops in vertebrates. Nieuwkoop used the embryos of the salamander Ambystoma mexicanum to test the ability of different parts of the amphibian egg to differentiate into various types of cells. He separated the sections that would give rise to ectoderm and endoderm and allowed them to develop independently; he found that mesoderm could not form without the interaction of these two tissues. When Nieuwkoop recombined the ectodermal and endodermal regions, the endoderm induced mesoderm to form in the adjacent region of the ectoderm. Using those experiments, Nieuwkoop also demonstrated that the induction process establishes a polarity in the mesoderm, such that dorsal endoderm induces dorsal mesoderm, while ventral endoderm induces ventral mesoderm.\n\nWhile Nieuwkoop was able to discern the roles of the germ layers for the induction of mesoderm, the signals involved in the genetic activation of the process remained unknown. Beginning in the mid-1980s, scientists started to determine the molecules responsible for mesodermal induction. They found that at least four families of protein-encoding pathways, or signaling factors, Vg1/Nodal, BMP, Wnt, and FGF, direct the induction and maintenance of mesoderm in vertebrates. In 2002 Eric Davidson and his colleagues at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California outlined the gene network that regulates specification of mesoderm and endoderm in the sea urchin, and Davidson further confirmed this network in 2012 with Sagar Damle."}, {"url": "https://study.com/learn/lesson/gastrulation-3-germ-layers.html", "page_content": "Primary Germ Layers\n\nGastrulation's end result is the formation of the gastrula, which is characterized by having distinct germ layers. The term \"germ layer\" refers to a layer of primary cells that eventually form specific organ systems in later development. The germ layers were first discovered by Christian Pander in 1817, when he studied a chick gastrula and defined its three distinct layers: the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. Just like a chick gastrula, the human gastrula is composed of the same three germ layers. Some animals, such as jellyfish, develop two germ layers instead of three and are referred to as dipoblasts. Dipoblasts exhibit radial symmetry and only develop an ectoderm and an endoderm during gastrulation. On the other hand, organisms that develop from three germ layers are called tripoblasts.\n\nBlastula to gastrula\n\nEctoderm\n\nThe ectoderm is the outermost layer of the gastrula and is composed of four regions: the neural plate, neural crest, surface ectoderm, and placodes. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system, which originates from the neural plate and crest; the epidermis (outermost layer) of the skin, which originates from the surface ectoderm; head regions, which originate from the placodes; and parts of the adrenal gland, which originate from the neural crest. The ectoderm can be traced and marked in research using the SOX1 protein, which is a protein used by ectodermal cells to initiate neural development.\n\nMesoderm\n\nThe mesoderm is the middle layer of the gastrula and is further segmented into somites, which are blocks of cells vital to provide a pattern of the vertebrate. The mesoderm gives rise to both connective tissues and muscles. Connective tissues of the body include bone, cartilage, blood, and blood vessels. On the other hand, muscle groups derived from the mesoderm include smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. The mesoderm can be labelled and traced in research using the expression of the brachyury T gene, which is a transcription factor used in embryonic development.\n\nEndoderm\n\nThe endoderm (previously referred to as the entoderm) is the innermost later of the gastrula and contributes to the development of organ systems such as the respiratory, renal, and gastrointestinal tracts. The endoderm is also present in the lining of the extraembryonic yolk sac and umbilical cord, which are vital to the embryo's nourishment and waste management. The endoderm can be labelled and traced in research via the expression of alpha-fetoprotein.\n\nGastrulation Examples\n\nSince gastrulation in humans is very hard to observe, animal models such as chickens and frogs are heavily researched. The animals mostly follow the same gastrulation methods as humans but with minor differences."}, {"url": "https://biologywise.com/information-about-the3-germ-layers-in-animals", "page_content": "Like it? Share it!\n\nAll animals begin life as a single-celled organism. That single cell undergoes various divisions and processes during gestation to develop into a newborn animal. The development process includes the formation of the germinal layers, which eventually give rise to the various parts of the animal.\n\nDiscovery\n\nThe three germ layers in chick embryos were first observed and reported by Heinz Christian Pander, a doctoral student at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, in 1817.\n\nAnimals, invertebrates, and vertebrates alike, start out as unicellular zygotes. The zygotes (fertilized egg cells) undergo cell divisions till they form a multicellular ball of cells called the blastula. A blastula is generally formed after the 7th cell division (cleavage) of the zygote, and consists of around 128 cells. The blastula shows cells arranged in a spherical manner called the blastoderm, encircling a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. As development progresses and the blastula attaches to the uterine lining, it expands and the cells form two distinct structures: the trophoblast and the inner cell mass. The trophoblast will eventually give rise to the yolk sac and the amnion, while the inner cell mass will undergo differentiation to form the embryo.\n\nBlastopore Formation\n\nAfter implantation, the blastula develops into a gastrula. The gastrulation process is characterized by the formation of a blastopore, a dorsal lip, and the archenteron. The blastopore is an opening on the surface of the blastula that opens into the blastocoel. The blastocoel is now called the archenteron, and will eventually develop into the digestive tract of the animal. The dorsal part of the blastopore is called the dorsal lip, and the cells around it later give rise to the head region of the animal. The fate of the blastopore depends on the complexity of the animals. In less complex animals (protostomes), such as molluscs and earthworms, the blastopore develops into the oral cavity or mouth, but in case of more complex animals (deuterostomes), such as humans and most vertebrates, the blastopore develops into the anal opening.\n\nFormation of Germ Layers\n\nOnce the blastopore is formed, the cells of the inner cell mass start moving along the invagination. This movement of cells is known as morphogenetic movement and includes processes such as epiboly, involution, and ingression. These processes help facilitate the movement of cells. The rearrangement of cells establish two temporary layers of cells called the hypoblast and the epiblast. The formation of the dorsal lip or primitive streak leads the epiblast to divide and differentiate into the three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The hypoblast later forms the amnion.\n\nThe Three Germ Layers in Animals\n\nGerm layers are the primary layers of cells that will, in due course, differentiate and develop into all the tissues and organs of the animal. The number of germ layers in animals vary depending on the body complexity.\n\nSponges\n\n\u25a3 Simple animals like sponges have only one germ layer that gives rise to the whole body.\n\nJellyfish \u2013 Cnidarian animal\n\n\u25a3 Cnidarian animals like jellyfish and hydra show the presence of two germ layers, and are hence called diploblasts. They show true tissue development and radial symmetry.\n\n\u25a3 Complex animals, ranging from flatworms to humans, show the presence of three germ layers. Hence, they are called triploblasts, and they exhibit bilateral symmetry.\n\nThe three germinal layers differentiate into the organism\u2019s body plan in response to the received chemical cues and stimuli.\n\n\u25a3 The endoderm is the innermost layer.\n\n\u25a3 The ectoderm is the outermost layer.\n\n\u25a3 The layer between these two layers is called the mesoderm.\n\nENDODERM\n\nThe endoderm layer is characterized by flattened cells that later transform into columnar cells. The cells of this layer later form the inner lining of the digestive tract, respiratory tube, and organs, such as the pancreas, liver, etc. The cells of the inner lining of glands and the tympanic cavity also arise from this layer. The cells also line the trachea, bronchi, alveoli of lungs, the urinary bladder, and a part of the urethra.\n\nThe endoderm, in humans, differentiates and forms distinct recognizable organs within the 6th week of embryonic development.\n\nMESODERM\n\nThe presence of this layer is only seen in triploblastic animals. Its presence leads to the formation of a body cavity, called the coelom, where the organs develop and grow freely.\n\nThe mesoderm further gives rise to four subtypes:\n\n\u25a3 Intermediate mesoderm\n\n\u25a3 Paraxial mesoderm\n\n\u25a3 Lateral plate mesoderm\n\n\u25a3 Chordamesoderm\n\nThese four types are formed via cell signaling and cellular interactions between the cells of the endoderm and the ectoderm.\n\nThe cells of the intermediate mesoderm give rise to the kidneys and gonads, while the lateral plate mesoderm differentiates and produces the entirety of the circulatory system including the heart, the various blood cells, blood vessels, spleen, the wall of the gut, and also the wall of the animal body. The paraxial mesoderm produces the cartilage, skeletal muscles, and the dermis. The notochord or the primitive spine of the animal develops from the differentiation of the cells of the chordamesoderm.\n\nIn general, the mesoderm is responsible for the formation of striated, skeletal, and smooth muscles, bones, cartilage, connective and adipose tissues, the lymphatic and circulatory systems, dermis, the genitourinary system, and the notochord.\n\nECTODERM\n\nThe ectoderm is responsible for the outermost layers of the embryo. It differentiates into three subtypes\n\n\u25a3 The surface ectoderm\n\n\u25a3 The neural crest\n\n\u25a3 The neural tube\n\nThe surface ectoderm differentiates to form the epidermis, hair, nails, eye lens, sebaceous glands on the skin, cornea of the eye, tooth enamel, and the epithelium of the mouth and the nose. In layman terms, this subtype gives rise to the exoskeleton of the animal. The neural tube develops to form the brain, spinal cord, the posterior pituitary gland, the motor neurons, and the retina. The anterior pituitary gland arises by the development of the ectodermal tissue of Rathke\u2019s pouch. The peripheral nervous system, adrenal medullae, melanocytes, facial cartilage, and the dentin of teeth are formed by the cells of the neural crest. The neural crest, because of its significance, is often considered as the fourth germ layer despite being a derivative of the ectoderm.\n\nThe germinal layers are responsible for giving rise to the body, in the case of all animals. Despite the varying body complexities, the general process of embryonic development stays the same at the cellular level. The characteristic physical features and attributes develop during the later stages of development."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46095-6_7", "page_content": "Although Pander understood that the three germ layers \u201cwork mutually together although destined for different ends,\u201d von Baer\u2019s Germ Layer Theory took a more rigid deterministic view of the germ layers as it developed over the century. At the turn of the twentieth century, tissue grafting and explant culturing methods were developed that finally permitted scientists to functionally test the roles of different embryonic tissues (Oppenheimer 1940). Vogt\u2019s fate map made it possible to correctly interpret these experiments, since it is necessary to understand how tissues behave in their normal locations before trying to understand how they behave when placed in an abnormal environment. These embryological experiments demonstrated the source of signals that induce the germ layers, and showed that these signals act before gastrulation.\n\n7.5.1 Amphibians\n\n7.5.1.1 The Organizer\n\nAs a part of her doctoral thesis under Hans Spemann (1869\u20131941), Hilde Proescholdt (later Mangold) (1898\u20131924) worked with embryos from two differently pigmented species of salamander. She transplanted the dorsal lip of the blastopore from one embryo onto the ventral side of a host embryo. The dorsal lip is the site where gastrulation initiates in amphibians, and is visible as a small region of darkly pigmented cells at the margin. These experiments were particularly challenging because she could only obtain embryos from natural mating of a species that had only one mating season a year, and in the pre-antibiotic era, the operated embryos did not survive very well in the pond water she used to incubate her embryos (Hamburger 1984). She repeated the experiment several hundred times over the course of 2 years in order to obtain the six survivors that formed the basis of her Nobel prize winning paper (Spemann and Mangold 1924). The grafted tissue induced an entire secondary body axis. The transplant differentiated into notochord, muscle and some gut, and the overlying host cells adopted neural fates (Spemann and Mangold 1924). The mesoderm of the dorsal lip is sufficient to induce the overlying ectoderm to form neural tissue, and to organize an entire secondary body axis. Spemann called this tissue the Organizer, and laid out three characteristics that functionally define organizer tissue. The Organizer tissue should induce neural tissue from na\u00efve ectoderm, self-differentiate into notochord and prechordal plate, and reprogram surrounding tissue within the mesoderm.\n\n7.5.1.2 Mesoderm Induction\n\nJohannes Holtfreter (1901\u20131992) used a different approach to determine how the germ layers interact to produce the embryo. He developed culturing conditions that decreased the incidence of bacterial infection of operated embryos (Holtfreter 1929). He found that when raised in particular salt conditions, amphibian embryos gastrulate abnormally, such that the mesoderm and endoderm egress from the embryo instead of internalizing and migrating underneath the prospective ectoderm (Holtfreter 1933). In these exogastrulae, the mesoderm never underlies the ectoderm, and the neural plate never forms. He also performed explant studies, in which he removed cells of the animal cap from the blastula, and cultured them in his solution. The caps quickly healed into round spheres, but only differentiated into \u201catypical ectoderm\u201d (Fig. 7.6a) (Holtfreter 1938a, 1938b). This was surprising because, according to Vogt\u2019s fate map, some of the cells he explanted would become neural tissue if left in its original location. The Organizer experiment, Holtfreter\u2019s exogastrulae and the animal cap explants all showed that mesodermal tissue interacts with the ectoderm to generate the neural plate. This interaction was termed \u201cinduction\u201d because it involved communication between the germ layers and was presumably mediated by the transfer of an unknown molecule. More broadly, these experiments, along with others, showed that germ layer identity is not fixed before gastrulation, and they confirmed Pander\u2019s belief that interactions between the germ layers are essential for normal embryonic development.\n\nFig. 7.6 Experiments to find the mesoderm inducing signals in Xenopus. (a) Animal cap explants differentiate into atypical epidermis when cultured alone, but form mesoderm in combination with vegetal cells, or with mesoderm-inducing factors. (b) The Three Signal Model hypothesizes that there are three mesoderm-inducing activities in frogs: The first signal induces dorsal mesoderm (black arrow) in animal caps, the second signal induces ventral and ventrolateral mesoderm (yellow arrows) in animal caps, while the third signal dorsalizes ventral mesoderm in Ventral Marginal Zone (VMZ) explants (white arrows) (Dale and Slack 1987b) Full size image\n\nThe first indication that ectodermal cells could be induced to form mesodermal and endodermal tissue, came from experiments in which differentiated tissues from adult guinea pigs were implanted into newt gastrulae, or cultured in sandwiches between two ectodermal explants (Toivonen 1953; Takata and Yamada 1960; Saxen et al. 1964). Two important conclusions were drawn from these results. First, they showed that in the proper environment, presumptive ectoderm could be converted to the other germ layers. Secondly, they showed that some tissues produced instructive signals that could change the fate of ectoderm. This raised the possibility that such interactions occur during normal development to form the germ layers. Pieter Nieuwkoop (1917\u20131996) devised an experiment to identify the source of the endogenous mesoderm inducing signals. In a variation on Holtfreter\u2019s explant experiments, he explanted animal caps and vegetal pieces from salamander embryos and grew them either separately or in combination (Nieuwkoop 1969). He found that neither the animal caps nor the vegetal pieces were able to form mesoderm when grown separately, but mesoderm was present when the vegetal pieces were grown in combination with the animal caps (Fig. 7.6a). In salamanders, mesodermal tissue was derived exclusively from cells in the pigmented animal cap ectoderm (Nieuwkoop 1969). Similar results were obtained in Xenopus laevis (Nakamura et al. 1970). These experiments identified the vegetal pole as the likely source of the endogenous mesoderm inducing signals, although Nakamura cautioned that \u201c\u2018mesodermal induction\u2019, meaning the conversion of presumptive ectoderm into mesoderm, is an abnormal phenomenon\u201d which is only suggestive of the process that occurs in normal development (p. 318) (Nakamura et al. 1970).\n\n7.5.1.3 The Nieuwkoop Center\n\nA series of more spatially and temporally refined recombination experiments showed that the vegetal cells contained at least two types of inductive signals, and that these signals act before gastrulation. Dorsally located vegetal cells were able to induce ectodermal cells to become notochord, a dorsal mesodermal structure, with high frequency, but could only rarely induce ectoderm to form blood, which is derived from the ventral mesoderm. Ventral vegetal cells were able to induce ventral and intermediate mesodermal cell types easily, but could only rarely induce notochord (Dale et al. 1985; Dale and Slack 1987b). A series of heterochronic recombinants showed that vegetal pieces from young embryos could not act on gastrula-stage explants, but that gastrula stage vegetal pieces could act on younger ectoderm (Dale et al. 1985). This showed that the vegetal pieces continue to produce the mesoderm-inducing signal after gastrulation, but that the ectoderm loses the competence to respond to these signals. The dorsal mesoderm inducing activity was further localized to the dorsal-most vegetal cells of a 64-cell stage embryo, and its descendants (Gimlich and Gerhart 1984). When transplanted to the ventral side of a host, these cells could induce a full body axis, like the Organizer. Unlike the organizer, however, these cells did not contribute any cells to the axis itself and differentiated into gut endoderm. This region of the embryo was named the Nieuwkoop Center, in honor of the man who discovered the mesoderm-inducing capacity of cells in the vegetal pole (Gerhart et al. 1989). The Nieuwkoop center does not form in embryos treated with UV light during the first cell cycle, and all cells in resulting embryos adopt ventral fates (Gimlich and Gerhart 1984). Thus, the Nieuwkoop center is both necessary and sufficient to induce overlying cells in the embryo margin to become the Organizer .\n\n7.5.1.4 The Three-Signal Model\n\nA third inducing activity was uncovered by experiments that recombined the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) with the ventral marginal zone (VMZ). In these experiments, the tissue was explanted after mesoderm had been specified, just before the onset of gastrulation. When explanted at this stage and grown in isolation, the VMZ generates ventral mesodermal cell types, such as blood and mesothelium, but does not produce notochord and generates only a little muscle. By contrast, when combined with the DMZ, cells from the VMZ differentiate into muscle at a high frequency and no longer produce blood or mesothelium (Slack and Forman 1980; Smith and Slack 1983; Dale and Slack 1987b). The DMZ is the site of the Organizer, and was already known to induce neural tissue from ectoderm. These experiments showed that the DMZ contains another activity that acts to \u201cdorsalize\u201d presumptive ventral mesoderm so that it produces a more dorsal mesodermal cell type than it would in isolation. These results suggested the Three Signal Model for mesoderm formation (Fig. 7.6b) (Dale and Slack 1987b). According to this view, a signal from the dorsal vegetal cells induces the overlying marginal cells to adopt dorsal mesodermal fates (Fig. 7.6b, black arrow), including the notochord, while a second signal from the ventral vegetal cells induces overlying cells to adopt ventral mesodermal fates, including blood and pronephros (Fig. 7.6b, yellow arrows). At a subsequent stage, signals from the DMZ dorsalize other marginal cells to adopt dorsolateral mesodermal cell fates, like muscle (Fig. 7.6b, white arrows). These experiments only tested the functional activity of the signals produced by vegetal cells and did not clarify the molecular nature of the signals. The three activities could be explained by one molecule acting in a gradient, with different effects at different concentrations, or by multiple molecules acting synergistically to induce different fates.\n\n7.5.2 Teleosts\n\n7.5.2.1 The Embryonic Shield\n\nIt quickly became apparent that embryonic induction was not restricted to amphibian embryos. Several lines of evidence indicated that the teleost embryonic shield is the functional equivalent of Spemann\u2019s Organizer. Working in the yellow perch, Oppenheimer transplanted the embryonic shield from one embryo into ectopic locations in the blastoderm or yolk of a host embryo (Oppenheimer 1934a). She stained the host and graft with different color vital dyes, and found that the grafted shield self-differentiated into notochord and somites, and induced neighboring host cells to form a secondary neural axis, like Spemann and Mangold had observed in salamanders a decade earlier. Similar results were obtained in subsequent transplant experiments with shields from killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), trout, zebrafish, and medaka embryos (Oppenheimer 1934b, 1936c; Luther 1935; Shih and Fraser 1996; Inohaya et al. 1999). Conversely, neural tissue failed to form when the prospective neural ectoderm of a trout embryo was extirpated and grafted onto the yolk, far from any inductive signals of the shield (Luther 1936). The shield is necessary and sufficient to induce neural tissue from na\u00efve ectoderm and the shield fulfills Spemann\u2019s definition of an organizer tissue.\n\nOppenheimer went one step further and showed that amphibian cells could respond to signals from the shield (Oppenheimer 1936b). She implanted the shield of a zebrafish embryo into the blastocoel of a newt embryo. In the resulting chimeras, the zebrafish tissue differentiated into a notochord and somites, as expected, and the amphibian host cells surrounding this graft formed ectopic neural tissue. This striking result showed that the inductive signals themselves were likely to be conserved between amphibians and teleosts.\n\n7.5.2.2 The YSL\n\nEarly experiments to determine the role of the yolk during teleost development yielded ambiguous results. The great geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866\u20131945) was the first person to perform a systematic experimental analysis of teleost development, working with wrasse, sea bass, and killifish embryos at the Marine Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts (Morgan 1893, 1895). He used a needle to poke a hole in the vegetal pole of the embryo, opposite the blastodisc, gently squeezed out the yolk, and permitted the sac to backfill with seawater. He concluded that, \u201cThe yolk may be removed from the egg of Fundulus at almost any stage of development and the embryo still forms.\u201d (p. 809) (Morgan 1893). The caveat to this conclusion was that embryonic development ceased if he removed more than two-thirds of the yolk content. Morgan viewed the yolk as a passive structure, important only for the mechanics of embryonic cleavages and epiboly. Oppenheimer reinvestigated the role of the yolk in killifish, with a full understanding of embryonic induction (Oppenheimer 1936a). Her approach was to remove the entire blastoderm from the yolk at different stages and to grow them as isolates in culture. Blastoderms isolated after the 32-cell stage produced embryos with structures from all three germ layers, although they typically lacked posterior structures. Blastoderms isolated before this stage formed a hollow ball of epidermis reminiscent of the atypical ectoderm formed in Holtfreter\u2019s animal cap explants. Oppenheimer concluded that the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), which she called the periblast, contains a substance that is transferred to the blastoderm at or before the 32-cell stage, and is necessary for formation of the mesoderm and endoderm. Similar results were obtained from cultures of isolated goldfish, trout, medaka and zebrafish blastoderms (Fig. 7.6a) (Tung et al. 1954; Devillers 1961; Hyodo et al. 1996; Sagerstrom et al. 1996; Xu et al. 2014b). These transplant experiments were often difficult to interpret, given differences in staging, and whether or not a bit of the YSL had been included in the blastoderm isolates. Conclusive proof that molecules produced in the yolk are essential for embryonic development came from experiments in which RNase was injected into the YSL of zebrafish embryos (Fig. 7.7a) (Chen and Kimelman 2000). This treatment had dramatic consequences, and the embryos died before gastrulation, failing to express the earliest markers for mesoderm and endoderm. Since zebrafish embryos lacking mesoderm and endoderm survive perfectly well for days, it is likely that the RNase treatment affected a number of different processes that are vital for survival past early embryonic stages .\n\nFig. 7.7 Experiments to find the mesoderm inducing signals in zebrafish. (a) Zebrafish animal cap explants differentiate into epidermis when cultured alone, but express mesodermal markers when cultured on a free yolk cell (Ober and Schulte-Merker 1999). In untreated embryos, cells near the margin express the pan-mesodermal marker, No-tail/Xbra. No-tail/Xbra expression is greatly reduced when RNase is injected into the YSL, and an ectopic no-tail/Xbra appears when an ectopic yolk cell is grafted on the animal pole of a host embryo. (b) Signals from the YSL induce mesoderm and endoderm (small black arrows), and signals from the dorsal YSL induce dorsal mesoderm and endoderm (large black arrow) Full size image\n\nA complementary set of experiments demonstrated that signals from the yolk can induce mesoderm and endoderm. In a series of heterochronic transplants, old blastoderms with visible shields were replaced with younger blastoderms, lacking shields. As development proceeded, the transplanted blastoderms always developed shields in the same location as the original blastoderm (Long 1983). In zebrafish, animal cap cells expressed markers of mesendoderm, including the shield, when they were directly exposed to the YSL in grafting experiments (Fig. 7.6a) (Mizuno et al. 1996; Ober and Schulte-Merker 1999; Rodaway et al. 1999). Because the yolk cell cannot be further physically subdivided, specific regional capabilities of the YSL have not been addressed by grafting experiments. Targeted knockdown of specific genes in the YSL, however, indicates that it expresses an essential ventralizing signal in addition to its ability to induce dorsal mesoderm (Fan et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2014). Thus in teleosts, the extraembryonic YSL performs the same functions during development that are fulfilled by the vegetal blastomeres in amphibians (Fig. 7.7b). The YSL fits all the criteria for Nieuwkoop Center. Signals from the YSL are both necessary and sufficient to induce the shield, and the YSL does not contribute to the embryonic axis, since it is an extraembryonic tissue .\n\n7.5.3 Amniotes\n\n7.5.3.1 The Node\n\nThe functional equivalent of Spemann's Organizer in amniotes is called the node. In 1875, Viktor Hensen (1835\u20131924) was studying the embryonic development of the rabbit when he noticed an epithelial thickening at the anterior end of the primitive streak in gastrulating embryo (Hensen 1876). Because of its appearance, he called this structure the node, although in some texts it is referred to as the primitive knot. This structure, now called Hensen\u2019s node, was subsequently discovered in all gastrulating mammalian and avian embryos. Hensen observed that a bridge of invaginating mesoderm at the node connects the hypoblast to the epiblast. This unusual feature suggested to him that the node plays an important role in germ layer formation, but it would take nearly 60 years before experimental embryologists began to decipher its functions. After its discovery, biologists presumed the node was an embryonic growth zone (Leikola 1976). This changed when Vogt\u2019s vital dye staining technique was used to trace the cell movements in the chicken epiblast (Wetzel 1925, 1929; Gr\u00e4per 1929). These studies revealed that the cells of the epiblast migrate in an arc-like pattern toward the midline where they converge and invaginate in the streak and node. Later fate maps, using the more reliable lipophilic lineage tracers DiI and DiO, confirmed these observations (Hatada and Stern 1994). The node and primitive streak, therefore, are the sites where the germ layers form as the presumptive mesoderm and endoderm internalize. Rather than being a static structure, the node is composed of a highly dynamic cell population of endoderm and mesoderm precursors, equivalent to the teleost shield and the amphibian dorsal lip.\n\nEarly grafting experiments showed that the node and anterior primitive streak have the ability to self-differentiate when transplanted to the chorioallantoic membrane (Hunt 1931; Willier and Rawles 1931). Conrad H. Waddington (1905\u20131975) developed a technique for culturing chicken and duck blastoderms on a blood clot in a watch glass, with all the yolk removed (Waddington 1932). With this method, he could visualize development continuously for a period of days after various experimental manipulations. His first report describes 650 different operations. In one set of experiments, the epiblast was divided into pieces that were cultured separately. Only sections containing the node and anterior streak could produce embryonic organs such as the neural plate, notochord, heart and liver. This suggested that the node was essential for axis formation. Waddington next inserted pieces of the primitive streak underneath the epiblast of a cultured blastoderm. Anterior streak and node, but not the posterior streak, could induce the overlying epiblast to form a secondary body axis. Furthermore, nodal tissue from a duck could induce a secondary axis in a chicken epiblast, and vice versa (Waddington and Schmidt 1933). A limitation of these experiments is that they relied exclusively on morphological criteria to distinguish host tissue from graft because the vital dyes did not label tissue with sufficient intensity to be visible in sections, and because duck tissue was indistinguishable from chicken tissue under the microscope (Waddington 1932). Waddington was cautious in his conclusions, but his results were replicated much later using modern tissue labeling methods and quail-chick xenografts (Storey et al. 1992; Psychoyos and Stern 1996). These experiments show that the amniote node meets Spemann\u2019s definition of an organizer tissue. The mouse node can also induce a secondary neural axis in grafting experiments, indicating that organizer activity is a property common to the node in all amniote embryos (Beddington 1994).\n\nA series of xenograft experiments showed that zebrafish and Xenopus blastulae respond to signals from the chicken and mouse nodes (Kintner and Dodd 1991; Blum et al. 1992; Hatta and Takahashi 1996). Similarly, the rabbit node can induce neural ectoderm in chicken embryo (Waddington 1937). The conserved activities of these tissues suggested that the signals themselves were likely to be conserved among all vertebrates. This was confirmed when Chordin and Noggin were identified as the endogenous, neural inducing, and dorsalizing signals expressed in the amphibian Organizer, teleost shield, and amniote node (Smith and Harland 1992; Sasai et al. 1994; Connolly et al. 1997; Fisher et al. 1997; Schulte-Merker et al. 1997; Streit et al. 1998; Furthauer et al. 1999; Bachiller et al. 2000).\n\n7.5.3.2 Koller\u2019s Sickle/PMZ\n\nIt has been more challenging to identify the equivalent of the Nieuwkoop center in amniotes than in other phyla, mostly due to the more complicated anatomy of the blastoderm. Attention has focused on three extraembryonic tissues: the hypoblast, Koller\u2019s sickle and the posterior marginal zone (PMZ). The location of the hypoblast underneath the epiblast is reminiscent of the location of the vegetal blastomeres under the marginal zone of amphibians. Waddington was the first to test the capacity of the hypoblast to induce mesoderm, working in chicken and duck embryos (Waddington 1932, 1937). He separated the hypoblast from the epiblast, rotated the it 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 along the anteroposterior axis, recombined the pieces and grew them in culture. In all cases, the primitive streak developed abnormally, and sometimes secondary primitive streak and body axis formed with its polarity coordinated with that of the rotated endoderm. Although this result was suggestive, the lack of adequate lineage-tracing techniques meant that Waddington could not definitively conclude that the formation of a new node and streak was due to an inductive event. More recent experiments used lineage labels to unambiguously demonstrate that the node is induced, but have variously identified Koller\u2019s sickle, the PMZ, and the hypoblast as the inductive tissue (Azar and Eyal-Giladi 1979; Eyal-Giladi et al. 1992; Callebaut and Van Nueten 1994; Khaner 1998; Callebaut et al. 2003). For instance, a secondary body axis forms when a square piece of tissue from the PMZ including Koller\u2019s sickle, is grafted orthogonally to the endogenous PMZ (Fig. 7.8a) (Khaner and Eyal-Giladi 1989; Eyal-Giladi et al. 1992). Subsequent experiments found that Koller\u2019s sickle alone could not induce a primitive streak (Khaner 1998). Furthermore, detailed fate mapping showed that cells in Koller\u2019s sickle contribute to the axial mesoderm (Bachvarova et al. 1998). These results eliminated the sickle from consideration as the Nieuwkoop Center. PMZ dissected from a chicken or duck embryo in the absence of Koller\u2019s sickle can induce a primitive streak and body axis when grafted to an epiblast (Fig. 7.8a) (Bachvarova et al. 1998; Khaner 1998). Importantly, labeled cells in the graft did not contribute to the new body axis, indicating that the avian PMZ expresses signals that induce formation of the primitive streak near the marginal zone, which is comprised of future mesoderm and endodermal cells (Fig. 7.8b, large arrows). Similar grafting experiments have not been performed in mammals, but genetic studies in the mouse demonstrated that signals from the extraembryonic visceral endoderm (VE) are required to induce the node and primitive streak (Varlet et al. 1997). Thus, the avian PMZ and the mammalian VE are functionally equivalent and meet the criteria of the Nieuwkoop center. As the primitive streak extends and the node migrates toward the anterior, signals from the posterior streak induce surrounding epiblast cells to form lateral mesoderm (Fig. 7.8b, small arrows). Cells only become committed to these fates, however, after they invaginate through the primitive streak (Kimura et al. 2006). The node gains the ability to induce neural tissue when the streak has reached its full extension (Fig. 7.8b, white arrows) (Storey et al. 1992).\n\nFig. 7.8 Experiments to find the mesoderm inducing signals in chicken. (a) The PMZ can induce an ectopic primitive streak and Hensen\u2019s Node when grafted at a 90\u00b0 angle with respect to the original axis. The PMZ from a quail embryo can induce a primitive streak to form when grafted to the anterior portion of a chicken epiblast. (b) Signals from the PMZ induce formation of the primitive streak in the posterior area pellucida (top embryo, black arrows). At a later stage, the primitive streak and Hensen\u2019s Node express signals that induce mesoderm and endoderm, and signals from Hensen\u2019s Node pattern the neural tissue (white arrows) Full size image\n\n7.5.4 Conclusion\n\nThe discovery of the germ layers by Pander and von Baer raised the question of how the three layers cooperate to ensure the proper placement of organs relative to each other and with respect to the body axis. Some mechanism must act to guarantee that the foregut, for instance, always forms in the head rather than in some other location. The extent of communication between the germ layers only became apparent in the early twentieth century, when experimental embryologists began dissecting embryos and transplanting tissues to different locations, or developing them in culture. Comparisons of the effects of these manipulations to the normal fate maps demonstrated that cell fates depend on their environmental context. Spemann and Mangold found that in tissue transplants, the dorsal lip of the blastopore self-differentiates as axial mesoderm and induces the overlying ectoderm to form neural tissue. Because of these properties, they named this tissue the Organizer. Subsequently, tissues with Organizer properties were discovered at the onset of gastrulation in all vertebrate embryos. The fact that Organizer tissues function across phyla boundaries indicated that a common mechanism acts in all vertebrates to induce neural tissue, despite the obvious morphological differences between the embryos at these stages. The discovery that Chordin and Noggin are expressed in the amphibian Organizer, the teleost shield and the amniote node and streak confirmed this prediction and transformed our understanding of how the vertebrate body plan is constructed. Chordin and Noggin are both secreted antagonists of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP), a subclass of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily that ventralizes the embryo (Piccolo et al. 1996; Zimmerman et al. 1996). Thus, instead of providing a signal that induces dorsal fates, signals from the organizer the act to block ventralizing signals.\n\nExperimental embryologists also identified the tissues that induce the Organizer, called the Nieuwkoop Center, as discussed above. In amphibians, the Nieuwkoop Center is located in the dorsal vegetal blastomeres, which are fated to become gut endoderm, and other vegetal cells induce ventral mesodermal cell types. In teleosts and amniotes, the Nieuwkoop Center is located in extraembryonic tissues, including the YSL, PMZ and the mammalian VE. Signals from these tissues induce all mesodermal and endodermal cell types in the overlying blastoderm, including the shield and node. The combined action of the Nieuwkoop Center and the Organizer explains how development of the germ layers is coordinated. Therefore, the reason the foregut always forms in the head is because prior to gastrulation, precursors of the foregut induce organizer tissue, which induces and patterns the brain and head. In teleosts and amniotes, the foregut precursors and the organizer tissues are both induced by signals emanating from extraembryonic tissues, but the result is the same: coordinated development of organs within the three germ layers."}], "Heinz Christian Pander was the first to describe the notochord.": [{"url": "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/christian-heinrich-pander-1794-1865", "page_content": "Christian Heinrich Pander, often remembered as the father of embryology, also explored the fields of osteology, zoology, geology, and anatomy. He was born in Riga, Latvia, on 24 July 1794. Pander, with an eclectic history of research, is best remembered for his discovery and explanation of the structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he coined. In doing so, Pander was able to achieve the goal set forth by his teacher, Ignaz D\u00f6llinger, to reinvigorate the study of the chick embryo as a means of further exploring the science of embryology as a whole. His findings paved the way for the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, who would later revolutionize the field of embryology with his research.\n\nPander initially studied in the local schools of his hometown, Riga, and eventually enrolled in the University of Dorpat in 1812. While studying there, Pander attempted to pursue an education in both medical science as well as natural history. It was during this time that Pander began to work with an anatomist named Karl Friedrich Burdach who had previously taught Karl Ernst von Baer. Pander left Dorpat in 1814 and traveled to Germany. It was there in 1816 that Pander met von Baer, who convinced him to study at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under the tutelage of Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. Pander agreed and traveled to W\u00fcrzburg where he received his MD in 1817. It was also here that he published his dissertation, Historia Metamorphoseos Quam Ovum Incubatum Prioribus Quinque Diebus Subit, a study of the components of the chick embryo including detailed illustrations by Eduard Joseph d\u2019Alton.\n\nDuring his work at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Pander discovered the blastoderm of the chick embryo. The blastoderm is the outermost cellular layer of the embryo, which Pander believed contributed greatly to embryonic development. He studied the blastoderm\u2019s role in early embryonic development, describing the outer, middle, and inner layers in detail while only being able to conclude that the development of blood vessels occurred in the middle layer and that important events of embryonic development followed thereafter. Despite the lack of in-depth conclusions, Pander\u2019s discovery and recognition of the blastoderm as well as the layered structure of the embryo provided invaluable information and guidance to his colleagues as well as future embryologists, including von Baer.\n\nDespite promising early research, Pander did not pursue further work in the study of chick embryos or embryology in general. After he obtained his MD and published his dissertation, Pander began traveling through Europe visiting science museums and continuing his work of observation in the fields of biology, paleontology, and geology. His primary goal in doing so was to visit and study the newest and most intricate fossils and skeletons discovered in different parts of the world. Pander eventually began to publish a series of works on osteology, the study of bones, collaborating once again with E. J. d\u2019Alton. Pander became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1821 and a member of the St. Petersburg Zoological Academy in 1826. For the remainder of his life, Pander lived mainly in his estate near his hometown of Riga while still taking time to travel and continue his work in the fields of geology and paleontology, though none of his later work gained significant recognition. Pander died on 22 September 1865 in St. Petersburg. Though somewhat inconclusive, Pander\u2019s work with chick embryos and their components marked the beginning of a more advanced understanding of embryology."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-015-1897-z", "page_content": "In addition to its structural function, the notochord is also an important source of signals that are essential for patterning the adjacent tissues [23, 80]. In the sections below, we will discuss the experimental evidence indicating that the notochord is a source of key signaling molecules for the surrounding ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal derived tissues (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of transverse sections of a vertebrate embryo depicting notochord signaling to adjacent tissues. The notochord (no) secretes Shh, represented by arrows in the figure. This signal is responsible for patterning the ventral neural tube (nt). In particular, the notochord is able to induce the differentiation of the floor plate (fp), and they both represent a continuing source of ventralizing signals within the neural tube. The notochord is also important for somite differentiation, where Shh concentration gradients differentially pattern dorsal\u2013ventral somitic fates. Very low levels of Shh signal to maintain the dermomyotome (dm); slightly higher levels induce both loss of dermomyotomal markers and activation of myogenic differentiation (myotome, my); finally, higher levels of Shh cause the loss of myotomal markers and the induction of sclerotome (sc). Notochord signaling is also critical for the development of the hypochord (h) and of the dorsal aorta (da) Full size image\n\nNotochord signals for ectoderm development\n\nThe ectoderm is divided into three major domains: the outer ectoderm (mainly the epidermis), the neural tube (brain and spinal cord), and the neural crest (peripheral neurons, pigment, facial cartilage). During vertebrate embryonic development, signals from the dorsal organizer or its derivative, the notochord, are responsible for ectodermal commitment to a neuronal lineage.\n\nPatterning the neural tube\n\nPatterning of the neural tube is perhaps the best characterized role for the notochord during embryonic development. The vertebrate nervous system arises from the neural plate, a sheet of neuroepithelial cells that overlies the axial mesoderm. As development proceeds, the neural plate folds to form the neural tube, which in turn will form the spinal cord and the brain. At this stage, a dorsoventral polarity is established: cells in the dorsal half generate different neurons that relay sensory signals, whereas cells in the ventral half generate distinct classes of motor neurons and ventral interneurons that participate in the coordination of motor output (for a review, see [81]). Pioneering observations and embryological manipulations in chick and amphibians indicated that the notochord has a key role in establishing the dorsoventral polarity of the spinal cord [82, 83]. The notochord-secreted protein Shh was found to be the signal required and sufficient for patterning the ventral neural tube. The importance of Shh is confirmed by the loss of ventral neurons in embryos in which Shh signaling was either biochemically or genetically blocked [84\u201388]. Shh is initially secreted by the notochord and is able to induce the differentiation of the floor plate, a specialized group of neuroepithelial cells in the ventral portion of spinal cord [83, 89\u201391]. Then, floor plate cells express themselves shh, conferring the capability to specify both floor plate and motor neuron cellular fates, thus establishing a continuing source of a ventralizing signal within the neural tube. Evidences indicate that the minimal amount of Shh sufficient to induce the differentiation of each neuronal class in vitro correlates with the distance of Shh from its source of synthesis in vivo [88]. Thus, neurons generated in progressively more ventral regions of the neural tube require higher Shh concentrations for their induction [88]. Moreover, the generation of an engineered mouse that produces fluorescently labelled Shh from the endogenous locus provided new insights into the possible mechanism of in vivo Shh signal distribution during neural tube patterning [92]. This study supports a model wherein a graded signaling response to notochord-derived Shh activates a long-range patterning process in the ventral neural tube. Indeed, when patterning begins, Shh ligand is first detected at the apical region of ventral midline cells and then is progressively extended to the dorsal region. Moreover, the temporal gradient of Shh ligand accumulation is similar to the in vitro profile of Shh concentrations that is needed to progressively specify more-ventral cell types [92].\n\nAlthough the analysis of floor plate differentiation in avian and mammalian embryos provided a coherent picture of the inductive process, genetic studies in zebrafish revealed that a differentiated notochord is not strictly required for the generation of a floor plate in this vertebrate. Indeed, zebrafish mutants lacking the notochord (flh, momo, bozozok, and ntl) and shh mutants can develop al least the medial floor plate [93, 94]. In addition to shh, zebrafish embryos express two other Hh-related genes, echidna hedgehog (ehh) and tiggywinkle hedgehog (twhh), in notochord and floor plate respectively. Therefore, it is reasonable that multiple Hh genes might cooperate in the induction of a floor plate in zebrafish. Conversely, it is likely that only shh is responsible for the floor plate differentiation in avian and mammalian embryos. In fact, in chick and mouse embryos the specification of the floor plate and other ventral neuronal progenitors depends on distinct timing and duration of Shh signaling [95]. In a restricted developmental time frame, spanning from gastrulation to early somitogenesis stages, a transient burst of Shh signaling from the notochord is both necessary and sufficient for the specification of floor plate [82, 84, 87]. However, neural progenitors progressively lose their ability to acquire a floor plate identity in response to high levels of Shh. The downregulation of Shh signaling is a prerequisite for the onset of a floor plate identity [95]. Furthermore, it is likely that this mechanism contributes to the restriction of the floor plate to the neural tube midline. The possibility that neuroepithelial cells can generate a floor plate in response to other signaling pathways active within neural tissue cannot be excluded [95]. Notably, concomitant to Shh, signals of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs) family coming from the epidermal ectoderm control dorsal neural tube cell fate and modify its response to Shh signaling, by inhibiting the specification of a ventral cell fate [96\u201398]. In this context, the presence of notochord-derived BMP antagonists (e.g. Noggin, a notochord-secreted signaling molecule that binds and inactivates BMP, therefore playing a role in generating morphogenic gradients) allows to generate a permissive environment for Shh-mediated induction of the floor plate [99]. Notably, together with BMP ligands, other factors may also influence neural cell responsivity to Shh signaling. Interestingly, studies in chick embryos demonstrated that vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein expressed in the notochord, is able to potentiate the motor neuron inducing activity of Shh through direct binding to Shh ligands [100, 101].\n\nPatterning other ectoderm derivatives\n\nDifferent literature data suggest that the notochord, together with the ventral diencephalon and the mesenchyme, is involved in the development of the anterior pituitary. During the formation of cephalic tissues, the rostral tip of the notochord is adjacent to the cephalic ectoderm, where the anterior pituitary starts to develop. Indeed, transplantation experiments revealed that the anterior notochord is able induce the outpouching of the head ectoderm [102]. This leads to a partial formation of the Rathke\u2019s pouch and the upward invagination of the oral ectoderm, giving rise to the anterior pituitary. Therefore, a close contact between the diencephalon and ectoderm is a prerequisite for the induction of the anterior pituitary [102].\n\nNotochord signals for mesoderm development\n\nThe murine notochord, which is present from embryonic day (E) 7.5 until E12.5, forms all cell types of the nucleus pulposus in intervertebral discs (IVDs) [103, 104]. Moreover, temporal removal of Shh ligands from both the notochord and floor plate demonstrated that this signaling pathway is required for the formation of the peri-notochordal sheath and subsequently of the vertebral column [104]. More recently, it has been found that the expression of Shh in the notochord is sufficient to pattern the intervertebral discs and vertebral column. Indeed, removal of Shh from the notochord leads to failed Shh expression in the floor plate and results in the loss of vertebral structures and nuclei pulposi. In contrast, removal of Shh from the floor plate results in phenotypically normal vertebral column and intervertebral discs. These data indicate that the expression of Shh from the notochord is sufficient for patterning the entire vertebral column [105].\n\nPatterning the somites\n\nDuring vertebrate embryogenesis, the paraxial mesoderm that lies adjacent to the neural tube becomes segmented into paired epithelial somites. Then, each somite differentiates into the ventral sclerotome, from which the skeletal elements of the ribs and vertebral column derive, and the dorsal dermomyotome. The dermomyotome further differentiates into the dorsal-lateral dermotome, giving rise to dermis and myotome. The myotome is localized between the sclerotome and the dermotome and represents the precursor of axial musculature. Multiple extracellular signals expressed in the surrounding tissues determine the dorsal and ventral somitic cell fates, establishing the number of precursors that will give rise to either cartilage, muscle or dermal cells (for a review, see [106]).\n\nIt has been shown that the initiation and maintenance of the sclerotome depends on both Shh and Noggin, a Bmp4 antagonist, which are both expressed in the notochord when the sclerotome formation begins. Shh produced by the notochord and the floor plate is also important for the proliferation and survival of sclerotomal cells [87, 107\u2013111]. Indeed, in mice with ablation of Hh signaling, sclerotome formation is compromised and no vertebral column is formed [84, 112]. Conversely, gain-of-function studies have demonstrated that ectopic expression of Shh induces the expression of the sclerotomal marker Pax1 and inhibits the expression of the dermomyotomal marker Pax3 [108, 113]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the activity of notochord-derived Noggin is required for sclerotome differentiation, since Noggin-deficient embryos display defective sclerotome formation [114]. Indeed, Noggin inhibits the repressive activity of BMP signals, thus allowing the Shh-mediated induction of Pax1 in the somitic mesenchyme and the sclerotomal cell growth and differentiation into cartilage [114]. Therefore, it can be assumed that both signals, Shh and Noggin, cooperate during sclerotome formation [115]. In spite of this, studies in the Danforth\u2019s short-tail (Sd) mutant mouse, carrying a semi-dominant mutation that affect vertebral column development, challenged the concept that notochord might be required for sclerotome formation. In the Sd mouse model, although the notochord degenerates completely by E9.5, the floor plate is sufficient to maintain the differentiation of somites into sclerotomes and vertebrae [116]. More recently, it has been found that notochord-derived Shh regulates the expression of the chick early B cell factor 1 (cEbf1), a medial sclerotome marker expressed in somite areas close to the notochord that plays a crucial role for sclerotome development and formation of the vertebral body and pedicles [117].\n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that notochord-derived Shh promotes the myotome cell fate [118\u2013121]. Mouse embryos lacking Shh or its cell membrane ligand Smoothened display markedly decreased expression of Myf5, a key myogenic regulatory factor [84, 112]. In zebrafish, Shh is required for the differentiation of Pax3/Pax7-expressing dermomyotomal cells into MyoD-positive differentiated myocytes. In the absence of Shh signaling, Pax3/Pax7-expressing cells increase in number, but fail to activate the myogenic program [122, 123]. Even in this context, the Shh concentration gradients work in a morphogen-like fashion to differentially pattern the dorsal\u2013ventral somitic fates [124]. Indeed, different Shh levels elicit distinct responses in somitic cells. Very low Shh levels, combined with Wnt signaling activity, elicit the maintenance of dermomyotomal gene expression (Pax3). Slightly higher Shh levels induce both loss of dermomyotomal marker gene expression (Pax3) and activation of myogenic differentiation (Myf5 and MyoD). Finally, high Shh levels cause the loss of myotomal markers and the activation of sclerotomal gene expression [124].\n\nIt is known that dermomyotome progenitors colonizing the myotome first acquire a myocyte identity and subsequently proliferate as Pax7-expressing progenitors, before undergoing terminal differentiation. Recently, it was shown in both avian and mouse embryos that the loss of Shh responsiveness in dermomyotome-derived muscle progenitors is a key mechanism by which the myotome transits from differentiation into expansion [125]. Initially, Shh emanating from the notochord/floor plate through the sclerotome is able to reach the dermomyotome. In the dermomytome Shh both maintains the proliferation of dermomyotome cells and promotes the terminal myogenic differentiation of progenitors colonizing the myotome. Subsequently, when the myotome enters in the growth phase, myogenic progenitors become refractory to differentiation stimuli coming from Shh [125].\n\nStudies in zebrafish revealed that the correct specification of different cell types within the myotome is also dependent on the timing at which they receive the signal from the notochord and on their competence to respond [126]. Initially, the exposure of myotomal precursors to Hh is restricted to adaxial cells, a single cell layer lying close to the embryonic shield. Then, notochord-derived Hh proteins induce adaxial cells to become slow-twitch muscle fibers [127]. The early exposure to Hh ligands seems to be essential for the specification of muscle pioneer precursors, the slow muscle fiber myoblasts that respond to the highest levels of signaling and express engrailed genes [128]. A minor component of muscle pioneers become fated to form the superficial slow fibers and move away from the notochord, displacing precursors of the fast twitch fibers. By this time, these cells\u2014called medial fast fibers\u2014are irreversibly committed to the fast lineage; nevertheless they retain the ability to respond to Hh, as evidenced by their activation of engrailed expression, though at lower levels than muscle pioneers [127].\n\nMany zebrafish mutants affecting notochord development, such as flh, mom, ntl and doc, display a loss of muscle pioneers and of the horizontal myoseptum, the structure that separates somites into a dorsal and a ventral part. Indeed, cell transplantation experiments carried out in ntl and doc mutants showed that somite defects can be rescued by exogenous wild-type notochord cells [31, 41, 50, 129]. Moreover, flh mutant embryos display the transdifferentiation of notochord to muscle [33], and an ectopic induction of both myf5 and myoD in midline cells, especially in caudal somites. Indeed, abolishment of notochord-derived signals in flh mutants leads to extensive slow myogenesis, indicating that the combined action of floor plate-derived Twhh and notochord-derived Shh are sufficient to support non-pioneer slow myogenesis [33]. However, Twhh and Shh are unable to maintain and reinitiate MRF expression in adaxial cells during late stages of development. In fact, complete loss of ventral midline signals results in the absence of caudal slow muscle fibers and the formation of fast muscle fibers. Taken together, these data suggest that Shh released from the notochord is required for the maintenance of MRF expression. The additional exposure to midline signals reinitiates MRF expression and delays slow muscle fibers formation in flh and ntl mutants [130].\n\nPatterning other mesodermal tissues\n\nNotochord signaling is also important for the development of heart and vasculature. Previous studies in zebrafish showed that the anterior end of the notochord normally suppresses cardiogenic fate, by delimiting the expression of Nkx2.5, the earliest marker of presumptive myocardial cell fate [131]. Furthermore, the notochord is involved in the specification of the cardiac left\u2013right asymmetry. Actually, when the notochord is surgically ablated or when it is absent in mutant embryos (such as ntl and flh zebrafish mutants and no turning mice mutants), asymmetric markers of lateral plate mesoderm are either randomized or bilaterally expressed [132\u2013134]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Hh signaling is required for the earliest steps of specification, differentiation and proliferation of endocardial progenitors in the zebrafish embryo. The Hh signaling is cell-autonomously activated within endocardial progenitors, and the notochord is likely a source of this Hh signal [135].\n\nConcerning the vasculature specification, the notochord seems to have distinct roles in different species and developmental stages. The endothelial precursor cells or angioblasts originate from the mesoderm and then disperse throughout all embryonic tissues [136, 137]. The axial vessels of the trunk form in close proximity to the notochord and the endoderm. The dorsal aorta is normally just ventral to the notochord, whereas the axial vein is just below the dorsal aorta and above the endoderm. Studies in zebrafish indicate that the differentiated notochord is strongly required for the development of the dorsal aorta [138]. In fact, a fully developed notochord is needed for the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR2) in this axial artery and for the normal vessel assembly [138]. Conversely, the notochord seems less important for the development of the axial vein [139]. Indeed, in both flh and ntl mutants the dorsal aorta fails to form, while formation of the axial vein is less affected [138, 139]. The less severe vascular phenotype observed in ntl mutants may be caused by residual notochord signaling or alternatively by floor plate signals, which share many inductive properties with the notochord and could compensate for notochord loss [138, 139]. Experimental analysis showed that during somatogenesis notochord-derived Hh signals regulate the expression of vegfa, coding for vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the somitic mesoderm. In turn, VEGF-A acts on endothelial cells to drive arterial differentiation [140]. During early avian development, blood vessels develop in the embryonic disc, except in a midline region surrounding the notochord. Indeed, notochord-derived BMP antagonists, including noggin and chordin, are responsible for the generation and maintenance of this midline avascular region by preventing endothelial cells differentiation, migration, and network formation [141]. The combination of these inhibitory cues ensures that blood vessels are excluded from the midline until the paired dorsal aorta fuse.\n\nA narrow strip of tissue located between the paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm, called the intermediate mesoderm, gives raise to the vertebrate kidney. During embryogenesis, three sets of structures (pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros) emerge from the nephric cord within the intermediate mesoderm in an antero-posterior direction. It has been demonstrated that the notochord and floor plate-derived Shh ligands are dispensable for nephrogenesis but required for the correct positioning of the bilateral kidney primordia [142]. Actually, ablation of the notochord and floor plate in mice displays no effect on nephrogenesis but leads to kidney fusion [142]. A recent study on the temporal analysis of Shh function\u2014using a tamoxifen-inducible gene recombination system\u2014indicated that midline-derived Shh is essential to regulate the number of mesonephric tubules [143].\n\nNotochord signals for endoderm development\n\nThe endoderm germ layer gives rise to the epithelium of the pharynx and of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, including thyroid, thymus, lung, esophagus, stomach, intestine, liver and pancreas. Thus, determining how the endoderm is patterned is crucial for understanding the development of many internal organs.\n\nThe pancreas forms from the fusion of distinct dorsal and ventral buds. Embryonic manipulation in chick provided strong evidence that early signals released from the notochord to the endoderm permit dorsal pancreatic morphogenesis [144]. Moreover, these signals initiate and maintain the expression of different genes required for pancreatic development. In contrast ventral pancreas, which does not directly contact the notochord, develops normally in the absence of a notochord. In vitro recombination experiments suggest that notochord provides a permissive, rather that instructive, signal to the endoderm for the specification of a pancreatic fate. Indeed, pancreatic gene expression can be initiated and maintained only in prepancreatic chick endoderm cultured with notochord cells, whereas non-pancreatic endoderm does not express pancreatic genes when recombined with the same notochord [144]. Moreover, grafting experiments demonstrated that activin-\u03b2B and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expressed by the notochord repress endodermal Shh, thereby permitting pancreatic development [145]. Indeed, notochord removal before the onset of the notochord/endoderm molecular interactions leads to ectopic Shh expression in the pancreatic anlage, abnormal pancreatic morphogenesis, and prevents gene expression required for endocrine and exocrine compartments differentiation. Conversely, the inhibition of Shh in isolated prepancreatic endoderm is sufficient to induce specific pancreatic gene expression [145].\n\nEmbryological manipulations in amphibians demonstrated that the notochord plays a critical role in the development of the hypochord, a transient, endoderm-derived structure that lies immediately ventral to the notochord in the amphibian and fish embryo. During early neural stages, signals arising from the notochord instruct cells in the underlying endoderm to reach a hypochord fate, whereas further notochord signals are dispensable for the maintenance of this structure [146]. For example, in flh and ntl zebrafish mutants, the hypochord does not develop or it is severely disrupted [33]. However, in zebrafish gup, bal, dop and sny mutants, which are defective in late notochord development, the hypochord appears normal as assayed by the expression of the co2a1 marker [129]. Removal of the notochord during early neurulation leads to a complete failure of hypochord development and to the loss of vegf expression. Grafting experiments demonstrate that higher levels of notochord-derived signaling can expand the number of vegf-expressing cells, increasing the size of the differentiated hypochord [146].\n\nRecently, using spatio-temporal manipulation of Noggin conditional alleles during foregut development, it has been demonstrated that during early notochord development the action of Noggin results in BMP signaling attenuation, which in turn is required for the correct separation of the notochord cells from the dorsal foregut endoderm [147]. Importantly, this event appears to be a prerequisite for foregut compartmentalization. Indeed, mice lacking the BMP antagonist Noggin have esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, as well as defects in lung branching [148]. This phenotype appears to correlate with abnormal morphogenesis of the notochord. In particular, defective separation of the notochord from the definitive endoderm leads to hypocellularization of the foregut just before the critical period of compartmentalization [147].\n\nRole of extracellular matrix proteins in notochord patterning activity\n\nIn order to activate different embryonic differentiation programs, the Hh signals arising from the developing notochord must pass through the extracellular matrix surrounding notochord cells. Laminins are found in the peri-notochordal BM around forming somites, and later on around myotomes including vertical myosepta [22]. The source of notochord-derived Shh has an essential role in controlling laminin \u03b11 gene expression. As laminin 111 (also called laminin-1) is necessary and sufficient to initiate BM formation, these studies revealed that Shh plays a key role in this process [149]. In other systems (e.g. in vitro embryonic stem cells) it is known that Smad4, a BMP mediator, controls BM deposition through a dual control of metalloproteinase and laminin \u03b11 synthesis [150]. In zebrafish sly mutants, which carry a mutation in the gene encoding for laminin \u03b31 thus preventing the formation of laminin 111, Hh signaling is not affected, as revealed by normal expression levels for ptc, a gene that is transcriptionally regulated by this signaling pathway [151]. Indeed, these mutants display ectopic BMP activity in the myotome [152]. These findings suggest that a complex feedback mechanism between Shh, BMP and laminin 111 is responsible for the control of BM deposition and myogenesis.\n\nAnother example of mutual interaction between peri-notochordal BM deposition and notochord-related signaling activity has been revealed by zebrafish collagen XV depleted embryos [25]. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of col15a1 revealed that this peri-notochordal sheath protein is required for notochord differentiation, axon guidance and differentiation of functional muscle fibers. The authors proposed that the loss of BM integrity due to ablation of collagen XV may lead to an increased diffusion of Hh ligands from the notochord, resulting in an ectopic differentiation of medial fast fibers. The distinctive expansion of medial fast fibers in this model correlates with the onset of collagen XV expression after the Shh-mediated induction of adaxial and muscle pioneer cells [25].\n\nStudies in puff daddy (pfd), a zebrafish mutant yielded by a forward genetic screen for mutants exhibiting notochord sensitivity to lysyl oxidase inhibition, demonstrated that fibrillin-2 has an essential role in zebrafish notochord and vascular morphogenesis [71]. Although the notochord distortion observed in pfd mutants results from structural defects, the vascular phenotypes appear to rely at least in part upon altered cell signaling pathways. As genetic interaction between fibrillin-2 and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been demonstrated in fibrillin-2 knockout mice [153], Bmp-7-related signals or other morphogens may be required for endothelial cell branching and venous plexus morphogenesis in zebrafish. Moreover, treating zebrafish pfd mutant embryos with losartan, a specific inhibitor of the transforming growth factor (TGF\u03b2) signaling pathway, does not rescue their vascular phenotype [154], thus indicating that TGF\u03b2 signaling is not involved in the caudal vein abnormalities observed in fibrillin-2 depleted embryos [71].\n\nRecent in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the peri-notochordal sheath protein Emilin3 modulates the availability of Hh ligands by interacting with the permissive factor Scube2 in the notochord sheath [27]. Scube2 acts non-cell autonomously in the release of lipidated Shh from producing cells [155, 156]. Intriguingly, Emilin3 was shown to interact with the EGF repeats of Scube2, supporting the hypothesis that this extracellular matrix protein may be important for targeting Scube2 to the correct sites, thus tuning its activity in the extracellular milieu. Emilin3 deficiency disturbs notochord sheath formation and may cause an abnormal localization and/or activity of Scube2, leading to increased Hh signals. In agreement with this, expression of ptc1 and other Hh-responsive genes was shown to be consistently upregulated in Emilin3 depleted zebrafish embryos [27]."}, {"url": "https://evodevojournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13227-015-0025-3", "page_content": "Notochords in pre-Darwinian times\n\nThe notochord was discovered in 1828 in chick embryos by von Baer [32], who called it sometimes the dorsal strand (R\u00fcckensaite) and sometimes the chorda dorsalis. The latter term predominated during the nineteenth century, but, for convenience, we will refer to the structure simply as the notochord. Following von Baer\u2019s discovery, notochords were soon found in embryos of other vertebrates [33, 34] as well as in adults of amphioxus (classified then as fishes) [35]. Consequently, the homology of such structures among all vertebrates came to be widely accepted. Such a homology, being restricted to vertebrates, was agreeable to von Baer, who was willing to consider limited transformation within each of Cuvier\u2019s four embranchements\u2014namely, the vertebrates, radiates (cnidarians and echinoderms), articulates (arthropods and annelids), and molluscs [36]. In contrast, he firmly denied any evolutionary relationship between one embranchement and the next.\n\nInitial evolutionary ideas about notochords\n\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species triggered numerous scenarios for the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition [30], most including speculations on the evolutionary origin of the notochord. It was not long before von Baer\u2019s opposition to cross embranchement homologies was widely challenged, most irritatingly by a student in his own department at Saint Petersburg University\u2014Alexander Kowalevsky. The seeds of the conflict were sown in 1861 when Kowalevsky visited Heidelberg University and met Arnold Pagenstecher, who had recently described advanced larvae of amphioxus netted from the North Sea plankton [37]. In the opinion of Vucinich [38], Pagenstecher convinced Kowalevsky to go to Naples, Italy, to study the early embryology of amphioxus, although definitive evidence for that is lacking. In any event, Kowalevsky visited Naples from late 1863 through much of 1864 to work on the embryology of several invertebrates, most importantly amphioxus and ascidian tunicates.\n\nWhen Kowalevsky published on the embryology of amphioxus [39], he included a description of the early development of the notochord. He mistakenly thought the structure originated from segmental muscle cells, but corrected himself later [40] by finding that it arose from the mid-dorsal roof of the archenteron (Fig. 2a\u2013c). He also erred initially in claiming that the newly formed notochord comprised a population of individual cells that soon merged into a syncytium [39]. This is surprising because the correct answer had already been published [37]: namely, the amphioxus notochord consists chiefly of a row of persistently separate discoidal cells organized like a stack of coins. Importantly, Kowalevsky demonstrated that the early development of amphioxus is invertebrate-like, but the later embryology is vertebrate-like; however, he did not immediately express his opinion about the evolutionary implications of his discovery, perhaps to avoid antagonizing von Baer. Even so, Metchnikoff [41] was representative of many others in jumping to the obvious conclusion that \u201cthe major features of amphioxus development are intermediate between the development of vertebrates and that of lower animals\u201d (our translation).\n\nFig. 2 Notochords in phylogeny: invertebrate chordates, annelids, and nemerteans. a Midsagittal section of early neurula of amphioxus with blastopore (bp) and notochord rudiment (nr, horizontal hatching). b Cross section at level indicated by dotted line in a; notochord rudiment (nr) and somites indicated, respectively, by horizontal and diagonal hatching. c Cross section of later neurula of amphioxus showing notochord (no) and dorsal nerve cord (nc); somites indicated by diagonal hatching. d, e Early and late larvae, respectively, of an ascidian tunicate.

The arrow in m indicates the proboscis (pr) pulling out of the proboscis coelom (prc), leaving behind a few mesenchyme cells. In n, the mesenchyme cells in the proboscis coelom have extensively proliferated to form the notochord (no); the remains of the proboscis have become the anterior pituitary (ap), while the dorsal nerve cord (nc) has formed by the dorsal migration and fusion of the lateral nerve cords Full size image\n\nKowalevsky\u2019s research on amphioxus (excepting the mistakes noted above) was superb, but it was his publication on the embryology of ascidian tunicates [42] that brought him international fame. He followed the ascidian development through pre-metamorphic larvae, in which he discovered a notochord. Although vague about the cellular sources of the structure (at the time, nothing was known of embryonic cell lineages), he clearly described its early appearance as a solid cord of cells (Fig. 2d) as well as its further transition into a cellular sheath surrounding a fluid-filled lumen (Fig. 2e). The fully developed, coelom-like notochord in ascidians influenced some subsequent ideas about notochord evolution, as will be discussed further below.\n\nThe most consequential feature in Kowalevsky [42] was his proposal that ascidians were closely related to vertebrates. This was a clear challenge to von Baer, who considered ascidians to be molluscs related to shipworms largely on the basis of the incorrect homology he made between the ciliated gill slits of (adult) ascidians and those of bivalves. Kowalevsky\u2019s evolutionary conclusions were particularly irksome to von Baer, first for violating the genetic purity of the embranchements and second for attracting the attention of Darwin [43], who wrote that \u201c\u2026Ascidians are related to the Vertebrata, in their manner of development, in the relative position of the nervous system, and in possessing a structure closely like the chorda dorsalis of vertebrate animals. \u2026We should thus be justified in believing that at an extremely remote period a group of animals existed, resembling in many respects the larvae of our present Ascidians, which diverged into two great branches\u2014the one retrograding in development and producing the present class of Ascidians, the other rising to the crown and summit of the animal kingdom by giving birth to the Vertebrata.\u201d Due to this high-profile publicity, Kowalevsky\u2019s ascidian work quickly became the target of vigorous criticisms, but he countered them all successfully over the next few years, as thoroughly reviewed by Beeson [44].\n\nThe original annelid scenario\n\nBecause of Kowalevsky\u2019s embryological work, most biologists soon came to regard tunicates no longer as molluscs, but as close relatives of vertebrates. This change of mind made tunicates less clear-cut invertebrates and shifted attention to other taxa as the key starting point for the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition. Here again, Kowalevsky led the way [45], tentatively suggesting several phyla, including annelids, that might have been ancestral to vertebrates. His speculations were influenced by the earlier, non-evolutionary idea of Geoffroy-Saint Hilaire that the unity of body plans among animals is illustrated by the inverse dorsoventral arrangement of the main organ systems of vertebrates on the one hand and of annelids and arthropods on the other [46]. More specifically, Kowalevsky proposed that the notochord near the dorsal side of a vertebrate might have a homolog in the form of a band of fibrous cells (of unspecified nature) running in close association with the nerve cord near the ventral side of an annelid [45].\n\nIn 1875, Dohrn [47] and Semper [48] presented more extensive scenarios indicating how annelid-like ancestors underwent dorsoventral inversion while evolving into vertebrates. Both proposals were influenced by Kowalevsky\u2019s suggestion that annelids had a fibrous notochord-like structure closely associated with the nerve cord. According to Dohrn, these fibers were muscles that emigrated away from the nerve cord and later transformed themselves into cartilage (unfortunately he included no illustrations). Semper [48] simply appealed to the authority of Kowalevsky that the vertebrate notochord could be traced back in evolution to fibers (of unspecified histological identity) associated with the annelid nerve cord. Semper provided illustrations of the annelid and vertebrate conditions (Fig. 2f, g), but ignored the intermediate stages.\n\nSeveral contemporaries of Dohrn and Semper agreed with most of the annelid scenario but differed about how the notochord originated. Lwoff [49] proposed that annelids had a notochord that was cartilaginous from the beginning and never passed through fibrous stages, while Ehlers [50] suggested that that it arose from a siphon. The siphon is a tubular gut region, present in a few annelids and several other invertebrates, that opens at either end into the main course of the digestive tract and runs parallel and just ventral to the latter. Thus, a dorsoventral inversion of the annelid body (Fig. 2h) would orient the siphon in a position comparable that of the chordate notochord. To attain the vertebrate condition (Fig. 2i), the siphon detached from the rest of the gut and was converted from an epithelial tube to a compact cartilaginous structure. Two of Ehler\u2019s contemporaries [51, 52] endorsed his siphon-to-notochord transition. Thereafter, however, with rare exceptions [53], the annelid scenario remained unpopular during much of the twentieth century. It was only after the passage of many years that advances in developmental genetics stimulated the present revival of the theory (to be examined in detail in a later section of this review).\n\nThe nemertean theory\n\nIn 1883, Hubrecht [54] made the next attempt to turn invertebrates into vertebrates. He chose nemertean-like ancestors (not requiring dorsoventral inversion) to begin his scenario. The nemertean gastrula (Fig. 2j) has two invaginations, one becoming the archenteron and the other becoming the proboscis; at the same stage, numerous mesenchyme cells immigrate into the blastocoel. Subsequently, a through gut forms, and mesenchyme cells condense around the proboscis (Fig. 2k). Schizocoely then produces a proboscis sheath and proboscis coelom containing a few residual mesenchyme cells (Fig. 2l). Hubrecht\u2019s conversion of a nemertian into a protovertebrate begins as the proboscis withdraws anteriorly from the proboscis coelom (Fig. 2m, arrow). The transition is completed when the mesenchyme cells in the proboscis coelom greatly multiply and form a cartilaginous notochord. At the same time, the remnant of the proboscis becomes the anterior hypophysis, while the two main lateral nerves migrate dorsally and fuse to form the dorsal nerve cord (Fig. 2n). Twentieth century revisions of the nemertean hypothesis [55] all retained Hubrecht\u2019s way of making the vertebrate notochord. Since then, however, all versions of the nemertean scenario have been rendered highly improbable due to robustly supported molecular phylogenies relegating nemerteans to the Lophoptrochozoa, at a considerable phylogenetic distance from the chordates [56].\n\nThe original enteropneust scenario\n\nAlthough earlier biologists had vaguely suggested that enteropneust hemichordates might be precursors of the vertebrates, Bateson, in 1886, was the first to present a detailed scenario for the conversion [57]. No dorsoventral inversion of the body axis was required (Fig. 3a). The notochord homolog was the stomochord, a short diverticulum projecting anteriorly from the buccal cavity and acting as a fulcrum to facilitate undulatory swimming. Disconcertingly, however, the hemichordate stomochord is regionally restricted and lacks any intimate association with the locomotory musculature [58]. During much of the twentieth century, Bateson\u2019s scenario was occasionally revived, in whole or in part (for instance, Garstang appropriated the stomochord-to-notochord conversion [59]), although by no means broadly accepted. More recently, however, advances in developmental genetics have led to modern versions of the enteropneust theory, as will be discussed in a subsequent section of this review.\n\nFig. 3 Notochords in phylogeny: enteropneusts, arthropods, phoronids, and cnidarians. a Enteropneust scenario (after Bateson [57]); the notochord homolog is the stomochord (sc); m mouth; a anus. b The inverted arthropod theory (after Patten [62]) with the notochord (no) ventral to the nerve cord (nc); m mouth; a anus. c, d The diplochord hypothesis (after Masterman [64]); c shows only the digestive system of the actinotroch larva (m mouth; a anus) with a pair of diplochords (dc).

After inversion (m, looped arrow), the anatomy becomes chordate-like as the original mouth disappears (asterisk), a new mouth (nm) opens and the old subesophageal ganglion migrates dorsally (arrows). In addition, the pygochord becomes the notochord (no) underlying the dorsal nerve cord (dnc) Full size image\n\nFurther classical scenarios: arthropod, phoronid, and cnidarian notochords\n\nIn 1890, Patten published an extensive scenario for deriving vertebrates from inverted arthropods [60]. At the time, arthropods and annelids were considered to be close relatives\u2014incorrectly, it later turned out [61] \u2014so Patten\u2019s scenario bears a general resemblance to the annelid theory. He derived the notochord from a medial strand of tissue associated with the forming nerve cord. The strand then hollowed out and temporarily formed a spinal artery that transitioned to a notochord when its lumen filled with vesicular cells (Fig. 3b). He reiterated his earlier ideas in a 1912 book [62] that had an almost universally negative reception [63], and his work has been largely ignored ever since.\n\nIn 1897, Masterman proposed that phoronid larvae (called actinotrochs) had notochord-like structures [64] in the form of two small diverticula arising on either side of the developing esophagus (Fig. 3c, d). These diverticula, which he termed diplochords, although not medially located, reminded him of the hemichordate stomochord. He thus concluded that diplochords were homologs of the vertebrate notochord. Subsequently, Kemna [65] accepted the diplochord idea, while Roule [66] modified it slightly by proposing that the evolutionary precursor of the notochord was an unpaired diverticulum arising from the larval foregut of phoronids. Although adult phoronids lack a notochord, Masterman\u2019s proposed notochord homologs were given credence during most of the twentieth century because they fit well with other morphologic features seeming to unite phoronids with deuterostomes [67]. More recently, however, molecular phylogenetic analysis has convincingly moved the phoronids from the deuterostomes to the lophotrochozoans [68], and the putative notochordal nature of the diverticula of phoronid larvae is all but forgotten.\n\nIn 1905, Lameere [69] published a scheme for notochord evolution that started with cnidarians\u2014specifically with a creature resembling a sea anemone. A modern sea anemone has an oblong mouth opening into a sleeve-shaped pharynx projecting downward (aborally) into the gastrovascular cavity (Fig. 3e). Lameere commenced his scenario by zipping the sea anemone mouth shut until only a small opening remained at one end; simultaneously, he zipped the aboral exit of the pharynx shut in the opposite direction, leaving only a small opening (neurenteric canal) leading to the gastrovascular cavity (Fig. 3f), thereby converting the pharynx into a hollow dorsal nerve cord with a neuropore (functioning as small mouth through which water and food particles enter the animal). As already mentioned, the opening between the nerve cord and gastrovascular cavity became a neurenteric canal, permitting water to enter the gastrovascular cavity. To account for water outflow, Lameere surmised that an exit pore (comparable to the club-shaped gland of amphioxus) opened on the right antero-ventral side of the body (Fig. 3g). At this stage, the creature was still only a very early chordate comparable to an amphioxus larva without mouth, anus, or gill slits. A notochord then originated from an accumulation of cartilage-like cells (Fig. 3g) in the mesogloea between the nerve cord and the gastrovascular cavity. Eventually, the vertebrate condition was attained when a mouth, anus, and gill slits developed to connect the cavity of the gastrovascular cavity with the surrounding water.\n\nThe last of the classical scenarios for notochord evolution was proposed by Gaskell, remembered today mainly for his fundamental discoveries in physiology [70]. In the late 1880s, Gaskell had to give up his laboratory work to care for his chronically ill wife [71]. To keep himself intellectually engaged at home, he began developing a right-side up arthropod scenario for the origin of the vertebrates [72], eventually adding his ideas about notochord evolution [73]. He starts with an uninvited arthropod (Fig. 3h) in which the ventral nerve cord tissues migrate to (Fig. 3i) and surround the digestive tract, thus converting it to a hollow dorsal nerve cord while a secondary gut invaginators from the ventral surface of the body (Fig. 3j). Later, the secondary gut is filled with solid tissue to become the notochord while the tips of the paired appendages all along the body fuse in the ventral midline to enclose the definitive (tertiary) gut (Fig. 3k). In 1908, Gaskell\u2019s book [74] summarizing his ideas was not well received. One reviewer [75] wrote \u201cThe momentous problem of vertebrate beginnings is still \u2018on the knees of the gods.\u2019 We gravely doubt whether Gaskell\u2019s book will be of great value in dislodging it.\u201d\n\nNotochords when big-picture phylogeny was out of style: World War I to 1960s\n\nDuring much of the twentieth century, biologists were mainly concerned with evolution at relatively low taxonomic levels, and big-picture phylogeny was rarely considered. One exception was Gisl\u00e9n, who thought that the notochord had its beginnings in Palaeozoic echinoderms that ultimately evolved into vertebrates [76]. He began his scenario with the larval stage of an ancient echinoderm and proposed that the middle of the three coeloms on the left side (the hydrocele) was the precursor of the vertebrate notochord. His complex chain of reasoning, which we will not develop here, featured a bizarre amphioxus-like intermediate that ate with its neuropore and defecated through its mouth.\n\nFollowing Gisl\u00e9n [76], several biologists have returned to the idea that the echinoderm hydrocoel might be a homolog of the vertebrate notochord [77, 78]. Until recently, such a coelomic origin seemed to be supported by the structure of the fully developed notochord in the tail of many tunicates\u2014namely, an elongated epithelial bag surrounding a fluid-filled lumen [42]. Now, however, molecular phylogenies have rearranged the major taxa of chordates to locate amphioxus as the sister group to tunicates plus vertebrates [79]. Because neither amphioxus nor vertebrates have a coelom-like notochord at any stage of development [80], it is likely that the coelom-like arrangement is a peculiarity of tunicates and not a fundamental chordate property. This, in turn, makes it unlikely that echinoderms ever had a homolog of the notochord. For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that Jefferies [81] reconstructed a notochord running down the axis of what he considered to be the tail of fossils that he termed calcichordates. In contrast, more recent opinion [82] considers that such fossils represent echinoderms that had elements of the water vascular system occupying the position of the previously proposed notochord.\n\nThe beginnings of molecular phylogeny and developmental genetics and revival of interest in notochord evolution\n\nDuring middle decades of the twentieth century, most evolutionary biologists were concerned only with small-scale evolution, and most developmental biologists were not interested in evolution at any scale. In spite of this, the latter gave particular attention to the notochord\u2014as a derivative of some cells of the primary organizer and as a source of substances influencing neighboring tissues [83]. In that era, frustratingly little progress was made in understanding these phenomena because the techniques for characterizing and manipulating minute amounts of nucleic acids and proteins were not available. By the 1960s, however, the situation began to improve. Evolutionary biologists took a new interest in big-picture phylogeny after Zuckerkandl and Pauling introduced molecular sequence-based tree construction [84] and, two decades later, the discovery of the homeobox [85] reinterested developmental biologists in evolutionary issues and the field of developmental evolutionary biology (devo-evo) emerged.\n\nIn 1994, N\u00fcbler-Jung and Arendt published the first devo-evo paper concerned, in part, with notochord evolution [86]. Then, in 1996, they followed with a more detailed scenario that began with an annelid-like ancestor that transitioned, via an enteropneust-like intermediate, to a chordate [87]. They argued on the basis of neuroanatomy and developmental genetics that the Dohrn/Semper annelid theory was preferable to Bateson\u2019s enteropneust theory. Their key idea was that the nervous system of enteropneust-like ancestors of the chordates was arranged like that of annelids and arthropods (Fig. 3l); thus, dorsoventral inversion of the body would result in a chordate-like nervous system [87, 88]. As a corollary, they denied Bateson\u2019s stomochord/notochord homology, and proposed instead that the notochord evolved at the enteropneust stage from the pygochord (Fig. 3l, m), a conspicuous midventral mesentery originally discovered by Spengel [89] and named by Willey [90]. However, the pygochord appears to be a peculiarity of only a few enteropneust species [91], and its homology with the chordate notochord has never been widely accepted.\n\nThe revived annelid scenario and the axochord hypothesis\n\nArendt carried forward the work started with N\u00fcbler-Jung, using molecular genetic methods to gain insights into the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition. Among other things, he compared such developmental genetic features as regionalization of Hox genes [92] and nerve cell specification [93, 94] between annelids and chordates. His results led him to reject his initial suggestion of an enteropneust bridge between annelids and chordates [87] and to propose instead a revived version of the Dohrn/Semper annelid scenario. To account for the origin of the notochord, Arendt and his colleagues began with an annelid-like creature that had a midventral longitudinal muscle closely associated with the nerve cord. They termed this muscle the axochord and proposed that it is the evolutionary precursor of the chordate notochord [95]. The proposed homology is mainly based on the involvement of similar transcription factors (brachyury, foxA, foxD, twist, soxD, and soxE) and signaling molecules (noggin and hedgehog) in the formation of both structures. In response to this proposal, Hejnol and Lowe [96] cautioned that the two structures may be homoplasies and not homologies, partly because most of the genes they express in common are involved in the development other tissues as well. The homology has also been questioned [97] because there is no evidence that the axochord synthesizes signaling proteins comparable to those produced by amphioxus and vertebrate notochords. In response to such criticisms, Arendt and others are expanding their search for possible axochord-like structures in a wide spectrum of invertebrate phyla [98]. It has even been suggested that an axochord-like muscle should be sought in enteropneusts [99], although the older literature does not mention any likely candidate structures running in either the dorsal or the ventral midline of the trunk [100].\n\nThe revived enteropneust scenario and notochords as chordate novelties\n\nAdvances in molecular development not only led to a revived annelid theory, they also prompted Lowe to propose a new (and much modified) version of the enteropneust theory [101, 102]. In the original enteropneust scenario [57], Bateson postulated that the ancestor of the vertebrates already had many vertebrate-like features, including a notochord homolog. In contrast, Lowe proposed an enteropneust-like ancestor with a relatively uncomplicated morphology, lacking, among other things, a central nervous system. Surprisingly, in spite of their seeming morphological simplicity, enteropneusts proved to have an ectoderm divided into complex gene expression domains markedly congruent with those in the central nervous system of developing chordates. This led to proposals about how the simple tissues of an enteropneust-like ancestor could give rise to the complex organ systems of chordates; here, however, we will focus only on what is relevant for notochord evolution. In the view of Lowe and his associates, enteropneusts lack any structure homologous to the chordate notochord. Instead, they proposed that the \u201ctrue\u201d notochord evolved de novo in a basal chordate. They further speculated that this novel structure arose from cells running along the mid-dorsal side of the archenteron that took over and accentuated some of the signaling functions from ancestral endoderm and ectoderm [97].\n\nMore recently, a basic tenet of the revived enteropneust scenario\u2014namely, the proposed morphological simplicity of the ancestor of the chordates\u2014has required some revision. For example, it appears that enteropneusts actually do have a central nervous system [103, 104]. In addition, there has even been an indication that the stomochord might, after all, be homologous to the vertebrate notochord because both are the source of hedgehog signaling that could conceivably influence differentiation in the central nervous system [105]. However, this possible stomochord/notochord homology was not well supported when further work [106] failed to demonstrate the expression of additional enteropneust genes homologous to those involved upstream and downstream from notochord formation in chordates. In sum, the controversy over whether enteropneusts have any notochord precursors (either stomochord, or pygochord, or axochord) is far from a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nLowe and his colleagues were not the first to consider that the notochord is a chordate novelty. In 1955, Berrill proposed a scheme for the origin of the vertebrates [107] that resembled the older ideas of Garstang [59] in many respects\u2014but not for the origin of the notochord. Whereas Garstang proposed the structure was derived from the hemichordate stomochord, Berrill thought that the notochord first appeared as a novelty in an ancestral tunicate larva [107]. The larva in question, which was originally tailless, suddenly acquired a notochord by a mutation that caused vacuolization along the roof of the archenteron. The new notochord pushed out a larval tail that became motile when axial muscles, also novelties, differentiated in the same body region.\n\nBerrill\u2019s focus on tunicates was understandable because, until recently, they were considered the basal chordate group. However, even after the rearrangement the chordates such that amphioxus is a sister to a tunicate plus vertebrate clade [79], tunicates remain important for elucidating notochord evolution [108]. In tunicates, as in other chordates, brachyury genes are required for many aspects of notochord development. Because tunicates are favorable material for working out gene regulatory networks, good progress has been made in elucidating how brachyury is involved in notochord development. Satoh et al. [109] have pointed out that, if one takes the position that the notochord is a chordate novelty, much of the problem of its evolutionary origin can be reduced to two questions. First, how did gene regulatory networks upstream from brachyury change to endow the gene, already involved in mesodermal differentiation of animals generally, with a new notochordal expression domain in chordates, and, second, what gene cascades link the expression of brachyury with the ultimate histodifferentiation of the definitive notochord? For ascidian tunicates, it is now possible to outline important reactions in the gene regulatory networks upstream and downstream from notochord-expressed brachyury [110]. Moreover, it is likely that homologous brachyury-related gene networks operate in other chordates [111], although such networks are as yet less well elucidated. Conversely, those who take the opposing position that the notochord originated deep within the tree of invertebrate life are also studying gene regulatory networks involved in the development of such structures as the annelid axochord [98] as possible support for their alternative scenario.\n\nConclusions and perspectives\n\nThe evolutionary origin of the notochord remains an open question linked to the even broader uncertainty about the origin of the chordates [30]. From the current state of knowledge, it would be premature to decide whether the notochord is strictly limited to the chordates or is an ancient structure with homologs stretching back to a much earlier origin among the invertebrates. There has, however, been a useful advance that helps clarify thinking about notochord evolution: namely, the rearrangement of subphyla within the phylum Chordata such that amphioxus is now the sister group of the tunicate plus vertebrate clade [79]. The new arrangement makes it easier to accept tunicate features as derived instead of basal within the chordates. At the genetic level, tunicates are quite remarkable\u2014they are characterized by very rapid evolution, a lack of synteny with other chordates, the organization of many coding sequences into operons, and a strong tendency to discard key developmental genes [112]. In the light of all these peculiarities, it is surprising that tunicates have retained such a clearly chordate-like phenotype [113] (this emphasizes how poorly we still understand genotype/phenotype relationships in general). In contrast, the developmental genetics of amphioxus and vertebrates are broadly similar (Table 2). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that, in comparison to tunicates, amphioxus might give a more accurate idea of the early history of the chordate notochord. Progress toward deciding between the current conflicting scenarios for notochord evolution will probably require a detailed knowledge of gene regulatory networks in a wide spectrum of animals, which will not be accomplished quickly. For the present, a more practicable approach could be more thorough studies of all aspects of the biology of enteropneusts, animals that figure large in chordate origin scenarios."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/christian.heinrich_pander/2506963", "page_content": "Christian Heinrich Pander\n\nbiologist explorer paleontologist Zoologist\n\nJuly 24, 1794 (age 71) Riga, Latvia\n\nIn 1817 he received his doctorate from the University of W\u00fcrzburg, and spent several years (1827\u20131842), performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (German: Zarnikau) on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga.

In the more derived Chordates, the Vertebrates, the notochord is replaced by the vertebral column, and becomes the cartilaginous substance between vertebrae. The notochord can be seen in the image below, of a lancelet. Lancelets are some of the simplest Chordates.\n\nThe notochord extends the length of the organism, and allows for muscles to attach. This allows the lancelet to swim in fast bursts. Like the lancelet, all Chordate organisms develop a notochord at some point, although they may lose it later in life. Tunicates, for instance, are marine organisms which attach to the bottom of the ocean and filter feed. While the adult form has no need for the notochord, the larval tunicate uses the notochord to swim to potential settling sites. Other species retain the notochord throughout life, and do not grow a vertebral column.\n\nThese animals are known as invertebrate chordates. This group includes the lancelets, tunicates, and even some large fish like the sturgeon and coelacanth. In these large fish, the notochord can be as long as they are (around 3-4 feet) and will be really thick, almost half of an inch. These fish use this huge notochord as vertebrates use their spine. The only real difference is what it is made of and how it protects the spinal cord.\n\nIn vertebrates, the bony vertebrae grow around the spinal cord, protecting it on all sides. Animals with only a notochord lack this protection, as the spinal cord sits between the notochord and the skin. Animals like the sturgeon and coelacanth have developed armored plates and thick skin to protect their spinal cord and notochord from damage. Vertebrates convert the notochord into the cushioning intervertebral discs, which protect the vertebrae from smashing together. By the time a human is around 4 years old, however, the original notochord has been entirely replaced in the spine with other materials.\n\nNotochord Structure\n\nThe notochord is made of a number of different structural molecules including glycoproteins and resembles cartilage in many ways. When you cut across the notochord, and view the cross section under a microscope, it appears as a series on concentric rings. These different sized rings that surround each other are layers of the notochord, and are made from various structural molecules to give the notochord both strength and elasticity.\n\nThe glycoproteins and other structural molecules extend from cells, which are spaced far apart in the notochord. Each of these cells has a large vacuole, which it can pressurize. When pressurized, the cells push against one another and the surrounding structural materials. This creates an extra rigid notochord, which is necessary for swimming quickly.\n\nNotochord Function\n\nThe strength of the notochord makes it a very useful structure to attach muscles to. Muscles need places for attachment in order to flex properly. By attaching muscles down the length of the notochord, small invertebrates can use muscles all over their body to swim. Even in the larger fishes which rely on a notochord, it provides enough support for most of the muscles of their body to attach to. The turgor pressure created by the cells of the notochord make it extra rigid. While this provided enough support for many organisms, the vertebrates took this body plan one step further with the spine. The spine increase the rigidity of the notochord by being made out of bone, and further protects the spinal cord by fully encompassing it.\n\nIt has also been found that the notochord serves important signaling functions during normal vertebrate embryogenesis. A notochord secretes proteins which stimulate the formation of organ systems. This process, called organogenesis, starts when the embryo is a hollow ball of cells called the gastrula. This tiny ball has three layers, and a notochord is derived from the middle layer, or mesoderm. Once created, the notochord begins secreting a number of chemical signals which further the process of organogenesis. Eventually bones form and begin to create the spine. The notochord gets sandwiched between these vertebrae, and provide protection from the bones rubbing or smashing together.\n\nQuiz\n\n1. What is the difference between a notochord and a spine?\n\nA. There is no difference\n\nB. A spine is made of bone, a notochord of cartilage\n\nC. The notochord becomes the spine\n\n\n\nAnswer to Question #1 B is correct. The main difference is the type of material each is made of. A notochord does not become the spine, but rather fills the spaces between vertebrae in some animals.\n\n2. Where is the notochord located in a typical Chordate?\n\nA. Under (ventral to) the spinal cord\n\nB. Over (dorsal to) the spinal cord\n\nC. Between the spine and the spinal cord\n\n\n\nAnswer to Question #2 A is correct. The notochord is found under the spinal cord. Remember that unlike a spine, the notochord provides very little protection to the spinal cord. Also remember that animals with a spine no longer retain a notochord. It has been incorporated into the spine.\n\n3. Which of the following is NOT a function of the notochord?\n\nA. Support\n\nB. Hormone Secretion\n\nC. Digestion\n\n\n\nAnswer to Question #3 C is correct. The notochord is not involved in digestion in any way. It does provide support, and has been found to release protein hormones during development.\n\nReferences"}]}
