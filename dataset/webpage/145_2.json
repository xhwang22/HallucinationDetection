Having won the second season of Britain's Got Talent with his interpretation of Singing in the Rain, George has gone on to star in major films (Street Dance 2 and Street Dance 3D) and regular roles in Emmerdale (ITV), Waterloo Road (BBC), and Mount Pleasant (Sky). Playing the role of local bad boy Reecey, George joins previously announced cast members Deena Payne (Kath Casey), Jason Kajdi (Joe Casey) and Sophie Matthew (Sarah).\n\nOn the night of his 16th birthday, Joe Casey takes the girl of his dreams, Sarah, out on their first date. In an effort to impress her with bravado, Joe breaks into a building site overlooking his home on Casey Street. When the police turn up, a split-second decision forces him to choose between himself and his heart as the story splits in two: one which sees Joe stay to face the music, and the other which sees him flee and leave Sarah to run from the police. As two very different paths unfold before him, the consequences of that choice will change his life forever.\n\nThe full cast includes:\n\nGeorge Sampson as Reecey\n\nDeena Payne as Kath Casey\n\nJason Kajdi as Joe Casey\n\nSophie Matthew as Sarah\n\nCallum McArdle as Dad\n\nBilly Roberts as Emmo\n\nWill Haswell as Lewis\n\nEtisyai Philip as Billie\n\nJessica Niles as Angie\n\nBobby Windebank as Mr. Pressman/Ensemble\n\nMatthew McDonald as Callum/Ensemble\n\nAlex Tranter as On-stage swing\n\nMichael Nelson as On-stage swing\n\nFrances Dee as On-stage swing\n\nLottie Henshall as Ensemble\n\nGeorge Sampson found his passion for performing by busking on the streets of Manchester at the age of twelve. After being spotted as an exceptional talent and encouraged to audition for Britain's Got Talent, he rose to fame at the age of fourteen after winning the programme's second series in 2008 with his interpretation of Singing in the Rain. Following the success of the show, he made his stage debut in the West End hip-hop musical Into the Hoods\n\nGeorge also starred as Eddie in the feature films Street Dance 3D and Street Dance 2, where he found his love for acting. He then went on to star in three series of the award-winning BBC drama Waterloo Road, playing bad boy Kyle Stack. Having discovered a talent for acting work, George began working on Mount Pleasant (Sky) playing the role of Gary, and also in Emmerdale (ITV) as troublemaker, Ryan.\n\nOUR HOUSE was first staged at the Cambridge Theatre in London's West End from October 2002 to August 2003 and won the 2003 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical.

Stars including Michael Ball, Elaine Paige and Clive Rowe will be joining Maria Friedman to perform a selection of songs from some of the most celebrated musicals to have won \u2013 or been nominated for \u2013 the prestigious awards. The show\u2019s director, and holder of a record six nominations in the Best Actress in a Musical category, Maria Friedman has picked her 10 favourite Olivier winners, and tells us why they are special to her.\n\nDame Joan Plowright and Sir Laurence Olivier: Saturday, Sunday, Monday\n\nLaurence Olivier won the Society of London Theatre\u2019s special award in 1979\n\nThe awards were renamed in Lord Olivier\u2019s honour in 1984, so it seems appropriate to start with one of my favourite of his performances. Olivier and his wife Dame Joan Plowright were electric in the National Theatre\u2019s production of Saturday, Sunday, Monday. It was the first time my mother took the entire family to the theatre. I\u2019ll never forget the smell of the big pot of ragu that was cooking on the stage. Afterwards we went out for spaghetti bolognaise \u2013 it remains my favourite dish.\n\nA Chorus Line\n\nThe original production won best new musical in 1976, the first year of the awards\n\nA Chorus Line is one of the most dazzling productions to ever grace the West End. It is a story of artistic struggle which all performers can relate to, plus the ground-breaking staging and choreography make it unique and ever-relevant. Little did I know as an 18-year-old that 20 years later I would be performing What I Did for Love with its composer Marvin Hamlisch at the piano.\n\nSweeney Todd\n\nThe original 1980 London production won best new musical in 1980, subsequent productions won best musical revival in 1994 and 2013\n\nThis is the musical that changed my life and started a life-long love of the work of Stephen Sondheim. The 1980 production, which won Best New Musical, and the subsequent revivals are a testament to the power of his music and lyrics. With Sondheim, every note and every word matters. After the first ten minutes I felt like the production had projected me into space, it was an intense emotional reaction. At the time I looked up at the girl singing the top c and knew that I wanted to be her. Later I sang the role of Mrs. Lovett opposite Bryn Terfel.\n\nMark Rylance: Twelfth Night\n\nRylance\u2019s performance in Tim Carroll\u2019s all-male production of Twelfth Night was nominated for an award in 2003. Rylance has won the best actor Olivier twice, for Much Ado About Nothing (1994) and Jerusalem (2010)\n\nA two-time Olivier-award winner, Mark Rylance is one of the UK\u2019s most versatile stage actors. From his invigorating performance in Jerusalem to his uproarious portrayal of Olivia in Twelfth Night, he has a remarkable gift for bringing the most complex characters to life.\n\nKing Charles III\n\nBest new play, 2015\n\nMike Bartlett\u2019s King Charles III was provocative, wickedly entertaining and superbly acted. The play twists from moving to outrageously funny. I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\n\n\nLa Cage Aux Folles\n\nBest musical revival, 2009\n\nLe Cage aux Folles was reborn in 2008, the production at the Playhouse theatre was joyous and packed a punch. This revival was full of pizzazz but it was also timely. I\u2019ll never forget seeing my husband performing as the alternate Albin singing \u201cI Am What I Am\u201d . The song remains anthemic plea for tolerance and acceptance.\n\nBook of Mormon\n\nThe cast of The Book of Mormon perform at the Olivier awards\n\nRecipient of four awards in 2014, including best new musical\n\nThe Book of Mormon is one of the best nights out in the West End. Subversive and sharply written, it\u2019s a musical that never lets up. It is more of rock concert and it is amazing to see audiences let their hair down in a theatre.\n\nMerrily We Roll Along\n\nBest musical revival, 2014\n\nIt was thrilling to be a part of this revival and to see the incredibly gifted cast triumph. The production received seven nominations in 2014.\n\nEileen Atkins\n\nEileen Atkins in Honour, at the Cottesloe theatre, 2003. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nAtkins won best actress twice (for Honour in 2004 and The Unexpected Man in 1999)\n\n\n\nDame Eileen Atkins is in a class of her own. To pick just one performance is an impossible task \u2013 she has risen to every role. Her Olivier award-winning performances in Honour, The Unexpected Man and Cymbeline were spellbinding.\n\nJudi Dench\n\nActress of the year in a revival for Macbeth, 1977; actress of the year in a new play for Pack of Lies, 1983; best actress for Antony and Cleopatra, 1987; best actress for Absolute Helland best actress in a musical for A Little Night Music, 1996\n\nDame Judi Dench has had an unrivalled stage career. From Macbeth to A Little Night Music she has performed the most iconic roles, always with skill and elegance. Her rendition of Send in the Clowns in Sondheim\u2019s A Little Night Music was devastatingly beautiful."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/theater/the-oliviers-vs-the-tonys-mixed-rewards-for-shows.html", "page_content": "LONDON \u2014 This Sunday night, the Olivier Awards will honor the best of London commercial theater. There\u2019s a long history of Olivier-winning shows that went on to enjoy good fortune at Broadway\u2019s equivalent prizes, the Tony Awards: Four years ago, \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\u201d scooped a record-setting seven Oliviers before cleaning up with five Tonys when it transferred to New York. And last year, the Tony-coronated \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d repeated its New York best musical triumph with a London win in the same category.\n\nDoes that spell likely success for the Broadway-bound productions of \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d both of which are up for a slew of Oliviers on Sunday?\n\nNot necessarily.

Previews begin for the David Byrne and Fatboy Slim musical June 17 in the Broadway Theatre ahead of its July 20 opening night.\n\nSalonga will play Aurora Aquino in a limited guest engagement July 11-August 13. Aurora is the mother of Ninoy Aquino (played in the show by Conrad Ricamora). Following her run, guest stars from the Philippines will take over the role.\n\nThough Salonga has previously starred on Broadway in Les Mis\u00e9rables, Miss Saigon, Flower Drum Song, Allegiance, and Once On This Island, this will be Salonga's first time playing a Filipino role on the Main Stem. The performance will also be a homecoming for Salonga, who made her Broadway debut at The Broadway Theatre in 1991 as \u00c9ponine in Les Mis\u00e9rables shortly before starring in Miss Saigon in the same theatre. Here Lies Love will be Salonga's first Broadway producing credit.\n\nAlready announced in the cast are Jose Llana (The King and I, The 25th Annual Putnam Country Spelling Bee) and Ricamora (How to Get Away with Murder, The King and I) who will reprise their Off-Broadway roles for the Broadway run. An international casting search is underway to select the show's remaining company of over 20 actors, including for its lead Imelda Marcos.\n\nThe disco musical tells the story of former Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos' and her family's rise and fall. Marcos was married to Ferdinand Marcos, the tenth president of the Philippines whose dictatorship lasted 20 years until 1986. During his regime, a Philippine senator Ninoy Aquino was the Marcos family's leading critic until being assassinated in 1983. His murder sparked the People Power Revolution which lead to the removal of the Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos from power.\n\nThe musical features a score by Grammy, Tony, and Oscar winner David Byrne and Grammy winner Fatboy Slim, with music by both and concept and lyrics by Byrne. Returning to the project are original director Alex Timbers (Moulin Rouge) and choreographer Annie-B Parson. The quartet, led by Timbers, have developed the musical over the course of a decade. Tom Gandey and J Pardo will also contribute additional music for the production which will feature an immersive dance club staging.\n\n\n\nFollowing its original run at The Public, Here Lies Love ran at the National Theater in London in 2014 and Seattle Rep in 2017. Each production was met with a variety of responses, and conversations have cropped up again on social media as attention returns to the musical with the upcoming Broadway run. In response to online criticism, the official Here Lies Love Broadway accounts on Twitter and Instagram published a lengthy statement which included the production's intentions in portraying this vulnerable moment in Filipino history onstage in 2023. Read more here.\n\nJoining the creative ream are music director J. Oconer Navarro, assistant director Billy Bustamante, assistant choreographer Ren\u00e9e Albulario, casting consultant Bobby Garcia, production stage manager Gregory T. Livoti, and assistant stage managers Ryan Gohsman and Sheryl Polancos.\n\nThe creative team for Here Lies Love already include Tony-nominated scenic designer David Korins, Tony-winning costume designer Clint Ramos, Tony-winning lighting designer Justin Townsend, sound designers M.L. Dogg and Cody Spencer, Tony-nominated projection designer Peter Nigrini, and cultural and community liaison Giselle \u201cG\u201d T\u00f6ngi. Casting is by Tara Rubin, Xavier Rubiano, and Gail Quintos. General management will be by Foresight Theatrical.\n\nHere Lies Love is produced on Broadway by Hal Luftig, Patrick Catullo, Diana DiMenna and Plate Spinner Productions, Clint Ramos, and Jose Antonio Vargas, with Aaron Lustbader serving as executive producer. They are joined by Lea Salonga, Bobby Garcia, Giselle \u201cG\u201d T\u00f6ngi, Celia Kaleialoha Kenney, Girlie Rodis, Miranda Gohh, Rob Laqui, Georgina Pazcoguin, Don Michael H.

month\u2019s ceremony.\n\nEddie Redmayne, the club\u2019s Emcee, and Jessie Buckley, who plays Sally Bowles, are in contention for best actor and best actress in a musical for their highly acclaimed performances.\n\nBut the show is up against the equally lauded revival of the classic Cole Porter musical Anything Goes, which smashed box office records at the Barbican last year when it grossed \u00a3717,000 in a week. The show has nine nominations, including best actress in a musical for Sutton Foster, and best actor in a musical for Robert Lindsay.\n\nBoth Cabaret and Anything Goes are nominated for best musical revival, along with Spring Awakening at the Almeida theatre in north London.\n\nLife of Pi, the stage version of Yann Martel\u2019s Booker-winning novel featuring giant puppets and extraordinary special effects, leads the field for plays, with nine nominations, including best new play. The seven performers who play the puppet tiger are all nominated for best actor in a supporting role.\n\nBest actress nomination \u2026 Lily Allen in 2:22 A Ghost Story. Photograph: Helen Murray\n\nLily Allen is nominated as best actress for her West End debut in 2:22 A Ghost Story \u2013 which is also nominated as best new play \u2013 along with Cush Jumbo for the title role in Hamlet at the Young Vic.\n\nThe National Theatre\u2019s production of Larry Kramer\u2019s The Normal Heart about the Aids epidemic in 1980s New York has five nominations, including best actor for Ben Daniels and best supporting actress for Liz Carr.\n\nBack to the Future \u2013 the Musical has seven nominations; Moulin Rouge! The Musical has five; and the Bob Marley musical Get Up, Stand Up! and Frozen get four apiece. Beverley Knight, who stars in The Drifters Girl, is among the nominees for best actress in a musical.\n\nPride and Prejudice* (*Sort of), the joyful all-female retelling of Jane Austen\u2019s classic novel that started life at the Tron in Glasgow, gets three nominations: best entertainment or comedy play, and two for best supporting actress. Despite positive reviews, the show was forced to close early in January after audiences plummeted due to Covid restrictions being reimposed.\n\nNominations for best director are Rebecca Frecknall for Cabaret, Michael Longhurst for Constellations, Kathleen Marshall for Anything Goes and Max Webster for Life of Pi.\n\nJulian Bird, the chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and executive producer of the Olivier awards, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s fantastic array truly demonstrates the breadth and diversity of London\u2019s world-leading theatre industry, and its extraordinary creativity and resilience during an extremely challenging period for our sector.\n\n\u201cAfter a two-year hiatus, we are delighted to be able to bring the theatre community together again to celebrate our brightest talents.\u201d\n\nThe awards ceremony takes place at the Royal Albert Hall on 10 April."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/theater/olivier-awards-winners-evan-hansen-salesman.html", "page_content": "Despite those big successes, this year\u2019s Oliviers were notable for the variety of winners. \u201cLeopoldstadt,\u201d Tom Stoppard\u2019s play about Jewish life in mid-20th-century Vienna, won for best new play. \u201cThis may be the Stoppard play for people who don\u2019t normally cotton to Stoppard,\u201d wrote Ben Brantley, in a laudatory review for The New York Times when the show opened in January. It had to shutter just two months later because of the coronavirus.\n\nA perhaps more surprising winner was \u201cCyrano de Bergerac\u201d at the Playhouse Theater, named best revival ahead of Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman.\u201d That play, starring Wendell Pierce as Willy Loman, received five nominations in March.\n\nIn the end, it only secured two awards, with Elliott and Cromwell winning best director for a production that brought race into the heart of Arthur Miller\u2019s play, and Sharon D. Clarke winning best actress for her performance as Linda, Willy\u2019s wife. Ben Brantley, in his review for The New York Times, called Clarke\u2019s portrayal \u201cmagnificent.\u201d She \u201ctransforms a character often portrayed as a whimpering doormat into a strong, self-aware woman who knows the choices she has made and is determined to honor them,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOther notable winners included Andrew Scott, who took home the best actor award for his performance as a self-obsessed actor in No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s \u201cPresent Laughter\u201d at the Old Vic. \u201cHe does not so much play the part of the vainglorious actor Garry Essendine as grasp it around the waist and do a hot-to-trot tango with it,\u201d Ann Treneman wrote of Scott in a review for The Times of London. \u201cHis panache fills the entire theater.\u201d\n\nThe Oliviers came at a hopeful moment for audiences in London. On Wednesday, the National Theater reopened for its first production since the coronavirus forced its closure in March. \u201cDeath of England: Delroy,\u201d a one-man show about a Black man examining his British identity, is being performed to a socially-distanced audience wearing face masks. Several West End productions are also scheduled to return in coming weeks under the same conditions, including \u201cSix,\u201d the hit musical about the ill-fated wives of King Henry VIII."}]}
