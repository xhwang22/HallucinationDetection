Who needs them, the detractors said, when you've got four majors and The Players?\n\nGolf in the Olympics? Ditto.\n\nThe FedEx Cup? What was wrong with the money list to determine the best players?\n\nThe First Tee? Don't we have PGA professionals to teach and grow the game?\n\nFinchem said there's only one thing to do in those situations.\n\n\"If you're in a leadership position, you do the research, involve the best and brightest from your staff and you set the goals,\" said the 74-year-old Finchem, who retired from the PGA Tour at the end of the 2016 season, following 22 years as the commissioner. \"If you've done your homework, proceeded correctly and made the right calls, they will have an impact.\"\n\nHOF MC:David Feherty will preside over World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony as Tiger Woods to be inducted\n\nGallery:World Golf Hall of Fame opens exhibit honoring Tiger Woods, Tim Finchem, Susie Maxwell Berning, Marion Hollins\n\n'He's the reason we're out here:' Tiger Woods' career takes center stage for World Golf Hall of Fame ceremony\n\nAnd Finchem, the son of a career Marine officer who built a legal and political career before getting involved in golf, will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday at the PGA Tour's Global Home because of the impact he made on multiple fronts.\n\nFinchem will join Tiger Woods, Susie Maxwell Berning and the late Marion Hollins in the induction ceremony, which will be held at 7 p.m. and aired by Golf Channel. He also joins his predecessor, Deane Beman, in going from Tour commissioner to the Hall of Fame.\n\nA player on the Tour's policy board famously told Finchem that Beman had left him with a high-powered luxury car when he retired in 1994.\n\n\"All you need to do is keep it filled with high-test,\" the player said.\n\nFinchem did more than that. Under his direction, the Tour's total purses jumped from less than $60 million per year in 1994 to more than $250 million by 2006. The World Golf Championships and the FedEx Cup playoffs ensured the best players in the world would be on the same golf course the same week more often. And he took further steps to enhance The Players Championship, renovating the course in 2006, building the new clubhouse and bumping the purse to keep it the most lucrative in golf.\n\nThere are even critics of the success the Tour had under Finchem. Tiger Woods, they say, should get the bulk of the credit after he burst on the scene and went on to win 15 majors, two Players and 82 Tour titles, transforming the game of golf into a more athletic pursuit open to anyone of any race or background who could shoot the scores.\n\nFinchem will never deny that Woods being the game's top player for 20 of his 22 years as the commissioner was a huge factor, especially on the three new TV deals that were negotiated on Finchem's watch.\n\nBut Finchem had the foresight and business acumen to take advantage of Woods' dominance, such as involving Woods and his father Earl heavily in the launching of The First Tee, the World Golf Foundation's initiative to make golf more accessible and affordable to youth in at-risk areas and situations.\n\nThe First Tee is celebrating its 25th year with 150 worldwide chapters, 10,000 schools in its program to make golf part of a P.E. curriculum and more than 3 million kids reached per year through golf and its Life Skills and educational programs.\n\n\"There's no question about his impact,\" Finchem said of Woods. \"And there's no question that going forward, Tiger will have even more of an impact if he wants to be involved and show leadership more than he already has. His presence in anything related to golf is incredibly strong.\"\n\nFinchem was asked jokingly two years ago what the sport would have looked like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a much more difficult job,\u201d he admitted.\n\nFinchem expanded the international reach of the Tour through the WGC events, the Presidents Cup, developmental tours in China, South American and Canada, taking Tour events to Mexico, Japan, Korea and China, and finally throwing the weight of the Tour and the World Golf Foundation behind the drive to return golf to the Olympics.\n\nFinchem said the secret to success is never admitting that you\u2019ve been as successful as you\u2019re going to get.\n\n\"You always ask yourself, 'is there a better way for this to work?'\" Finchem said. \"Asking that question has resulted in hard work at organizing and working together with various organizations in golf and our international activity in golf. The more we focused on that, the more we learned, and the more we learned the more effective we were.\"\n\nFinchem, who graduated from the University of Richmond in 1969 (he had a debate scholarship) and got his law degree from Virginia, had a practice in Virginia Beach and got involved in local politics, moving quickly to the national scene when he worked President Jimmy Carter's campaign in 1976, then served on President Carter's Office of Economic Affairs.\n\nFinchem was later the national campaign chairman for Walter Mondale when he ran against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nHe started at the PGA Tour as the vice-president of business affairs and quickly climbed the ladder to be Beman's successor, serving as chief operating officer of the Tour and then deputy commissioner.\n\n\"He was the right guy at the right time,\" Beman said. \"He was always there to back up and do the things that needed to be done. He was a good administrator and understood the legal issues ... very adept at analyzing everything from every side.\"\n\nMonahan said Tiger Woods provided the punch. Finchem maximized it.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" Monahan said when it was announced in March of 2020 that Finchem would enter the Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/17597649/tim-finchem-rich-legacy-pga-tour-saw-financial-windfall-tenure-commissioner", "page_content": "ATLANTA -- Consider it fitting that what was billed as the final \"formal\" end-of-season speech of Tim Finchem's career was held Tuesday morning at the Tour Championship in something called the FedEx hospitality venue.\n\nThat's not a knock on the outgoing PGA Tour commissioner, who is poised to retire at year's end after more than 22 years on the job. It's just the opposite.\n\nFinchem will be remembered for ushering in the Tiger Woods era, capitalizing financially on the frenzy, and maintaining that boon through global economic crises and the downturn of Woods' career. He will be remembered for inventing a season-ending playoff system that created not only a viable conclusion but also greater monetary windfalls for his membership. He will be remembered for overseeing a transition of the tour from a pleated-pants, country-club set to a promising alternative for any athletic kid who would've previously opted for other endeavors.\n\nAll of these rivers flow into the same ocean. The greatest legacy of Finchem's career is money -- securing it for his tour, increasing it for his players, and producing more of it from various sources than ever before.\n\nTim Finchem, who soon will retire from his role as PGA Tour commissioner, addresses the media at East Lake Golf Club, site of this week's Tour Championship. Stan Badz/PGA TOUR\n\nAnd so, yes, it's fitting that his final address occurred at the FedEx hospitality venue, the name alone epitomizing the intrinsic value that the commissioner has heaped upon the tour over the past two decades.\n\nNot that he's buying any of it.\n\nWhile seated in the swanky suite off the new 18th hole sponsored by a company that will reward a lone playoff champion with $10 million later this week, Finchem took the honorable road. Asked about the greatest legacy of his tenure, he didn't mention anything about \"financial impact\" or \"economic progress\" or so many other money-related phrases he's so often repeated over the years. Instead, he pointed to his people.\n\n\"I'm proudest about the quality of our team and the interface with the players,\" he answered. \"Working with these people is just a fabulous experience. Watching their growth, the number of good people that have come to us, has been really rewarding. If you have that kind of strength, then good things happen. So I'm really comfortable with watching the transition now going forward and what's going to happen. I think some of the changes that are already being made, even before I step aside, are really, really good changes.\"\n\nAgain, it's honorable. It's also a bit misguided.\n\nLet's allow the numbers to do the talking. When Finchem took over for Deane Beman during the 1994 season, there were 44 events on the schedule. The total combined prize money was $56.4 million, with a top winner's share of $540,000. This year? With 46 events, the prize money is $320.4 million and the greatest winner's share is $1.89 million.\n\nThat's a 568 percent increase in total prize money and a 350 percent increase in the highest winning paycheck while adding just two events to the calendar.\n\nAs if to only further this point, most of this year's winners have earned more than the value of most entire tournament purses from the year Finchem became commissioner.\n\nFinchem congratulates Tigers Woods on winning the 2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. The PGA Tour cashed in on Woods' popularity and dominance during Finchem's tenure as commissioner. AP Photo/Phil Long\n\nSure, much of this is the direct correlation of Woods' rise as the game's most dominant player and one of the world's most popular athletes. But that doesn't mean marketing and selling a tour that included him was ever a foolproof proposition.\n\n\"By '98, Tiger was dominant,\" Finchem said Tuesday. \"So the questions were: How do you manage to grow the tour when your dominant player is playing 17 or 18 times and you have 46 events? How does that work? Well, between '96 and today, every one of those tournaments has grown in virtually every category almost every year. The lesson there is that fans like golf. They demonstrated that they like having a dominant player. ... [It] demonstrated that we can grow, and I think that's a good lesson for the future.\"\n\nIt's a future that soon won't include Finchem, at least not on a formal basis.\n\nHe maintained that he'll still be happy to serve as a consultant to incoming commissioner Jay Monahan, if need be. Finchem will work on his handicap, which is either a 4.3 or a 6.5, depending on which GHIN number you trust. And if you're wondering what to get for the man who has everything, he said the perfect retirement gift would be riding 18 holes in a golf cart at Latrobe Country Club alongside none other than Arnold Palmer.\n\nOther than that, Finchem can rest easy when he steps down, secure in the knowledge that he didn't just leave the PGA Tour in a better place than when he started, but he ushered it through one era and into the next, producing a level of financial stability that will endure as his lasting legacy -- even if he doesn't think so."}, {"url": "https://www.top-law-schools.com/tim-finchem-interview.html", "page_content": "Interview with Tim Finchem, Commissioner of the PGA Tour\n\nPublished October 2010\n\nTimothy W. Finchem received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Richmond in 1969 and his J.D. from the University of Virginia Law School in 1973. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the Carter White House as Deputy Advisor to the President in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979. Before becoming Commissioner of the PGA Tour in 1994, he served as Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour.\n\nTop Law Schools: Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today, Mr. Finchem.\n\nTim Finchem: I\u2019m happy to do it.\n\nTLS: Do you recall when you first developed an interest in the law?\n\nTF: I was in high school and I went on a field trip to watch a trial. I was a junior in high school, maybe 18 years old, and I thought that the lawyers were pitiful in terms of their presentation. I figured I could do better. Also, I generally had a political interest since I was 13 when Kennedy ran. [That race] got me interested in politics. And of course, if you\u2019re a young person, the idea of being lawyer sort of fits with politics and public policy. It\u2019s changed a little bit over the years, but it used to be that the vast majority of state legislators [were lawyers].\n\nTLS: So when you went off to law school, were you doing so with the intention of eventually being involved in public policy and government?\n\nTF: To some extent, yeah, I did, but I definitely wanted to be a lawyer. I wanted to litigate, and I wanted to be in the courtroom. My focus in law school was admiralty law because I wanted to litigate sea claims. I was in Norfolk, Virginia and anything related to ships was of interest to me. And so I started focusing more on admiralty. I practiced for about five years. But, in the back of my mind, I was always thinking that it would be helpful as a precursor maybe to some public policy involvement.\n\nTLS: What were those five years of practice like?\n\nTF: I worked for a plaintiff\u2019s personal injury-type law firm; they did some criminal law, and they did some business law and they did some real estate, but their key focus was representing the maritime trades. They represented seafarers, international union members out of Norfolk, they represented the ILA [International Longshoreman\u2019s Association]. So as a result, they got a lot of claims from individual members. It was maritime law with a focus on the plaintiff\u2019s side of personal injury.\n\nI did a mixed bag for three or four years with them and then I set up a general practice of my own with two other guys and the name of that firm was Croshaw, Finchem, and Williams. Croshaw is still practicing in Virginia Beach; Williams has been on the bench for about 25 years. I was doing campaigns then \u2013 I was involved in politics but after about five years of practice I left Virginia to work in Washington.\n\nTLS: Now, how did you get involved with the Carter Campaign?\n\nTF: Well, I was running a Senate race in VA in 1976. A fellow named Zumwalt, former Chief of Naval Operations, was challenging the long-time conservative incumbent Harry Byrd, the famous \u201cByrd Machine\u201d of Virginia. And I ran [Zumwalt\u2019s] campaign unsuccessfully the same year that Carter ran, and I think Carter lost the state by about 4,000 votes, so it was pretty close. We ran a decent race but during that campaign, Tim Smith \u2013 who I had known somewhat in law school \u2013 ran the Carter campaign in Richmond.\n\nWe interfaced a lot and I met, through Tim, some of the Carter people. And when Tim went to the White House in \u201977 after the inauguration, I\u2019d go up there a lot and hang out and met a bunch more people. One thing led to another, and in late \u201978 they asked me to come up.\n\nTLS: You were the Deputy Advisor of the Office of Economic Affiairs \u2013 what did your work entail in that role?\n\nTF: It\u2019s a fancy title, given the functions of the job, because basically I did intra- and inter-governmental coordination on economic initiatives in the White House, primarily at the federal level . . .[and also] in getting the state governmental apparatuses involved in federal government initiatives. At that point in time, one of the biggest problems with the Carter Administration and the economy was the rate of inflation. High interest rates and high inflation stemmed largely from the oil embargoes that preceded the Carter Administration. And actually, that\u2019s why he lost \u2013 the economy was just so bad because of that. We were fighting uphill on that stuff.\n\nBut I reported to Alfred Kahn, who is known as the great deregulator \u2013 he deregulated the airline industry, and he deregulated a couple other industries in his tenure. He\u2019s a great guy, he\u2019s a professor at Cornell now and was a good guy to be in that job for the president. But it was a great experience. And I left [one thing] out \u2013 when I went to the campaign in the general election I was national staff director, and that was also a great experience. Those times for me were very important in terms of experience and building a skill set and things of that nature.\n\nTLS: Did you find that your legal training had an impact on your ability to take these jobs on?\n\nTF: Somewhat. I mean, legal training helps develop your analytical skills as much as anything. Learning to look at both sides of an issue, learning to ask the right questions, learning to be able to stand back and look at a situation or a set of facts and be able to make an evaluation. Those skills are important in just about anything you do in life, but certainly in an organizational atmosphere. Whether it\u2019s a business or a campaign or government, those skills are very important if you want to be effective.\n\nTLS: Now going back to the law school days \u2013 growing up in Virginia and going to undergrad at Richmond, going to UVA seems like a natural progression. Was that your top choice? Did you look elsewhere for school?\n\nTF: No, I just wanted to go to Virginia. I spent four years at Richmond and then a year of graduate school in political science, and during those years I had been able to spend some time up in Charlottesville, and I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere else. However, I did give some thought to working on a PhD and teaching Poli Sci\u2026I applied and was accepted to a graduate program at USC for political science. I gave it some thought, but at the end of the day going to Virginia Law was what I really wanted to do.\n\nTLS: Can you recall some of your favorite classes or professors at UVA Law?\n\nTF: Dan Meador, who taught Civil Procedure, was a good professor. Probably my favorite professor was A.E. Dick Howard for Con Law, who is still there. He was a Dean for a while, some years ago; he basically rewrote the Virginia Constitution in 1971 and that\u2019s when I was in my first year of law school. It then had to be approved by the voters of Virginia so I worked with him on it \u2013 in those days, states were just gradually getting around to re-writing their constitutions, and some of them still are. The politics of doing this are fraught. So it was a massive re-do of the constitution of Virginia that had to be submitted to voters. I worked with him one summer on the campaign to approve the new constitution \u2013 called the Constitutional Referendum Campaign \u2013 and it was successful. Then he and I co-authored a short piece/booklet on sort of a \u201chow-to\u201d regarding the politics of getting revised constitutions approved. In the aftermath of that, it was used in a number of states as kind of a roadmap as how to go about it.\n\nTLS: I read that you also had the opportunity to argue in front of Thurgood Marshall when you were on the Moot Court team. What was that like?\n\nTF: That experience\u2014the Lile Moot Court competition\u2014was the intra- law school competition. It was the competition of stature at Virginia. The inter-law school competitions that you could get involved in were secondary to the Lile competition at the time. It was a two-year competition; you wrote briefs and argued six times, and every time you were up against someone, you had to win in order to proceed. So it was a single elimination competition that spanned two years and when you got to the finals, a Supreme Court justice came down was a part of the panel alongside a couple of circuit court judges. Thurgood Marshall was on our panel for the finals, and we lost.\n\nTLS: Oh no!\n\nTF: Yeah, but the whole thing was great. I always look back at my debate experience in high school and college and then my moot court experience at Virginia as absolutely fundamental to what I do today because of the communication skills I acquired. I don\u2019t care what you do, whether it\u2019s business or government or public service or volunteerism, any kind of situation you\u2019re in where you\u2019ve got to interface with people, communication skills are [essential].\n\nI always look at communication skills first when I\u2019m looking at a potential employee. [I\u2019m looking for] those who handle themselves well and can communicate. Because if you do that and you have a brain, you can [learn the rest of the necessary skills]. So that experience was terrific because not only was it good for communication skills, but writing the briefs, arguing the cases \u2013 it just took your argumentative skills to another level. And then to have a Supreme Court justice asking you questions in the finals was pretty cool.\n\nTLS: That\u2019s amazing. So after the Carter Administration, you remained involved in politics on some level but mostly moved into private sphere work prior to getting involved with the PGA, right?\n\nTF: Right, I had my own firm, the National Marketing and Strategies Group.\n\nTLS: You never returned to the practice of law, right?\n\nTF: I did some consulting work for a couple of firms and I had my own firm and we did strategic corporate consulting, and we did a little bit of government relations, but not much \u2013 it was mostly outside-of-the-beltway stuff.\n\nTLS: Given the current economic climate, things are really difficult in the legal field right now and there are a whole lot of lawyers, a whole lot of law schools, and a lack of jobs. What advice or thoughts would you want to share with anyone considering entering the legal field at this point?\n\nTF: Generally, I always tell people that I think you should make decisions which increase your options if you can. And from the standpoint of graduate school or law school, if I had to do it over again, I would have gotten an MBA along with a law degree. A law degree gives you certain training in certain areas, but if you make the move over to the business environment, it would be particularly helpful in my view to have more of an in-depth business understanding. And, I think that if you do business law, then understanding the corporate structure, how it works, what makes it go, and where the motivation comes from for people to do certain things, in addition to corporate finance and some of the other basics, is pretty important.\n\nAnd in doing so, you increase your options, because then you\u2019re in a position to go in a business direction with the benefit of a law degree or go down the legal road with the benefit of a business education. So, that would be a partial answer to your question. In addition, just within the context of law school, I would say to look at course work in the same vain \u2013 trying to increase your options for what directions you might go. I would strongly encourage that a student takes advantage of the summers to do on-the-job training in certain environments, whether in a corporation or legal office or a law firm or in a court or whatever\u2019s available\u2026or getting a clerkship; I didn\u2019t do that, but not only is it good for the resume, it\u2019s good for the experience.\n\nTLS: What work did you do during your two summers?\n\nTF: I didn\u2019t do any of those things. I ran the constitutional referendum campaign one summer and I ran a congressional race in the other summer. Somewhere along the way I tended bar.\n\nTLS: How rigorous were your three years at UVA?\n\nTF: The first year was an eye-opener, but after that, it really depends on how hard you want to work. In terms of going to law school, getting the law degree, getting the basics, I didn\u2019t think it was particularly difficult after the first year. I mean, I\u2019m not suggesting it wasn\u2019t challenging \u2013 it is \u2013 but I think maybe it\u2019s a little overstated sometimes. You\u2019ll see. It just depends on what you want to try to accomplish. But you know, what you want to do is get everything you can out of it. You can\u2019t do it again, so you want to get all that you can out of it.\n\nTLS: So I take it you worked pretty hard, then?\n\nTF: I did, I worked hard. I was always trying to do other stuff. I was elected vice chairman of the state party of VA when I was in my second year of law school; looking back, I\u2019m not exactly sure how that happened. But I did a lot of politics on the side; I ran a congressional race, I did the constitutional referendum, and I was very involved in the state Democratic party. And then there was my coursework, and I also had a couple of jobs on the side. So maybe it was a hell of a lot harder than I remember, but I\u2019ve been in some stuff since [that\u2019s been much harder]. Looking back, it just seems\u2026it was just so much fun. Being a student is fun; I didn\u2019t want to ever stop being a student.\n\nTLS: That\u2019s good to have on record, because there seem to be way more horror stories circulating than stories about how law school was so much fun. Did you find the UVA environment to be competitive?\n\nTF: Yeah, but in a healthy way, I think. The professors were interesting and fun.\n\nTLS: What about a least favorite course?\n\nTF: I liked my first year courses. But the Uniform Commercial Transactions was a pain in the ass course. The UCC Code is like a thousand pages, so you put this thousand-page book on your desk and look up the answers if you can. That was kind of a bummer \u2013 the UCC was so boring. But I really liked so much of the stuff, like Torts. The history of law is so interesting to me, and I could have spent more time in Con Law. Con Law is interesting; it can be tedious in some areas if you\u2019re not interested in the subject matter of the case law, but the formulation of case law is interesting. I always think it\u2019s amusing when you hear Democrats and Republicans arguing about \u201cWe don\u2019t want an activist judge \u2013 we don\u2019t want someone that makes policy\u201d and all this crap. But when you decide cases \u2013 that\u2019s what you do. I mean, it\u2019s all a matter of degree, like everything else. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the constitution says.\u201d Well, the constitution started being interpreted 200 years ago.\n\nTLS: Well, thank you so much for taking the time to do this. I really appreciate it.\n\nTF: Hey, it\u2019s fun. No problem.\n\nTLS: But I have one more question, the most important one \u2013 how did it feel to be portrayed on Saturday Night Live? [link]\n\nTF: [Laughs] Hahaha, well, I didn\u2019t think it was very funny. I didn\u2019t get annoyed by it, but I also can\u2019t say I heard anyone laughing during the show. But here\u2019s the funny thing \u2013 all the e-mails I got the next day were somewhere along the lines of, \u201cYou\u2019ve finally arrived.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/29070837/tim-finchem-former-pga-tour-commissioner-elected-world-golf-hall-fame", "page_content": "Tim Finchem, who expanded the PGA Tour's footprint around the world and negotiated TV contracts that more than tripled prize money during his two decades as commissioner, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nFinchem was elected through the contributor category and will become the 10th administrator to be inducted, joining predecessor Deane Beman. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, also was elected as a contributor.\n\nFinchem was PGA Tour commissioner when the World Golf Hall of Fame opened in 1998 in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n\"One of the great things about that is to get know the inductees who I didn't know in other aspects of my job,'' Finchem said Monday. \"It's a tremendous list of people. To be included in that group is very powerful. I want to thank those who thought I was deserving of it. In many ways, I didn't feel I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long.''\n\nFinchem found it fitting that he joins the induction class of 2021 with Tiger Woods, whom he first saw at a college tournament his first year as commissioner in 1994. Later that year, Finchem noticed players finishing up their rounds at the World Series of Golf at Firestone and watching an 18-year-old Woods win the first of three straight U.S. Amateurs.\n\nWoods was elected through the male player category a month ago. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, was elected as a contributor.\n\n\"It is the greatest honor to be elected to join golf's most legendary players and contributors in the World Golf Hall of Fame,\" Finchem said. \"I am especially proud to stand alongside one of the world's all-time greats, Tiger Woods, in the Class of 2021 and look forward to what will be an exciting year ahead.\"\n\nWoods joined the PGA Tour in 1996 after two years at Stanford and brought enormous attention to himself and to the tour. Along with winning twice in seven starts, Woods won the Masters in his first attempt as a pro by setting 20 records, including a 12-shot victory that set off the first wave of \"Tigermania.''\n\nFinchem seized on it.\n\nHe was in the middle of negotiating a new network television contract, and prize money spiked. More deals followed in 2001, 2006 and 2012. PGA Tour prize money went from under $100 million on three tours in 1994 when Finchem was appointed commissioner to more than $400 million over six tours when he retired at the end of 2016.\n\nFormer PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, left, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame.

It continues on today. As a sport, we were blessed he didn't like tennis.''\n\nIt wasn't just money, however.\n\nFinchem created The First Tee program shortly after Woods won the Masters. Turning back Greg Norman's proposal for a world tour, Finchem came up with the World Golf Championships series in 1999 that led to three events for players from the leading six tours around the world. He also took advantage of a growing class of international players from outside Europe -- Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh among those -- by starting the Presidents Cup in 1994.\n\nAt the heart of Finchem's work was making the PGA Tour logo recognizable around the world, a symbol of strength.\n\nThe PGA Tour had a development circuit (now called the Korn Ferry Tour) and a senior tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) for players 50 and older. Now it has circuits in Canada (Mackenzie Tour), Latin America and China.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" said Jay Monahan, whom Finchem groomed as his successor.\n\nMonahan delivered the news to Finchem during The Players Championship, two days before golf joined so many other sports in shutting down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome of Finchem's best work came during tough times.

Woods was scheduled to go to Wilmington Country Club on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022, for a private meeting of top players to discuss the threat of Saudi-funded LIV Golf, according to two people aware of the plans at the BMW Championship. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the privacy of the meeting. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Greg Norman braced for another fight with the PGA Tour and was equipped with what he often referred to as the tour\u2019s \u201cplaybook\u201d from the first time he tried to start a rival league.\n\nThis version might have a similar ending.\n\nNorman\u2019s first attempt to assemble an exclusive field to play for big money around the world never got off the ground. The PGA Tour wielded its political influence, Arnold Palmer stood behind the heritage of the tour and that was that.\n\nAnd then the PGA Tour stole his idea.\n\nWhat emerged were the World Golf Championships, the richest events (back when a $5 million purse meant something) with no cut and a limited field. Former PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem publicly thanked Norman for his \u201cdetermination and suggestions of 1994\u201d when the first WGC was played.\n\nIn that respect, this is starting to feel like a repeat.\n\nReports over the weekend \u2014 the most thorough from No Laying Up, which has engaged top players on its podcast for years \u2014 pointed to a plan to create up to 15 tournaments offering some of the richest purses for a limited field of elite players.\n\nThose were the most pertinent details that emerged from a players-only meeting last week. Norman must feel as though he has seen all this before.\n\nBut this was less about trying to quash Saudi-funded LIV Golf and more about taking the PGA Tour in a modern direction that emphasizes its biggest names. And what makes this different from 1994 is how the movement unfolded.\n\nNo Laying Up reported 23 players in attendance at the invitation-only meeting. That included \u2014 it starts with, really \u2014 Tiger Woods, who flew to Delaware from Florida for the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the top guys together more often than we do,\u201d Rory McIlroy said the next morning, the closest any player came to a public revelation. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all in the same tournaments, all in the same weeks.\u201d\n\nFor now, the plan is somewhere between a vision and reality. The players have been in touch with Commissioner Jay Monahan, and he could provide a better sense of where it all stands when he speaks Wednesday ahead of the Tour Championship .\n\nBut the value of that meeting went far deeper than details.\n\nBy all accounts, the players left inspired, unified and unusually quiet. Xander Schauffele smiled when he referred to the silence as a \u201ccode,\u201d which is not to suggest he was joking.\n\nSaid one player, speaking on condition of anonymity to honor such a code, \u201cWhen was the last time all the top players got together in the same room? That has never happened before.\u201d\n\nIt spoke to the ownership the players have taken of their tour, and their determination to stave off the greatest threat professional golf has faced.\n\nWorth noting is 16 of the top 20 players in the world ranking were in the room. Among those missing, one didn\u2019t become a PGA Tour member until three weeks ago (Tom Kim). Another is reported to be leaving for LIV Golf after this week (Cameron Smith).\n\nHideki Matsuyama and Sungjae Im might have required translation, though they should have been included. Matsuyama was said to be curious why he wasn\u2019t invited. Two people who know of his plans say the Japanese star is not going anywhere. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Matsuyama has not said anything publicly about his plans.\n\nSome of those players still might leave for LIV one day. After Brooks Koepka did an about-face in the span of one week in June, no one should be surprised by any defection.\n\nIf so, what they leave behind might be similar to what they are joining.\n\nIf this is the path forward for the PGA Tour, is it the answer?\n\nShort fields, no cuts, big money. Where you have heard that one before? More than a WGC concept, it sounds like it was torn from the gospel of what Norman was preaching, minus the concept of team golf with silly names.\n\nBut it will have far more relevance under the umbrella of a tour, the identity of professional golf for more than 50 years. And it won\u2019t have the scrutiny over the source of funding \u2014 the Public Investment Fund \u2014 that LIV Golf seems to constantly face.\n\nOne other difference in the playbook is Norman\u2019s first challenge in 1994 never made it to court.\n\nFor the three LIV golfers who sought a temporary restraining order to compete in the FedEx Cup playoffs, the ruling against them was a big setback. At this point, players who sign with LIV Golf should not expect to play anywhere on the PGA Tour until at least 2024, and the majority of them might miss out on all the majors unless they go through open qualifiers.\n\nAll the while, the PGA Tour could be headed toward a new model of small fields, big purses, guaranteed money because of no cuts and the option to play other PGA Tour stops that have special meaning to them and still have a good purse.\n\nPerhaps the tour should have thought of this sooner.\n\nIn the long run, maybe it\u2019s better this way. One of the messages that came out of the antitrust lawsuit filed by defectors is that every PGA Tour player had a right to feel like a defendant. \u201cThis is your tour,\u201d they were told.\n\nNow they\u2019re acting like it really is.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2019/05/29/pga-tour-paid-tim-finchem-10-million-bonus-money-retired/", "page_content": "While Tim Finchem stepped down as PGA Tour commissioner at the end of 2016, he still was paid more than $10 million in bonus and incentive money, according to the organization\u2019s 990 tax records for 2017.\n\nIn 2017, Finchem received $12,216,755 in compensation from the PGA Tour, according to the 990 that was made available by Pro Publica.

That prize money figure did not include the majors.\n\nIn 2016, Finchem was paid $4.47 million, which included a base salary of $1.19 million and bonus pay of $3 million. He received another $4.7 million from related organizations, according to tax records. His total compensation from the Tour was $3.99 million in 2015, including bonus pay of $2.7 million. He received another $2 million from related organizations that year.\n\nThe former commissioner was by far the highest-paid person listed on the Tour\u2019s tax filings for 2017. Current commissioner Jay Monahan received total compensation of $4.78 million that included a base salary of $998,077 plus bonus and incentive pay of $2.8 million.\n\nOutside of Finchem and Monahan, there were 14 others among the Tour\u2019s officers and highest paid employees who made more than $1 million in 2017. Thomas E. Wade, the PGA Tour\u2019s chief commercial officer, received $3.1 million, according to the tax records.\n\nPlayers who earned the most prize money were listed as independent contractors.

Total expenses also grew to $1.41 billion compared to $1.2 billion the previous year. The Tour says its organization and its tournaments generated more than $180 million in charitable donations in 2017.\n\nIn revenue, the Tour reported $458 million in TV rights, up from $433 million in 2016.

When Finchem became commissioner, total purses were approximately $56 million on the PGA Tour, a number that grew to $256 million by 2006 and well in excess of $300 million now.\n\nIt was in March at the Dell-Match Play Championship where Finchem announced he would step down prior to the end of his contract, which had been extended to June 1, 2017. He said then he hoped to remain involved in the First Tee program and the World Golf Foundation.\n\n\"For every organization there is a time,'' Finchem said. \"I could probably go on another five or six years. But I don't think that is best for the organization. I don't consider myself old. But I'm getting old.''\n\nThe PGA Tour as it is now constituted came into existence in 1968, as the players and all club professionals had been under the PGA of America, which today runs the PGA Championship and Ryder Cup among other tournaments in addition to its role with more than 28,000 club pros in the United States.\n\nFirst called the Tournament Players Division, the name changed to PGA Tour in 1975. Joseph Dey, formerly the United States Golf Association president, was named first commissioner and held the position until 1974, when Beman, a former tour player, took over and held the position for 20 years."}]}
