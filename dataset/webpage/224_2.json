The original lineup was James Hetfield (Vocalist and Rhythm guitarist), Dave Mustaine (Lead Guitar), Lars Ulrich (Drums), Ron McGovney (Bassist). The group came into mainstream from their Self-Titled album and the hit single \"Enter Sandman\".\n\n\n\nWith their first two albums, Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning reaching underground success, their third effort, Master of Puppets has since become one of the most important heavy metal albums ever, as it became the first thrash metal album to be certified platinum. The title track has since become the band's most played song live. ...read more. They were one of the top metal bands around back in the 80s, now they are just remembered for what they did in the 80s. If Metallica stuck to its roots it would still be on top and would probably be considered the greatest metal band of all time. They still are either considered the greatest metal band of all time or the second greatest to Iron Maiden. From the Black Album and on they have sold out if they stuck to their thrash roots they would probably have came out with albums just as good if not better than their first four albums For me, it's when they released the Load album. This album, and every other album after it, is nothing more than either alternative or hard rock. Death Magnetic tries, but falls short, in my opinion. Why is Metallica alienating their fan base? Change your image back to thrash metal. Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax don't seem to have an issue with it. Their first 4 albums defined heavy metal and thrash back in the day. (Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and... And Justice for All) After that, they became huge sellouts. The Black Album was ok, but it isn't what Metallica should be. Everything they've released since 1991 has been alternative, hard rock, mainstream garbage. All of the big four tried something different during the mid-late 1990s, and that was because Thrash Metal was performing very poorly critically and commercially ( the latter in terms of the genre's standards). If anything, they did a good job in keeping Heavy Metal relevant, and are still doing it to this day.\n\nMaroon 5 Maroon 5 is an American pop/pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. Before the current group was established, the original four members, Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick, formed a band known as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. I agree with what CrimsonShark said, they should be known as \"The Adam Levine Experience\" now. I really liked their first three albums, but they really went downhill after that. They mostly make horrible monotonous dance pop tunes nowadays just to follow the trends, and I can hardly even call them a band anymore. It's just Adam Levine and a bunch of other guys barely anyone knows about. \"The Adam Levine Experience\" is a much more fitting name. Whatever the heck happened to this band, I'll find it difficult to understand. Adam Levine is also quite the egotist, he's following fame and money at this point. He's a famous celebrity, known for being in \"The Voice\" and has a well-documented personal life. Hardly anybody knows about any of the band members, its almost sad how I tend to pity them somewhat as they can't even display much of their talent.\n\n\n\nMaroon 5, wait sorry, The Adam Levine Experience was a pretty solid band. Now, they've become the poster boy for the term \"sell-out\", and many notable music fans and critics understandably hate the band for this. If anything, blame Adam for all this. Pretty much everything has already been said here, but at least \"Girls Like You\" and \"Memories\" are decent songs. However, on their latest album Jordi, they sound like they just gave up on making good melodies. \"Beautiful Mistakes\" is an overwhelmingly boring song with a robotic melody, trite lyrics and a phoned-in Megan Thee Stallion verse, and yet it's not even the worst song on the album, as the rest consists of bland beats, Adam Levine's tired vocals and lots of AutoTune.\n\nI feel like this could be the end for Maroon 5, or as CrimsonShark puts it, \"The Adam Levine Experience\", as other members will probably just give up on Adam who should learn how to sing again or take care of his kids. I almost want to cry when I hear a song off of \"overexposed\". It disgusts me how they destroyed everything they built with their first three albums. \"Songs about jane\" was funk/alternative rock for the masses and it was excellent. \"it wont be soon before long\" was more retro sounding but brilliant nonetheless. \"Hands all over\" was a mix of the two with more Michael jacksonesque sounds in it. \"Overexposed\" is the quintessential sell out album in recent history. Maroon 5 wasnt selling well so they ditched every shred of rock in their music and made a ton of cash.\n\nX Japan X Japan is a Japanese heavy metal band from Chiba, formed in 1982 by drummer Yoshiki and lead vocalist Toshi. X Japan will always be at the top of the hierarchy. The top predator in a food chain if you will.\n\n\n\nX Japan have kept to true to themselves even after the 10 year hiatus. I'm pretty sure most of the people who voted for them here have no idea what this list is about, but this time I won't complain about their ignorance. I really don't see how they sold out but X-Japan rule most and deserve to be top of most lists. Pure awesome. How did they sell out? Dahlia (assuming this is the supposed sellout album) was amazing if you ask me.\n\nFall Out Boy Fall Out Boy is an American pop punk band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. They definitely started to kind of sell out once Save Rock and Roll came out, straying away from the good sound. Once Mania hit that was the definition of a sellout. Hear for yourself and you'll see why. I know everyone calls them sell outs, but why? Because they became popular artists? So becoming popular = sellout/bad? Whoever is thinking in this mentality needs to reevaluate their mentality. Their music does change a lot, but that doesn't mean they are sellouts. They definitely sold out. Compare songs like sugar we're going down to pop rock GARBAGE like centuries or my songs know what you did in the dark. I could get behind Save Rock and Roll and even American Beauty/American Psycho, but Mania...sell out in the essence of sell out. It's cliche but: SELL OUT BOY!\n\nKiss Kiss is an American hard rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons and the band's original manager, Lew Linet. This band was selling merchandise from the beginning, when they were arguably the biggest thing going. Now, 40 plus years later people want to call them sellouts. There are millions of fans who felt this way for a long time but keep coming back to support them, even through the disco era. All that ultimately matters is their music and it's mostly great. How are these guys not in the top 10? Kiss has sold out pretty much every single way possible.\n\n\n\nWhy is nirvana on this list? The over-merchandising of Nirvana started after Kurt's death, and everything about \"In Utero\" is far from selling out, it's the exact opposite. Beth and I was made for loving you like the songs or not you got to call it like you see it and how is A7X sell outs they are the best they sell out just because the lead singer Mshadow doesn't want to scream himself hoarse he wanted to sing the horror he wanted to sing! There last album also had screaming and in god hates us and there new single not ready to die Pushing KISS merchandise on talk shows has only served one purpose; telling the world how much Gene Simmons has sold out.\n\nNickelback Nickelback is a Canadian post-grunge band formed in 1995 in Hanna, Alberta, Canada. The band is composed of guitarist and lead vocalist Chad Kroeger, guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Ryan Peake, bassist Mike Kroeger, and drummer Daniel Adair. They sold out before anyone actually heard of them. Their first album, The Curb was heavy and their newer stuff is very poppy. I wish they could go back to not always singing about sex and partying and all that crap. Who remembers their album Curb? No one, since their fans love their new poppy music. Like with Metallica, they were heavy and processed by money to make themselves softer. How could anyone forget them? Apparently they had a grunge sound at the beginning, and then decided to go all radio-friendly with the latter of their albums I hate Nickelback. But some of their earlier stuff is pretty good.\n\nGwen Stefani Gwen Ren\u00e9e Stefani (born October 3, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. She is a co-founder and the lead vocalist of the band No Doubt, whose singles include \"Just a Girl\" and \"Don't Speak\" from their 1995 breakthrough studio album Tragic Kingdom, as well as \"Hey Baby\" and \"It's My Life\" from later albums. An unfortunate example of a true sellout. I understand that not everyone is super talented. I understand you only have so many songs in you. But I'd rather fade into rock obscurity with a couple of great tunes under my name than prop-myself up with a bunch of cookie-cutter, pop garbage just to stay famous. 1995 Gwen wouldn't even recognize herself today. Okay, now this chick is actually a sell out, and not Tom DeLonge. She gave up her band No Doubt, which is Ska Punk, in order to be a pop artist and become more popular. She doesn't put passion in her pop music. Meaning she did sell out, when someone does not even put passion into something, just doing it for fame, that is big time selling out. I really liked her in No Doubt. She left the band to produce terrible mainstream music that appeals to the lowest common denominator in an attempt to make money. If you look up sellout in the dictionary, her picture should be there. Can't believe she isn't number one. No Doubt were a great band, and she threw it all away to sing about \"B-A-N-A-N-A-S\" and prance around with Harajuku girls... I could rant for days about what a sell-out and disappointment she is.\n\nTaylor Swift Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. She was born on December 13, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania. She is best known for writing personal songs and for having won 11 Grammys. She became interested in country music when she was around 9 years old, and after watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt that she should go to Nashville to begin a country music career. She then signed a contract with RCA Records and began to write songs. What happened in Reputation, I won't understand. She has great songs throughout most of her country 2006 - 2010 discography and there are standouts in Red and 1989. Reputation on the other hand, just falls flat and is really disappointing. You know, she's making a diss song of sorts, yet its also the same woman who sung about a boy who passed away from Neuroblastoma. Damn it! Yeah there's bands and artists on here who made little change and are called sell outs like U2 and Green Day (who really just evolved their sound, and experimented different subgenres.) on the other hand you have Taylor Swift who literally went from country music to pop music. All because she wanted more attention and mainstream success. This artist makes Green Day going from punk rock to alternative rock less noticeable. Of course she's a sell out, it's pretty obvious. I'm not saying this to hate on Taylor or anything, but she made great country music that she genuinely loved making, and all of a sudden she became a generic pop artist with the passion honestly stripped away. \"Shake It Off\" is so generic. Meh, I don't think she sold out in too big of a way. Her music might be super different than what it used to be, and while I don't really know too much about her because I'm not super creepy, I'm sure she works just as hard on her music now, as she did during her country albums.\n\nColdplay Coldplay are a British pop rock band formed in 1996. The band consists of Chris Martin (lead vocalist and pianist), Jonny Buckland (lead guitarist), Guy Berryman (bassist) and Will Champion (drummer and backing vocalist). Manager Phil Harvey is often considered an unofficial fifth member. The band renamed themselves \"Coldplay\" in 1998. Before making their debut album, they recorded and released three EPs: Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999, and The Blue Room in the same year. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone. ...read more. Their first three albums were great. But then afterwards with every album they released they went more and more with mainstream pop. Definition of a sellout. For the older fans, Coldplay is that kid you used to be friends with and go to school with. They were shy and gawky, but at least they were friendly and honest. Unfortunately, they secretly wanted very badly to fit in and be liked. To this end, at some point during summer vacation, that kid starts hanging out with the wrong crowd, eventually reinventing themselves. By the time you see them again, they're a completely different person. Now, they hang out with the cool kids and want nothing to do with you. That's Coldplay.\n\n\n\nYou know a musician has sold their soul to the devil when they have collaborated with the likes of Kanye West, Rihanna, Beyonce, and Jay Z. Although Paradise was said to be their sellout song, I would still rather listen to it than 90% of what is on the radio now. Anyway, they started out as a rock band and gradually transitioned to pop (although they still made great songs, like A Sky Full of Stars), and then worked with The Chainsmokers on \"Something Just Like This\", which says enough already. While they've always been pop rock, they at least had some alternative leanings when they started out. Now they've gone completely pop, which while more successful utterly angers their die hard fans, and casual listeners for making boring music.\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas The Black Eyed Peas is an American hip hop group, consisting of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, and singer Fergie. 10 A group who have sold out, not once but twice. Originally they were a supposedly legit band who had respect in the hip hop community. Fergie then joined, and they became a pretty good pop band for a while. Then I Gotta Feeling came along, and they lost any semblance of identity to become generic soulless pop-dance music that occupy the charts these days. Thankfully they went on hiatus before they steeped too much further in that part of their career, clearly due to diminishing returns. When they inevitably reunite, they should hopefully return to what they originally were, but the chances on that are sadly slim. A sellout in every sense of the word. This group apparently used to be an actual band and play instruments. I didn't know this now since they use computerized will.I.am beats and autotune in all of their songs. Almost as big of a sellout as Taylor Swift. In the beginning, they were a well-respected rap group. Then came Fergie and they turned to crap. The final straw was The E.N.D., featuring that \"I Gotta Feeling\" song that idiots made more popular than anything Elvis or Simon and Garfunkel released. (NO JOKE.) They started playing live instrumentals and now use beats and autotune in their electronic music. That has to be top 3 at least.\n\nThe Contenders\n\nDavid Bowie David Robert Jones, known professionally as David Bowie (January 8, 1947 - January 10, 2016) was an English singer born in London, the son of a fundraiser and a waitress. He is credited for his experimental and creative musical discography which has won praise and accolades for many critics and fans. The man who the world knew as David Bowie was an actor, a painter, a philosopher, and many other things. But first and foremost, and what he was known for most, he was a rock star, covering every genre from psychedelic folk to industrial. His influence on fashion, music, and pop culture in general remains as his legacy--along, of course, with his unforgettable music. 11 What is Bowie doing in this list?\n\nWhat is Rod Stewart doing in this list?\n\nThese two are British music legends.\n\nThey are top artist's world wide, respected by all that are music lovers and music fans.\n\nMost artist's in the world look up to thes two, they would love to write and perform songs like Bowie or Rod Stewart made world famous.\n\nINCREDIBLE! Ok, so his late 80s to 90s stuff was very much him selling out, he came back with The Next Day and Blackstar, which are two of his finest works\n\nImagine Dragons Imagine Dragons is an American pop rock band from Provo, Utah, and are now based out of Las Vegas, Nevada. Imagine Dragons' lineup consists of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure with the release of their single \"It's Time\", followed by their award-winning debut studio album Night Visions (2012), which resulted in the chart-topping singles \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\". Rolling Stone named \"Radioactive\", which holds the record for most weeks charted on the Billboard Hot 100, the \"biggest rock hit of the year\". 12 The early 2010s were an era were pop unleash its worst and an album like Night Visions was like a breath of fresh air.\n\n\n\nYears later, they make Believer, which is so atrocious not even having Dolph Lundgren in the MV can redeem it. I've always hated this band with a passion, but they somehow find ways to get worse over time. Their second album is the definition of sophomore slump. They did that with Origins.\n\nGenesis Genesis are an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey in 1967. The most commercially successful and long-lasting line-up includes keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. 13 After Gabriel's departure, Genesis became the worst sellouts in rock history by discarding the quirkiness that made them somewhat interesting in favor of a massive pop bland-out. They were only pretending to be artists, but they were completely sincere about being soulless shills chasing the bucks by producing pablum for dummies. \"Trick of the Tale\" sounded so awful after \"Lamb,\" I not only gave up on Genesis, I permanently gave up on all commercial rock. I wasn't happy again till Punk came around. And whenever I think of Genesis these days, I think of Judas. I can't help it. Sadly.\n\nI think they had the biggest drop in Quality in music, if we take Metallica for exemple The Black Album, Load and Reload are good albums (even great in the case of The Black Album) just not Thrash Metal, St Anger and Lulu sucked but those where uncommercial experiments. And they did return to form with Hardwired & Death Magnetic.\n\nHowever I do feel that people are being too hard on Phil collins, A Trick of the Tail & Wind and Wuthering are as great as the Peter Gabriel albums, And Then There Were Three & Duke are also good though Steve Hackett's exit did hurt them and Phil's side project Brand X is awesome.\n\nI Blame the 80's. I wholeheartedly disagree with this. I understand if 80s Genesis isn't your thing, but the music still had soul, and the band wasn't just in it for the money. Also, if anyone's to blame for the shift in styles, it's Tony Banks and (to a lesser extent) Mike Rutherford - they wanted to write hit songs, while Phil didn't even want to be the singer at first. Phil also tried to get the entirety of Supper's Ready in the setlist of one of their later concerts, but the other two declined. However, regardless of whose fault the shift is, the music was still good. Even if you're a hardcore prog fan, the band still made tons of great music until the very end. Even considering the period after Duke, which many believe to be the point where the pop influence simply became too much, we still got gems like Dodo/Lurker, Mama, Home by the Sea, Domino, The Brazilian, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (the album version), Driving the Last Spike, Dreaming While You Sleep, Fading Lights, and more! And that's just ...more They went from being one of the best bands to being one of the worst bands in a short time. \"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" was one of the best albums ever. They threw it all away to be the British Kansas, they were only in it for the money. Disgraceful phonies, I could never even look at an album cover of theirs ever again. Peter sold out soon after, I have no interest in him now either. Very disappointing, worst sellout in the history of rock.\n\nPanic! at the Disco Panic! at the Disco is an American pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 and featuring the current lineup of vocalist Brendon Urie, accompanied on tour by bassist Dallon Weekes, guitarist Kenneth Harris, and drummer Dan Pawlovich. 14 It becomes pretty obvious after Vices and Virtues that Brendon Urie abandoned the good sound that Panic at the Disco had just to be famous and sell out with Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die and the pop music on it. It was apparent in Vices and Virtues as well, but at least not that much to the point there's still a lot of their sound in it. Now, it's all pop garbage that is not the Panic sound that made them. I have to admit that they did kind of sold out, although they're still enjoyable either way\n\nRod Stewart Roderick David \"Rod\" Stewart is a British rock singer-songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. 15\n\n30 Seconds to Mars Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band currently consists of brothers Jared and Shannon Leto. 16 I just watched them perform on the late show and my god... what the hell is this? Electric drums, no distorted guitars or powerful vocals? they're just another Chain Smokers knock off. Complete loss of identity. They went from border-line metal to electronic, techno crap. They're all talented, but they cover up that talent with awful dance beats. (Up in the air is a perfect example). Went from a very nicely produced space prog rock concept album to absolute trash. In my opinion the most stark sell out in all of this list. Listen to the new album \"America\" and that will tell you why they should be at the top of this list. God awful stuff.\n\nGuns N' Roses Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. Apart from hard rock they are also associated with heavy metal. ...read more. 17 With every member that left Guns n Roses, they took a bit of talent with them. I hated Chinese Democracy and is nothing like Appetite For Destruction\n\nSnoop Dogg Cordozar Calvin Broadus, Jr., (born October 20, 1971) known professionally as Snoop Dogg, is an American rapper, actor, record producer, and television personality from Long Beach, California. 18 I'm seriously surprised how no one talks about Snoop Dogg selling out just like they do with Metallica selling out. Snoop started collaborating with terrible artists like Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Jason Derulo, PSY, promoting terrible rappers like Wiz Khalifa, Far East Movement, even guest stared on Big Time Rush!\n\nBesides all of that, he hasn't been himself either. Right now he's trying to be a wannabe Rastafarian, even calling himself \"Snoop Lion.\"\n\n\n\nSnoop really has changed. He's in his 40's Now so he should just retire already. He was a gangster back then but now he's a joke that's not funny. In my opinion, he should be number 1. He started promoting terrible rappers like Far East Movement and Wiz Khalifa. And he started rapping with a lot of terrible artists (Lil Wayne, Miley Cyrus, Big Time Rush, Jason Derulo, Psy, Soulja Boy, Katy Perry, the list goes on). He even said that Lil Wayne is dope!\n\n\n\nHow is this guy not higher?! He really is one of the biggest sellouts in music history! Really! He promoted Wiz Khalifa (and apparently, Snoop likes anyone who smokes weed). And when you keep getting promoted by Snoop, you're gonna be mainstream forever. But I haven't heard from Wiz Khalifa since so I'm glad he's gone. No more. We don't need anymore whack rappers killing up the genre. Snoop, you are one of the greatest rappers of all time. Why did you rap with Big Time Rush? Did your kids tell you to do it? We're they like \"daddy that's one of our favorite bands. Can you go rap with them? \" Just why?\n\nGreen Day Green Day are an American pop punk/punk rock band formed in East Bay, California in 1987. The members include Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals and guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass), Tr\u00e9 Cool (drums) and Jason White (guitar). Green Day are associated with punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Some of their influences include The Ramones, Sex Pistols, NOFX, and Bad Religion. They are best known for their songs like \u2018Boulevard of Broken Dreams\u2019, \u2018Basket Case\u2019 and their \u2018American Idiot\u2019 & \u2018Dookie\u2019 albums. American Idiot sold 6 million copies in the U.S. and won a Grammy Award for \"Best Rock Album\". Green Day have sold over 75 million records worldwide and have won 5 Grammy Awards. They ...read more. 19 Sure they started out as punk rock, but at least they generally stayed as some form of punk, even in American Idiot. It was still an album about rebellion, just this time against the government when previously they rebelled against society. They went from songs like jaded take back geek stink breath to wake me up when September ends and last night on earth. Generic pop songs. At least in the last 3 albums they weren't aiming for money Look at them in the 80s now look at them. They didn't sell out to big but their Music changed drastiually and they are getting closer to sellouts by music release to music release. They should be a lot higher. Warning sucked, then I gained back their respect once American Idiot came out, and after that they sucked and still do.\n\n20 Jefferson Starship\n\nSantana Santana is an American Latin rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1967 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana. 21 Ever since Santana made an unlikely comeback in 1999 with \"Smooth\" and the Supernatural album (which probably should've been named \"Superficial\"), he definitely sold out on the albums that followed. He sounded like the guest of his own show and his guitar wailing alongside vocal guests even became as unbearable as a baby crying/shrieking in a public place. Santana's sellout story is one for the ages that very few people mention these days.\n\nHeart Heart is an American rock band that first found success in Canada and later in the United States and worldwide. 22 Heart's self-titled album was a huge sellout. I'm a fan of that album. I just don't care if the sisters hated the uncomfortable corsets they were wearing, especially on Ann. They don't do pop, they do rock.\n\nAvril Lavigne Avril Ramona Lavigne is a Canadian\u2013French singer-songwriter and actress. By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain; by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2 million. 23 She \"sold out\" in the sense that her new music was a lot more pop oriented and flamboyant, but she clearly thought she was still \"pop punk\" until her latest album. I see it that her second album she was really upset about her grandfather passing away, and her following album is her somewhat her trying to put that part of her life behind her. Let go is my favorite album by her, if I had to say the album where she was probably closest to her actual self, without emotions that greatly impacted her music to be super downbeat, or upbeat, it'd have to be Goodbye Lullaby. Her newest album her fight with Lyme diseases was clearly a huge influence, and she even seems to wear more formal, and more importantly clothes that cover more of her. This is probably because Lyme disease is from ticks, and wearing longer clothing seems like and easy solution to try to stop from ticks getting on you. How dare you put Avril Lavigne here!\n\nPink Floyd Pink Floyd are an English progressive rock band formed in 1965 in London, England. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. The band consisted of 5 members - David Gilmour (Vocals and Guitar), Syd Barrett (Vocals and Guitar), Nick Mason (Drums), Roger Waters (Vocals and Bass), and Richard Wright (Vocals and Keyboard). Barrett was replaced by Gilmour in 1968. ...read more. 24 If you don't like normie people (and there's plenty of reasons not to), you're certainly not going to like the number one Normie band of all time. Here is a band that millions of benighted people liked, probably because they were so zoned out and boring that they weren't at all threatening. And their music was mainly droning trance stuff for people on drugs who hate to think. I never once liked this bland money-making machine, the idols of the undiscriminating and clueless masses, and I was happy when they broke up. Sid Barrett was the only good thing about them, and he was insane. They got very bad after he had to retire. When I found out that \"Dark Side\" was on the charts longer than any other album, I thought \"Is this how bad the rock audience really is?\" Yes, they were that bad. And what really killed rock? It was the bad audience, who honestly never liked anything but Soft Pop. Pink Floyd changed their sound when Roger Waters turned Pink Floyd into an autocracy. They never sold out, they just let one guy take over the band. Once Roger Waters disbanded Pink Floyd and David Gilmour reformed it, they went back to their signature sound. Despite all this, I still think Pink Floyd is the best band of all time. Pink Floyd doesn't sell out. Maybe they change the sound after Roger Waters.\n\nBut changing sound =/= sellout.\n\n\n\nBands need to evolve. They want to do something different despite of the popularity. That's it. Egomanic Waters ruined a great band by falling out with the \"sound\" of Floyd, Gilmour and Wright (RIP), believing he was the only one that mattered. His solo work is depressing, relentless utter crap"}, {"url": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/10/17/riaa-best-selling-artists-of-all-time/", "page_content": "The Best Selling Artists of All Time \u2014 Updated for 2022\n\nCountry, rap, and even 90s pop artists appear in the RIAA\u2019s list of best selling artists of all time.\n\nWelcome to our best selling artists of all time list! The list has recently been updated to reflect 2021 sales figures, which have introduced some interesting changes. Notably, Eminem has moved up several positions on the list, surpassing Guns N\u2019 Roses, and the previously unranked (within the top 50) Taylor Swift has found a spot of her own, above the likes of Bon Jovi, Queen, and Chicago.\n\nThe Eagles moved the most units of the top 10 artists, selling approximately 19 million additional albums between 2017 and 2021 \u2013 and proceeding to the number-four position as a result.\n\nBreaking down the RIAA\u2019s list of Gold and Platinum artists, you\u2019ll find a few surprises.\n\nFor example, only a few hip-hop artists appear on the best-selling artists of all time list. Eminem is right behind Guns N\u2019 Roses. 2Pac manages to hold his own, narrowly beating out Bob Dylan and Def Leppard.\n\nProving the power of manufactured pop, the Backstreet Boys make a strong showing, beating out Phil Collins and Dave Matthews Band.\n\nUnderscoring the popularity of country music, several country artists appear on the list. Garth Brooks takes second place, while Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, George Strait, and Fleetwood Mac rank high with total albums sold in the double-digits.\n\nYou can check out the top 50 best-selling artists, starting with #50, along with how many albums they\u2019ve sold, below.\n\n50.

Particularly with the resurgence of the recent Elvis biopic, this is likely to spark interest in new fans from the latest generations.\n\nElvis\u2019 bestselling single is \u201cIt\u2019s Now Or Never\u201d,with 5,42 million units sold. To give some perspective to this number, artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and the Rolling Stones never reached that type of figure for a unique physical single.\n\n#2 \u2013 Frank Sinatra\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 95,250,000\n\nTaking second place is Frank Sinatra, selling 95,250,000 units.\n\nHe is no doubt one of the most outstanding entertainers of all-time, and in the 30s/early 40s, the American music industry was heavily dominated by swing music, where Frank was at the top of his game.\n\nThree of Sinatra\u2019s songs made No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. These were, Learnin\u2019 the Blues\u201d (1955), \u201cStrangers in the Night\u201d (1966), and \u201cSomethin\u2019 Stupid\u201d (1967).\n\nHowever, it is safe to say that \u201cMy Way\u201d was his best-selling single of all time, with an impressive 989,000 sales.\n\n#3 \u2013 Michael Jackson\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 79,350,000\n\nMichael Jackson, also known as the King of Pop, was one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nHis physical single sales figures are 79,350,000, with 27 million vinyl records of Thriller sold.\n\nIt is interesting to point out that Michael Jackson has sold more digital singles than he did physical singes. His digital single sales are 79,930,000, also being the highest number of digital single sales out of the top 10 in the ranking.\n\nThis demonstrates the longevity of his career progressing into the digital age.\n\nToday, fans continue to collect Michael Jackson vinyl\u2019s, with the likes of \u201cBillie Jean\u201d, \u201cBeat It\u201d and \u201cThe Earth Song\u201d being amongst some of the most valuable single vinyl records to own.\n\n#4 \u2013 Madonna\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 75,210,000\n\nAmerican singer Madonna has released an impressive 92 singles and 24 promotional singles, selling more than 100 million singles worldwide.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Madonna is the most successful solo artist in Hot 100 chart history, and she is the biggest selling singles artist of all time, selling over 17.8million singles during her 30-year career.\n\nSome of Madonna\u2019s memorabilia is worth thousands of dollars online. In 2008 a record was uploaded to eBay by an Italian seller who did not realise it played Madonna track,\n\n\u201cLike a virgin\u201d. The vinyl ended up being sold for 8100 dollars.\n\n#5 \u2013 Stevie Wonder\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 65,320,000\n\nStevie Wonder placed fifth in the rankings, selling 65,320,000 physical single copies.\n\nHis bestselling single \u201cI Just Called to Say I Love You\u201d is just one of his ten US number-one hits on the pop charts.\n\nHe also has 20 R&B number one hits, selling over 100 million records, 19.5 million of which are albums.\n\nHe is one of the top 60 best-selling music artists with combined sales of singles and albums ever.\n\n#6 \u2013 Whitney Houston\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 49,520,000\n\nWhitney Houston is of course one of the most powerful ballad singers of all time, ranking in sixth with the most physical single sales of all time.\n\nHer first number on hit was \u201cSaving All My Love For You\u201d, selling over 1 million physical copies.\n\nWhilst \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d, sold over 20 million copies, it is the best-selling single of all time by any female solo artist.\n\nIt even won her a Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1994\n\n#7 \u2013 Cher\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 46,220,000\n\nKnown as the Goddess of Pop, Cher has sold over 100 million records worldwide as a solo artist, with 46,220,000 of them being physical copies.\n\nCher\u2019s song \u201cBelieve\u201d was a commercial success worldwide, topping the record charts in over 23 countries and with sales of over 11 million copies.\n\nWhilst her physical single sales figures are strong, her digital sales are the lowest in the top ten, with just 9,630,000.\n\n#8 \u2013 Prince\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 42,210,000\n\nPrince takes 8th place in the rankings, with \u201cThe Most Beautiful Girl in the World\u201d being his bestselling physical single, with 805,000 units sold.\n\nAfter releasing his Purple Rain soundtrack in 1984, Prince hit his sales peak, selling 13 million copies and spent six months at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart.\n\nHe has an impressive 7 Grammys, an Oscar for \u201cPurple Rain\u201d and a Golden Globe for \u201cThe Song of the Heart\u201d on the Happy Feet soundtrack.\n\n#9 \u2013 Janet Jackson\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 40,640,000\n\nJanet Jackon has sold over 40 million certified albums and singles in the United States and is one of the best-selling music artists alongside her brother.\n\nHer career spans 33 years from 1982 to 2015, and along the way she topped the US charts with 10 singles and 7 albums.\n\nHer album \u201cjanet\u201d was one of the best-selling albums of the 90s, scanning around 7.1 million copies.\n\n#10 \u2013 Billy Joel\n\nPhysical Singles Sales- 36,910,000\n\nAt number 10 is Billy Joel. After releasing 13 studio albums, six live albums, 18 compilation albums, 10 video albums, 61 singles, three promotional singles and 45 music\n\nvideos, he has sold over 150 million records worldwide.\n\nIt is safe to say he is a legendary singer-songwriter and pianist and is still currently touring across 3 countries and has 17 upcoming concerts.\n\nA spokesperson from Offline Marketing Company, Oppizi, says: \u201cThe rise in LP sales is fascinating to witness, as physical copies of music make a comeback. It appears physical goods still hold value for many people, even in the digital age.\n\n\u201cOf all the music formats, vinyl has the most value. Today, Vinyl records could sell for ten times its original price 20 years from now.\n\n\u201cOften, music lovers feel like digital downloads make them lose out on any sort of physical interaction with the music they are listening to. More people want to experience purchasing, which is why going to a record store and buying a vinyl is more appealing today.\n\n\u201cPeople today are also attracted to buying vinyl records for the album\u2019s art and exclusive copies can be bought and worth a fortune.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for music artists looking for ways to promote their music, pushing physical copies could be a great way to give fans that desired nostalgic purchasing experience.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://popculture.com/news/50-biggest-country-stars-of-the-21st-century/", "page_content": "50.

Keep Working Hard\n\nAlthough there are many reasons why hardworking people won\u2019t always be successful, this isn\u2019t an excuse to stop giving your goals 100%.\n\nHard work is essential if you want to be able to reach your full potential, and if you neglect it outright, your only outcome will be failure.\n\n3. Rely On Your Support Network\n\nIf you try to do everything on your own, you will quickly burn out from stress and fall behind on your progress.\n\nHowever, by building a support network of people with skills that complement your own, you can make things much easier for yourself without compromising your own progress.\n\nSummary\n\nCory Joseph has worked hard to become one of the best professional basketball players in the NBA, and he has no plans on leaving the court anytime soon.\n\nDespite not being one of the wealthiest players in the game, he has no shortage of fans who are looking forward to seeing much more from him in the future.\n\nMake sure to check back often so you won\u2019t miss any important updates on Joseph\u2019s ongoing career and growing fortune.\n\nAs of June 2023, Cory Joseph\u2019s net worth is estimated to be $3 Million.\n\nWhat do you think about Cory Joseph\u2019s net worth?
