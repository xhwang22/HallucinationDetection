(NYSE: WGO), a leading outdoor lifestyle product manufacturer, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Barletta Pontoon Boats (\u201cBarletta\u201d), the industry\u2019s fastest-growing, premium pontoon boat manufacturer, for an initial consideration of $255 million in cash and newly-issued Winnebago Industries shares, plus up to $15 million in Winnebago Industries shares upon the achievement of performance milestones at the end of calendar 2021. Certain growth objectives, if achieved through calendar years 2022 and 2023, provide the opportunity for up to $50 million in additional cash consideration. The transaction extends Winnebago Industries\u2019 marine platform into one of the fastest-growing boating segments, advances the Company\u2019s ongoing evolution into a premier outdoor lifestyle company, and is expected to drive significant financial accretion.\n\nBarletta was founded in 2017 with a focus on high-quality, innovative products, unrivaled service and strong dealer relationships, which has allowed the company to grow rapidly in the pontoon boat segment and establish a strong, differentiated position in the market. The privately-owned company manufactures a portfolio of premium pontoon boats and has a network of 125 dealer locations across the U.S. and Canada with coast-to-coast coverage and significant opportunity for regional expansion. Barletta generated full-year 2020 revenues of $120.6 million and EBITDA of $10.5 million, and expects to deliver full-year 2021 revenues of approximately $214.6 million and EBITDA of $26.4 million. Barletta\u2019s growth trajectory is supported by a strong backlog of orders. The company recently opened a new manufacturing facility in Bristol, Indiana to add production capacity and scale to better meet the demands of its continued growth.\n\n\"The acquisition of Barletta significantly expands Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the strong and growing marine market by acquiring the fastest-growing brand within one of the most rapidly-growing boating segments,\" said Winnebago Industries President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Happe. \"Barletta's premium, innovative pontoon boats are a natural fit with our broader brand portfolio, with shared appeal among families looking to create great experiences and memories on land or on water. Barletta's commitment to quality, innovation and service \u2013 the same golden threads that unite all Winnebago Industries brands \u2013 and strong relationships with its dealer partners, has driven tremendous growth, enabling Barletta to become a rising force in the industry in a short period of time. We look forward to leveraging our operational excellence, functional resources and proven expertise in nurturing and growing outdoor lifestyle brands to fuel the organic expansion of Barletta\u2019s product line, market share and margins. We are excited to welcome Barletta\u2019s talented employees to the Winnebago Industries team and believe this transaction positions us well to deliver enhanced growth and significant value creation for employees, customers and shareholders.\u201d\n\nBarletta Pontoon Boats President and Founder Bill Fenech commented, \u201cToday is an exciting day for Barletta, as Winnebago Industries\u2019 track record of cultivating premium outdoor lifestyle brands will allow us to further accelerate our growth, expand our offerings, and gain greater share of the pontoon boat market segment. Our shared values and dedication to creating exceptional outdoor experiences make Winnebago Industries an ideal owner and partner for us. We look forward to continuing to innovate and deliver the highest-quality products, unrivaled customer experience, and win-win partnerships with our dealers as Barletta grows within the Winnebago Industries portfolio.\"\n\nFollowing the close of the transaction, Barletta will operate as a distinct business unit within Winnebago Industries. Winnebago Industries\u2019 public reporting will include the formation of new Marine reporting segment comprised of Barletta and Chris-Craft. Barletta\u2019s manufacturing facilities will remain in Bristol, Indiana. Bill Fenech will continue to lead the Barletta business post-closing as its President.\n\nTransaction Highlights\n\nExtends Winnebago Industries\u2019 Marine Platform into the Highly Attractive Pontoon Market Segment: The acquisition of Barletta broadens Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the complementary and growing Marine market. Built on versatility, value and accessibility, pontoon boats represent the largest and one of the fastest-growing boating segments in North America, growing at double-digit CAGR over the past 10 years. As the demand for products by outdoor enthusiasts continues to grow, an expanded marine platform will enable Winnebago Industries to grow its customer reach and further balance its overall portfolio and revenue profile beyond recreational vehicles (RVs). Barletta\u2019s premium pontoons are highly differentiated from Winnebago Industries\u2019 Chris-Craft brand and have very limited dealer overlap with other Winnebago Industries brands. Additionally, the pontoon boat market segment provides an opportunity for Winnebago Industries to leverage the intersections between the RV and marine lifestyles and customer demographics, enhance sales and share best practices across the entire Winnebago Industries enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of Barletta broadens Winnebago Industries\u2019 presence in the complementary and growing Marine market.

Barletta\u2019s three main tiers of premium pontoons offer an extensive customer lifetime value runway as consumers upgrade over time. Barletta will benefit from Winnebago Industries\u2019 proven framework for differentiation through unique approaches to quality, innovation and service, and the ability to leverage the Company\u2019s operational expertise, supply chain relationships and resources to fuel product line expansion and broader geographic dealer penetration into untapped US markets.\n\n\n\nRecognized for its quality and innovation in the premium pontoon boat category, Barletta has achieved a 60+% revenue CAGR since its first year of production in 2018 and is already ranked among the top ten pontoon manufacturers by market share.

(NYSE: WGO), a leading United States (U.S.) recreation vehicle manufacturers, launched the Company's new 2016 motorhome and towable lines today at The Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev.\n\n\"Winnebago is the 'Real Deal', and we're proud to display the best and most comprehensive lineup in the Company's history,\" said Winnebago Vice President of Sales and Product Management Scott Degnan . \"With nearly 500 in attendance, we are seeing great response to new and redesigned products from what we consider the best dealer network in the industry.\"\n\nThe Adventurer and Suncruiser, Winnebago's flagship Class A gas models, have been totally redesigned inside and out. The exterior includes new front and rear molded fiberglass styling, as well as new lights, LED accent lights, aluminum finned grill and molded \"blade-type\" wheel trims with chrome accents. Inside, the excitement continues with new interior upgrades as well with a new contemporary dash, \"pull-over\" passenger work station with USB and 12-volt ports, new Xite G3 Infotainment system, new tile flooring extending into the cab area, new interior d\u00e9cor, curb view window and much more. The Adventurer and Suncruiser are a fantastic alternative to a consumer who wants the look and functionality of a higher-end diesel, but on a gas platform.\n\nThe iconic Winnebago design just became even more \"cool\" with the addition of the new \"Daytona\" full-body paint option to the retro-style Brave and Tribute motorhomes. This motorhome line is a great mix of the past and present with three unique Winnebago floorplans.\n\nWinnebago also introduced an all-new Journey and Meridian 38P four-slide floorplan. The 38P features an island wrap-around galley, large pop-up TV with Rest Easy sofa, large picture window on the patio side and spacious bedroom and bathroom with Winnebago's largest shower.\n\nA new Scorpion premium fifth wheel toy hauler is joining the Winnebago lineup and offers a large 14-foot garage space to haul all your toys.

Inside the living area of the unit, the wide body design and radius ceiling provide a spacious interior with features such as a 55\" TV, a large island with raised breakfast bar and much more.\n\nWinnebago's brand licensing partners also have products on display, including two new Winnebago park model RVs, Winnebago RV Covers and Winnebago Headwear and Apparel.\n\nAbout Winnebago Industries\n\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. , \"The Most Recognized Name in Motor Homes \u00ae\", is a leading U.S. manufacturer of recreation vehicles, which are used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreation activities.

WGO recently inked a deal to acquire Indiana-based recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturer, Newmar Corporation, for $344 million.\n\nDeal Details\n\nTotal consideration of the deal is valued at $344 million, which will be funded by a combination of cash and stock, based on Winnebago\u2019s $36.77 closing price on Sep 13. Winnebago will finance the deal with $270 million in cash and 2 million shares of its stock issued to Newmar shareholders. Per the pact, any stock price shortfall \u2014 as of the closing date \u2014 will be compensated by incremental cash payment up to $20 million.\n\nSubject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the agreement is set for closure in first-quarter fiscal 2020. Upon completion of the deal, Newmar shareholders will hold approximately 6% of Winnebago\u2019s outstanding shares. Newmar will operate as a standalone unit within Winnebago.\n\nDeal Motive\n\nWinnebago, which is a leading producer of RVs in the United States, primarily builds quality motorhomes, travel trailers, fifth wheel products and boats. Newmar, which manufactures luxury motorhomes, seems to be a natural fit in Winnebago\u2019s portfolio of outdoor lifestyle brands. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal.The Newmar buyout adds high-end motorized products to the existing Winnebago brand lineup. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise in the region and share their best practices, and bolster the combined entity\u2019s scale and leadership position.\n\nDeal Benefits\n\nThis buyout is likely to bolster Winnebago\u2019s product line and dealer network, and rev up the motor-home segment. The deal will expand Winnebago\u2019s core RV platform, thereby enhancing its position in North American RV landscape.\n\nThe combined entity will have approximately $2.6 billion in pro-forma revenuesand lead to a reduction in debt. The deal is likely to be immediately accretive to its free cash flow and fiscal 2020 EPS. Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The deal is also expected to result in cost savings of at least $5 million annually for a period of three years.\n\nWinnebago Gaining From Strategic Buyouts\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, Winnebago has rallied 55.6%, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 37.8%. The company also surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Winnebago has been riding on the strength of its acquisitions, including the buyout of Grand Design and Chris-Craft in 2016 and 2018, respectively. The Grand Design acquisition expanded the existing towable RV product offerings of Winnebago, while the Chris-Craft takeover enabled the company to enter into the marine segment. These acquisitions bolstered the firm\u2019s footprint and diversified portfolio in the outdoor lifestyle market. The Newmar acquisition is also likely to boost the performance of Winnebago.\n\nWill Growth Continue Amid Recession Worries?\n\nThe recreational vehicle industry is influenced by many strong macroeconomic factors and is extremely sensitive to overall strength of the economy, as buying an RV is a large discretionary purchase for majority of customers. With the weakening of the economy, RV sales generally fall sharply, as consumers do not feel confident enough in their financial stability to justify a large recreational purchase.\n\nThe industry has started to show signs of a slowdown, which is considered as an early warning sign of a recession. According to the RV Industry Association, RV unit shipments have declined around 20% so far this year, after declining 4.1% in 2018. Amid such a scenario, RV manufacturing biggie Thor Industries THO is scaling down the production of RVs. Further, LCI Industries LCII has consolidated some of its facilities in view of the slowdown. Headwinds like rising input costs and sluggish demand may impact the near-term performance of Winnebago, which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nNotably, wholesale shipments of RVs in 2019 are forecast to be 401,200 units, indicating a 17.1% year-over-year decline. Shipments for 2020 are likely to decline 3.5% to about 387,400 units. The industry is at risk from the U.S.-China trade war, with RV components likely to get impacted by tariffs, which would significantly raise prices for manufacturers. The price increase would likely be passed on to consumers, in turn lowering demand.\n\nDespite the cyclical downturn, the industry surely holds promise, as millennials are more inclined to spend on experiences that recreational vehicles can deliver. If the economy stays strong and continues to grow, RV sales will likely get a boost, thereby enhancing the performance of stocks within the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, a better-ranked stock in the RV space is Indiana-headquartered Skyline Champion Corporation SKY, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe firm builds a variety of manufactured and modular homes, park-model RVs, along with modular buildings. It was formed by the merger of Skyline Corporation and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC in June 2018. Skyline Champion, which had generated $1.3 billion revenues last year, is one of the largest homebuilders in America of late.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nZacks experts released their picks to gain +100% or more in 2020.

Having entered Dave Grohl's studio to record the next Mondo Generator Album, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for undisclosed reasons. In that same month they released their latest album Flight Of The Raven. It was produced by Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album Bleach.

Hailing from Oxford, the group began as a quartet however, during 1999. With a sound comparable to classic Sub Pop bands and Queens of the Stone Age (when Nick Oliveri mans the mic), two of the original members exited shortly thereafter, leaving Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums) to fend for themselves. Making a name for themselves the old-fashioned way (touring incessantly via van for very little pay and handing out demos), the duo eventually began building a loyal following, which led to a gig supporting Fugazi at London's Forum, which in turn got the attention of the head of indie label Fierce Panda Records. This led to the release of the duo's debut EP, Plata O Plomo, in March of 2003, and as a result, racked up accolades (including being nominated 'Best British Newcomer' at that years' Kerrang Awards). 2003 was a busy one for the Ben's, as they played well over a hundred gigs (including a spot at the Reading/Leeds festivals, and playing alongside the likes of Burning Brides and Nebula). Several singles and EP's found their way into the shops during late 2003 and early 2004 Manhunt, a split 7\" with tour mates Nebula, and the George Dickel EP, while Winnebago Deal was invited to take part in one XFM and two Radio One sessions. A new recording contract with Double Dragon Music soon followed, as the duo hooked up with renowned Sub Pop producer Jack Endino (best known for working with both Nirvana and Soundgarden early on). The resulting debut full-length, Dead Gone, appeared in September 2004, which was prefaced by a few gigs supporting Mondo Generator. A month after their debut's release, Plata O Plomo was reissued in Australia, with an expanded track listing.\n\n-Greg Prato / allmusic.com\n\nBetween the release of \"Dead Gone\" and recording the new album \"Flight Of The Raven\" Winnebago Deal toured the UK and Europe with High On Fire, Brant Bjork & The Bros, Therapy?, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, Tokyo Dragons and The Dwarves, as well as playing in Nick Oliveri's band Mondo Generator for European and US shows including a German tour with Motorhead and the recording of songs for the new Mondo album."}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Winnebago%20Deal", "page_content": "Winnebago Deal\n\nBand, *1999 GB, Oxford\n\nAlternative and Rock\n\nWinnebago Deal are a rock music band from Oxford, United Kingdom.

Although, as two pieces go, these boys make The White Stripes look like purveyors of stagnant nursery rhymes.\n\nFlight Of The Raven is their second full-length album, released on renowned indie label Fierce Panda. Opener With Friends Like These sets the tone for an album of stoner-influenced, punk-paced drinking tunes that will never make it to radio but, thanks to the boys\u2019 commitment to relentless touring, should still be coming to a town near you.\n\nFuture single Spider Bite starts with a muted, rolling riff that is unleashed into a thrashing tub-thumping rock number, complete with Hellacopters piano lick in the mid-section and the gruffest vocals you will hear on a song about spiders, ever. Reeper, meanwhile, is a slice of Fu Manchu in their early days with Cathedral\u2018s Lee Dorrian on vocal duties, tearing through their balls-out rock and roll by-numbers tune with style.\n\nVenomised sees the velocity slowed way down for a crushing horror groove that grinds its way through three minutes of feedback-laced lead lines and whispered female backing vocals. A Dose Of Something is just what the doctor ordered, back firmly in late \u201990s stoner territory, and makes it clear to see why this band have supported Nebula on numerous occasions. The title track features some of the rawest vocals you will ever hear, and follower You Let Me Down will have you scratching your head as to just how two instruments can make this much noise.\n\nWhile some rock bands seek to take their influences and set about trying to forge an as yet undiscovered musical mastery, there are others who simply reproduce their heroes\u2019 chords in a different order and make a packet on the back of someone else\u2019s creativity. Thankfully Winnebago Deal turn the latter position on its head, where they are only too happy to pay constant homage to their inspiration. You can barely find an interview where the lads aren\u2019t shouting about Melvins or Black Flag; and it\u2019s because of this that the blistering live duo will gain respect enough to negate what they\u2019re lacking in originality and hopefully win some fans en route."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1614420", "page_content": "Infobox musical artist\n\nName = Winnebago Deal\n\n\n\n\n\nImg_capt =\n\nImg_size =\n\nLandscape =\n\nBackground = group_or_band\n\nAlias =\n\nOrigin = England\n\nGenre = Rock\n\nYears_active = 1999\u2013present\n\nLabel = Fierce Panda Records , Double Dragon Music\n\nAssociated_acts =\n\nURL = [ http://www.winnebagodeal.com/ www.winnebagodeal.com ]\n\nCurrent_members = Ben Perrier\n\nBen Thomas\n\nPast_members =\n\nNotable_instruments =\n\nWinnebago Deal is a rock music band from Oxford , United Kingdom .
