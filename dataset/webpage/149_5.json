It\u2019s a little wonder that it eventually became known as \u201cThe Mammoth Cheese\u201d.\n\nFrom that point, the cheese ball seemed to have disappeared into culinary history for nearly 150 years. It then had the good fortune to resurface in 1944 in a book by Virginia Safford called Food of My Friends. In this book, a recipe was included for the Cheese Ball, and it wasn\u2019t long after that it found itself a staple of cuisine.\n\nCan it truly be considered a cuisine, though?

Remember, little events like this are always popular at the office, and imagine how many types of cheese balls can be discovered then! (Or\u2026 maybe there will just be a lot of almond covered ones.)\n\nA traditional cheese ball appetizer includes ingredients such as cream cheese, cheddar cheese, brie, sour cream, garlic powder and other spices. Some people like to create a spicy version that uses hot pepper sauce. Other people like to include a splash of Worcester sauce. Add Thai Sweet Chili sauce and serve with wontons!\n\nThrow a Cheeseball Party\n\nFor those people who have a collection of friends who enjoy a \u2018fortified blog of cream cheese\u2019, the only option is to grab a friend and host a fun and exciting cheese ball party!\n\nOf course the main food that is served must be cheeseballs, but that doesn\u2019t\u2019 have to be boring.

Sawyer to serve as New Hampshire representative at the Centennial Celebration of George Washington's Inauguration, to be held in Washington, D.C., a logical choice perhaps since Elisha's father was still Superintendent of Government Buildings. But Elisha and Charles were also close friends and associates, serving together on several local boards, and in the early 1900s they combined to underwrite the purchase of 4 acres of land on or near Dover Point Road that preserved the site of Dover's early meeting hall and church, and in turn conveyed the property to the First Parish Church, an area which, in the present day, is the subject of an ongoing architectural dig (recently described in one of Dover 400th Committee's online presentations).\n\nElisha became owner of 50 Silver St. by virtue of marrying Fannie, the youngest daughter of Dr. Alphonso Bickford, a local physician, who also served as Dover's Mayor in 1861-62, the start of the Civil War and a time of military recruitments and political uncertainty. Bickford died in 1869, Elisha and Fannie married the following year, and Elisha, still a lowly clerk at the National Bank, and his bride moved in with her now widowed mother. She died in 1896. Elisha and Fannie stayed and created the elegant home described in the earlier article.\n\nElisha's oldest son was Alphonso, who after graduating from Harvard Medical School, opened a practice in Newburyport. But he had interests other than medicine because in 1894 he was a member of the Frederick Cook Arctic expedition off the coast of Greenland, which ended with the scuttling of the expedition ship, the Miranda, and the successful recovery of the crew and passengers by another vessel.\n\nThis may explain Elisha's interest in the National Geographic Society. Although he managed to survive this experience he did not survive a later appendectomy, passing away following surgery in 1906 at age 34. His widow, Edith (who happened to be the daughter of a Mayor of Newburyport), and their daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1903, moved to Dover and resided at 45 Silver, one side of a double house, across the street from Elisha.\n\nElisha's second son, Harold, joined him at Strafford Savings after college and he and his family lived next door to Elisha at 38 Silver, the house with the window in the brick chimney. Upon Elisha's death in 1922, Harold, who by now had followed Elisha in becoming president of the bank, his wife and daughter moved into 50 Silver St. Then Harold's wife died in 1926 and after a suitable passage of time, he married Edith, his brother's widow, and she and Elizabeth moved to 50 Silver, too. At some point, Elizabeth married G. Allen Huggins who was employed as a \"clerk\" at the Savings Bank, and for several years they took over the space at 45 Silver. In 1934, Harold and Edith sold 50 Silver to Roy B. Ireland and they moved to the other side of the double house, being 43 Silver. (Are you still with me here?) By 1936, Allen (now Assistant Treasurer at the bank) and Elizabeth Huggins had purchased Back River Farm, the former Emerson Farm at the end of Bay View Road (that was featured in an earlier article about Dover's National Historic Register properties), and by way of maintaining the family tradition, their son was named Elisha.\n\nAnd then there was Philip, one of Elisha's twins. He had married Marguerite, daughter of Frank B. Williams, who lived at 103 Silver, who was the head of I.B. Williams (the \"I.B.\" was for Isaac Bartlett, by the way, Frank's father). Philip, who became an executive in the family business, and Marguerite made their residence across the street at 98 Silver. And by odd happenstance, Marguerite's sister, Dorothy Williams, married a young man whose family lived on Rutland Street, and his last name was\u2026Brown. Dorothy and Leroy moved next door to her parents at 107 Silver. (Many years later Dorothy, then a widow, moved back to the original family home at 103.)\n\nThe surname of Brown was very popular in Dover in the early part of the century. For example, there were 20 or more entries for Brown in the City Directory of 1924. Elisha and his offspring seemed to dominate Silver Street, but there were others, unrelated, who were close by. There was Arthur Brown, the proprietor of Newman's Pharmacy at the beginning of the street at Tuttle Square; he lived for a time at 55. George W. Brown was the owner of 43-45, and lived in one side of the house, listed as \"retired\". (He may have been related, but I couldn't find the connection.) Ernest B. Brown was identified as a \"salesman, Nashua\", and resided at No. 60 with two children, Philip R. and Viola H., both \"students,\" which might include all the way up to college graduation. All of these Browns within four blocks.\n\nJust as a footnote: When Harold Brown moved next door to his parent's home, he sold No. 38 which became known as the Dover Convalescent Home, operated by Rhonda Comiskey. Numbers 43-45 (which has special historical significance as one of the oldest houses in Dover, built in 1781) was the site of the Dame Tibbetts Tavern. According to a description from the Dover Library, \"Daniel Webster was among the tavern's regular clientele when he was in Dover presiding over the court.\" This later became the law office of Gregoire, Calivas, Morrison and Indorf, now of Atty. Thomas Torr.\n\nNumber 50 remained in the Ireland family well into the current century. Roy Ireland, who purchased the property from Harold Brown, was owner of a local shoe manufacturer, but consistent with the \"bank\" connections of the former owners, Ireland also was president of Dover's Merchants National Bank.\n\nNumber 103, the Williams family homestead is now the Silver Street Inn: Dorothy Brown died in 1977, age 85. Number 98, the home of Philip and Marguerite Brown (she died in 1981, age 97), is now the residence of City Councilor and Mrs. Dennis Ciotti.\n\nAnd one final note: in my list of spiffy vehicles registered in Dover in 1912, Frank B. Williams appears as an owner of a 38.4 h.p. Pierce Arrow. Several years prior, Pierce Arrow had been chosen by President Taft as the official White House vehicle, so this was a clear symbol of a successful man.\n\nTony McManus is a Dover native.

The first cheese ball was created by a farmer named Elisha Brown Jr. in 1801 in Massachusetts which she presented to then US President Thomas Jefferson at the White House. Here are five different cheeseball recipes to try today.\n\nSuji cheeseballs\n\nMade with semolina (suji) and cheese, these balls of goodness are the perfect evening snack with your cup of chai. Boil water in a pan. Add pepper, red chili powder, salt, and roasted semolina, and cook well. Take a small portion of the mix, flatten them, add cheese in the center, and make small spheres. Deep-fry and serve hot with chutney.\n\nSchezwan cheeseballs\n\nThese spicy and flavorful cheeseballs are the perfect appetizers to serve at a party. Boil potatoes, then peel, and mash them well. Add chopped garlic, onion, and corn and mix well. Add red chili powder, salt, pepper, and Schezwan sauce and mix well. Make small rounds, flatten them, add shredded cheese, and close the dough. Dip in cornflour-water slurry, deep fry, and serve.\n\nPotato cheeseballs\n\nMix together plain flour and water in a bowl and keep aside. Combine grated processed cheese, mashed potatoes, chopped green chilies, chopped onion, chopped cabbage, and salt. Divide the mixture and roll each portion into small balls. Dip the balls in the flour-water mix and roll in breadcrumbs. Deep-fry the balls in oil until golden brown. Serve hot with tomato ketchup.\n\nPaneer cheeseballs\n\nMix together crumbled paneer, chopped onions, chopped green chilies, chopped ginger, rice flour, Bengal gram flour, salt, cornflour, and finely-chopped coriander in a bowl. Divide the dough and shape each portion into flat rounds. Add a small cube of cheese in the center, seal the balls, and roll again lightly. Deep-fry the balls in rice bran oil. Serve hot with chili sauce.\n\nChocolate cheeseballs\n\nThis sweet dish offers a unique twist to the classic savory cheeseball recipe. It can be served as a dessert. Beat peanut butter, softened butter, and cream cheese in a bowl until creamy. Add confectioner's sugar, cocoa, brown sugar, more peanut butter, and chocolate chips, and mix well. Shape into small balls, roll in chopped walnuts, refrigerate for two hours and serve."}, {"url": "https://roughlydaily.com/tag/elisha-brown/", "page_content": "Treading in the divots at half time.

The first type are bright orange puffed corn balls that are similar in flavor to cheese curls. Airy but also crunchy, these snacks leave an orange stain on the fingers of those who eat them. The second type is molded with a softer cheese and are popular at parties, being served on trays and used as a dip for crackers. Traditional cheeseballs of this variety are made with cream cheese or cheddar cheese. Nuts, seeds, or dried fruit often decorate their outside, and they are commonly seasoned with garlic, pepper, and salt. Gourmet versions are flavored with ingredients such as Worcestershire sauce, blue cheese, olives, sherry, smoked salmon, and pineapple.\n\nThe first recorded cheeseball of the second kind was a giant one, clocking in at 1,235 pounds, and being known as the \"Mammoth Cheese.\" It was crafted at the farm of Elisha Brown, Jr. in Cheshire, Massachusetts, in 1801. A \"cheese hoop\" 4 feet in diameter and 18 inches deep\u2014which was strengthened with iron bands\u2014held the cheese in place as it was being molded. Elder John Leland, a Baptist preacher, presented the gargantuan cheeseball to Thomas Jefferson at the White House, on New Year's Day in 1802. According to one report, it was still being served in 1805; according to another, it was tossed into the Potomac River when it got too old to eat.\n\nNot much happened with this type of cheeseball for well over a century. A recipe for a more life-size version of it first appeared in print in 1944, in Food of My Friends, a cookbook by Virginia Safford, a columnist from Minneapolis. It became a popular mid-century food but fell out of favor in the following decades. Its fortune began to rise again in the twenty-first century, largely on account of Amy Sedaris. In 2002, with her brother David, Sedaris wrote a play called The Book of Liz, about a woman who makes cheeseballs for her religious community, Clusterhaven. Sedaris also has come up with cheeeseball recipes and showed Martha Stewart how to make one of her smoky cheeseballs on Stewart's television program.\n\nHow to Observe National Cheeseball Day\n\nCelebrate the day by eating some puffy corn cheeseballs or by dipping some crackers or other snacks into a cheeseball. If you are feeling extra festive, you could dip one type of cheeseball into the other. Although both can be found at stores, making them adds some extra excitement to the day. Many recipes for soft dipping cheeseballs can be found online, and recipes for cheeseball puffs can be found as well. Today is also the perfect day to pick up books like Food of My Friends by Virginia Safford or Great Balls of Cheese by Michelle Buffardi. If you are in the Massachusetts area, you could make a stop at the Mammoth Cheese monument in Cheshire.\n\nSponsor\n\nSomething Wrong or Missing?\n\nObservation Notifications\n\nThis event does not currently have a sponsor.

(National Archives Identifier 300222) View in National Archives Catalog\n\nRevolutionary War pension files can be a gold mine of information for genealogists searching for ancestors from the era of the nation's birth.\n\nTake, for example, Daniel Ide, a member of the prolific Ide family of Massachusetts.\n\nDaniel Ide was born in Westminster, Vermont, in 1783.1 A published genealogy of the Ide family lists an Ichabod Ide who lived in Westminster, Vermont, in the mid-1700s. Ichabod had many sons who could have fathered Daniel, but there is no Daniel listed in any of the family groups for Ichabod's children.2 A search of the Vermont vital records microfilm also failed to find a Daniel Ide other than his death record and birth records of his children.\n\nThere are quite a few pension files for the Ide family of Massachusetts, and fortunately for our search for Daniel, there is one for Israel Ide, one of Ichabod\u2019s sons. At first glance, a researcher might not consider this pension file because Israel served from Massachusetts. The pages within, however, show that Israel came from Westminster, Vermont, to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he signed on with Captain Wood's Regiment. Israel's brother Ichabod and several cousins were already serving in Wood's regiment. Almost at the end of the file is an affidavit from one Daniel Ide, who stated:\n\nI, Daniel Ide of Coventry in the County of Orleans and State of Vermont aged fifty six years depose and say that I am a Son to Israel and Martha Ide who formerly lived in Westminster in this State and afterwards lived in Coventry aforesaid\u2014I further State my Father the said Israel Ide died on the 9th day of October 1822 since which my Mother the said Martha Ide has ever continued a Widow.3\n\nDaniel swore to the affidavit on March 1, 1839. His age of 56 years at the time gives us a birth year of 1783, which matches the age listed on his death record. With the connection made between Daniel and Israel, it is now possible to trace the Ide family back to the original immigrant, Nicholas Ide, who was born about 1620 in Ide, England, and died in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, in 1690.4\n\nNot every Revolutionary War soldier received a pension. And the pension and bounty-land warrant application files contain mostly the records of enlisted men, not officers. The first pension act, enacted on August 26, 1776, allowed pensions for soldiers and sailors who had been injured in the service of the colonies and were therefore incapable of earning a living.\n\nLearn more about: Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty-Land Warrant Application Files on Ancestry.com.\n\nStrategies for researching Revolutionary War service.\n\nFamily samplers submitted to support pension applications.\n\nCongress Offers Incentives to Stay in Until War's End\n\nTo encourage officers and enlisted men to serve for the duration of the conflict, the Continental Congress passed a resolution on May 15, 1778, allowing half-pay for all officers and a set gratuity of $80 to all enlisted men who remained in service to the end of the war. On August 24, 1780, the Continental Congress passed the first act offering pensions to widows and orphans of Revolutionary War soldiers.\n\nDuring the war, pensions were used to encourage enlistment and acceptance of commissions and to prevent desertion and resignation. After the war, they became a form of reward for services rendered. States as well as the federal government offered and awarded pensions based on participation in the Revolutionary War. However, the Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty-Land Warrant Application Files in the National Archives (Microfilm Publication M804) contain only the records of pensions granted or paid by the U.S. federal government.\n\nNot until 1818 did Congress pass a pension law granting pensions to Revolutionary War veterans who had not been disabled. These pensions, based on financial need, were granted for life. When a larger-than-anticipated number of applicants led to financial difficulties for the young nation, Congress amended the 1818 law in 1820 and again in 1822. The most liberal pension legislation, enacted in 1832, gave full pay for life to officers and enlisted men who had served for two or more years and partial pay for service of six months to two years.5\n\nA fire in the War Department on November 8, 1800, apparently destroyed all Revolutionary War pension and bounty land warrant applications and related papers submitted before that date.6 The pension files now in the National Archives were filed after 1800 and contain either a 10-by-14-inch envelope (if the pension paperwork still exists) or a 10-by-14-inch card summarizing the information about a claimant (if the pension no longer exists). An envelope may contain from 1 to 200 (or more) pages of records. A typical file contains around 30 pages of records, consisting of an application or applications of one or more claimants (veteran [designated the survivor], widow, orphan, etc.); other documents submitted as evidence of identity and service; and papers showing actions taken by the government concerning the claim(s).7\n\nDifferent types of pensions contain some of the same records, such as applications or affidavits, as well as different types of records, such as marriage records. There are basically three types of pensions: survivor (the veteran himself), widow, or invalid.\n\nPension Files of Survivors Yield Much Information\n\nSurvivors' pension envelopes have headings containing the name of the state or organization in which the veteran served, his name, other names he was known by, and the letter S (for survivor) followed by a file number.\n\nThe file may contain affidavits testifying to the veteran's service or claimed disability; documentary evidence of service submitted by the applicant, such as a commission or discharge certificate; printed briefs summarizing the claimed service; property schedules; certified copies from state officials verifying the applicant's service record; letters from attorneys, congressmen, and other interested parties relating to the progress of the application; and letters from genealogists and researchers seeking information with responses from the Pension Office, the Bureau of Pensions, or the Veterans Administration.8\n\nWilliam Nudd's declaration at age 69 listed his war service, with enlistment at Greenland, NH, and several six-month enlistments and stations in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and New York. (National Archives, Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs)\n\nAn example of a survivor\u2019s pension is that of William Nudd, pension number S11151. His file contains a card that notes the pension roll where his pension was recorded and includes information on his service as a private in Colonel Mooney's Company, in the New Hampshire line. According to the card, he received a pension of $35.44 per annum, and his certificate of pension was issued on November 12, 1832, and sent to S. I. Tibbets, of Ossipee, Strafford County, New Hampshire. The file also includes a Declaration in Order to Obtain the Benefit of the Act of Congress passed July 7, 1832, which lists William's age as 69, and specific information on his Revolutionary War service: enlistment at Greenland, New Hampshire, and several six-month enlistments and stations in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and New York. The file also contains a preprinted form, \"Brief in the Case of, \" which asks questions about the veteran's age and in what battles he was engaged. Affidavits from William's long-time acquaintances giving support for his case are also present. By pension standards, his file, at around a dozen pages, is quite a small one.9\n\nWidows' pension application files envelopes have headings for the state or organizations in which the veteran served; his name and his widow's name; and the letter W (for widow) followed by the file number. Only the widow's given name will appear on the envelope unless she remarried, in which case her new surname will be included with the notation \"Former Widow.\" The file may contain records normally found in the survivor's file, especially if the file consolidates both the survivor's application and the widow\u2019s application.\n\nA veteran's pension application normally gives his age or date of birth, his residence, and sometimes his birthplace. Property schedules often give names and ages of a veteran\u2019s wife and children. The application of a widow seeking a pension or a bounty-land warrant may give her age, residence, maiden name, date and place of marriage, and the date and place of her husband's death. In some widows' pension application files is a copy of a marriage record from the town clerk, a clergyman, or a justice of the peace as proof of marriage. Sometimes family-record pages from Bibles and other books were also submitted by a widow as proof of marriage.10\n\nRevolutionary War Files Among Easiest to Use\n\nRosilla Hill, widow of Jonathan Hill, filed for a pension (application number W16291) based on her husband's service. While his service was from Massachusetts, Rosilla filed for a pension in Winchester, New Hampshire. The file includes a card listing the state roll where Rosilla was recorded with the annual payment of $99.55.\n\nLydia Coombs's affidavit provides information about her brother, Jonathan Hill, stating that he was married to Rosilla and that they had 12 children. (National Archives Identifier 54876474) View in National Archives Catalog\n\nAffidavits in the folder include one from Lydia Coombs, who stated that she was the sister of Jonathan Hill; that she lived in Douglas, Massachusetts, at the same time Jonathan and Rosilla were married, although she did not attend the ceremony; that Rosilla and Jonathan had lived together until his death; and that they had 12 children. Rosilla's declaration states that she is a resident of Winchester, New Hampshire; that Jonathan was a soldier in the first eight months of 1775; that they were married in May 1775 at Douglas, Massachusetts, by Elder Adam Stracter; that Jonathan was a substitute for Benjamin Robbins of Douglas and a one-month substitute for George Brown of Colcester, Rhode Island; and lastly that Jonathan died in Winchester, New Hampshire, on November 26, 1830.\n\nAn affidavit from William Dudley, town clerk of Douglas, Massachusetts, states that he was unable to locate in the town records any evidence of a marriage between Jonathan Hill and Rosillah Combs. However, he did find the intention of marriage for them published in Douglas on July 15, 1776. There are several letters of inquiry in the file and responses from the War Department. The file also states that Rosilla was 80 years old when she received her pension in 1839 and that Jonathan received a Bounty Land Warrant #4339, issued February 23, 1797, and given to William Blanchard.11\n\nRevolutionary War pension files are among the easier types of federal records to use because they are arranged alphabetically by surname of the veteran. Within surnames, the files are arranged alphabetically by given name and then alphabetically by state of service. The pension application files reproduced in Microfilm Publication M804 are also available online at www.ancestry.com.\n\nThe Revolutionary War pension and bounty-land warrant application files contain many 18th-century documents such as commissions, discharges, deeds, wills, diaries, journals, muster rolls, newspaper clippings, letters, marriage certificates, and family bible pages. These documents are too numerous for the National Archives to inventory and describe them all. Approximately 70 journals, diaries, and account books in the records have been inventoried, however, and a detailed descriptive list was compiled and printed in the descriptive pamphlet for Microfilm Publication M804.12\n\nMost of the inventoried items were written by the veteran, but some were written by fathers, wives, daughters, or sons of veterans. The time span of these items is from as early as 1685 and as late as 1853, but most items date from 1774 to 1781. The value of these items is more for the soldiers' perspectives than for genealogical information. The veterans included in this inventory are from 10 states:\n\nConnecticut: Thomas Bradford, Aaron Hart, Matthew Jackson, Simeon Lyman, Ephraim Lyon, John McCall, James Morris, Thomas Pierpoint, William Stevens, Lemuel Storrs, Jonathan Todd, and Robert Treat\n\nMassachusetts: Elijah Baker, Phinehas Bemis, Reuben Childs, Isaiah Eaton, William Farnsworth, Hezekiah Fay, Thomas Grafton, William Hamilton, Rufus Houghton, Andrew Kettell, Jonathan Libby, Benjamin Lock, George Mason, Joshua Mason, David Northey, Nahum Parker, Benjamin Pond, Joseph Roundey, Levi Stedman, Jehiel Stewart, Nathan Stickney, Josiah Stone, Abner Weston, Ammi White, Joseph White, and Joseph Wilder\n\nNew Hampshire: Samuel Chase, Daniel Kimball, Enoch Long, and John Spafford\n\nNew Jersey: Anthony Swain\n\nNew York:Henry Beckman Livingston and Samuel Millington\n\nNorth Carolina:Daniel Teachey\n\nPennsylvania: Daniel Deall, David Denny, Abner Everett, and Jacob Ritter\n\nRhode Island: Jabez Whipple\n\nSouth Carolina: Arthur Fairies\n\nVirginia: Zachariah Mills, Alvin Montjoy, Robert Scott, Anthony Tinsley, and George Toombs.13\n\nRevolutionary War pension application files have much to offer genealogists. If you have lost track of a family around the Revolutionary War, like the Ide family in Vermont, these records might connect your line as it connected Daniel and Israel. The Hill file also connected Jonathan Hill and Rosilla Coombs to Douglas, Massachusetts, and provided the information needed to find their parents. The amount of material in each file varies, but if you are lucky, you can find valuable insights into the veteran's life and his family.\n\nJean Nudd is an archivist with the National Archives. She is an avid genealogist and lectures frequently on using federal records and doing genealogy. She has given presentations to the Federation of Genealogical Societies in Boston, New England Regional Genealogical Conferences, and the Ohio Genealogical Society's annual conference, among many others.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Skirmishes between British troops and colonial militiamen in Lexington and Concord in April 1775 kicked off the armed conflict, and by the following summer, the rebels were waging a full-scale war for their independence. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778, turning what had essentially been a civil war into an international conflict. After French assistance helped the Continental Army force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, the Americans had effectively won their independence, though fighting would not formally end until 1783.\n\nCauses of the Revolutionary War\n\nFor more than a decade before the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, tensions had been building between colonists and the British authorities.\n\nThe French and Indian War, or Seven Years\u2019 War (1756-1763), brought new territories under the power of the crown, but the expensive conflict lead to new and unpopular taxes. Attempts by the British government to raise revenue by taxing the colonies (notably the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts of 1767 and the Tea Act of 1773) met with heated protest among many colonists, who resented their lack of representation in Parliament and demanded the same rights as other British subjects.\n\nColonial resistance led to violence in 1770, when British soldiers opened fire on a mob of colonists, killing five men in what was known as the Boston Massacre. After December 1773, when a band of Bostonians altered their appearance to hide their identity boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor during the Boston Tea Party, an outraged Parliament passed a series of measures (known as the Intolerable, or Coercive Acts) designed to reassert imperial authority in Massachusetts.\n\nDid you know? Now most famous as a traitor to the American cause, General Benedict Arnold began the Revolutionary War as one of its earliest heroes, helping lead rebel forces in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775.\n\nIn response, a group of colonial delegates (including George Washington of Virginia, John and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, Patrick Henry of Virginia and John Jay of New York) met in Philadelphia in September 1774 to give voice to their grievances against the British crown. This First Continental Congress did not go so far as to demand independence from Britain, but it denounced taxation without representation, as well as the maintenance of the British army in the colonies without their consent. It issued a declaration of the rights due every citizen, including life, liberty, property, assembly and trial by jury. The Continental Congress voted to meet again in May 1775 to consider further action, but by that time violence had already broken out.\n\nOn the night of April 18, 1775, hundreds of British troops marched from Boston to nearby Concord, Massachusetts in order to seize an arms cache. Paul Revere and other riders sounded the alarm, and colonial militiamen began mobilizing to intercept the Redcoats. On April 19, local militiamen clashed with British soldiers in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, marking the \u201cshot heard round the world\u201d that signified the start of the Revolutionary War.\n\nHISTORY Vault: The Revolution From the roots of the rebellion to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, explore this pivotal era in American history through sweeping cinematic recreations. WATCH NOW\n\nDeclaring Independence (1775-76)\n\nWhen the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia, delegates\u2014including new additions Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson\u2014voted to form a Continental Army, with Washington as its commander in chief. On June 17, in the Revolution\u2019s first major battle, colonial forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British regiment of General William Howe at Breed\u2019s Hill in Boston. The engagement, known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, ended in British victory, but lent encouragement to the revolutionary cause.\n\nThroughout that fall and winter, Washington\u2019s forces struggled to keep the British contained in Boston, but artillery captured at Fort Ticonderoga in New York helped shift the balance of that struggle in late winter. The British evacuated the city in March 1776, with Howe and his men retreating to Canada to prepare a major invasion of New York.\n\nBy June 1776, with the Revolutionary War in full swing, a growing majority of the colonists had come to favor independence from Britain. On July 4, the Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, drafted by a five-man committee including Franklin and John Adams but written mainly by Jefferson. That same month, determined to crush the rebellion, the British government sent a large fleet, along with more than 34,000 troops to New York. In August, Howe\u2019s Redcoats routed the Continental Army on Long Island; Washington was forced to evacuate his troops from New York City by September. Pushed across the Delaware River, Washington fought back with a surprise attack in Trenton, New Jersey, on Christmas night and won another victory at Princeton to revive the rebels\u2019 flagging hopes before making winter quarters at Morristown.\n\nSaratoga: Revolutionary War Turning Point (1777-78)\n\nBritish strategy in 1777 involved two main prongs of attack aimed at separating New England (where the rebellion enjoyed the most popular support) from the other colonies. To that end, General John Burgoyne\u2019s army marched south from Canada toward a planned meeting with Howe\u2019s forces on the Hudson River. Burgoyne\u2019s men dealt a devastating loss to the Americans in July by retaking Fort Ticonderoga, while Howe decided to move his troops southward from New York to confront Washington\u2019s army near the Chesapeake Bay. The British defeated the Americans at Brandywine Creek, Pennsylvania, on September 11 and entered Philadelphia on September 25. Washington rebounded to strike Germantown in early October before withdrawing to winter quarters near Valley Forge.\n\nHowe\u2019s move had left Burgoyne\u2019s army exposed near Saratoga, New York, and the British suffered the consequences of this on September 19, when an American force under General Horatio Gates defeated them at Freeman\u2019s Farm in the first Battle of Saratoga. After suffering another defeat on October 7 at Bemis Heights (the Second Battle of Saratoga), Burgoyne surrendered his remaining forces on October 17. The American victory Saratoga would prove to be a turning point of the American Revolution, as it prompted France (which had been secretly aiding the rebels since 1776) to enter the war openly on the American side, though it would not formally declare war on Great Britain until June 1778. The American Revolution, which had begun as a civil conflict between Britain and its colonies, had become a world war.\n\nStalemate in the North, Battle in the South (1778-81)\n\nDuring the long, hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington\u2019s troops benefited from the training and discipline of the Prussian military officer Baron Friedrich von Steuben (sent by the French) and the leadership of the French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette. On June 28, 1778, as British forces under Sir Henry Clinton (who had replaced Howe as supreme commander) attempted to withdraw from Philadelphia to New York, Washington\u2019s army attacked them near Monmouth, New Jersey. The battle effectively ended in a draw, as the Americans held their ground, but Clinton was able to get his army and supplies safely to New York. On July 8, a French fleet commanded by the Comte d\u2019Estaing arrived off the Atlantic coast, ready to do battle with the British. A joint attack on the British at Newport, Rhode Island, in late July failed, and for the most part the war settled into a stalemate phase in the North.\n\nThe Americans suffered a number of setbacks from 1779 to 1781, including the defection of General Benedict Arnold to the British and the first serious mutinies within the Continental Army. In the South, the British occupied Georgia by early 1779 and captured Charleston, South Carolina in May 1780. British forces under Lord Charles Cornwallis then began an offensive in the region, crushing Gates\u2019 American troops at Camden in mid-August, though the Americans scored a victory over Loyalist forces at King\u2019s Mountain in early October. Nathanael Green replaced Gates as the American commander in the South that December. Under Green\u2019s command, General Daniel Morgan scored a victory against a British force led by Colonel Banastre Tarleton at Cowpens, South Carolina, on January 17, 1781.\n\nRevolutionary War Draws to a Close (1781-83)\n\nBy the fall of 1781, Greene\u2019s American forces had managed to force Cornwallis and his men to withdraw to Virginia\u2019s Yorktown peninsula, near where the York River empties into Chesapeake Bay. Supported by a French army commanded by General Jean Baptiste de Rochambeau, Washington moved against Yorktown with a total of around 14,000 soldiers, while a fleet of 36 French warships offshore prevented British reinforcement or evacuation. Trapped and overpowered, Cornwallis was forced to surrender his entire army on October 19. Claiming illness, the British general sent his deputy, Charles O\u2019Hara, to surrender; after O\u2019Hara approached Rochambeau to surrender his sword (the Frenchman deferred to Washington), Washington gave the nod to his own deputy, Benjamin Lincoln, who accepted it.\n\nThough the movement for American independence effectively triumphed at the Battle of Yorktown, contemporary observers did not see that as the decisive victory yet. British forces remained stationed around Charleston, and the powerful main army still resided in New York. Though neither side would take decisive action over the better part of the next two years, the British removal of their troops from Charleston and Savannah in late 1782 finally pointed to the end of the conflict. British and American negotiators in Paris signed preliminary peace terms in Paris late that November, and on September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaty of Paris. At the same time, Britain signed separate peace treaties with France and Spain (which had entered the conflict in 1779), bringing the American Revolution to a close after eight long years."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Lt-Col-Samuel-Brown-Jr/6000000039147928199", "page_content": "About Lt.

Around 16,000 soldiers died from starvation or illness.\n\nHow Much Were Continental Soldiers Paid?\n\nPrivates in the Continental army earned about $6.25 a month. To entice soldiers to join the army, Congress, states and towns offered a bounty, which was a one-time payment of money or a grant of land, upon enlistment.\n\nThe amount of the bounty varied greatly depending on who was paying it and where the soldier enlisted, among other things.\n\nAlthough Continental soldiers made a decent amount of money, they also paid a lot in deductions, according to America Goes to War: A Social History of the Continental Army:\n\n\u201cMoreover, military pay was subject to deductions over which the soldier had little control. Deductions for costs to replace uniforms, arms,and equipment lost or destroyed on the march or battlefield reduced monthly wages as well. Paymasters simply introduced what was called a \u2018stoppage\u2019 in a soldier\u2019s pay. A private who was owed seventy-two dollars yearly often received only about twelve dollars per year after deductions for arms, clothes, family support, and fines.\u201d\n\nWhat Did Soldiers in the Continental Army Wear?\n\nUniforms of the Continental Army varied greatly in the first few years of the war. Then, in 1779, George Washington standardized the army\u2019s uniforms by ordering all soldiers to wear white or off-white breeches, white waistcoats and long blue jackets with facings of varying colors, depending on the regiment.\n\nEach state regiment wore different colors for the facings, lining and buttons, with white facings for New England state regiments, buff facings for New York and New Jersey state regiments, red facings for the middle state regiments as well as Virginia and blue facings for Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina state regiments.\n\nLater on, in 1782, blue coats with red facings became the standard for all Continental uniforms.\n\nHow Old Were Continental Soldiers?\n\nThe official enlistment age for the Continental Army was 16, (15 with parental consent) but soldiers could sign on up to the age of 55.\n\nThe majority of Continental soldiers were young men, usually around 17 or 18 years old. Older soldiers had more responsibilities at home, such as families to raise and farms to tend to, so they usually joined the local militias instead because the militia was a part-time commitment that worked locally and didn\u2019t have to march off to war like the Continental Army did.\n\nWhat Did Soldiers in the Continental Army Eat?\n\nEach soldier in the Continental Army was given a daily ration of one pound of beef/fish or three-quarters of a pound of pork, a pound of bread, three pints of dried vegetables, a pint of milk and a quart of spruce beer of cider or a gill of whiskey.\n\nWhere Were Most of the Continental Soldiers From?\n\nWhen the Continental Army was first formed in 1775, about 16,449 of the 37,363 soldiers were from Massachusetts. This is not all that surprising though seeing that the American Revolution started in Massachusetts and the British army occupied the area since the beginning.\n\nHowever, Massachusetts soldiers continued to make up the bulk of the Continental Army in almost every year of the Revolutionary War, except for 1779 and 1780 when the ranks were mostly Pennsylvania soldiers.\n\nAfrican-American Soldiers in the Continental Army:\n\nIt is estimated that around 5,000 African-Americans served as soldiers in the Revolutionary War.\n\nAlthough the Continental Congress voted to ban African-Americans from joining the army on November 24, 1775 and informed existing black soldiers that they would not be allowed to re-enlist, they soon reversed this decision and allowed the existing black soldiers to re-enlist but refused to allow new black soldiers to join.\n\nAs the war continued, this policy was abandoned primarily because states had trouble recruiting enough soldiers to meet their quotas and realized they needed all the soldiers they could get, regardless of race.\n\nThe black soldiers served alongside white soldiers, making the Continental Army a desegregated, integrated army, which would it would not be again until 1948.\n\nThe only all-black regiment in the Continental Army was the First Rhode Island Regiment, which officially began recruiting African-Americans and Native-Americans in February of 1778 after the Rhode Island General Assembly voted to allow the enlistment of black men and natives.\n\nSome notable African-American soldiers in the Continental Army were:\n\n\u2666 Pomp Jackson, served in Capt. Jeremiah Hill company of Col. Edmund Phinney\u2019s Regiment.\n\n\u2666 Peter Salem, first served in Captain Simon Edgell\u2019s militia company, then enlisted in Capt. Drury company of the 6th Massachusetts Regiment, reenlisted in the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, reenlisted again in the 6th Massachusetts Regiment, reenlisted again in Captain Claye\u2019s Company of Colonel Nixon\u2019s Regiment.\n\n\u2666 Felix Cuff of Waltham, Massachusetts\n\n\u2666 Cato Prince, served in Capt. Ebenzer Smith\u2019s company of the 8th Massachusetts Regiment\n\n\u2666 Pelatiah McGoldsmith of Palmer, Massachusetts\n\n\u2666 Primus Jackall, served in Capt. Jonathan Maynard\u2019s company, Capt. Nathaniel C, Allen\u2019s company, Capt. Francis\u2019s company which are all in Lieutenant Col. John Brooke\u2019s regiment.\n\nWomen Soldiers in the Continental Army:\n\nThe exact number of women who served in the Continental Army is unknown but is considered to be small in comparison to the hundreds of women who fought in the American Civil War, according to Linda Grant De Pauw in her book Battle Cries and Lullabies:\n\n\u201cStill, when all is said and done, the numbers are surprisingly small. There are two possible explanations. One is that despite the high visibility of Washington\u2019s army in the history books, most of the fighting during the American Revolution was small scale and local; women who had patriotic motives for military activity did not have to join the Continental Army to take part. The other explanation is that America did not have a social class as impoverished as that which provided soldiers for European armies. In the seventeenth century, after the end of the Thirty Years War, professionalized royal regiments came into existence. Joining these, soldiers lost their individuality. They were no longer free to select their own uniforms, for instance, and they were put under such firm discipline that Keegan describes it as a \u2018military slave system.\u2019 The attraction for recruits was the security military life offered. Kings and Queens were always waging wars, so lifetime employment was guaranteed. The Continental Army, by contrast, was mustered for an emergency; Americans continued to be hostile to standing armies and expected to demobilize when peace came. Thus there was little economic incentive for women to enlist.\u201d\n\nSince women were not allowed to join the army or state militias at the time, these women soldiers disguised themselves as men by cutting their hair, binding their breasts, wearing men\u2019s clothing and adopting masculine aliases.\n\nSome of the women were discovered while in service but their names are unknown because military officials declined to provide them in the official papers and records, possibly to protect their identity when they returned to civilian life.\n\nSome of the other women were identified either because their identity was discovered after they were killed in battle or because they later applied for military pensions.\n\nOthers, such as Margaret Corbin, never even disguised her identity and served openly as a woman when she took up arms in the heat of a battle.\n\nThe women who survived the war and did not seek military pensions are completely untraceable and we will never know who or how many there were.\n\nSome notable women soldiers in the Continental Army were:\n\n\u2666 Deborah Sampson alias Robert Shurtliff, served in Capt. George Webb\u2019s Company of the 4th Massachusetts Regiment. Later received a military pension and wrote a memoir about her military service.\n\n\u2666 Ann (or Nancy) Bailey, alias Samuel Gay, served in Capt. Abraham Hunt\u2019s Company of the 1st Massachusetts Regiment. Her identity was discovered and she was brought to trial, fined and sent to prison for a brief sentence.\n\n\u2666 Ann Marie Lane, served in the Virginia Light Dragoons until 1781. Later received a military pension.\n\n\u2666 Elizabeth Gilmore, a private who served in an unidentified regiment.\n\n\u2666 Margaret Corbin, camp follower who manned her husband\u2019s cannon after he was killed in the Battle of Fort Washington, later joined the Corps of Invalids after she was injured in the same battle.\n\n\u2666 An unidentified woman who served in the 1st New Jersey Regiment, her gender was discovered in 1777 and she was discharged.\n\n\u2666 Sally St. Clair, served in an unidentified South Carolina regiment that is rumored to be the Sgt. Jasper of Marion\u2019s Brigade, identity was discovered after she was killed in battle.\n\n\u2666 Two unidentified women who served in the 2nd South Carolina Regiment.\n\nSources:\n\nGrant De Pauw, Linda.

(The Netherlands, which was engaged in its own war with Britain, provided financial support to the Americans as well as official recognition of their independence.) On land the Americans assembled both state militias and the Continental (national) Army, with approximately 20,000 men, mostly farmers, fighting at any given time. By contrast, the British army was composed of reliable and well-trained professionals, numbering about 42,000 regulars, supplemented by about 30,000 German (Hessian) mercenaries.\n\nAfter the fighting at Lexington and Concord that began the war, rebel forces began a siege of Boston that ended when the American Gen. Henry Knox arrived with artillery captured from Fort Ticonderoga, forcing Gen. William Howe, Gage\u2019s replacement, to evacuate Boston on March 17, 1776. An American force under Gen. Richard Montgomery invaded Canada in the fall of 1775, captured Montreal, and launched an unsuccessful attack on Quebec, in which Montgomery was killed. The Americans maintained a siege on the city until the arrival of British reinforcements in the spring and then retreated to Fort Ticonderoga.\n\nThe British government sent Howe\u2019s brother, Richard, Adm. Lord Howe, with a large fleet to join his brother in New York, authorizing them to treat with the Americans and assure them pardon should they submit. When the Americans refused this offer of peace, General Howe landed on Long Island and on August 27 defeated the army led by Washington, who retreated into Manhattan. Howe drew him north, defeated his army at Chatterton Hill near White Plains on October 28, and then stormed the garrison Washington had left behind on Manhattan, seizing prisoners and supplies. Lord Charles Cornwallis, having taken Washington\u2019s other garrison at Fort Lee, drove the American army across New Jersey to the western bank of the Delaware River and then quartered his troops for the winter at outposts in New Jersey. On Christmas night Washington stealthily crossed the Delaware and attacked Cornwallis\u2019s garrison at Trenton, taking nearly 1,000 prisoners. Though Cornwallis soon recaptured Trenton, Washington escaped and went on to defeat British reinforcements at Princeton. Washington\u2019s Trenton-Princeton campaign roused the new country and kept the struggle for independence alive.\n\nIn 1777 a British army under Gen. John Burgoyne moved south from Canada with Albany, New York, as its goal. Burgoyne captured Fort Ticonderoga on July 5, but, as he approached Albany, he was twice defeated by an American force led by Generals Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold, and on October 17, 1777, at Saratoga, he was forced to surrender his army. Earlier that fall Howe had sailed from New York to Chesapeake Bay, and once ashore he had defeated Washington\u2019s forces at Brandywine Creek on September 11 and occupied the American capital of Philadelphia on September 25.\n\nLearn how George Washington and other commanders reconstituted the Continental Army while wintering at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, during the American Revolution See all videos for this article\n\nAfter a mildly successful attack at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on October 4, Washington quartered his 11,000 troops for the winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Though the conditions at Valley Forge were bleak and food was scarce, a Prussian officer, Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, was able to give the American troops valuable training in maneuvers and in the more efficient use of their weapons. Von Steuben\u2019s aid contributed greatly to Washington\u2019s success at Monmouth (now Freehold), New Jersey, on June 28, 1778. After that battle British forces in the north remained chiefly in and around the city of New York.\n\nWhile the French had been secretly furnishing financial and material aid to the Americans since 1776, in 1778 they began to prepare fleets and armies and in June finally declared war on Britain. With action in the north largely a stalemate, their primary contribution was in the south, where they participated in such undertakings as the siege of British-held Savannah and the decisive siege of Yorktown. Cornwallis destroyed an army under Gates at Camden, South Carolina, on August 16, 1780, but suffered heavy setbacks at Kings Mountain, South Carolina, on October 7 and at Cowpens, South Carolina, on January 17, 1781. After Cornwallis won a costly victory at Guilford Courthouse, North Carolina, on March 15, 1781, he entered Virginia to join other British forces there, setting up a base at Yorktown. Washington\u2019s army and a force under the French Count de Rochambeau placed Yorktown under siege, and Cornwallis surrendered his army of more than 7,000 men on October 19, 1781.\n\nThereafter, land action in America died out, though war continued on the high seas. Although a Continental Navy was created in 1775, the American sea effort lapsed largely into privateering, and after 1780 the war at sea was fought chiefly between Britain and America\u2019s European allies. Still, American privateers swarmed around the British Isles, and by the end of the war they had captured 1,500 British merchant ships and 12,000 sailors. After 1780 Spain and the Netherlands were able to control much of the water around the British Isles, thus keeping the bulk of British naval forces tied down in Europe."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/projects/American-Revolutionary-War-soldiers/272", "page_content": "For DAR information, see Daughters of the American Revolution\u200e.\n\nThe American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783) or American War of Independence began as a war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and thirteen British colonies in North America, and concluded in a global war between several European great powers.\n\nThe war was the culmination of the political American Revolution, whereby many of the colonists rejected the legitimacy of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation, claiming that this violated the Rights of Englishmen. The First Continental Congress met in 1774 to coordinate relations with Great Britain and the by-then thirteen self-governing and individual provinces, petitioning George III of Great Britain for intervention with Parliament, organizing a boycott of British goods, while affirming loyalty to the British Crown. Their pleas ignored, and with British soldiers billeted in Boston, Massachusetts, by 1775 the Provincial Congresses formed the Second Continental Congress and authorized a Continental Army. Additional petitions to the king to intervene with Parliament resulted in the following year with Congress being declared traitors and the states to be in rebellion. The Americans responded in 1776 by formally declaring their independence as one new nation \u2014 the United States of America \u2014 claiming their own sovereignty and rejecting any allegiance to the British monarchy.\n\nFrance's government under King Louis XVI secretly provided supplies, ammunition and weapons to the revolutionaries starting in 1776, and the Continentals' capture of a British army in 1777 led France to openly enter the war in early 1778, which evened the military strength with Britain. Spain and the Dutch Republic \u2013 French allies \u2013 also went to war with Britain over the next two years, threatening an invasion of Great Britain and severely testing British military strength with campaigns in Europe \u2014 including attacks on Minorca and Gibraltar \u2014 and an escalating global naval war. Spain's involvement culminated in the expulsion of British armies from West Florida, securing the American colonies' southern flank.\n\nThroughout the war, the British were able to use their naval superiority to capture and occupy American coastal cities, but control of the countryside (where 90% of the population lived) largely eluded them because of the relatively small size of their land army. French involvement proved decisive, with a French naval victory in the Chesapeake leading at Yorktown in 1781 to the surrender of a second British army. In 1783, the Treaty of Paris ended the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded by what is now Canada to the north, Florida to the south, and the Mississippi River to the west.\n\nNumbers of Continentals Soldiers and Militia\n\nVarious accounts of totals have been made.

A division of sentiment was not unexpected. On no question can a perfect unanimity be hoped, or certainly it would have been on that between war and embargo, the only alternatives presented to our choice; for the general capture of our vessels would have been war on one side, which reason and interest would repel by war and reprisal on our part.\n\nOf the several interests composing those of the United States, that of manufactures would of course prefer to war, a state of non-intercourse, so favorable to their rapid growth and prosperity. Agriculture, although sensibly feeling the loss of market for its produce, would find many aggravations in a state of war. Commerce and navigation, or that portion which is foreign, in the inactivity to which they are reduced by the present state of things, certainly experience their full share in the general inconvenience: but whether war would to them be a preferable alternative, is a question their patriotism would never hastily propose. It is to be regretted, however, that overlooking the real sources of their sufferings, the British and French Edicts, which constitute the actual blockade of our foreign commerce and navigation, they have, with too little reflection, imputed them to laws which have saved them from greater, and have preserved for our own use our vessels, property and seamen, instead of adding them to the strength of those with whom we might eventually have to contend.\n\nThe Embargo, giving time to the belligerent powers to revise their unjust proceedings and to listen to the dictates of justice, of interest and reputation, which equally urge the correction of their wrongs, has availed our country of the only honorable expedient for avoiding war: and should a repeal of these Edicts supercede the cause for it, our commercial brethren will become sensible that it has consulted their interests, however against their own will. It will be unfortunate for their country if, in the mean time, these, their expressions of impatience, should have the effect of prolonging the very sufferings which have produced them, by exciting a fallacious hope that we may, under any pressure, relinquish our equal right of navigating the ocean, go to such ports only as others may prescribe, and there pay the tributary exactions they may impose; an abandonment of national independence and of essential rights revolting to every manly sentiment: While these Edicts are in force, no American can ever consent to a return of peaceable intercourse with those who maintain them.\n\nI am happy in the approach of the period when the feelings and the wisdom of the nation will be collected in their representatives assembled together. To them are committed our rights, to them our wrongs are known, and they will pronounce the remedy they call for: And I hear with pleasure from all, as well those who approve, as who disapprove of the present measures, assurances of an implicit acquiescence in their enunciation of the general will.\n\nI beg leave through you to communicate this answer to the address on which your signature held the first place, and to add the assurances of my respect."}, {"url": "https://revolutionarywarjournal.com/american-light-dragoons-and-partisan-corps-in-the-revolutionary-war/", "page_content": "Virginia Light Dragoon 1776. Later of the 1st Continental Light Dragoons. From Charles Lefferts, Uniforms of the Armies in the War of the American Revolution, 1775-1783\n\nTowards the end of 1776, Washington formed what became known as Light Dragoons and Partisan Corps or Legions. Light Dragoons were specifically units of mounted cavalry or horse. Partisan Corps were unique, for unlike dragoons of horse, they were elite units consisting of both cavalry and light infantry of foot. Highly mobile, by the summer of 1777, both forms of cavalry became the eyes and ears of the American army. It became common for highly mobile groups of light cavalries to not only provide valuable service during major battles, but to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance, engage enemy troop movements, disrupt delivery of supplies, raid and skirmish enemy positions, and organize expeditions behind enemy lines to gather intelligence.\n\nBut realizing their importance had come with a price. When Washington arrived in New York City during the spring of 1776 to prepare for an expected British invasion, he focused on the city\u2019s defenses. Among the troops arriving to defend the city was a volunteer militia of Connecticut cavalry commanded by Colonel Elisha Sheldon. Washington refused their offer of a regular mounted unit. He did not recognize the value of a highly mobile force. It was long thought that the forested terrain of America did not lend itself to an effective cavalry. Companies of Horse were almost nonexistent and rarely saw service during the previous French and Indian war \u2013 prejudicing the need of Horse by military commanders leading the rebellion. Washington also claimed that due to the lack of sufficient forage for the horses, he could not sustain a cavalry and sent Sheldon\u2019s unit back to Connecticut. He would soon pay dearly for his decision.\n\nOn August 22, 1776. British commander General William Howe landed 15,000 men on Long Island. The Americans had foreseen just such a move and had already prepared a series of forts and redoubts in Brooklyn. Their defensive lines extended both south and east for several miles. Though the British incorporated highly mobile units of horse dragoons to patrol the lines and report on enemy movements, the Americans relied on foot troops, mainly a unit of riflemen rangers under Colonel Thomas Knowlton. Between the British and American lines were four important passes that the Americans guarded. The fourth, at Jamaica Pass was the most distant, five miles from Brooklyn and considered too far for concern. General Sullivan posted only five soldiers to watch for enemy movement while the rebels prepared for the expected British attack.\n\nBattle of Long Island, Aug. 27, 1776. Note Jamaica Pass on upper right. Had the pass been protected by a company of cavalry, the Americans may have been warned in time to prevent disaster.\n\nOn the evening of August 26th, General Howe split his army. He left a force of British and Hessians along the American center and right, while his main army swung to the east to march all night to attack the American left flank by daybreak. In the early morning hours of August 27th, Howe came through Jamaica Pass and easily overpowered the five guardsmen. Meanwhile, British and Hessians forces confronting the American center and right launched their feint attack. While the American\u2019s attention was focused on this diversionary assault, Howe fell upon the American left and rear. The American line collapsed, entrapping General Sullivan\u2019s division. If not for the sacrifice of nearly four hundred Maryland troops, who held the line and attacked, the entire division would have been lost.\n\nWashington was handed a devastating defeat, but like all the officers of the rebellion, there was a steep learning curve taking place. It became obvious that without a mobile unit of horse to patrol the lines and quickly report back important intelligence on troop movements and strength, Washington and his officers were at a great disadvantage. He began to take steps to improve his army\u2019s abilities to gain enemy information. In the month between the Battle of Long Island and General Howe\u2019s invasion of Manhattan Island, Washington became frustrated by his lack of enemy intelligence. Seeds were sown in the city that would eventually grow into an elaborate spy network. More pressing for immediate needs, Washington turned to his intelligence officer, Colonel Thomas Knowlton. Captain Nathan Hale, of Knowlton\u2019s Rangers, assumed a disguise and was sent to Long Island to gain enemy information, resulting in the schoolteacher\u2019s capture and execution. Washington\u2019s intelligence woes continued as the British army pursued the rebels north to White Plains and across New Jersey, the Americans barely crossing the Delaware River to safety.\n\nTrooper in Major Henry \u2018Light Horse Harry\u2019 Lee\u2019s Legion.\n\nBaylor\u2019s 3rd Continental Regiment.\n\nBy late 1776, any preconceptions of a fruitless and inefficacious cavalry vanished. Washington was thoroughly convinced of his army\u2019s need for corps of highly mobile horse. They would not only improve communications but probe enemy lines and garnish information by staging raids to capture and interrogate prisoners. He applied to Congress who granted him the power to establish a system of cavalry. Without prior experience in organizing a cavalry, Washington set about forming what became Light Dragoons and Partisan Corps of Legions. He re-designated all existing horse to form the basis of his Light Dragoons. Officers were given permission to select their subordinates. Each regiment was commanded by a colonel, lieutenant colonel, and a major. Regiments were divided into six troops, each commanded by a captain, one lieutenant, one cornet (second lieutenant), two sergeants, four corporals, and thirty-two privates. Each company also had a farrier (shoed and took care of horses\u2019 hoofs), armorer, and trumpeter for a regimental total of 267 officers and troopers. Washington\u2019s army would field four regiments of dragoons. Smaller Partisan Corps were also incorporated into the army. They too were labeled light horse, their sizes varied from fifty men to a company size of nearly a hundred (as was the case with Captain Allen McLane\u2019s Partisan Corps). However, a Partisan Corps usually numbered fifty troopers while sixty or more was considered a Legion, such as Major Henry \u2018Light Horse Harry\u2019 Lee\u2019s Legion.\n\nListed are the four regiments of dragoons along with additional partisan corps that were incorporated into the American Continental Army. Given is their date of authorization, organization and original commanding officer:\n\n1st Continental Regiment of Light Dragoons (Bland\u2019s Horse). Authorized June 8, 1776 as Virginia State Troops. Assigned to Continental Army on November 25, 1776, re-designated Virginia Lt. Horse led by Lt. Colonel Theodoric Bland. Organized on March 31, 1777. Consisted of six troops from Virginia.\n\n2nd Continental Regiment of Light Dragoons (Sheldon\u2019s Horse). Authorized on December 12, 1776, Colonel Elisha Sheldon of Connecticut\u2019s horse became its commander. Organized between Dec. 16, 1776 and June 21, 1777. Consisted of four troops of Connecticut, one from Massachusetts, and one from New Jersey.\n\n3rd Continental Regiment of Light Dragoons (Baylor & Lady Washington\u2019s Horse). Authorized on January 1, 1777, Lt. Colonel George Baylor from Washington\u2019s personal staff was chosen to command. Organized in the spring of 1777 at Morristown, NY. Consisted of three troops from three troops from Virginia, two from Maryland, and one troop recruited at large.\n\n4th Continental Regiment of Light Dragoons (Moylan\u2019s Horse). Authorized on January 5, 1777, Colonel Stephen Moylan, Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp commanded. Organized spring of 1777 at Philadelphia. Consisted of six troops from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.\n\nArmand\u2019s Partisan Corp comprised of light infantry of foot and light horsemen.\n\n1 st Partisan Corps (Armand\u2019s).

Though they rarely changed the course of events or made a major impact on a specific battle, historian William Sherman explained that \u201cthey were seen as encouraging initiative and acts of boldness which in turn bolstered the Continental army\u2019s morale; while fostering an offensive spirit in a conflict where pitched major engagements were normally avoided and where, due to both logistical constraints and lack of training, it was generally ill advised for large bodes of American forces to be on the attack.\u201d Washington felt confident that his units of horse gave him time and knowledge, consistently keeping him abreast of enemy strength and motion. This allowed him to plan appropriate tactics and quickly take necessary actions when the need arose. Through trial and error, the Continental Army eventually realized all the necessary limbs required to forge an effective fighting force \u2013 no doubt the cavalry forming Washington\u2019s right hand.\n\nThe Cowpens, South Carolina, January 17, 1781.
