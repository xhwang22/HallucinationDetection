{"Frank Abagnale Jr. escaped from police custody twice, once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary.": [{"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/alcatraz-escape-8-daring-prison-breaks-history/2722/", "page_content": "On June 12, 1962, inmates Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin are discovered missing from their cells on Alcatraz Island during an early morning bed check. To this day, they have never been found. It is the most iconic prison escape in American history.\n\nTake a look at a list of history\u2019s other daring prison breaks:\n\n1. Catholic Nobleman Who Fled in Drag (1716)\n\nWilliam Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale (1676 \u2013 March 2, 1744) was a Catholic nobleman who took part in the Jacobite Rising of 1715. After joining the rebellion, the earl was captured at Preston together with other Jacobite leaders. He was found guilty of treason, sentenced to death, and locked in the Tower of London. On February 24, 1716, the night before the day of his execution, his wife Lady Nithsdale went to visit him in prison accompanied by her maid and friends. The group smuggled in women\u2019s clothes for the Earl then spirited him out of the Tower disguised as a woman. The Earl fled to Rome where he lived with his wife until his death.\n\n2. Public Enemy No.1 and His Fake Wooden Gun (1933)\n\nIn the heyday of the Depression-era outlaw, John Herbert Dillinger (June 22, 1903 \u2013 July 22, 1934) was one of the most wanted American gangsters. After spending most of his 20s in state prison for attempting to hold up a small-town Indiana grocer, Dillinger was paroled in May 1933. From September 1933 until July 1934, he and his violent gang terrorized the Midwest. They killed 10 men, wounded 7 others, robbed banks and police arsenals, and staged 3 jail breaks \u2013 killing a sheriff during one and wounding 2 guards in another. Of his 3 jail breaks, Dillinger\u2019s March 3, 1934 escape from the Lake County Jail in Crown Point, Indiana was the most infamous as the the jail was deemed \u201cescape-proof\u201d. Originally arrested on charges that he killed a police officer during a bank robbery in 1933, he allegedly used a fake gun carved out of wood and blacked with shoe polish to escape.\n\n3. Catch Me if You Can (1971)\n\nBetween the ages of 15 and 21, Frank William Abagnale Jr. (born April 27, 1948) spent his years posing as a check forger, teacher, doctor, attorney, and faux airline pilot and so on. He was eventually captured in France in 1969, and served six months in a French prison, six more in Sweden, finally being deported to the United States where he was sentenced an additional 12 years in the federal prison. Abagnale attempted to escape from the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta Georgia in 1971 by convincing the prison guards that he was a prison inspector. Despite the 1971 escape attempt and another one, Abagnale was paroled after five years on the condition he would help federal authorities uncover check forges. Abagnale parlayed his unique skills into a security consultant career advising banks and businesses on how to avoid fraud. Abagnale\u2019s early life story inspired the feature film Catch Me If You Can starring Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n4. The Serial Killer Who Fled Up in Aspen (1977)\n\nNobody knows when or where Theodore \u201cTed\u201d Robert Bundy (born Theodore Robert Cowell; November 24, 1946 \u2013January 24, 1989) killed for the first time. According to the FBI, Bundy\u2019s prolific reign of terror and murder was well underway by 1974. In 1976, law school dropout Bundy was charged with killing a vacationing nursing student, and he found himself in Aspen, Colorado in June 1977 for a preliminary hearing. Bundy, who was acting as his own attorney, asked to use the court\u2019s law library, was left alone there, and jumped out of a second-floor window then fled up Aspen Mountain. Bundy was located in Aspen a few days later. On New Year\u2019s Eve in 1977, after losing weight, Bundy seized another opportunity for escape and slipped through an opening in the ceiling of his cell, walked out of the front door through the jailer\u2019s office. Bundy continued his murder spree while on the run. On the evening of January 14, 1978, he invaded a Florida State University sorority house and brutally killed two co-eds and left a third with serious injuries. Bundy was apprehended by police in Pensacola on February 15, 1978. He received three death sentences in two separate trials for the Florida homicides, and died in the electric chair at Raiford Prison in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989. Shortly before his execution, he confessed to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. Some experts have suggested the actual number might be higher.\n\n5. The Flying Murderer (2001, 2003, 2007)\n\nA French convicted killer Pascal Payet (born July 7, 1963) fled into the sky in a helicopter not just once, but three times. He was initially sentenced to a 30-year jail term for a murder committed during the robbery of a security van in 1997. Payet\u2019s first escape came in 2001 when he arranged for friends to collect him from the roof of a village prison in a helicopter. Two years later, while still a fugitive, he re-visited the same prison to help three more inmates escape by chopper. He was eventually caught, but then escaped for the third time from the Grasse prison in southeast France in 2007 using a helicopter hijacked by four men in Cannes. Payet and his accomplice fled, and the pilot was not harmed. Payet was recaptured on September 21, 2007 in Barcelona, Spain and was transferred to French custody a couple of weeks later.\n\n6. Korean Houdini (2012)\n\nChoi Gap-bok, 50, a yoga practitioner for 23 years, was arrested on suspicion of robbery on September 12, 2012, and was put in a detention cell at the police station in Daegu, South Korea. On early morning on September 17, while his prison guards were asleep, Choi applied the \u201cspecial cream\u201d he had requested on the upper part of his body and slipped out of the food slot at the bottom of his cell. The space that the 5\u20194\u2019 Choi squeezed through was 5.9 inches tall and 17.7 inches wide. The escape only took 34 seconds. Six days later, Choi was caught and put in a cell with a much smaller food slot.\n\n7. NY Prison Break (2015)\n\nOn June 6, 2015, for the first time in the 170-year old history of the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York, convicted killers David Sweat, 34, and Richard Matt, 48, vanished from the maximum security prison leaving guards a note that read \u201chave a nice day\u201d. They smuggled in hacksaw blades, hiding them in frozen hamburger meat, and cut through a steel wall, carved into a large pipe and crawled along tunnels before finally popping out of a manhole in Dannemora, New York. Their expected ride never showed up, and after 20 days on the run, Matt was shot dead while Sweat was returned to custody two days later.\n\n8. Mexican Drug Lord (2015)\n\nMexico\u2019s most notorious drug lord, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera (born December 25, 1954 or April 4 1957), known as El Chapo, escaped from a high-security prison in a laundry cart in 2001. It took authorities 13 years to catch him again. After only 17 months back in prison, on July 11, 2015, Guzm\u00e1n, the billionaire head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, stepped into a shower at a maximum-security prison, crawled through a hole and vanished through a mile-long tunnel apparently built for him. The tunnel began with a 20\u00d720 inch opening inside the shower of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cell. The Mexican prison from which El Chapo escaped is virtually identical in layout to one he escaped in 2001. Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured by Mexican marines following a shootout on January 8, 2016."}, {"url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13655694/is-catch-me-if-you-can-a-true-story/", "page_content": "CATCH Me If You Can was a blockbuster hit for Steven Spielberg in 2002 and brought with it a tale of cat and mouse.\n\nThe movie, which saw Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio team up, told the story of a young con artist who managed to evade capture from the FBI.\n\n3 Leonardo DiCaprio played Frank Abagnale, Jr. in Catch Me If You Can Credit: \u00a9 Dreamworks\n\nWhat is Catch Me If You Can about?\n\nFrank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) worked as a doctor, a lawyer, and as a co-pilot for a major airline - all before his 18th birthday.\n\nA master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame.\n\nAt the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most successful bank robber in the history of the U.S.\n\nFBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) makes it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him.\n\n3 Film was directed by Steven Spielberg (centre) and also starred Tom Hanks (right) Credit: DreamWorks\n\nIs Catch Me If You Can a true story?\n\nThe film is a true story and is based on the life of Frank Abagnale.\n\nAs a teenager he successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana parish prosecutor.\n\nAfter the film was released, Frank released Catch Me Where You Can - The Screenplay, where he stated in the foreword that film was 80% true to what had really happened.\n\nThe film was also based on Frank's 1980 autobiography of the same name.\n\n3 The real Frank Abagnale (left) seen here with Leo and Tom Credit: Getty - Contributor\n\nWhere is Frank Abagnale now?\n\nFrank, now 72, was born on April 27, 1948 and is an American security consultant known for his career as a con man, check forger and impostor from the age of 15 to 21 years old.\n\nHe became one of the most notorious impostors, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities and stealing millions of dollars.\n\nFrank escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary) before turning 22 years old.\n\nHe served fewer than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government.\n\nHe is currently a consultant and lecturer for the FBI academy and field offices.\n\nFrank also runs Abagnale and Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale", "page_content": "Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (born April 27, 1948 in Bronxville, New York City, United States) is an American security consultant.

He later impersonated various white-collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started his own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of his life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about his personal history was shared in his 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via his website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties.\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr. started his own business.\n\nAbagnale would later state that he had a stable childhood and was especially close to his father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When his mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to her husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were his siblings devastated, but so was his father, who was still in love with his wife. As his mother worked toward her independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with his father after the divorce, and he often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white-collar transactions.\n\nCredit Card Schemes\n\nAs a teenager, Abagnale got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. He soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using his father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Abagnale convinced gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when his father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, his father was struggling financially.\n\nDismayed over her son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent him to a school for wayward boys. Undone by his father's newfound circumstances and caught between his parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old.\n\nAbagnale had little in his bank account and no formal education. Abagnale altered his driver\u2019s license to make himself 10 years older than he was and exaggerated his education. This helped him get better-paying jobs, but he still barely made ends meet.\n\nAbagnale decided to quit working and wrote bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn his account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that he would eventually be caught, he went into hiding.\n\nImpersonations Meant to Impress\n\nAbagnale realized that he could cash more bad checks if he dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. He decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so he schemed his way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that he had lost his uniform while traveling. HQ told him where to go to pick up a new one, which he did \u2014 and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D.\n\nAbagnale then learned all he could about flying \u2014 once, by pretending he was a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am \u2014 and cleverly forged his own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. His ruse earned him valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which he did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world.\n\nOnce Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, he decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought his identity was blown \u2014 but instead, he was invited to visit the local hospital, where he became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Abagnale eventually gave up the gig and left town.\n\nOver the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with him when he settled down in Montpelier, France. He had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized his face on a wanted poster, she turned him in to authorities.\n\nJail Time and Consultancy\n\nAbagnale served time in France (reputedly in the harsh confines of Perpignan, where he became seriously ill), Sweden and the United States for his crimes, during which time his father died. Abagnale was eventually granted parole after several years from a Petersburg, Virginia prison. He eventually found lecturing work as a white-collar crime specialist, providing information to bank employees about ways to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nIn exchange for his freedom, the government told Abagnale that he had to educate them about his methods in order to prevent others from defrauding authorities. Abagnale worked with the FBI for more than 30 years as one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on document fraud, check swindling, forgery and embezzlement. He also started his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which educates others on how to avoid becoming fraud victims.\n\nMovie: 'Catch Me If You Can'\n\nIn 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the aforementioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nUpon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that he regrets that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of his life behind.\n\nBooks\n\nAbagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: April 27, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Bronxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the United States and overseas for his fraudulent crimes.

While being transferred into prison by a United States Marshal, the Marshal forgot to give the prison Abagnale\u2019s detention commitment. This struck the administration as unusual, and caused the guards to believe that he was a prison inspector sent by the FBI. Using this information to his advantage he used his phone call to get his friend, Jean Sebring, to forge a business card to back up the story.\n\nSebring used a business card given to her by FBI Agent Joe Shea and altered it to include Abignale\u2019s information. Once delivered to Abignale, he told the guards that he was in fact an inspector sent by the FBI and that he had to get outside of the prison to talk to his fellow FBI agent. The guards laughed and boasted about how they knew all along and were difficult to fool, ultimately allowing Abagnale to leave the facility.\n\nHe was eventually returned to prison to serve four years, but following his release, made an effort to turn his life around.
