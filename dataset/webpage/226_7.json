But even she will admit she didn\u2019t quite carry the clout of the woman who virtually ordered her to become a Member of Parliament \u2013 none other than former Prime Minister, \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 Margaret Thatcher.\n\nDuring her decade at the cutting edge of Government, and in all during her 21 years as a serving MP, Virginia never lost sight of the education of life and good values that were instilled into her as a young girl growing up, for the most part, here on the Island.\n\nDespite being born in Scotland, simply because her father was working there at the time, she, along with numerous family members, calls the Island her home. She is here as often as she can be, despite now being an active member of the House of Lords as Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, as well as working as a head-hunter for a high-profile company in London. She chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board & CEO Practice, which conducts searches for Chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors for plcs and private companies.\n\nDuring a break away from life in the fast lane that she still enjoys, Virginia took time out to give \u2018Island Life\u2019 readers an insight into her interesting and rewarding career as an MP, and her love of the Island.\n\nShe revealed: \u201cMy great grandfather Sir Edward Poulton came to St Helens Cottage in about 1890, and in 1915 he gave St Helens Common to the National Trust. My other grandfather Dr. William Garnett bought a house in Seagrove Bay around 1900.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents met playing hockey in Priory Bay, and we still play hockey there, so the family have been doing that for more than 100 years. All my family were quite academic and very involved in public policies. Dr William Garnett was involved in introducing education to London as one of the original signatories of the London School of Economics where I studied, so I am very proud of him.\u201d\n\nHer family bought half of Priory Bay in 1926, and the family home was built the following year. Since then the whole family has been down here constantly, with often as many as 100 relations gathering in the summer.\n\nVirginia points out: \u201cWe all share a passion for the Island. As a young girl I remember we had these appalling traditions, so every Easter Monday we would walk from Horestone Point to Whitecliff Bay \u2013 again a walk that was started by my great grandfather in 1890. The other tradition is swimming to St Helens Fort. My great uncles who were killed in the First World War did it, and I swam to the Fort when I was 10 years old.\n\n\u201cAnother childhood memory was when we loaded up the dinghies and drove to Freshwater and then rowed around and had a picnic in Scratchells Bay. Another time we had a running race from Freshwater to home. We really went for it, and couldn\u2019t move for a week afterwards. It was a competitive environment.\n\n\u201cWhen we were young Priory Bay was quite distant from Ryde because people didn\u2019t have cars and we went everywhere by boat. I think we learned a great resilience. Sometimes the tide and wind are against you and you make no progress. On other occasions you have the tide and wind with you, and even though you don\u2019t make much effort you travel like a rocket. I think that is the most wonderful lesson for life \u2013 sometimes you work so hard and it doesn\u2019t happen, but other times you just sail through it.\u201d\n\nVirginia recalls one of the most influential people in her life was her \u2018very special\u2019 aunt Peggy Jay. She said: \u201cShe was in politics and had a massive influence on me, and I say my husband Peter only married me because he thought I would turn out like Peggy Jay. She was a member of the Greater London Council, and was forceful. She was a great reformer and campaigner. She was brought up on the Island, and was a wonderful mentor.\u201d\n\nDespite being married to a Tory MP, Virginia had never given much thought to joining him in the Commons. Then one day her whole life changed when she received a call from 10 Downing Street, on the orders of PM Margaret Thatcher, saying more female MPs were required, and she was on the \u2018wanted list\u2019.\n\nShe continued: \u201cI decided Peggy Jay should have been an MP, but she wasn\u2019t so I would be. I wanted Peter to be the MP for the Isle of Wight long ago, and then in 1982 it came up for the following year\u2019s General Election. I worked so hard and actually got 34,900 votes \u2013 only five people in the country got more votes than I did, but one of those was Liberal Stephen Ross, the sitting MP, who beat me.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. The campaign was \u2018Turn Wight Blue\u2019 and Mrs. Thatcher even came over to visit. The day after I had lost she rang me to say \u2018what bad luck\u2019 and I burst into tears. But it made me realise much more about the Island; the huge delights, but also some of the difficulties and dilemmas.\n\n\u201cI learned how hugely entrepreneurial and creative the Island is with lots of small businesses and so many dedicated people. We all hope it can become an Island of real enterprise and creativity in small businesses. With modern technology, distance working and IT, my senses are that it is going to become ever more possible to realise this vision. The Island really has everything going for it.\n\n\u201cWhatever I have done, I have always felt part of my energy was put into developing and promoting the Island in any way I could. The Island needs all the help it can get to make people realise what a wonderful and exciting place it is.\u201d\n\nVirginia became MP for South West Surrey in 1984. There were 365 applicants to be the Tory candidate, but she was chosen and subsequently won the seat. She said: \u201cAt the time there were just 23 women MPs in a House of Commons of more than 600, so we were like an endangered species. Now the ratio is about one in four. I loved the constituency life and being involved in every aspect.\u201d\n\nInitially she served under Margaret Thatcher and then John Major, and received her first ministerial position in 1988 as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment. She was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1989, and was appointed a member of the Privy Council upon joining Major\u2019s Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in 1992, serving until 1995.\n\nShe then served as Secretary of State for National Heritage until 1997. After the 1997 General Election, she returned to the back benches, saying: \u201cI had been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and returning to the back benches enabled me to re-connect with my family. After 10 years I felt I had done my time and needed my life back.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her 10 years as a Minister, Virginia recalls: \u201cMrs. Thatcher called me one day to see her on a Monday, which was unusual. I said I was busy and could it be later in the week. But I was summoned and she offered me a job as a Minister. I was so surprised. She wanted me to go to Environment, but I had only ever spoken about Defence, Agriculture or transport, and knew nothing about it.\n\n\u201cShe replied very smartly that I would have to read up on it! It was very interesting getting people to use unleaded petrol, and recycle. But I loved being Secretary of State for Health because it was so demanding and intense. It was a job where I had a real role with serious responsibilities. I had to take difficult decisions, so I had to be courageous and tenacious to survive.\u201cWhen I first became a Minister I had a very bright young man in Central Office. He was 23 and used to coach and brief me when I went on television\u2019s \u2018Question Time\u2019. He was a very clever, positive person, and his name was David Cameron!\u201d\n\nThat is one of the main reasons why Virginia is very supportive of the present team, even though she believes coalition must be \u2018incredibly frustrating, compromising and complex\u2019.\n\nAfter quitting the Cabinet Virginia continued to work closely with Tory leaders William Hague, Ian Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. It was Howard who put her in the House of Lords in 2005. She said: \u201cI was absolutely delighted, and it was unexpected. Some of the debates in the Lords are phenomenal, and it will be a great loss if it goes. But I accept it is hard to justify.\u201d\n\nVirginia added: \u201cI am someone who is constantly restless, so I am never really satisfied. I have been married coming up 45 years to the same person, and that is something that gives great strength. But if you can find a role in life that in your way plays to your strengths and minimises your many failings then you are privileged.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/virginia-bottomley/biography", "page_content": "Virginia Bottomley Biography\n\nBritish politician\n\nPersonal detailsBorn (1948-03-12) 12 March 1948 (age:75)Dunoon, ScotlandPolitical partyConservativeSpousePeter Bottomley \u200b(m.:1967)\u200bChildrenJosh \u00b7 Cecilia \u00b7 AdelaEducationPutney High SchoolAlma materUniversity of Essex (BA)London School of Economics (MA)SignatureWebsiteOfficial websiteVirginia Bottomley's voicefrom the BBC Front Row, 25 April 2013\n\nVirginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Bottomley, Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, PC DL (n\u00e9e Garnett, born 12 March 1948) is a British Conservative Party politician and headhunter.
