Born and raised in New York's Greenwich Village, Davis learned to play the guitar as a youngster. Music remained an avocation, however, until her late teens. Although she began writing songs at the age of 18, Davis didn't turn to music as a career until briefly attending Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica, New York. Leaving school to devote her full attention to music, she recorded a demo tape of her original tunes and was signed by Elektra. They released her debut album, Blame It on Me, in late 1997. It reached number 157 on the Billboard 200, and her first single, a cover of Ani DiFranco's \"32 Flavors,\" became a Top 40 single in early 1998. The single's success also led to an invitation to participate in the Lilith Fair. Davis and Elektra disagreed, however, about the direction of her career. While the label hoped for a straightforward R&B sound, Davis was more interested in fusing her rich mix of influences. Her 2001 sophomore effort, Fortune Cookies, was powerful and original; it also went unpromoted and drove a wedge between her and the label. Striking out on her own, she formed the Tigress Records imprint to release her third album, 2005's critically acclaimed Surrender Dorothy.\n\nThough she continued to perform live, not much was heard from Davis in industry circles until she revealed in early 2018 that she had another album ready. Saying that her career had played out backwards -- \"I got my first deal\u2026and then I paid my dues\" -- she previewed her fourth album at a concert in New Orleans that March. Cleopatra released the sparer Love Again in May of 2018."}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/7118982-Alana-Davis-Fortune-Cookies", "page_content": "There is a short hidden track at the end of Track 11.\n\n\n\nAlbum Recorded At \u2013 The Magic Shop, NYC, Overdubs recorded at Joe Music, and Ed Tuton's House\n\nMixed At \u2013 The Hit Factory, NYC\n\nTracks 1, 4,5, Recorded At \u2013 The Penthouse, NYC\n\nTrack 6 Recorded At - The Right Track Studios, NYC\n\nMastered At \u2013 Gateway Mastering\n\n\n\nAll Songs Published By Humblebee Music / EMI Blackwood Music Inc., (BMI) Except: Track 2 3EB Publishing / EMI Blackwood Music Inc.

Rejuvenated by the spirit of the first three Dio albums, guitarist Vivian Campbell, bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Vinny Appice joined forces with singer Andrew Freeman (Hurricane, Lynch Mob) to perform songs from the classic Dio era. The band eventually decided to make new music, and those songs will be showcased on the upcoming album, Heavy Crown, due Feb. 19.\n\nSadly, Jimmy Bain passed away on Saturday (Jan. 23) at the age of 68, but Last in Line have decided to proceed with Loudwire's exclusive premiere of the \"Blame It on Me\" lyric video (watch above) in tribute to the late bassist.\n\nA vast departure from the raging speed of the previously released track \"Martyr,\" the song \"Blame It on Me\" explores a more barren and tortured soundscape. The doomy atmosphere is led by staccato guitar work, which releases its tension by letting chords sustain while Freeman delivers subdued verses and an angst-ridden chorus. Freeman does well to give a nod to the legacy of Ronnie James Dio, but carefully strays from inviting close comparisons by injecting his own soulful idiosyncrasies. Meanwhile, the lead in the chorus is reminiscent of \"Pain,\" a Dio song off the 1993 effort Strange Highways, though Appice was the only Last in Line member present on that record.\n\nFollowing Jimmy Bain's passing, Campbell stated, \u201cIt's with the heaviest of hearts that I must confirm the news of the passing of our dear friend and Last In Line bandmate, Jimmy Bain. It was Jimmy who gave me my first big break in the music industry and for that I am forever indebted. Jimmy was immensely proud of our new album and his input to it was immeasurable. We will continue to celebrate his life through his music. On behalf of Vinny and Andrew, our thoughts and condolences are with his family at this most difficult of times. Rest in peace, dear friend.\u201d\n\nHeavy Crown was produced by Jeff Pilson, furthering the Dio ties as Pilson plucked the strings on and off with the band, ultimately being featured on three Dio studio albums. The album is available for pre-order at iTunes, and includes immediate downloads of \"Blame It on Me\" and the previously released songs \"Devil in Me\" and \"Martyr.\"\n\nSee Where Vivian Campbell Ranks Among the Top 50 Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time"}, {"url": "https://www.ruicardo.com/musica/suggestions/george-ezra-blame-it-on-me/", "page_content": "Il giardino \u00e8 stato benedetto dagli dei di me e te\n\nCi siamo diretti ad ovest per ritrovarci un po 'di verit\u00e0, ooh\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\nAbbiamo contato tutte le nostre ragioni, le scuse che abbiamo fatto\n\nCi siamo trovati un tesoro e l'abbiamo buttato via\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\n...\n\nQuando ballo da solo e il sole sta sanguinando\n\n\u00c8 colpa mia\n\nQuando perdo il controllo e il velo \u00e8 abusato,\n\n\u00c8 colpa mia\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\nCatturato dalla marea dei fiori, catturato nel carnevale\n\nHai dimenticato la tua fiducia, vedo correre gli zingari\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\n...\n\nQuando ballo da solo e il sole sta sanguinando\n\n\u00c8 colpa mia\n\nQuando perdo il controllo e il velo \u00e8 abusato,\n\n\u00c8 colpa mia\n\nQuando ballo da solo, so che andr\u00f2\n\nDai la colpa a me ooh\n\nQuando perder\u00f2 il controllo, so che andr\u00f2\n\nDai la colpa a me ooh\n\nCosa stai aspettando?\n\n..."}, {"url": "https://www.definitions.net/definition/Blame%20It%20on%20Me", "page_content": "\u00d7 Close Note\n\nThe ASL fingerspelling provided here is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment.\n\n\n\nThere are obviously specific signs for many words available in sign language that are more appropriate for daily usage."}, {"url": "https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27086702", "page_content": "\n\nYear: 2002 2:35 37 Views\n\nMy baby's got this set of jet black eyes I swear that girl's the devil in disguise I've been Let down Burned out So let me tell you what I'm talking about I've been Chastised Deprived She's got my skull filled with sentimental lies She's no good for me So I'm gonna set her free I'm gonna let you fly Bye bye so long my sweet baby Chorus: Me, my love Blame it on me Me, my love Say it was me now Me, my love Step back, don't jack me up now Please, my love Blame it on me My girl, she's got this jet black hair When she walks, heads stop, rotate and stare I've been Let down Locked out So let me tell you what she's all about There's Black lies Fake cries She's got this bag filled with sentimental lies She's no good for me So I'm gonna set her free I'm gonna let you fly Bye bye so long my sweet baby Chorus Hey I know I'm wrong So I'll go home Make me believe Believe don't tease me, please now Chrorus"}, {"url": "https://radio.callmefred.com/en/song_story/sorry-blame-it-on-me-akon/", "page_content": "-The song is called \"Sorry, Blame it on Me\".\n\n-It is the fifth single from R and B singer/songwriter Akon's second studio album, Konvicted (Deluxe Edition).\n\n-The song was co-written and produced by Clinton Sparks.\n\n-The song was written after an incident in a nightclub in which Akon performed a sex dance with an underage girl.\n\n-A demo of the song was leaked in February 2007, several months before the official version was available on Akon's Myspace.\n\n-The song was released on iTunes on July 17, 2007.\n\n-The song reached the number one position on iTunes on July 21, 2007 and July 23, 2007."}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/6047047-DReam-Blame-It-On-Me", "page_content": "Booklet:\n\nAll tracks produced by D\u00b7Ream with Tom Frederikse for FXU\n\nAll tracks published by Pumphouse Songs Inc (PSI) / EMI Music Publishers\n\n\n\nAn Artificially Sweetened sleeve\n\n\n\nBooklet & back cover:\n\n1 \u2117 1993 \u00a9 1994 Warner Music UK Ltd / 2,3,4 \u2117 1994 \u00a9 1994 Warner Music UK Ltd A Time Warner Company\n\n\n\nBack cover:\n\nThe copyright in this sound recording & artwork is owned by Warner Music UK Ltd.\n\n\n\nOn disc:\n\nAll tracks published by Pumphouse Songs Inc (PSI) / EMI Music Publishers / copyright control\n\n\n\n1 \u2117 1993 \u00a9 1994 Warner Music UK Ltd.\n\n2,3,4 \u2117 1994 \u00a9 1994 Warner Music UK Ltd.\n\nA Time Warner Company\n\n_\n\nCatalog numbers:\n\n4509-97790-2 MAG1027CD on back cover\n\nMAG 1027CD 4509-97790-2 on spine & disc\n\n\n\nReleased in jewel case.\n\nTrack durations are not printed on the release."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Blame-It-on-Me-(George-Ezra-song)", "page_content": "\" Blame It on Me \" is a song by British singer-songwriter George Ezra.

Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie.\n\nThe Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers.\n\nLee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act\u2019s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored \u201cfortune cookie-ish\u201d crackers, among other treats.\n\nOne of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city\u2019s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company.\n\nREAD MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown\n\nJapanese Internment Causes a Shift\n\nWATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII\n\nHow did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part.\n\nJapanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn\u2019t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn\u2019t want to eat raw fish. \u201cSo in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.\u201d And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check.\n\nBut the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them.\n\nMore than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee.\n\nREAD MORE: Building the Transcontinental Railroad: How 20,000 Chinese Americans Made it Happen\n\nFortune Cookie Controversy\n\nTanya Constantine/Getty Images A family opening fortune cookies.\n\nAs fortune cookies became a staple in Chinese restaurants, they also became fodder for ethnic stereotyping.\n\nDespite having historic roots in Japan and growing into a uniquely American business success story, the cookies became an easy shorthand for all things Chinese\u2014along with other reductive and sometimes disparaging pop-culture stereotypes like squinty eyes, heavy accents and being good at math. In 2012 for example, MSG Network aired a fan sign of the New York Knick\u2019s Taiwanese American basketball sensation Jeremy Lin, overlaying his face above a broken fortune cookie. The same year, ice cream makers Ben & Jerry\u2019s briefly offered a \u201cTaste the Lin-sanity\u201d-themed frozen yogurt, complete with broken fortune cookies, before an outcry forced them to publicly apologize and remove the cookies from the recipe.\n\nUsing things like fortune cookies and takeout boxes as shorthands for Chinese culture is misleading, says Lee, given that they\u2019re distinctly American inventions\u2014and the global reach of American culture helps to perpetuate those stereotypes around the world. But despite misconceptions about its true origins and its misuse as a symbol of Chinese heritage, the fortune cookie still carries powerful resonance throughout American culture.\n\n\u201cYou have the number of people who have been engaged through fortune cookies, you have fortune cookie little baby booties, fortune cookie jewelry,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt really speaks to Americans in a very profound way.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: The 8-Year-Old Chinese American Girl Who Helped Desegregate Schools\u2014in 1885"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-may-31-me-55046-story.html", "page_content": "ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSome might say no Chinese meal is complete without the fortune cookie.

Hagiwara never thought to patent the recipe. It wasn\u2019t long before some savvy Chinese-American merchants saw the novelty of the fortune cookies and installed their own factories in Chinatown.\n\nAnd when World War II made enemies of the Japanese--prompting the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans, including the Hagiwaras--Chinese Americans seized the chance to claim a place in American culture.\n\nGregory Louie\u2019s grandfather, a truck driver, was looking for a little side income when he and his son bought a fortune cookie-making machine from a Japanese-American baker in 1948.\n\nLotus Fortune Cookies was a family affair run by aunts, uncles and children.

But you may be surprised to know that the fortune cookie is not Chinese at all. In fact, modern-day fortune cookies first appeared in California in the early 1900s. There is some discrepancy, however, on who actually invented the cookie.\n\nInventor Controversy\n\nMost sources credit either Makoto Hagiwara or David Jung with the invention of the fortune cookie. Of the two, Hagiwara seems to have the stronger claim. A Japanese immigrant who had served as official caretaker of the Japanese Tea Gardens in San Francisco since 1895, Hagiwara began serving the cookies at the Tea Garden sometime between 1907 and 1914. (His grandson, George Hagiwara, believes the correct date is between 1907 and 1909). The cookies were based on Japanese senbei\u2014toasted rice wafers. According to some sources, the cookies contained thank-you notes instead of fortunes and may have been Hagiwara\u2019s way of thanking the public for getting him rehired after he was fired by a racist Mayor.\n\nMeanwhile, Canton, China, native David Jung had immigrated to Los Angeles and in 1916 he founded the Hong Kong Noodle Company. He claimed to have invented the fortune cookie around 1918, handing out baked cookies filled with inspiring passages of scripture to unemployed men. However, there is no surviving documentation showing how he came up with the idea.\n\nCourt Ruling\n\nIn 1983, the San Francisco Court of Historical Review held a mock trial to settle the issue for once and for all. (The Court has no legal authority; other weighty culinary issues they have settled include whether or not chicken soup deserves its reputation as \"Jewish Penicillin.\") During the trial, someone provided the judge with a fortune cookie containing the message \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. not very smart cookie.\" In fairness to Daniel M. Hanlon, the real-life federal judge who presided over the case, his decision rested on weightier pieces of evidence, including a set of grills. Still, it came as no surprise when the Court sided with Hagiwara and ruled that San Francisco is the birthplace of the fortune cookie.\n\nNot surprisingly, Angelenos ignored the ruling: many sources continue to credit Jung with inventing fortune cookies. But for now, Los Angeles (County) will have to be satisfied with being the official birthplace of the Cobb Salad and the Shirley Temple mocktail.\n\nAlternate Theory\n\nOr maybe not. Yet another possibility is that the fortune cookie was invented by a Japanese American living in Los Angeles. That is the claim of the proprietors of Fugetsu-Do, a family-owned and operated bakery in the Little Tokyo district of downtown Los Angeles. According to the Kito family, the idea for the fortune cookie originated with their grandfather, Seiichi Kito, who founded Fugetsu-do in 1903. While the confectionary quickly became famous for its mochi\u2014sweet round rice cakes accompanied by everything from sweet red bean paste to peanut butter\u2014at some point Kito began making fortune cookies and selling them to Chinese restaurants. Visitors to the shop can still see the original fortune cookie molds on display in the front store window \u201ccollecting dust and memories.\u201d\n\nOrigin of the Fortune\n\nAccording to sources, Kito's inspiration was omi-kuji \u2013 fortunes written on slips of paper found in Japanese Buddhist temples. Today, you\u2019ll find omikuji-senbei (\u201cfortune crackers\u201d) sold in bakeries in Japan.\n\nBut where does the inspiration for modern-day fortune cookie messages come from? Despite the fact that fortune cookies have proved about as popular in China as a plate of cooked spinach is to the average five-year-old, their origins may be Chinese after all. Every fall (the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar, to be exact) the Chinese celebrate the mid-Autumn Moon Festival. Children hear the legend of how, in the 14th century, the Chinese threw off their Mongol oppressors by hiding messages in Mooncakes (which the Mongols did not like to eat). On the night of the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, the rebels attacked and overthrew the government, leading to the establishment of the Ming dynasty.\n\nOrigin of the Cookie\n\nToday's Mooncakes don\u2019t contain messages, but some believe that during the American railway boom of the 1850s, Chinese railway workers came up with their own substitute for the mooncakes they were unable to buy: homemade biscuits with good luck messages inside.\n\nLike the mooncake legend, no proof for this story exists. And, thanks to the exhaustive efforts of Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, we now know that at about the same time the Chinese railway workers were laying down tracks, tsujiura senbei (rice cakes containing paper fortunes) were being made at the Hyotanyama Inari shrine outside Kyoto in Japan. According to Jennifer 8. Lee's book, The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, Nakamachi uncovered an illustration in an 1878 book showing a man grilling tsujiura senbei outside the shrine.\n\nSo, where do fortune cookies come from? At this point, the weight of historical evidence seems to agree with a man interviewed for the movie, \u201cThe Killing of a Chinese Cookie\u201d, who states, \u201cThe Japanese invented the fortune cookie, the Chinese advertised it, and the Americans tasted it.\u201d Still, as author Lee says, it\u2019s \u201ca riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a cookie.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.infoplease.com/culture-entertainment/food/history-fortune-cookie", "page_content": "Born in California, of Chinese American\u2014or maybe Japanese American\u2014origin\n\nby Borgna Brunner\n\nLike chop suey, fortune cookies are an American invention. They originated in California, but who the actual inventor was, and which city in California is the true home of the fortune cookie, has continued to be a matter of debate. Unequivocally not Chinese, the fortune cookie may in fact not even be Chinese American.\n\nChinese or Japanese, Angelino or San Franciscan?\n\nOne history of the fortune cookie claims that David Jung, a Chinese immigrant living in Los Angeles and founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company, invented the cookie in 1918. Concerned about the poor he saw wandering near his shop, he created the cookie and passed them out free on the streets. Each cookie contained a strip of paper with an inspirational Bible scripture on it, written for Jung by a Presbyterian minister.\n\nAnother history claims that the fortune cookie was invented in San Francisco by a Japanese immigrant named Makoto Hagiwara. Hagiwara was a gardener who designed the famous Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park. An anti-Japanese mayor fired him from his job around the turn of the century, but later a new mayor reinstated him. Grateful to those who had stood by him during his period of hardship, Hagiwara created a cookie in 1914 that included a thank you note inside. He passed them out at the Japanese Tea Garden, and began serving them there regularly. In 1915, they were displayed at the Panama-Pacific Exhibition, San Francisco's world fair.\n\nJudicial Activism\n\nIn 1983, San Francisco's pseudo-legal Court of Historical Review held a mock trial to determine the origins of the fortune cookie. (In the past, the Court had ruled on such pressing topics as the veracity of Mark Twain's quote, \"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco\" and the origins of the Martini. *) To no one's surprise, the judge (a real-life federal judge from San Francisco) ruled in favor of San Francisco. Included among the evidence was a fortune cookie whose message read: \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie.\" Equally unsurprising, Los Angeles has denounced the ruling.\n\nFrom Confucius to Smiley Faces\n\nFortune cookies became common in Chinese restaurants after World War II. Desserts were not traditionally part of Chinese cuisine, and the cookies thus offered Americans something familiar with an exotic flair.\n\nAlthough there have been a few cases reported of individuals actually liking the texture and flavor of fortune cookies, most consider the fortune to be the essence of the cookie. Early fortunes featured Biblical sayings, or aphorisms from Confucius, Aesop, or Ben Franklin. Later, fortunes included recommended lottery numbers, smiley faces, jokes, and sage, if hackneyed, advice. Politicians have used them in campaigns, and fortunes have been customized for weddings and birthday parties. Today messages are variously cryptic, nonsensical, feel-good, hectoring, bland, or mystifying.\n\nFrom Chopsticks to High Tech\n\nFortune cookies were originally made by hand using chopsticks. In 1964, Edward Louie of San Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Company, automated the process by creating a machine that folds the dough and slips in the fortune. Today, the world's largest fortune cookie manufacturer, Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island CIty, Queens ships out 60 million cookies a month.\n\n*After being served a Martini on the bench, the judge enthusiastically ruled that San Francisco was the home of the famous cocktail.

A fortune cookie is not common in China, but it is a common dessert in the U.S. and other Western nations.\n\nAre Chinese Fortune Cookies From China?\n\nNo, the fortune cookies are believed to be an American invention which was popularized in California during the twentieth century. They are believed to have originated from the cookies which the Japanese-immigrants in the U.S. made during the early twentieth or late nineteenth century. The rumors that these cookies originated from China are false. In 1992, Wonton food tried to introduce their fortune cookies in China but failed since the Chinese considered them to be too-American. These cookies were shipped to Hong Kong in 1989 and sold to people as genuine-American fortune cookies.\n\nThe Origin Of Fortune Cookies\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, there was a cookie which resembled the fortune cookies, that was prepared in Japan. There is unique temple-tradition in Japan of giving random-fortunes which is referred to as omikuji. The Japanese cookies differed from fortune cookies in various ways. Japanese cookies are prepared using a darker dough, are a bit bigger, and their batter has miso and sesame instead of butter and vanilla. Both cookies have fortunes; however, the piece of paper in the Japanese cookie is wedged at the bend of the cookie and not inside. The Japanese cookie is referred to as tsujiura senbei and is still being sold in various parts of Japan. The Japanese cookies don\u2019t have lottery numbers and are usually served with tea.\n\nA modern version of the cookie was first served in San Francisco by Makoto Hagiwara at a Japanese tea-garden during the late early 1900s. Jung David claimed that he was the inventor of the fortune cookie in 1918. The court of Historical-Reviews of San Francisco tried to settle the case in 1983. The court determined that Hagiwara was the one who invented fortune cookies. Kito Seiichi, the founder of Fugetsu-do, also claims to have created this cookie. Seiichi says that he got the idea of a fortune cookie from the Omikuji from Japan. Kito claims to have sold them to the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nManufacturers Of Fortune Cookies\n\nFortune cookies were prepared by hand until the early twentieth century when Shunk Yee invented the cookies machine. Currently, there are over 3billion fortune cookies being produced annually on the planet with a considerable percentage of them being consumed in the United States. Wonton Food Inc is the biggest manufacturer of these cookies in the world. Wonton Food Inc produces more than 4.5million cookies every day. Other large producers of fortune cookies include Peking Noodle from Los Angeles and Baily International (Midwest).

But what inspired these cookies and who was responsible for creating these fortune telling snacks?\n\nOne theory is that the original fortune cookie was created by Makoto Hagiwara, who was the caretaker of the Japanese Tea Gardens in San Francisco. He served the cookies there around 1907, and they were based on a Japanese grilled rice wafer known as senbei. Rather than fortunes, these cookies were said to have thank you notes inside.\n\nAnother popular theory is that it was David Jung who formed these famous fortune tellers. Jung, from Canton, had immigrated to Los Angeles at the start of the 20thcentury and opened his restaurant, the Hong Kong Noodle Company, in 1916. He maintained that he was responsible for creating the cookie, and placed the motivational fortunes inside to give to unemployed men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA second Los Angeles resident is also claimed to have invented the cookie. Japanese-American bakery owner Seiichi Kito, who founded his family-run business Fugetsu-do in 1903, also lays claim to being the creator of these cookies. His family maintain that he sold his fortune cookies to Chinese restaurants, providing a letter dated 1927, that mentions a Japanese-American in Los Angeles as the inventor of fortune cookies, as evidence. Sources believe that Kito was inspired by omi-kuji, a small piece of paper with fortunes written on them that were found in Buddhist temples in Japan. Nowadays, bakeries in Japan sell \u2018fortune crackers\u2019 under the name of omikuji-senbai.\n\nAnother source of inspiration for modern fortune cookies is thought to be from the Chinese Mooncakes. As with many food origins in China, this comes from a legend. As the story goes, Chinese people in the 14th century were oppressed by the Mongols. They hid messages in Mooncakes, which the Mongols did not enjoy eating, allowing them to organise and overthrow the government on the night of the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival.\n\nFortune cookies have also been traced to tales of Chinese railway workers working on the American railways in the 1850\u2019s. Unable to buy mooncakes, they created their own biscuits filled with messages of luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so many conflicting stories and dates, the exact origins of fortune cookies are still unknown, however, a quote from the film \u2018The Killing of a Chinese Cookie\u2019 seems to summarise it well: \u201cThe Japanese invented the fortune cookie, the Chinese advertised it, and the Americans tasted it\u201d.\n\nIf you are wanting to put together your own oriental-inspired feast, (whether you decide to end the meal with fortune cookies or not!), check out the wide range of Chinese and Japanese foods available at our Asian supermarket online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://fortuneandframe.com/blogs/news/meaning-behind-fortune-cookies", "page_content": "If you\u2019re anything like me, fortune cookies determine your fate.

These crackers had messages in the center of them, like fortune cookies.\n\nJapanese immigrants began to make Senbei in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the 1900s. At the same time, Chinese restaurants did not have many desserts to offer. They then began to make the senbei crackers for customers. Around the time of World War II, fortune cookies became popular among soldiers. Chinese-Americans were able to mass-produce fortune cookies when Japanese-Americans got sent to internment camps.\n\nWhat Do Fortune Cookies Symbolize? Fortune Cookies symbolize luck, wisdom, fate, and all that is unknown. This all comes from the fortune that is inside. The message in your cookie is for you. Out of every single fortune cookie that you could\u2019ve picked, you picked that one. Whether you're looking for some advice or a little luck, you can interpret the message any way you want.\n\nWhat Does An Empty Fortune Cookie Mean? An empty fortune cookie may be disappointing, but what it means isn\u2019t. There are two popular beliefs about what an empty fortune cookie means but don't worry, both are good. The first is that you will soon have something good happen to you. The reasoning behind this is that you are now owed a fortune and it will be repaid to you with a good event. The second is that your fortune is a blank slate. You are in control of your own future and are able to take the reins and make what you want to happen, happen. You have everything you need to move forward and bring in good energy. Although it may be a little less fun, no fortune is nothing to worry about. It doesn\u2019t mean that you have no future or luck. Instead, it is something to embrace and get ready to see the change you need.\n\nPictured Signature Fortune Locket in Aquamarine, Pink, and Blush\n\nWhat Do the Lucky Numbers on Fortune Cookies Mean? The lucky numbers on fortune cookies can have many meanings. It all depends on how you decide to use and interpret the numbers. Some people will use these numbers to play the lottery, in hope that they will win. Others will make sure to look out for those numbers in everyday life. They may signify a date or time that something lucky will happen. You can also make lucky numbers your own. If one of the numbers on your fortune is 8, you can search out things with the number 8. The amusement park ride cars you get on, license plates, phone numbers, and house numbers. This can become a superstition of ours if you feel the number speaks to you. Fortune Cookie Examples There are so many different fortune cookie fortunes that you may receive. They may be quotes or words of wisdom. Some of my favorites are: \u201cLove all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\u201d - William Shakespeare \u201cYou are not what you\u2019ve done.

Drew Barrymore looks set to become the latest member of the Hollywood glitterati to travel down the yellow brick road after signing on to direct Surrender Dorothy, pitched as a loose sequel to the 1939 musical.\n\nBarrymore, who recently made her debut as a feature film-maker with the well-received rollerderby movie Whip It, was originally tipped to star in the project when it was first proposed back in 2002. She would have played the great-great-granddaughter of Dorothy, a young woman who has to learn how to use the power of those famed ruby red slippers to keep the Wicked Witch of the West from taking control of the kingdoms of Earth and Oz.\n\nThere's no word on whether Barrymore will still be taking the lead role, though at 35 she might be considered a little old for the part. The project has been resurrected due to the current proliferation of movies based on much-loved children's stories, following the enormous box-office success of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.\n\nAt least five films based on the Wizard of Oz have been reported in recent weeks. Disney, which made Alice in Wonderland, is developing Oz the Great and Powerful, an origins tale revealing how L Frank Baum's wonderful wizard ended up at the Emerald City (and possibly featuring Sam Mendes directing Robert Downey Jr as the wizard). There are also two CGI versions, as well as another based on a comic-book series, and finally the bizarre-looking The Witches of Oz, featuring Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin, Christopher Lloyd (as the wizard) and Alien's Lance Henriksen.\n\nThough all 14 of Baum's Oz books are now out of copyright, and therefore freely available for anyone to plunder, it seems unlikely that all of the above will make it into cinemas: often in these cases, one or more of the films will fall at the wayside at the development stage. If not, there are going to be more wizards in multiplexes over the next few years than at a Harry Potter convention.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz story has been adapted for the big screen on many occasions, with the most famous version being the 1939 musical starring Judy Garland. Disney itself brought Return to Oz, based on two of Baum's sequels, to cinemas in 1985."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430650/reviews", "page_content": "6 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nMy mother asked me if I wanted to watch a movie with her while I was visiting. I normally don't watch TV movies. I don't have the patience for them or even most cinematic movies these days, but every now and again, I'll be surprised by what the networks come up with. So, not wanting to disappoint my mother, I acquiesced. Spotting Vilmos Zsigmond's name as the cinematographer during the opening credits made me feel a little more hopeful.\n\n\n\nDiane Keaton plays Natalie a mother grieving the loss of her daughter Sara. Sara was spending the Summer with old friends of hers at a New England beach house. Their vacation had just started when she dies in a car accident on the way back from getting ice cream. In order to deal with her death, Natalie ends up taking her daughter's place at the beach house. Initially, it is an awkward situation for everyone on two different levels. On top of dealing with Sara's death, Natalie never really cared for Sara's friends. Dealing with their own grief, the friends still recognize the delicate nature of the situation, knowing Sara was all she had, and humor her desire to be in the environment where her daughter spent the remaining days of her life.\n\n\n\nThe acting is good. Keaton is, of course the standout. She runs the gamut of emotions without turning herself into a clique, even when the material starts to border on the ridiculous. The scene where she hallucinates the clouds spelling out \"Surrender Dorothy\" (the \"Land of Oz\" reference her and Sara greeted each other with) is silly, but Keaton conveys the delirium Natalie feels at thinking she could actually bring her daughter back to life.\n\n\n\nAt first, I wished that we had gotten to know Sara just a bit more than we did. But, then, I realized that it made sense for us to only get a glimpse of her, because, as with the loss of anyone close to us, we all experience the desire to have just spent a little bit more time with them and/or gotten to know them just a little bit more. One of the things that I liked about this movie is that a lot of the way it took shape was very deliberate and effective. Another example would be a scene early on, before her death, when they are sitting outside, talking, drinking and having a good time. The camera kept going around in circles. I rolled my eyes thinking it was pretentious and then I even started feeling a little nauseous. Afterwards, I realized that its hyperkineticness served the story. They were friends, sitting around catching up with each other at a feverish pace, while inebriated. The memory of that night as their final one together with Sara probably took on a heightened reality after she died.\n\n\n\nBecause it is a TV movie, I don't judge it too harshly. It is at mercy of much higher censorship standards than a theatrically or video released film. And, I was surprised by some of the content in this CBS-movie-of-the-week. We saw people taking hallucinogenic mushrooms. We saw two young men in a homosexual relationship. We saw a woman in her late 50's in a lead role! None of this was without limits, of course. We saw the young heterosexual couple in bed, as well as them kissing. We saw no such interaction in the homosexual couple. That isn't to say that it should have occurred, only that to me it suggested a double standard. It would have been fine if I didn't see anyone romantically in bed together. But, this is a major network. I give it kudos for the aforementioned risky content it included (even if it was necessary just to tell the story). So, if it has to pay the price by not so subtly (to me, anyway) asserting a conservative bias, so be it. Just don't shoot be for observing it.\n\n\n\nFor a while, I was hoping the writers were shrewdly implying Natalie was this close-minded Republican, who was, ultimately, teachable. She reminded me so much of Bree Van Kamp from American TV's \"Desperate Housewives.\" She is a very conservative woman who had a very unusual response to grieving the loss of her husband. We never really understood why Natalie wasn't friends with Adam, her daughter's best friend. We know that she didn't invite any of Sara's friends to the funeral, but there was specific discussion of her disdain towards Adam. We also know, towards the end of the film that she blamed him from keeping her daughter from moving on with a straight man. However, through most of the movie, I was thinking she was homophobic, but the writers didn't just come right out with it. But, then, she didn't judge Adam's boyfriend on the merit's of his gay relationship with Adam, especially considering his philandering ways. I was also trying to insinuate an antiabortion stance from the reaction she had when she found out about Sara's pregnancy. But, it could pain any mother in her position, whether pro-Choice or antiabortion, who found that her recently deceased daughter had given up an opportunity to give birth and, therefore, had given up a chance to leave a part of her behind. Oh, well, there goes that theory.\n\n\n\nMy favorite line involved Natalie reading Adam's latest play. She alluded to his previous work being a really good comedy (which begged the question of how she could go on not liking him, yet interested in what he had to write) and sensed that she was now dealing with a really uninteresting drama. She then insisted that he cannot go all Woody Allen on her \"like when he made'Interiors.'\" Any movie that can appropriately and humorously use a Woody Allen reference (delivered by one of his former muses no less) is alright in my book. Too bad my mother was asleep at that point to enjoy it!"}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Surrender+Dorothy/+wiki", "page_content": "There are more than one Surrender Dorothy.\n\nThe Milwaukee Version began as a jamming rock band at Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI back in 1985. Dan Carney, Tom Connell, Linda Heegeman, Tim Heuer, Tom Huguelet, Steve Jaracz and Kurt Urban formed the heart of the revolving door that was to become Surrender Dorothy for the next few years. In true rock band style, many members came and went, and some came back again\u2026\n\nIn 1987, the revolving door slowed down and a lasting formation took shape. The addition of Tommy Boesch on country-tinged guitar and J. Finnegan on barefoot stompin' bass was the beginning of a new era that has proven to be a life long connection for Surrender Dorothy's current band members. Kurt Urban made his move from front man with the killer vocals Tom Connell and Dave Wolff were tag team drummers over the next couple of years. Linda Heegeman continued in her role as female vocalist and percussionist and took over band management. It was at this time that they transitioned from playing Marquette bars and functions to playing bars, clubs and festivals throughout the Milwaukee, Madison and Chicago Areas.\n\nSurrender Dorothy rocks more than ever now with the upcoming release of two new studio albums, the re-release of a 1990 album and a national cross-generation network of fans ready to make the trip for our recent select appearances. Over the past 7 years, members of the band have traveled from Britain and across the country to play several \"Surrender Dorothy Final Farewell\" tours, \"Surrender Dorothy Reunion\" tours, and to volunteer a show for the Milwaukee based Enderis Park Neighborhood Association\u2019s \u201cConcerts on The Green\u201d. Summer 2007 highlights included another trip into the studio followed by a spot at the Milwaukee Summer Soulstice Festival, and a return to their MU roots with a Marquette University Class of 1987 Reunion Gig and a Surrender Dorothy Reunion show at Conway's including members past and present. September 2008 marked the long awaited return of Jigglesfest. Fans from as far as England, Colorado, California, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin traveled to attend with their friends and families.\n\nThe band is a true Milwaukee tradition for the large number of Milwaukeans and X-Milwaukeans alike. Fans from across the country (and across the Atlantic!) look for reasons to make the pilgrimage back to Milwaukee - a Surrender Dorothy show tops the list.\n\nThe other version is made up of Rehgina (vocals) Peter Murray (bass) Norman Laco (guitar) Dave Stevenson (drums)\n\nSurrender Dorothy formed in 1987 when drummer Dave Stevenson asked Rehgina to sing lead for the band he was in at the time. Like most bands, though, it took a few years before they found the lineup that worked, involving Rehgina, Stevenson, bassist Peter Murray, and guitarist Norman Laco.\n\nIn 1990 they got one of their demo recordings on CFNY's Modern Rock album, and were a featured part of a Canadian music showcase in Texas in March 1991.\n\nIn 1992, the band spent six months planning, gathering funds, and applying for (and receiving) financial assistance from FACTOR and SOCAN to do a short tour of Europe in the fall of that year. Arriving a week before their first gig, all the things that could go wrong did, but they got themselves sorted out during that week and proceeded to impress the European media and audiences alike.\n\nWhen they got home they made the record label rounds with the four-song demo they'd recorded before they left for Europe. One song, \"\u2026here's my heart\u2026\", was eventually released on a CD-single for radio, and appeared on the Bullseye Records Compilation \"Unsigned, Sealed And Delivered Volume 5\", which received national distribution. Due to the success of the 1992 European tour, the band returned in the fall of 1993, once again to critical and public acclaim.\n\nSubsequent tours in 1994 and 1996 culminated in a licensing deal with universal music's German office in 1996. Their debut CD, 'Serum\", was co-produced with Toronto's Matt Dematteo (Big Wreck, Ashley MacIsaac, Big Sugar) at Presence Sound.\n\n(from: http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/S/Surrender_Dorothy.html)"}, {"url": "https://thebedlamfiles.com/film/surrender-dorothy/", "page_content": "A twisted 1998 no-budgeter about a disturbed young man who attempts to turn his hetero-male roommate into Dorothy, the perfect woman.

So it brings me nothing but joy to read Pajiba's report that Barrymore is considering for her next directing vehicle Surrender Dorothy, a Wizard of Oz sequel that stalled in development back in 2002, when Barrymore was merely attached to star.\n\nPajiba doesn't know if Barrymore would still star, but she's also on board as a producer through her Flower Films. The script by Zach Helm (who went on to do Stranger Than Fiction) follows Dorothy's great-great-granddaughter, who must use the ruby red slipper to keep the Wicked Witch of the West from taking power (no word on exactly how the witch recovers from her water bath). Obviously the character could be any age, but I'm guessing Barrymore is now a little old to play the part and might hand the part over to another up-and-comer-- Pajiba suggests Barrymore's Whip It star Ellen Page, and I couldn't like that suggestion more.\n\nThere are a lot of other Oz adaptations in the works right now, from Disney's prequel starring Robert Downey Jr. to Todd McFarlane's dark take that he constantly talks about but will probably never happen. It's not clear if Barrymore is moving forward on Surrender Dorothy quickly enough to beat out any of the other projects, but if the success of Wicked proves anything, we have an endless appetite for new takes on the classic story in the Emerald City."}, {"url": "https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/526376/surrender-dorothy/", "page_content": "Miscellaneous Notes\n\nWinner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1998 Slamdance Film Festival.
