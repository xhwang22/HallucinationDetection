Police say the shooter was an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority, which operates the light rail facility in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe shooting began around 6.30am local time in a facility that stores trains and serves as a transit control center, and the victims include employees of the facility.\n\n\u201cThese folks were heroes during Covid-19. The buses never stopped running, VTA didn\u2019t stop running,\u201d said Cindy Chavez, a Santa Clara county supervisor. \u201cThey just kept at work, and now we\u2019re really calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy.\u201d\n\nVTA workers cross West Hedding Street near the scene of a mass shooting in San Jose.

We owe them and their families so much \u2026 For now, we need to focus on everything we can do to support these families and their loved ones.\u201d\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom, who cancelled another event to rush to the scene, described gun violence in the US as an epidemic.\n\n\u201cThis happens again and again \u2013 rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt begs the question what the hell is going on in America?\u201d\n\nNewsom spoke emotionally in front of a county office where flags flew at half-staff. He said victims\u2019 relatives were \u201cwaiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother their son, their dad, their mom is still alive\u201d.\n\nTwo people hug on Younger Avenue outside the scene of a shooting in San Jose.

It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s raw.\u201d\n\nRaul Peralez, a local city council member, said he was waiting to hear from a close friend who worked at the transit center.\n\n\u201cThis hits close to home for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a close friend \u2013 I\u2019m still waiting for his status. He\u2019s been a friend since middle school. His wife is on her way down here now.\n\n\u201cNot even knowing that information is devastating and I can understand how so many families are feeling right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe violence began early on Wednesday morning. Raj Singh, a union leader with the VTA operators union, told the Mercury News that the shooting occurred during the busiest time of day at the light rail facility, when employees are reporting to work and getting ready to start transit service.\n\nLaurie Smith, the sheriff of Santa Clara county, said sheriff\u2019s deputies entered the building while the shots were still being fired, but did not fire upon the suspect.\n\nPolice and investigators at the scene of a shooting at the San Jose Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard.

Authorities said the shooter took his own life.\n\nA spokesperson for the Santa Clara sheriff\u2019s office said bomb-sniffing dogs detected explosives at the shooting scene. The authorities are bringing in a bomb robot to scan the scene. \u201cThey are searching every crevice of the building,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department confirmed in a press conference that it was investigating whether the shooting was related to one or more fires that broke out in San Jose around the same time.\n\nThe San Jose fire department responded to a large house fire at 6.36am, and another fire in a commercial area at 6.26am. Both were reported just moments before the shooting at the rail yard, which is a few minutes\u2019 drive away.\n\nAuthorities approach a home being investigated in connection to the shooting.

A gunman killed three people before killing himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019.\n\nAccording to the San Jose Mercury News, it was the deadliest mass shooting in the Bay Area since 1993, when eight people and a gunman were killed at the 101 California Street skyscraper in San Francisco.\n\nA fuller picture of the attacker began to emerge by Wednesday evening. Sam Cassidy\u2019s ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told the Associated Press that Cassidy had a bad temper and would tell her that he wanted to kill people at work, \u201cbut I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now.\u201d\n\nNelms, shaken by the news, said her ex-husband would come home wound up and angry about things that happened at work. As he talked about it, \u201che would get more mad\u201d, she said. \u201cHe could dwell on things.\u201d\n\nWhen Cassidy lost his temper, Nelms said there were times she was scared. He was someone who could physically hurt others, she said.\n\nNelms said they were married for 10 years. Cassidy filed for divorce in 2005 and had not been in contact for 13 years. She said he had been treated for depression.\n\nTransit authority mechanic Rochelle Hawkins said she dropped her phone when she heard shots.\n\n\u201cI was running so fast, I just ran for my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI would hope everyone would just pray for the VTA family. Just pray for us.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3257241/2022/04/18/earthquakes-matias-almeyda-john-fisher/", "page_content": "A competent organization would have made a decision on Matias Almeyda this winter.\n\nA competent organization would have understood the roster-building ramifications of Almeyda\u2019s unusual man-marking system, known the meaning behind the never-ending rumors linking him to jobs in Latin America and realized that letting the Argentine head coach enter the final year of his contract without any clarity on his future was a recipe for disaster. A competent organization would have either extended him this offseason and let him rebuild the team in his image or fired him and begun anew with someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe San Jose Earthquakes have not been a competent organization.\n\nInstead of making a move on Almeyda this winter, the Earthquakes, led by managing owner John Fisher, did nothing. Regardless of whether that choice was borne of indecision, cheapness, a belief that this could actually work or some other combination of factors, it\u2019s created an unholy mess in San Jose, which is last in MLS with three points from seven matches and, on Monday afternoon, finally fired Almeyda. He leaves San Jose with a regular season record of 31 wins, 42 losses and 25 draws, a 1.2 points per game average, a -33 goal differential and, as pointed out by Quakes Epicenter, an expected goal differential that dropped in every year of his tenure, falling from +0.2 per 90 in his first season in 2019 to a league-worst -0.96 per 90 in 2022.\n\nThe drama runs much deeper than poor statistics. Almeyda, who, according to sources, was one of the highest-paid coaches in MLS, ran roughshod over the club in recent weeks, embarrassing himself and the organization with a series of lamentable decisions that seem to indicate a desire to be fired. He repeatedly skipped league-mandated news conferences. His on-field tactics were a horror show. His lineup choices verged on ridiculous. He\u2019s even gotten into confrontations with fans at at least two different home matches. Last week, he reportedly tried to resign while insisting that the club pay him and his assistants out for the remainder of 2022. His behavior has been disrespectful to supporters and no doubt harmful to his own players, who have been individually miscast and collectively set up to fail.\n\nHis tantrum, which was perhaps fueled in part by his dissatisfaction with Fisher\u2019s unwillingness to spend on the first team, was extreme. It was clear that he wanted out for quite some time, but it\u2019d still be a bit unfair to say the club should have foreseen him acting this childishly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe on-field issues were more predictable. San Jose fired former GM Jesse Fioranelli last June. He had largely ceded his last couple of years of roster decisions to Almeyda, mostly ignoring the domestic market and spending the limited capital that Fisher gave him on players who had previously played for the head coach during his time in Argentina and Mexico. Most of them have been below average in MLS.\n\nThe club took a new tack under Chris Leitch, who ran the sporting department on an interim basis after Fioranelli was fired before being hired in a full-time capacity in November. This winter, the new GM jettisoned Almeyda guys Luciano Abecasis, Oswaldo Alanis, Carlos Fierro, Andy Rios and Daniel Vega, who combined to make $3.2 million in 2021, roughly 30 percent of the club\u2019s overall salary outlay. He replaced them largely with players from within the league, trading for Jeremy Ebobisse from Portland last summer and landing Jamiro Monteiro from Philadelphia this winter.\n\nThe new approach makes sense. Fisher is clearly not going to splash the same kind of cash as upper middle-class clubs like Portland or Seattle, never mind spending like MLS heavyweights Toronto, Atlanta, LA Galaxy and LAFC. That doesn\u2019t mean the Quakes can\u2019t succeed, it just means they have to be efficient. Using allocation money as an intra-MLS transfer fund (something low-budget Colorado has done to great effect over the last few seasons) was a good place to start. Getting more out of the academy, a part of the organization Leitch has worked in and an area he\u2019s placing real emphasis on, will also be important moving forward.\n\nBut, regardless of its merit, the changed strategy didn\u2019t seem to mesh with Almeyda\u2019s desires. Coupled with his poor record, that should have been enough for Fisher and the club board to fire him this winter. Instead, perhaps motivated by a desire to not pay two head coaches at the same time, they let him enter a lame-duck year. Leitch was given reign over the roster, but he was saddled with a head coach who looked like he didn\u2019t want to be in the Bay Area and didn\u2019t appear to be on-board with the club\u2019s overall plan. That\u2019s no way to empower a first-time chief soccer officer, though Leitch said on Monday that things remained civil between the Quakes and Almeyda.\n\nIn preseason, semi-reasonable high-end expectations had San Jose competing for a playoff spot then moving on from Almeyda and starting anew at zero added cost to Fisher this winter. Projected worst-case scenarios probably looked something like the crisis that\u2019s now unfolding. Either way, the Quakes were effectively throwing away this season before it even started. Leitch began turning over the roster, but this was never a real rebuild. No matter how many new players were signed, they would be playing for a coach with a hyper-specific system who seemed like he had no more than one season left at the helm. The organization was always going to struggle with a manager who didn\u2019t seem to have a real mandate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUs parting ways happened amicably, honestly, and with the utmost professionalism from both sides,\u201d Leitch said. \u201cThe hope was in the offseason that we would enter into the 2022 season with some fresh faces on the roster and our results would be different than what they are, with the hope that there\u2019d be possibilities to extend or have a different perspective with Matias.\u201d\n\nInterim head coach Alex Covelo, elevated from his position as head coach of Quakes II in MLS Next Pro, should be able to improve results with more conventional tactics and lineup choices, changes that Leitch said on Monday should be expected. But, thanks to the indecision around Almeyda this winter, it seems like 2022 will end up being a lost year for the entire club regardless.\n\nNot that that would be new for San Jose, of course. Since they were reborn in 2008, the Quakes have been among the least successful teams in MLS. Despite playing in a market that the club\u2019s own COO views as one of the best in the country from both a corporate and talent perspective, they don\u2019t draw fans, they don\u2019t get good results and they don\u2019t spend on their first team. They\u2019ve made the playoffs four times in 14 seasons since they came back into existence after the first iteration of the club moved to Houston in 2006. They basically wasted the career of all-time MLS record goal scorer Chris Wondolowski. They\u2019ve never even seemed to have much of a real plan, though Leitch is at least working to change that. It\u2019s all so bleak that Francisco Calvo, who signed with the Quakes this winter after five seasons split between Minnesota and Chicago, took out his own club in an interview last week with TUDN\u2019s Michele Giannone.\n\n\u201cFirst, let me say I\u2019m grateful to be in this organization, but this organization is missing a lot of things,\u201d Calvo said. \u201cAnd the people in charge need to realize that. \u2026 San Jose doesn\u2019t have stars. San Jose is not the one that spends the most. Do you think that MLS looks at San Jose and thinks that we can win the championship without spending? I don\u2019t think so. But that\u2019s on San Jose and they need to change it. If they want to win, they have to spend and make things better all around.\u201d\n\nFisher, the heir to the Gap Inc. fortune, the managing owner of the Oakland A\u2019s and a part-owner of the Scottish Premiership\u2019s Celtic FC, is the common denominator through all of San Jose\u2019s struggles. He almost never speaks publicly. His last interview about any of his teams, one of the few he\u2019s ever given, appears to have come in June 2020, when he was doing damage control and reversing course after the A\u2019s became the only MLB team that publicly refused to pay minor leaguers a $400 per week stipend after their season was canceled.\n\nHis lack of public comments mean we don\u2019t know his intentions in regards to the Earthquakes. We can only judge his ownership based on how the organization has actually performed. That record, as outlined above, has been putrid.\n\nThe club has struggled on the field, in the stands and in the broader Bay Area market. The region has plenty of youth talent, but, apart from decent contributions from goalkeeper J.T. Marcinkowski and the promise of Cade Cowell, the Quakes haven\u2019t seen huge returns from their academy. They\u2019re located in Silicon Valley, but they haven\u2019t really leaned into data and analytics in their sporting department until recently. There\u2019s still plenty of room for them to grow in that department. The training facility is subpar, though Fisher and the club are now finally in the process of constructing a new one. PayPal Park, the soccer-specific stadium that they built in 2015, doesn\u2019t have nearly enough luxury areas to drive revenue in the same way as the new stadiums for other clubs around MLS, according to multiple sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while Fisher, whose net worth is listed by Forbes at $2.4 billion, is well within his rights to not want to lose millions upon millions in annual operating costs on top of the investments he\u2019s already made into the Earthquakes, the consistent lack of direction in the front office and the Almeyda mess are both embarrassing and a direct indictment on his ownership of the club. The team\u2019s overall irrelevance is a drag on MLS, as well. The Bay Area should be a vibrant market for the league. Instead, MLS is a complete afterthought in the area. A lot of that is on Fisher.\n\nHe might treat the A\u2019s, who underwent yet another roster teardown this offseason, with the same apparent indifference that he treats the Quakes, but owning an MLS club is different than owning an MLB team. Even with its numerous problems, baseball is established in the North American sports landscape in a way that MLS can only dream of.\n\nMLS needs to grow, and it needs committed owners in order to do so. The ideal MLS owner should also be an evangelist for soccer, someone who feels a responsibility to grow the game in the U.S. and Canada. Fisher doesn\u2019t even seem to care about his own team, let alone the sport at-large. He appears more interested in limiting his losses and growing the price of his club off of the work and investment of other MLS owners (the Quakes were valued at $510 million by Sportico last year; Fisher was part of an ownership group that paid $20 million to bring them back in 2007) than in making a positive impact.\n\nSome sources have speculated that Fisher, who last summer hired a firm to explore the sale of minority stakes in the Quakes, will look to sell the club in the next few years. San Jose would no doubt benefit from more competent ownership, but those sources were merely speculating. Fisher has never commented on whether or not he would consider selling the Quakes and has repeatedly stated through spokespeople that he has no interest in selling the A\u2019s. Absent more information, we can only assume he\u2019s in it for the long haul.\n\nThat would be bad news for soccer in North America. The Quakes haven\u2019t been a competent organization, but Fisher has been worse than that. Unless he dramatically changes how he manages his team, he\u2019ll likely continue to be an anchor on his own club, the league and the entire sport in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n(Photo: Bob Kupbens / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/steve-cooper-liverpool-former-academy-coach-masterminded-nottingham-forest-play-off-charge-1527129", "page_content": "Pep Guardiola recognises the moment that gave England the impetus they needed to push on with their demand to step out of international football\u2019s shadows and compete again as a contender. In October 2017, in India, England won a World Cup at any age group for the first time since 1966 when their Under-17 team beat Spain 5-2 in the final.\n\n\u201cBig congratulations to the manager,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt is the step England needed. It happened in Spain. Spain was always in the last-16, quarter-finals. Then they arrived one moment in the semi-finals and since then they have won every time. That\u2019s why it is so important. To finally win.\u201d\n\nThe stars of that England team were its young attackers, a group of teenagers who finally had overwhelming evidence to push for regular league minutes. From the 2015 Under-17 World Cup squad, only one has made a senior international appearance. Five years on from 2017, five of that squad already have: Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Conor Gallagher, Emile Smith-Rowe and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Marc Guehi could become the sixth after receiving his first call-up last week.\n\nIt was also a masterclass of the coaching system, the strategy through which the Football Association really did hope to shift the preconceptions of English football. The Under-17s took separate in-possession and out-of-possession coaches, a goalkeeper coach, two fitness coaches, two analysts, two physios, a doctor, a chef, an education officer and a psychologist.\n\nSteve Cooper, the head coach of that World Cup-winning team, has since enjoyed a rapid progression of his own. Leaving his role in 2019 to join Swansea, he led them to two successive Championship playoff campaigns before departing at the end of his second season (Swansea are now 16th). When Chris Hughton was sacked in September, Nottingham Forest had taken one point from seven league games. Since then, only leaders Fulham have taken more Championship points. Cooper is masterminding another remarkable rise.\n\nOn Sunday, Forest play in the last eight of any competition for the first time since Bayern Munich in the Uefa Cup in 1996. This club has undergone several mini-eras since, few of them pleasant: play-off heartache, League One relegation, the chaos of Fawaz Al-Hasawi\u2019s ownership, the managerial merry-go-round, Greeks bearing gifts. Supporters have seen enough false dawns to fill a calendar, but few managers have got under their skin quite like Cooper.\n\nSunday\u2019s tie offers a fine chance to reflect on Cooper\u2019s coaching career, now almost 25 years in length despite him still being the ninth youngest manager in the top two tiers of English football. A steady but unspectacular player \u2013 by his own admission \u2013 he began coaching young age groups at Wrexham at the age of 19. Budgets were tight; Cooper became a minibus driver, a manager, a mentor and a fixture secretary all at once. He immediately fell in love with coaching. This was his vocation.\n\nIn 2008, having already become one of the youngest coaches in Europe to earn their UEFA Pro Licence, Cooper was headhunted by Forest\u2019s Sunday opponents Liverpool. Initially overseeing the development of academy players aged between 12 and 16, in the space of five years, he was promoted to academy manager and then Under-18s coach, working with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Raheem Sterling and Conor Coady, amongst others. More importantly, he worked under Jose Segura, a Spanish coach who would go on to be Barcelona\u2019s head of academy and then general manager.\n\nIt was through Segura that Cooper defined his preferred playing style: possession-based, aggressive pressing when the ball is lost and a coach who demands that his players are courageous with their forward passing. At Swansea, that occasionally became quite defensive without enough flair players to shift through the gears. At Forest, Cooper appears to have got the balance right.\n\nCooper won the World Cup with England\u2019s U17s in 2017 (Photo: Getty)\n\nThat long history in academy football and with England\u2019s age-group teams provides Cooper with a distinct advantage. The breakout stars of the Forest team that will take on Liverpool are Middlesbrough loanee Djed Spence and academy graduate Brennan Johnson, aged 21 and 20 respectively. Keinan Davis, 24 but with only 22 career league starts before this season, has been a revelation since Lewis Grabban got injured. James Garner, on loan from Manchester United, has kicked on again under Cooper. Ryan Yates has become an excellent all-action midfielder who reinforces the connection with the local community.\n\n\u201cSteve is prepared to place trust in young players,\u201d says Ian Foster. Foster was one of Cooper\u2019s coaches with the Under-17s who is now the England Under-19s head coach. \u201cWe have seen that throughout his career, from his player development at Liverpool, Wrexham and England and then how he has operated at Swansea and now at Forest. He creates pathways for players. And his history of developing talent means that more senior players will always be on board with it. Some of them become part of his leadership, so everyone is working on the same page.\u201d\n\nThat community has a power that Cooper has understood wherever he has coached. \u201cYou just have to make time for people, particularly if they show a bit of interest in you,\u201d he said the week after his appointment at the City Ground. \u201cWe want to be decent people, we want to represent the traditions and the values of the club to the level that they deserve.\u201d After each victory, Cooper raises his fist three times to each stand and hears them cheer thrice in return. It has become an emblem of their Championship progress.\n\nOne of the integral elements of Cooper\u2019s style is collaboration, a deliberate destruction of ego and the traditional manager-player relationship. At the Under-17 World Cup, he would work with the players on game approach and opposition analysis, asking them to problem solve between each other. At Forest, Grabban has worked with Davis, Steve Cook with the younger centre-backs. What\u2019s the point in telling them what to do when they are more likely to do it if it\u2019s their own solution?\n\n\u201cThe great shift that has taken place is a realisation that these young players can handle it,\u201d says Foster. \u201cThey have the technique, the tactical awareness, the physical prowess. All they needed was regular minutes, a chance to show what they can do. Steve is prepared to provide that opportunity, but he\u2019s also prepared to challenge them and support them to find solutions. That\u2019s how we develop rounded players.\u201d\n\nThere are no guarantees at Nottingham Forest; this club has repeatedly promised and not delivered, delivered but fallen short. They are emphatic second favourites against Liverpool and still outsiders for promotion after their dismal start to the season.\n\nBut, for now, none of that really matters. More important than playing in the Premier League is having a club that, finally, seems on a firm footing. If that\u2019s not only down to one man, supporters know that one man has made a bigger difference than most. On Sunday Steve Cooper revisits his own history. He\u2019s more interested in the relentless pursuit of his, and Nottingham Forest\u2019s, future."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3194871/2022/03/19/steve-cooper-the-liverpool-years-only-now-do-i-fully-appreciate-what-a-brilliant-coach-he-was/", "page_content": "Steve Cooper is the kind of character who prefers to look forward rather than back. He often needs a little encouragement to even talk about the past.\n\nAnd when he does, he nearly always has a knack of finding a way to bring the conversation back around to the future.\n\nGiven that he is still only 42 \u2014 young for a football manager \u2014 it is hard to conceive the thought that a key step on his journey to becoming Nottingham Forest manager began more than 13 years ago, when he was appointed as an academy coach at Premier League Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanded the role of coaching the under-12 side in 2008, within three years he was head coach of the academy. Some might have seen his rise coming on the horizon given that at the age of 27 \u2014 while coaching in the academy at Wrexham \u2014 he had become one of the youngest people to complete a UEFA Pro Licence.\n\nCooper\u2019s journey into management in Championship football, with Swansea, saw him climb the ladder steadily, with his appointment in 2019 following positive spells coaching the England Under-16 and Under-17 sides, winning the World Cup with the older age group.\n\nBut it was during those five years at Liverpool that Cooper\u2019s reputation really blossomed as he played a part in the development of players like Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Woodburn.\n\nThis weekend, Cooper\u2019s Forest will face his former club in a FA Cup quarter-final at the City Ground that feels decidedly like a blast from the past, largely because of the shared history of the two clubs.\n\nAnd Cooper acknowledges the role his time on Merseyside played in his personal development as he looks to further enhance his reputation by attempting to mastermind a win that would propel Forest into their first FA Cup semi-final since 1991 \u2014 in the year they lost in the final to Tottenham, when he was just 11.\n\n\u201cI think all of your experiences shape you, whether they are good, bad or indifferent. I had a long time at Wrexham and they were important days,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThen Liverpool, the FA, Swansea\u2026 you take something out of everything in life. Life is all about experiences and learning from them.\n\n\u201cI had the best part of five years at Liverpool and, when I look back on that now, for me personally it was a really important time. You always do your best for the organisation you work for. It is about the job you do, rather than what you get out of it as an individual. But I was definitely a better coach when I stepped away from there than I was when I first went in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is what I try to achieve in every job I go into \u2014 I try to come out of it as a better coach. It is what I am trying to do here as well, at Nottingham Forest. Every step for me so far has been a beneficial one. I am still a relatively young coach, if I am allowed to say that. I am looking to always improve.\u201d\n\nDuring his five years at Liverpool, Cooper went from being an under-12 coach, to being the senior coach at the academy.\n\n\u201cAcademies are all about the players. That is all that matters. You work long hours, you run long sessions, you work with a lot of players and a lot of different teams,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThe challenge is to help as many players as you can, as much as you can. That applies wherever you are and regardless of who you are working for and whether it is a young nine or 10 year-old or a player in the latter part of his development.\n\n\u201cI managed to work with a lot of very talented young players. Academies are all about the players; it is only ever about their development.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s enthusiasm for reflecting on the past is revived noticeably when the subject of who his biggest influences were at Liverpool arises.\n\n\u201cI met a really important person there, a guy called Pep Segura. He had a massive influence on me. He influenced me when it came to game understanding and the methodology of things,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nCooper with Segura (Photo: Joe Giddens \u2013 PA Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough as well that Sir Kenny (Dalglish) was still working there before he went back to being with the first team. It was brilliant to spend some time around such an iconic guy like him. They were important times for me, in terms of learning and developing as a coach.\u201d\n\nIt was Segura, who had previously managed Olympiakos and Barcelona B \u2014 where he helped develop talents such as Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas \u2014 that Cooper quickly formed a close relationship with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPep was and is a major influence because I still speak to him now. He helped me understand how the game can be played and what it takes to play that way. Not so much just playing \u2014 it was about how you train as well; how you prepare players to do things in the way that you want. He taught me about the methodology behind things as well as how to do things.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message that Pep gave me was that you\u2019ve got to know what you want your team to look like. That\u2019s what I pride myself on now \u2014 having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also how to get there. Pep put me on a different track, really.\n\n\u201cWhat is important in coaching is that you find your own way. You find what you really believe in as a coach. Because, in the end, you want your team to be a reflection of what you believe in. Pep was important to me. What I have learnt, most of all, is that what you think yourself is most important of all. I am still on that journey.\u201d\n\nCooper will not come up against Alexander-Arnold, who has developed into an integral figure at Liverpool and, arguably, one of the best right-backs in the world. The defender will be missing at the City Ground through injury. But Cooper plays down the thought of missing out on a reunion with his former player \u2014 and on any notion of him deserving any credit for the progress of players like him.\n\n\u201cCoaches don\u2019t produce players \u2014 players produce themselves. That is always something I have thought. I never think about any coach being part of a player\u2019s evolution. We are there, along the way,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cPlayers are the ones who deserve the credit for what they achieve. If they do well, they are the ones who deserve the praise for it, because it is their hard work that has got them there.\n\n\u201cWhether they turn into footballers or just good young men, that is what development is all about. It is the same here now. We have a host of young players who are working to get established. It is an ongoing daily journey.\n\n\u201cBut with Trent, I don\u2019t see it as missing out on a reunion, exactly. There are not many games where we do not come up against somebody I have worked with. Chris Willock and Andre Dozzell played with QPR. Before that, against Reading, they had Tom Dele-Bashiru in their squad. There are always players you come up against who you have a past relationship with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest have already beaten Arsenal and Leicester on their way to the quarter-final. It feels like their biggest test yet against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nIf they are to pull off another upset, much will depend on the talented younger players within Forest\u2019s own squad. Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence have formed a dangerous partnership down the right flank, James Garner and Ryan Yates have a dynamic midfield partnership and Keinan Davis has been almost unstoppable up front in recent weeks.\n\nSpence celebrates his goal against QPR this week with Johnson (left) and Worrall (right) (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that young players need these experiences. Players are shaped by all experiences, be they good, bad or indifferent. But it is often the latter two that are the most important,\u201d says Cooper, who will also hope to guide Forest into the play-offs in the remaining 10 games of the Championship season. \u201cThat is where you learn the most from. It is about the difficult situations and how you respond to them. That is what defines you. It is how you respond to setbacks that shapes you.\n\n\u201cI am a big believer in self-worth in people; a big believer in positivity and what you can do. We definitely like to have positivity around our daily routines, in the terminology we use and the intent of our days. We always try to focus on ourselves, on our environment and trying to achieve \u2014 to be successful. We attack challenges, we attack big games and embrace them rather than fear them. That is our mentality and if that is building belief and building confidence, then great.\n\n\u201cEvery day I ask the players to be the best version of themselves, to be winners and to give their best; to train and play in a way that we want to do things \u2014 to behave the way we want to behave. But we have not turned things around here. Not yet. We have made some good steps. We have work still to do.\u201d\n\nPaul Taylor\n\n\u201cCoops is destined to manage in the Premier League, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Morecambe\u2019s Northern Irish full-back Ryan McLaughlin tells The Athletic.\n\n\u201cEven all those years ago at Liverpool it was clear that he had everything you need to make the leap from youth coaching to a senior environment. I don\u2019t think any of us have been surprised by how well he has done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaughlin played for Liverpool Under-18s under Cooper a decade ago. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup where they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by a Chelsea side including Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nCooper during the FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea at Anfield on April 12, 2013 (Photo: Paul Thomas \u2013 The FA/The FA via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt was Coops\u2019 attention to detail that really stood out for me. He was very good at seeing things in your game that needed to be worked on. Then he would be relentless in terms of pummelling that into you every day on the training field,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBefore we played Chelsea he talked to me about what I\u2019d be up against in their winger Jeremie Boga. He knew him inside out. He got the balance spot on between giving you good info about what to expect but not freaking you out. He sold it to you as a brilliant challenge. He never over-complicated things. He was a really good communicator. I remember how enjoyable it was playing for him.\u201d\n\nCooper initially joined Liverpool from Wrexham in 2008. In the summer of 2011 he was promoted to academy manager by Dalglish to work closely with academy director Frank McParland, who also had a spell working at Forest during Mark Warburton\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe previous season Cooper had enhanced his reputation after stepping up to assist the academy\u2019s technical director Segura with the reserves following the departure of coach John McMahon.\n\n\u201cCoops and Pep had a great relationship,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cI know Coops took a lot from working with Pep. The Barcelona way is Coops\u2019 way. He always wanted to be expansive with the full-backs high and wide. He always wanted us to be brave in possession.\u201d\n\nThe appointment of Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager in 2012 sparked another reshuffle at Kirkby. With under-18s coach Mike Marsh added to Rodgers\u2019 senior staff at Melwood, Cooper took charge of the under-18s for the 2012-13 season. His squad included the likes of Jordan Rossiter, Jon Flanagan, Ryan Kent, Jerome Sinclair, Sheyi Ojo, Harry Wilson, Jordon Ibe, Tom Brewitt, Cameron Brannagan and Jordan Williams.\n\nMcLaughlin was coached by Cooper at Liverpool (Photo: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams, who currently plays for Bolton Wanderers in League One, was one of Cooper\u2019s youngsters who broke into Rodgers\u2019 first-team set-up, making his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at Anfield in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Coops since I was nine years old and he was coaching at Wrexham. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with him and we\u2019re still in contact a few times a month with messages going back and forth,\u201d Williams tells The Athletic. \u201cHe moved on to Liverpool when I was in the under-13s at Wrexham and then when I made the same move he was my under-16s coach at Kirkby. We had a great team. I think we only lost two games under him all season.\n\n\u201cCoops could be quite hard on us but not in a bad way. He set standards every day and he didn\u2019t like anyone falling below them. He knew what each player needed to get them going and would personalise it.\n\n\u201cI always remember striker Jerome Sinclair (who later signed for Watford) had his best season under Coops. He used to work so hard with Jerome on the training pitch. He knew he needed an arm around the shoulder, while he knew that I needed more of a kick up the ass. You can tell if someone is more suited to being a coach than a manager. Coops always had both sides. His training sessions were good and he knew how to set a team up tactically. But he also knew how to handle egos off the pitch, which is important.\u201d\n\nCentre-back Brewitt had only just turned 16 when Cooper gave him his FA Youth Cup debut in a fifth round victory over Leeds United.\n\n\u201cCoops was great for me,\u201d says Brewitt, who currently plays for Connecticut-based Hartford Athletic in the USL Championship.\n\n\u201cI was one of the youngest in the squad but he always knew how to fill me with confidence while also ensuring I was on edge to get the best out of me. He had a way of taking you out of your comfort zone. Not to a point where you couldn\u2019t perform, but to help you grow as a player.\n\n\u201cShortly before I made my FA Youth Cup debut he told me \u2018You\u2019re not in the team because of the injuries, you\u2019re in it because I picked you and I believe in you\u2019. We won 3-1 and I cleared one off the line. I felt like I had his trust and I was desperate to impress him.\n\n\u201cThere was always a feeling between us as players that Coops would go on to manage in first-team football. It was the way he went about things. He was less of a pure talent developer and more of a manager in terms of his tactics and getting the best out of players.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely an edge to him. He wasn\u2019t shy in terms of giving out a bollocking. But any criticism was always constructive. He made players better from working with them but he also made it clear that we were there to win and we needed to win in a certain way.\u201d\n\nRodgers rejigged the academy structure when at Liverpool (Photo: Clint Hughes/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the 2012-13 season when Cooper was in charge of the under-18s.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re injured managers forget all about you, but Coops cared and always went out of his way to help during a tough period,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met off the pitch. He cares about what\u2019s going on in your life away from football.\n\n\u201cWhen I got promoted with Bolton, he was in touch with me straight away. When my dad passed away, Coops was the first person to come around the house. That says a lot about him.\u201d\n\nWhen Cooper left Liverpool in the summer of 2013, it was a shock for his players. His contract wasn\u2019t renewed as Rodgers\u2019 overhaul of the academy gathered pace.\n\nIt was a period of significant change at Kirkby as Rodgers sought to exert his authority. Segura had stepped down in 2012 citing a desire to return home to Spain. However, his decision was also influenced by the fact he missed out on a more senior role after the owners ditched plans to appoint a technical director and a sporting director to work with Rodgers, who had demanded sole control.\n\nAlex Inglethorpe, the current academy director, was brought in from Tottenham initially as under-21s coach and Michael Beale, currently No 2 to Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa, was recruited from Chelsea. Cooper\u2019s exit was swiftly followed by the sackings of academy head coach Rodolfo Borrell, now Pep Guardiola\u2019s assistant at Manchester City, and academy director McParland. Neil Critchley, now manager of Blackpool, had arrived from Crewe to take over from Cooper after being headhunted by Rodgers.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise when Coops left and I\u2019m not sure what went on,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cWe were never told the finer details, but obviously Brendan had come in as manager and was putting his own stamp on things.\n\n\u201cCoops was similar to Michael Beale and Alex Inglethorpe in terms of his approach to the game \u2014 young and very driven. Whenever I went back home to Northern Ireland people would ask me what the coaches were like at Liverpool and I\u2019d always say how lucky I was. As well as Coops, I worked with Mick Beale, Mike Marsh, Rodolfo Borrell and Alex Inglethorpe. They have all done well for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the academy at Liverpool is that they develop coaches as well as players. Just look at the job Mick is doing at Villa and Critch at Blackpool. I enjoyed working with Coops, but I think it\u2019s only now that I fully appreciate what a brilliant coach he was.\u201d\n\nWilliams adds: \u201cWe were gutted about Coops going because we all loved playing for him. We just turned up one day and he had been replaced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has ever affected what Coops thinks about Liverpool. He still speaks highly of the club. He became a fan. He moved on and put everything into his new challenges.\u201d\n\nCooper twice led Swansea into the play-offs before being recruited by Forest, following the departure of Chris Hughton.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a smart move by Forest,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cThe impact he\u2019s had has been amazing. They\u2019re great to watch and they\u2019re winning. He has turned them into promotion contenders. He had a great education at Liverpool and as players we all benefited from that time we spent with him.\u201d\n\nWilliams agrees, saying: \u201cEverywhere Coops has been he has improved the teams he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI know Yan Dhanda and he really enjoyed playing for him at Swansea. Now he\u2019s got Forest flying. I\u2019m made up for him. Great coach, great person.\u201d\n\nJames Pearce\n\n(Photos: Getty Images; graphic: Tom Slator)"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/21/swansea-head-coach-steve-cooper-heading-for-exit-after-growing-unsettled", "page_content": "Steve Cooper has departed Swansea City by mutual consent after growing unsettled. The head coach led Swansea to successive Championship play-off finishes but made clear his concerns over the direction of the club.\n\nThe 41-year-old took Swansea to the play-off final last season on a modest budget. The club were keen to offer Cooper, whose deal runs until next summer, a new contract following defeat by Brentford at Wembley but the former England Under-17 manager was reluctant to enter talks. Cooper was of interest to Crystal Palace before the Premier League club appointed Patrick Vieira, and his work at Swansea also attracted attention from Fulham, who appointed Marco Silva.\n\nCooper said \u201cit feels like a good time for all parties to make a change\u201d and Swansea\u2019s chief executive, Julian Winter, pointed to the head coach\u2019s contract situation. \u201cWe felt as a club that the situation needed clarity and with a new season edging closer, the mutual nature of this decision allows both parties a chance to look forward,\u201d he said.\n\nCooper has established a reputation as one of the country\u2019s most exciting young coaches and has helped develop the youngsters Joe Rodon, Rhian Brewster and Marc Guehi, the last of whom this week joined Palace from Chelsea after two seasons on loan at Swansea.\n\nThe timing of Cooper\u2019s exit is poor given Swansea are due to start the season at Blackburn Rovers in less than three weeks. It is unclear who will take interim charge and financial restraints suggest it is unlikely they will move for a manager for whom they must pay compensation. The club has a longstanding interest in the Lincoln City manager Michael Appleton, who is recovering after successful testicular cancer surgery, and the Queens Park Rangers assistant John Eustace is also thought to have been shortlisted before Cooper\u2019s appointment in June 2019."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2777583/2021/08/18/cade-cowell-san-jose-earthquakes-mls-usmnt/", "page_content": "When he received my call, seventeen-year-old San Jose Earthquakes forward Cade Cowell had just given his teammate Emmanuel Ochoa, a fellow Quakes homegrown, a ride to grab some food at a San Jose mall. The two would later join other teammates for an afternoon of bowling organized by San Jose winger Carlos Fierro. Still Cowell answered and, with a slight hint of discomfiture, admitted that he had forgotten about the interview.\n\nCatching Cowell away from the Quakes\u2019 training ground turned out to be a welcome coincidence. What followed was a casual conversation with a teenager who, despite his status as one of Major League Soccer\u2019s brightest young talents, isn\u2019t wrapped up in the growing hype surrounding his name. Cowell is direct and transparent \u2014 a sharp contrast to today\u2019s ultra-polished and content-driven professional athlete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always hanging with my teammates and stuff,\u201d Cowell said. \u201cI just like to go fishing and bike riding in the hills and stuff like that. I really enjoy being outside. I really don\u2019t like city life at all. I like going to the forest, like a pond where it\u2019s quiet and you just get away from everything that\u2019s going on in your life.\u201d\n\nEver since his professional debut at age 15 in 2019, there has been considerable hype surrounding Cowell. In 2021, that hype is starting to turn into tangible results. Cowell became the first player in MLS this season to notch four goals and four assists. He\u2019s starting regularly for his club now and was recently named an MLS All Star for the first time. During the Gold Cup in July, he was invited to train with the senior U.S. national team for the second time in his young career.\n\nA GOAL AND ASSIST. CADE COWELL IS ON FIRE. pic.twitter.com/JifDDrEw6N \u2014 San Jose Earthquakes (@SJEarthquakes) April 24, 2021\n\nBut unlike many of his fellow professionals, Cowell refrains from the distractions of daily online interactions despite his growing fame. He has chosen to literally mute all the noise by turning off every social media notification on his phone. He has 1,639 followers on Twitter, which he said he only glances at occasionally, but digital approval is of little interest to Cowell, who will turn 18 in October.\n\n\u201cLike it\u2019s cool for fans to see what you\u2019re doing here and there,\u201d said Cowell. \u201cI\u2019ll post when I catch a fish or where I\u2019m at sometimes. But I just feel like (social) media\u2019s not everything in life and I feel like that\u2019s what it\u2019s turning into right now. It\u2019s like (having followers) is the most important thing in life. I just feel like it\u2019s not real. You know?\u201d\n\nAs a result, Cowell said that he\u2019s unaware of the buzz around him at the moment. Altogether, Cowell just wants to play soccer.\n\nAnd if he could, he\u2019d lift more weights, too.\n\nAside from his youthful smile, Cowell looks like an athlete who would excel at the NFL Combine, rather than on an MLS pitch. The MLS website lists Cowell at 6 feet tall and 163 pounds, but there\u2019s strength behind those measurements in a way that\u2019s immediately clear to anyone who watches him play.\n\nAs if it wasn\u2019t obvious enough, Cowell quite unabashedly enjoys lifting. Cowell said confidently that he can bench press up to 245 pounds, and if it were up to him, he\u2019d likely go for more. But rules are rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c(San Jose) didn\u2019t really want me to (lift) anymore,\u201d Cowell said when asked if he still lifts weights like he did before becoming a pro. \u201cIt was basically like, they wanted me to be more explosive and it\u2019s for the better. I still lift a lot, but not like I used to.\u201d\n\nBut while his physique is immediately noticeable, those closest to him also note the forward\u2019s mentality and desire to be a difference maker on the pitch. He\u2019s an intense player who plays at full tilt at all times, which is ideal for a league that continues to be recognized for its muscle and verticality.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what really excites me about him because we talk about it continuously,\u201d said San Jose head coach Mat\u00edas Almeyda in April. \u201cHe\u2019s a humble player. Humble in heart. He\u2019s humble in that he wants to listen. He wants to learn. That\u2019s what convinces me that he\u2019s going to be a great player. But he also has to understand that this takes time. We can\u2019t settle on his power. We can\u2019t settle on his pace. He has to aspire to play in Europe and we\u2019ve talked about this. And for that, one needs to have so many small technical skills. He still has to learn those. He\u2019s young. He\u2019s very young but he\u2019s doing well.\u201d\n\nCADE COWELL! That's a goal and an assist already tonight. \ud83d\udc40 #SJvDC pic.twitter.com/SZCQdxVwzk \u2014 Major League Soccer (@MLS) May 2, 2021\n\nAlmeyda made sure to note the specific technical skills that Cowell must improve: Precision with both feet, movement off the ball and becoming an aerial threat are among them. Cowell, in spite of his flaws, has started in 13 of San Jose\u2019s 19 matches this season. He has outplayed Quakes legend and veteran striker Chris Wondolowski to earn those games, but must now compete for playing time with San Jose\u2019s latest forward signing Jeremy Ebobisse. The former Portland Timber star was immediately inserted in the starting XI upon arrival with Cowell going back to the bench.\n\nSan Jose\u2019s decision to add another experienced striker may have bumped Cowell from the starting No. 9 position, but the addition of Ebobisse will allow Cowell time to develop further and battle for minutes.\n\n\u201cWhen we do fitness tests, Cade is the player with the highest (vertical) jump, and it\u2019s not even close\u201d Almeyda sid. \u201cBut he still can\u2019t head a ball, so that means he needs to improve his heading technique. That\u2019s fine. It takes time and I know that. I don\u2019t go by all the great things that are said (about Cowell). I like it. Anyone would. It motivates me when (my players) are talked about, but I can\u2019t settle on that. I want more for them. I want them to be complete players, to become difference makers throughout their careers.\u201d\n\nAlex Saunders remembers the first time he saw Cowell play, when the San Jose 2003 academy team he coached faced Modesto Ajax\u2019s 2002s. Cowell, born in 2003, was playing up one year with his hometown Modesto club. He was 11 years old and Saunders knew then that Cowell could become a special talent.\n\n\u201cPace, power, athleticism, goals. He honestly had it all then,\u201d recalled Saunders. \u201cHe\u2019s just a bigger, stronger, quicker version of what he was when he was 11 I think.\u201d\n\nSan Jose had identified Cowell as an important prospect, but logistically, adding Cowell to their academy program was difficult, with Modesto being an hour and a half drive away. Saunders and other club staff continued to see Cowell at area tournaments, which convinced them of the player\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cI got to know his family,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cWe went out to dinner with his grandparents, his mum and dad, his brother and sister. We just built a relationship. When he could he would play with us. We kept in contact. He was an amazing kid. They really wanted him to play down here full time, but he was still quite young and living further away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt age 15, Cowell led the nation in scoring as a striker for Ballistic United. Interest for Cowell from other MLS academies intensified, and according to Saunders, former San Jose general manager Jesse Fioranelli, and especially current technical director Chris Leitch, made Cowell a priority. However, unlike academy programs such as Real Salt Lake\u2019s, who provide a full-service academy experience, including dorms and a charter school program, San Jose could only offer the promise of soccer and a reliable support system.\n\nTo replicate the RSL academy model or the Philadelphia Union\u2019s expansive YSC Academy in Chester, Pennsylvania, would likely require an exorbitant financial investment from the Quakes. The cost of living in Silicon Valley is among the highest in the U.S., with available land for development at a premium.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area, as you probably know, is a very different place,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cWe all struggle.\u201d\n\nThe solution was a simple one for Saunders: Cowell would live with him, and his family would serve as Cowell\u2019s host family for his time in San Jose. It led to Cowell becoming San Jose\u2019s youngest homegrown signing in 2019 when Cowell was 15.\n\n\u201c(The Cowells) were so tight as a family that they wanted to make sure it was a good environment with someone they trusted,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cI knew that they were having these conversations, so I offered to the Quakes and I offered to his family \u2018I know you guys. Come live with me.\u2019\u201d\n\nCowell and Saunders at home in November 2018 (Courtesy Alex Saunders)\n\nSaunders says that he has played a very small part in Cowell\u2019s development. Cowell\u2019s family, according to Saunders, are \u201cthe most amazing support network that you could possibly want.\u201d Saunders, though, has undoubtedly added to that network.\n\nUnder Saunders\u2019 tutelage, Cowell has learned to cook, iron a shirt and do laundry. Before Cowell became a first-team player, they watched Quakes games together and Cowell would occasionally wake up at 4AM on the West Coast to watch Saunders\u2019 beloved Tottenham Hotspur. When Cowell made his professional debut in 2020, Saunders\u2019 fianc\u00e9e bought balloons and a cake for Cowell to celebrate the occasion. Saunders bought a USMNT scarf to commemorate Cowell\u2019s Gold Cup call up.\n\nCowell\u2019s two bikes and his fishing rods adorn Saunders\u2019 garage. And while Cowell refers to the Saunders household as his host family, which is technically true, their relationship is a close one. They confide in each other and discuss Cowell\u2019s professional aspirations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c(Cowell) just always talks about how he wants to be the best player,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cHow he wants to help the Quakes. He wants to score goals and get assists and do everything that he can for the team. He\u2019s a quiet, reserved character, singularly focused on his desire to be the best player he can be. He goes to training. He comes home. He eats. He rests. He wants to go fishing in his spare time and relax. He\u2019s never up late and he doesn\u2019t have people over late. He definitely takes care of himself. He\u2019s nothing like I was as a 17-year-old.\u201d\n\nSaunders, who said Cowell has a \u201ccontagious smile,\u201d has been surprised by the attention Cowell has received and said facetiously that he\u2019s a bit star struck by the strapping young soccer star with whom he shares his kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou see me at the games now when he\u2019s near the ball or has a chance, I\u2019m jumping up and down like an eight-year-old hoping that he\u2019s going to score or assist or something,\u201d said Saunders. \u201cI\u2019ve just been this familiar face. We see each other at the house. I can\u2019t take any credit for anything, but I shall be sad someday when he flies the nest.\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, Cowell needed to leave home on strangely short notice \u2013 albeit for a good reason. After D.C. United winger Paul Arriola limped off the field in the group stage opener against Haiti, a spot on Gregg Berhalter\u2019s U.S. national team roster became available, or so it seemed.\n\n\u201cI was at (Quakes goalkeeper) JT Marcinkowski\u2019s house just having dinner with him,\u201d recalled Cowell. \u201cMy phone was ringing and it said \u2018Gregg Berhalter\u2019 and I was like \u2018Oh wow, this is crazy.\u2019 (Berhalter) was like \u2018Hey Cade. I have a player injured and we want you to come out to the Gold Cup and join us. Your flight is tomorrow.\u2019 I got really excited. But after I found out that (Arriola) wasn\u2019t even really hurt, I got upset for like two or three days. I was kinda bummed. But it was a cool two or three days in training and stuff.\u201d\n\nCowell said rushing to national team camp in the middle of an international tournament was \u201cpretty strange.\u201d A player in his position is thrust into an unfamiliar routine within a highly competitive environment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really have much of a conversation with Gregg until the last day when he said that I\u2019m going home,\u201d Cowell said. \u201cHe said that he was very surprised at how much better I\u2019ve gotten since the January camp. He said I was more confident, that he could see that.\u201d\n\nCowell is represented by the Wasserman Media Group, but he laughs when he confesses that he doesn\u2019t remember his agent\u2019s last name. That could be perceived as a lack of attention to detail, but in speaking with Cowell, one realizes that he speaks matter of factly \u2014 avoiding platitudes or forced responses. Discussions between himself and his agent about playing abroad aren\u2019t being had either, Cowell says, but he revealed that he has a check list of professional objectives that he follows.\n\nCowell wouldn\u2019t disclose the full contents of the list other than to say that playing in Europe is a personal goal of his. Every so often, Cowell will discuss his future with Wondolowski, who has become one of Cowell\u2019s mentors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Cowell isn\u2019t getting ahead of himself. He\u2019s eligible to play for Mexico and the U.S., but said he\u2019s undecided regarding his national team allegiance. Cowell briefly supplanted Wondolowski, the league\u2019s career scoring leader, as San Jose\u2019s starting forward. Cowell\u2019s performances have since cooled, a reality that will test his mentality and competitiveness. For now, focusing on the present must take precedence over a future that he cannot control.\n\n\u201cYou get too caught up in things\u2026you start scoring, you feel like you\u2019re doing good and then people start worrying about other things instead of really conquering what you\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Cowell said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let that happen to me. I really just want to be the best player that I can possibly be. At the end of my career just be like \u2018I really checked everything on my list.\u2019 I did it all.\u201d\n\n(Photo: John Todd / ISI Photos / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37627517/san-jose-earthquakes-part-ways-manager-matias-almeyda-sources", "page_content": "Matias Almeyda is out as manager of the San Jose Earthquakes, the MLS club confirmed on Monday.\n\nAlex Covelo, who has been head coach of Earthquakes II in the inaugural season of MLS NEXT Pro, was announced as interim head coach. Earthquakes legend Chris Wondolowski will serve as interim assistant coach, alongside Steve Ralston and Luciano Fusco, with Almeyda's backroom staff also departing.\n\nThe decision was made to part ways with the Argentine hours after the Quakes tied Nashville SC, 2-2, extending San Jose's winless start to the season to seven games, and making it the only team in MLS without a win. It isn't clear the extent to which Almeyda will be paid the remainder of his contract.\n\n- MLS on ESPN+: Stream LIVE games, replays (U.S. only)\n\n- Soccer on ESPN+: FC Daily | Futbol Americas\n\n- Don't have ESPN? Get instant access\n\nSources told ESPN that Almeyda told the team after last week's 4-3 loss to Houston that he was \"done\" as San Jose manager and that he would talk to the team the following Monday. But when Monday came there was no further clarity as to his future. Those sources also said that this is something that Almeyda had said to the team more than once over the years in the wake of difficult losses.\n\n\"We've had ongoing discussions and for sure this past week,\" general manager Chris Leitch told media members on Monday.\n\n\"I think that culminated in just both parties realizing that this was the best for everyone. So without getting into all of the details of what happened, when and who said this, and that, I think the most important part is just that Matias and his staff as well as our club, we realized that we both endeavored to have better results than than what we've shown not only this year, but in years past.\"\n\nMatias Almeyda had been in charge of San Jose since the start of the 2019 season. Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAlmeyda concludes his three-plus seasons in San Jose with a regular season record of 31-42-25. He was signed to great fanfare and high hopes just prior to the end of the 2018 regular season. Almeyda's man-marking system was expected to turn around the fortunes of a team that had qualified for the playoffs just twice in the previous eight seasons.\n\n\"I want to thank the Earthquakes for this time together, thank you to the fans, directors, staff and John Fisher for their trust, thank you to the players for their effort and thank you to MLS for giving me this opportunity,\" Almeyda wrote on Twitter following the announcement.\n\nWhile the team played some exciting soccer at times during Almeyda's tenure, the team lacked consistency, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Once the rest of the league became more familiar with his tactics, the team's results suffered. San Jose did reach the playoffs during the pandemic-shortened season of 2020, but that was done with the benefit of MLS expanding the playoff field in the Western conference to eight teams, with San Jose sneaking into the final spot.\n\nFor his part, Almeyda has on multiple occasions criticized San Jose's lack of spending in comparison to much of the rest of the league.\n\nNames already being suggested as possible replacements include El Salvador manager Hugo Perez, as well as former Quakes player and assistant Ian Russell, who managed the team's affiliate in Reno for four seasons.\n\n\"I will prioritize the MLS experience part of it,\" Leitch, who said the search for Almeyda's long-term replacement would begin immediately, added when asked what the club would be looking for a in a new coach.\n\n\"We're looking for club-centric staff and head coach, those with a high tactical acumen and flexibility and someone that's a leader, a good culture builder, because honestly, this club deserves and needs to win. We haven't been successful in the more recent years. This is a winning club that's lifted multiple trophies. That's where we want to get back to.\""}, {"url": "https://www.sportico.com/business/sales/2021/san-jose-earthquakes-sale-1234638264/", "page_content": "San Jose Earthquakes owner John Fisher has hired a bank to explore the sale of minority shares of the MLS club, according to multiple people familiar with the plans.\n\nFisher, who owns a large majority of the team, has retained Moelis & Co. to help with the process, according to the people, who were granted anonymity because the details are private. It\u2019s unclear how much of the team he\u2019s looking to sell, or to how many people, and it\u2019s possible deals won\u2019t materialize.\n\nThat said, now might be a good time to sell a sizeable limited partnership in an MLS club. A handful of controlling and minority stakes have already sold this year at large valuations. The Earthquakes, which play in an 18,000-seat team-owned stadium, were valued at $510 million in Sportico\u2019s recent valuations.\n\nThe Earthquakes declined to comment. Reached via email, a Moelis representative also declined to comment.\n\nLike owners in all major U.S. sports, MLS owners are recovering from a difficult 2020 season interrupted by COVID-19.

But moments after victory Cooper retreated to the dugout, covered his face with his hands and afforded himself a few quiet seconds to digest everything that had happened.\n\nForest are back in the top flight for the first time since 1999. Cooper\u2019s black polo shirt was drenched in champagne from his players ambushing a pitchside interview and tears pooled in his eyes when he touched on the pride of seeing more than 36,000 Forest fans bask in promotion in the west end of the stadium, becoming the fifth and final league team to be allocated that side of the ground and secure victory this season, from Leicester in the Community Shield in August to Port Vale in the League Two playoff final last Saturday.\n\n\u201cPersistent standing is not permitted,\u201d were the words displayed on the big screens before kick-off but that message soon ignored as supporters savoured a remarkable season that began with Forest making their worst start since 1913.\n\nFor Cooper, the October international break Forest went into fresh from his third game, a 3-0 win at Birmingham, was an opportunity to drum his methods into his squad and soon after they went on a nine-match unbeaten streak.\n\n\u201cWe went on some brilliant runs but there were times I would look at the league table and think: \u2018We haven\u2019t made much progress here\u2019 and we\u2019d still be in 15th or 13th and you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Maybe we won\u2019t get in the top 10,\u2019\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to be part of the journey that has got us back to the Premier League.\u201d Then he chuckled. \u201cSounds great,\u201d he said.\n\nCooper\u2019s laser-like focus kept Forest grounded in their surge up the table and the highs of knocking out Arsenal and Leicester in the FA Cup en route to hosting Liverpool. After victory on Sunday he grinned as he apologised for peddling the same answers, poking fun at a level-headed outlook that has brought the biggest of prizes.\n\nSteve Cook celebrates with a cardboard cutout of Steve Cooper. Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty Images\n\n\u201c\u2018About the next game, control the controllables\u2019 and all that crap,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m tough with them [the players], I\u2019m challenging, demanding, but I\u2019m with them, I\u2019m with them 100% and that\u2019s how you get the best out of people and get the best out of themselves. But I\u2019ve felt it back as well. I\u2019ve asked them to trust me and never once have they wavered.\u201d\n\nForest will not veer from their principles because of the step up in class. \u201cYou need a clear identity and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got here,\u201d says Lolley, who signed from Huddersfield, Sunday\u2019s opponents, four years ago. \u201cIn games you have to adapt and change but for the most part we\u2019re here to attack teams and we\u2019ll go up and do exactly the same.\n\n\u201cWe showed that in the FA Cup, in games where we certainly weren\u2019t second-best in any of them. We\u2019ve got success from being the team we are and the way we play. We always try to play on the front foot and press teams. To be the set of players and staff that have put Forest back where they belong is an incredible feeling.\u201d\n\nThe arrival of Cooper, coveted by Premier League clubs last summer, was a coup but no one envisaged the extraordinary uplift that followed. \u201cHe\u2019s come in and taken what looked, from the outside, like a misfit team who were low on confidence and couldn\u2019t score goals last season,\u201d Worrall says. \u201cWe were OK defensively but we could not score for toffee, and this year we\u2019ve been a breath of fresh air.\u201d\n\nOf the bond with fans, Worrall says: \u201cIt had grown miles apart in seasons gone by but now it\u2019s very tightly knit. A lot of them come to the training ground, we have conversations with the forum groups and they have been behind us every step of the way. The supporters\u2019 contribution is a major reason we\u2019re back.\u201d\n\nNottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has promised to back the manager in the transfer market. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA\n\nCaf\u00fa, an unused substitute, was soon sliding on the dressing-room floor and Djed Spence was among those with cigar in hand before jumping on the team bus. Evangelos Marinakis, Forest\u2019s Greek owner who has vowed to provide \u201call the ammunition to the team with good players\u201d, patted Spence, a loan star from Middlesbrough, on the back and shook hands with Cooper. There was also a warm embrace from Cooper with the Football League\u2019s chief executive, Trevor Birch, who appointed him at Swansea.\n\nAt what point was the miracle on? \u201cUmmm, good question,\u201d Spence says. \u201cWe just believed; you can smell it, you can feel it in the group, you can feel it in the changing room. You just get that vibe. The manager came in and gave us belief. Hard work is the main thing. It has been a memorable season.\u201d\n\nA few minutes after the final whistle the straight-talking Worrall, in between bluntly admitting Forest have not been good enough in previous seasons, compared the side to a \u201cwhipped dog\u201d and highlighted how Cooper had killed him and his teammates with kindness since September.\n\nThe same applies beyond the City Ground. Cooper sent individual letters to members of the Football Writers\u2019 Association to apologise for not being able to attend the Midlands lunch in April, citing a desire to \u201cget every detail right in these important weeks\u201d. That he certainly did."}]}
