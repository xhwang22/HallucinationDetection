{"Achille-Ferdinand Carri\u00e8re was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1894.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Legion-of-Honour", "page_content": "Legion of Honour, officially National Order of the Legion of Honour, French Ordre National de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, premier order of the French republic, created by Napoleon Bonaparte, then first consul, on May 19, 1802, as a general military and civil order of merit conferred without regard to birth or religion provided that anyone admitted swears to uphold liberty and equality.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s ideas for this order, which finally prevailed, aroused a certain amount of opposition, particularly from those who felt the Legion should have purely military qualifications. After becoming emperor, Napoleon presided over the first investiture into the Legion, which took place in 1804 at the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, Paris. In 1805, schools were started for daughters of members; later, hospitals were maintained for sick and infirm legionnaires. During the Restoration, the Legion became a royal order, ranked below the restored military and religious orders of the ancien r\u00e9gime. Upon the downfall of the monarchy, the Legion once again became the highest-ranking order and decoration in France.\n\nTrue to the stated ideals of Napoleon when founding the order, the membership of the Legion is remarkably egalitarian; both men and women, French citizens and foreigners, civilians and military personnel, irrespective of rank, birth, or religion, can be admitted to any of the classes of the Legion. Admission into this order, which can be conferred posthumously, requires 20 years of civil achievement in peacetime or extraordinary military bravery and service in times of war. Admission into the Legion for war services automatically carries with it the award of the Croix de Guerre, the highest French military medal.\n\nDuring the Consulate and the First Empire, Napoleon served as the grand master of the order, while a grand council of seven grand officers administered the 15 territorial units, or \u201ccohorts,\u201d into which the order was divided. Currently, the president of France serves as grand master, and the order is administered by a civil chancellor with the help of a council nominated by the grand master. The Legion has five classes, listed in descending rank: grand cross (limited to 80 members), grand officer (200), commander (1,000), officer (4,000), and knight, or chevalier (unlimited). Napoleon himself made some 48,000 nominations. Foreign recipients in the classes higher than chevalier are supernumerary. Promotion from a lower grade to a higher grade is done according to the service performed in the lower. However, extraordinary services may admit candidates at once to any rank.\n\nThe changes in design of the insignia reflect the vicissitudes of French history. Originally, the star of the order depicted a crown surrounded by oak and laurel wreaths with the head of Napoleon, while the other side displayed an eagle holding a thunderbolt with the motto emblazoned \u201cHonneur et Patrie\u201d (\u201cHonour and Country\u201d). During the first Restoration, Louis XVIII, in 1814, replaced the head of Napoleon with that of King Henry IV of France, and on the other side introduced the royal fleur-de-lis emblem. Napoleon III, in 1870, restored the original design, although he replaced the head of Napoleon with the female head of the Republic. The badge of the Legion depicts this head with the inscription \u201cR\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise\u201d; the reverse side has a set of crossed tricolours with the motto \u201cHonneur et Patrie.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honour", "page_content": "The Legion of Honour (French: Ordre national de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur)[2] is the highest French award.\n\nIt was established by Napoleon Bonaparte on 19 May 1802.\n\nThe Order is the highest decoration in France and is divided into five degrees: Chevalier (Knight), Officier (Officer), Commandeur (Commander), Grand Officier (Grand Officer) and Grand Croix (Grand Cross).\n\nThe order's motto is Honneur et Patrie ('Honour and Country'), and its seat is the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur on the left bank of the River Seine in Paris.\n\n\u2191 le petit Larousse 2013 p1567 \u2191 Formerly the Royal Order of the Legion of Honour (Ordre royale de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur)"}, {"url": "https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nOrdre de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur\n\nOfficier medal of the French \"L\u00e9gion d'honneur\" Awarded by France Type Order with five degrees Awarded for Excellent civil or military conduct delivered, upon official investigation Status Open since 1802 Statistics Established May 19, 1802 First awarded July 14, 1804 Distinct\n\nrecipients The maximum quotas:\n\nKnight: 125,000\n\nOfficer: 10,000\n\nCommander: 1,250\n\nGrand Officer: 250\n\nGrand Cross: 75 Precedence Next (higher) None Next (lower) Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration[1]\n\nThe L\u00e9gion d'honneur or Ordre national de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (National Order of the Legion of Honour) is a French order established by Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, First Consul of the First Republic, on May 19, 1802.[2] This world-renowned Order is the highest decoration in France and is divided into five various degrees: Chevalier (Knight), Officier (Officer), Commandeur (Commander), Grand Officier (Grand Officer), and Grand-Croix (Grand Cross).\n\nThe royal orders of the Kings were all abolished after the French Revolution, but Napoleon saw a need to officially honor outstanding service and merit based on the principle of equality between military and civilian citizens. By honoring the different kinds of services rendered to the country, this new order reflected the ideals of the revolution.\n\nThe original statutes have been slightly amended over the years, but in 1962 General Charles de Gaulle restored the Legion of Honor to its original concept as the highest general military and civil order of merit. Today the award can be given to men and women, French citizens and foreigners, civilians and military personnel.[3]\n\nThe order's motto is Honneur et Patrie (Honour and Fatherland), and its seat is the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur on the left bank of the Seine river in Paris.\n\nHistory\n\nConsulat\n\nNapoleon, as emperor, always wore the cross and Grand Eagle of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur.\n\nPrior to the Revolution The Order of St. Louis was the most popular in the French kingdom. Louis XIV founded it in 1693. It was comprised of grand crosses, commanders and chevaliers or knights, all of whom were Catholic officers of the royal army. Louis XV instituted the Order of Military Merit for Protestant foreign officers serving in France.[4]\n\nAfter the Revolution it was Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, the First Consul and de facto sole ruler, who created a reward to commend civilians and soldiers that became the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur,[5] a body of men that was not an order of chivalry like the old nobility system, but an order of Merit. From its beginning it was conferred on illustrious individuals in all walks of life\u2014the military, magistrates, administrators and civil servants as well as men of distinguished achievement in the arts, fine arts, teaching, agriculture, trade, and industry.\n\nL\u00e9gions d'honneur' on August 16, 1804, at the camp of Boulogne. Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, First Consul of the French Republic, awards some of the firston August 16, 1804, at the camp of Boulogne.\n\nOn July 15, 1804, the first L\u00e9gion d'Honneur were awarded in the Chapel of The Invalides with the emperor personally bestowing the awards in a grand military and religious ceremony. Along the first to be honored were eighteen marshals, five cardinals and a number of scholars, scientists, writers and composers. By 1812, 1,400 civilians had been decorated.[6]\n\nA few weeks later on, August 16, in a solemn military ceremony held at Boulogne-sur-Mer, the troops who were to embark for England and were within sight of the enemy\u2019s shores were personally bestowed the new honor by Napoleon.\n\nTo spur the members of the Legion to even greater efforts in the service of their country he instituted four ranks in the Legion: knight, officer, (commander until 1814), and grand-officer. In addition, Napoleon, as Emperor, added a fifth rank: Grand croix (cross), called \"grand-eagle\" during his reign. The ranks of grand officer and grand cross are known as dignit\u00e9s.\n\nFirst Empire\n\nAfter the reestablishment of the nobility in 1808, award of the L\u00e9gion gave way to the title of \"Knight of the Empire\" (chevalier de l'empire). The title was made hereditary after three generations of grantees.\n\nNapoleon had dispensed 15 golden collars of the legion among his kinsmen and the highest of his ministers. This collar was abolished in 1815.\n\nAlthough research is made difficult by the loss of the archives, it is known that three women who fought with the army were decorated with the order: Virginie Ghesqui\u00e8re, Marie-Jeanne Schelling and a nun, Sister Anne Biget. (The first recorded women's award is 1851, under Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte.)\n\nThe L\u00e9gion d'honneur was prominent and visible in the empire. The Emperor always wore it and the fashion of the time allowed for decorations to be worn most of the time. Napoleon's personal decorations were captured by the Prussians and were displayed in the Zeughaus (armory) in Berlin until 1945. Today, they are in Moscow.\n\nRestoration of the Bourbon Kings in 1814\n\nLouis XVIII changed the appearance of the order, but it was not abolished because it would have angered the 35-38,000 who were already members. The images of Napoleon and his eagle were removed and replaced by the image of Henry IV, the popular first king of the Bourbon line. Three Bourbon Lilies (fleur-de-lys) replaced the eagle on the reverse of the order. A king's crown replaced the imperial crown. In 1816, the grand cordons were renamed grand crosses and the legionnaires became knights. The king decreed that the commandants were now commanders.\n\nAlthough, during the Hundred Days, Napoleon had revoked the L\u00e9gion d'honneurs bestowed by Louis XVIII, the Order itself was maintained; but there was an attempt to diminish its prestige by giving it second place after the Order of Saint Michael and the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis.[7]\n\nInsignias with figure of Henry IV.\n\nCertificate honoring the recipient of a L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n\nJuly Monarchy\n\nLouis Philippe, King of the French, wearing the sash of the order.\n\nFrance's first constitutional monarch, King Louis-Philippe of the House of Orleans, abolished the other orders of the monarchy and restored the order of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1830 as the sole decoration of the French nation. The insignia were drastically altered. The cross now displayed tricolor flags.\n\nSecond Republic\n\nYet another revolt in Paris (1848) brought a new republic and a new design to the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n\nA nephew of the founder, Prince Napol\u00e9on was elected president and he restored the image of his uncle on the crosses of the order. In 1852 the first officially recorded woman, Ang\u00e9lique Duchemin a revolutionary in the 1789 uprising against the absolute monarchy, was admitted into the order. President Napoleon staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and made himself emperor of the French in 1852.\n\nSecond Empire\n\nAn Imperial crown was added. During Napoleon III's reign the first American was admitted\u2014Dr. Thomas Wiltberger Evans, dentist of Napoleon III.\n\nThird Republic\n\nIn 1870 the defeat of the army in the Franco-Prussian war brought another Republic. As France changed, the L\u00e9gion d'honneur changed as well. The crown was replaced by a laurel and oak wreath. In 1871, during the Paris Commune, the H\u00f4tel de Salm, headquarters of the L\u00e9gion, was burned to the ground in street fighting and the archives of the order were lost.\n\nDuring the First World War, some 55,000 decorations were conferred, 20,000 to foreigners. The large number of decorations was due to the new posthumous awards authorized in 1918. Traditionally membership in the L\u00e9gion could not be awarded posthumously.\n\nThe oath which the Legionnaires had previously sworn to the various regimes were abolished during the Third Republic.\n\nDe Gaulle\n\nIn 1940 General Charles De Gaulle, Leader of the Free French movement, out of respect for French institutions\u2014which he considered as having fallen into abeyance\u2014refused to award the medal of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and decided it was necessary to create a special and original decoration. On November 16th, 1940, in Brazzaville\u2014capital of the nascent Free France, he signed Edict No. 7, which created the Order of the Liberation.\n\nWhen he stepped down in January of 1946, General De Gaulle signed a decree that suspended the nominations to be awarded the Cross of the Liberation (decree of January 23, 1946). Since the goal of liberation had been achieved, the Order was deactivated. It was only reactivated in 1958 for Winston Churchill and in 1960 for King George VI, posthumously.[8]\n\nLater when De Gaulle became president of France he formally established a new decoration known as the National Order of Merit. This reestablished the L\u00e9gion d'honneur as the premiere award for \"eminent service.\" \"Distinguished service\" is now rewarded with the new Order of Merit, whose lapel ribbons and rosettes look like the Legion's, except that the color is blue.[9]\n\nThe National Order of Merit was established one year after the code of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur was revised. This new code harmonized the system of French decorations and replaced a number of ministerial orders. Only four of these are still awarded: The Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques, the Ordre du M\u00e9rite Agricole, the Ordre du M\u00e9rite Maritime and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\n\nCriticism\n\nControversy over whether the award is losing its original value has been ongoing throughout modern history. In 2008, Paris-based broadcaster Johnny Summerton questioned the value of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur when it was granted to the judge who gave the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, his divorce in 2007 and to the man who introduced him to his new wife a short time later. \"But it's the apparent trend to broaden the scope that has many questioning whether it any longer has a true value,\" he wrote.[10]\n\nOrganization\n\nThe organization of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur has remained the same since 1852. The Chief of State, the President of the Republic, is accorded the rank of Grand Cross upon taking office and automatically becomes the Grand Master of the Order. After his term expires, he remains a Grand Cross.\n\nThe Grand Master chooses and appoints the Grand Chancellor from among the Grand Crosses or the Grand officers. This is one of the highest positions in the French Republic and the appointment is for a six-year renewable term. The Grand Chancellor is chairman of the Council of the Order and directs the administrative services housed in the Palace of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in Paris. He represents the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in litigation, is the keeper of the Seal of the Order and presents to the Chief of State all the reports, draft decrees, regulations and decisions concerning the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. Each new President of the Republic receives the Collar of the Grand Master of the Order from the Grand Chancellor.\n\nAdmission to the Order\n\nMembers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur are appointed for life. In peacetime, twenty years of distinguished military or civilian service are required for admission to the Order. Candidates are nominated by the various Ministers, who submit their names to the Grand Chancellor. He in turn presents them to the President of the Republic.\n\nFrench nationals, men and women, can be received into the L\u00e9gion, for \"eminent merit\" (m\u00e9rites \u00e9minents) in military or civil life. In practice, in current usage, the order is conferred, in addition to military recipients, to many entrepreneurs, high-level civil servants, sport champions[11] and people with high connections in the executive branch of the government. The members of the French Parliament cannot receive the order, except for valor in war, and ministers are not allowed to nominate their accountants.\n\nA Legionnaire can be received into the Order only by another Legionnaire of at least equal rank. These requirements do not apply to foreigners receiving the award.\n\nFrench nationals are always initially received in the L\u00e9gion to the class of chevalier (knight). To be promoted to a higher class, one must prove new services to France and a set number of years must pass between appointment and promotion. The only exception is the President of the Republic, who is made a grand cross de jure upon his accession to the presidency. Foreigners are not admitted in the L\u00e9gion as such, but may be decorated with the insignia of the L\u00e9gion. A foreigner can be decorated directly with the insignia of a higher class. Foreign heads of state and the wives or consorts of monarchs are made Grand Cross as a courtesy.\n\nOffenses\n\nWearing the decoration of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur without having the right to do so is an offense. Wearing the ribbon or rosette of a foreign order of knighthood is prohibited if that ribbon is mainly red, like the ribbon of the L\u00e9gion.\n\nMembers convicted of a severe crime (plain crime in French) are dismissed de jure from the order. Members convicted of a lesser felony (d\u00e9lit in French) can be dismissed too.\n\nCollective appointments\n\nCollective appointments can also be made to cities, institutions, companies, or military units. In the case of a military unit, its flag is decorated with the insignia of a knight, which is a different award than the fourrag\u00e8re. Cities proudly display the decoration in their coat of arms.\n\nNo emblem had ever received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur until Napoleon III bestowed it upon the flags of regiments that had distinguished themselves during the Italian campaigns. Only one flag was so honored in 1870, the standard of the 57th R\u00e9giment de Ligne. From 1859 to 1947, fifty-seven flags were decorated, including those of the Paris and Reims fire brigades, the \"Ecole Polytechnique,\" the \"Ecole Navale\" and the \"Ecole de l\u2019Air.\" In 1954, President Ren\u00e9 Coty awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur to the flags of the Le Havre and Rouen fire brigades.\n\nThe award was first given to French cities during the Hundred Days. After 1870 the Republic rewarded several cities, including Paris (1900). Thirty-one were decorated between 1914 and 1917, sixteen of them during World War I. Cities honored include Li\u00e8ge in 1914, Belgrade in 1920, Luxembourg in 1957 and Stalingrad (today's Volgograd) in 1984 were decorated, as were 51 regiments and the Military School of Autun.\n\nTwenty-one schools, mainly higher education institutions providing the bulk of reserve officers during the World Wars, were awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. They share this distinction with the Red Cross, the abbey of Our Lady of Dombes and the state-railway company SNCF.\n\nSchools for descendants\n\nWhen the French Revolution closed the doors of the convent schools it brought the end of educational institutions for girls. Only a few exclusive schools were available to girls at the beginning of the First Empire. Napoleon was aware of this lack and on December 15, 1805, in Sch\u00f6nbrunn, signed the decree which established \"lay schools for daughters of the members of the Legion of Honour.\" They were located in the Ecouen Ch\u00e2teau in 1807 and in the ancient abbey of Saint Denis in 1809. Today the boarding schools are state establishments under the authority of the Grand Chancellor. The girls enrolled have a direct ascendant who is a holder of either the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, the Order of Merit or of the Military Medal. A thousand children and grandchildren of the members of the order are educated in these schools annually.\n\nThe Order and other countries\n\nForeigners may be nominated for membership in the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. They can be admitted at any rank and promoted regardless of how long they have been members.\n\nIn the United States, Generals of the Army Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur are among the 10,000 Americans who have received the decoration. In 1949, the Academies of West Point and Annapolis were also decorated. Although it is rare for an ambassador in Paris to be awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, a posthumous exception was made for the United States ambassador Pamela Harriman in 1997. The last surviving American World War I veteran, Frank Buckles, also received this honor.\n\nIn 2004, on the 60th anniversary of D-Day, French president Jacques Chirac saluted the United States for its part in ending World War II by awarding one hundred American veterans with the Legion d'honneur. In 1998, France observed the 80th anniversary of the World War I armistice by awarding L\u00e9gion d'honneur medals to American veterans of that conflict as well.\n\nAdditionally, in the United Kingdom Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and the late Lord Mountbatten have been decorated with the Grand Cross. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has also been decorated with the Grand Cross.\n\nAustralian General Sir John Monash was decorated with the Grand Officer during the First World War and Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Chief of the Australian Defence Force, received the degree of Commander in 2007.\n\nOther high level foreigners to be awarded include Vladimir Putin, President of Russia at the time, who received the award in September 2006 and Shimon Peres, President of Israel at the time, who received the award in March 2008.\n\nList of recipients\n\nThe list of recipients is quite diverse, including such names as Mahmoud Hesabi (1903-1992), Iranian scientist, Alexander Graham Bell, Paul Hewson (aka Bono), Fairuz (Arabic: \u0641\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0632 also spelled Fairouz or Fayrouz) a distinguished Lebanese singer, William Joseph Donovan, KBE United States Army, was an American soldier best remembered as wartime head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the \"father\" of today's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Rear Admiral Jules S\u00e9bastien C\u00e9sar Dumont d'Urville, French explorer and naval officer.\n\nFor a complete list of recipients go to French Legion of Honor.\n\nClasses and insignia\n\nThe five classes wearing their respective insignia (gentlemen).\n\nThe order has five classes:\n\nTwo dignities : Grand-Croix (Grand Cross): Formerly grande d\u00e9coration, grand aigle or grand cordon , wears the badge on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest. Grand Officier (Grand Officer): Wears the badge on a ribbon with a rosette on the left chest, plus the star on the right chest.\n\nThree ranks : Commandeur (Commander): Formerly commandant, wears the badge on a necklet. Officier (Officer): Wears the badge on a ribbon with a rosette on the left chest. Chevalier (Knight): Formerly l\u00e9gionnaire, wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest.\n\n\n\nRibbon bars Knight Officer Commander Grand Officer Grand Cross\n\nThe sitting President of the Republic, as grand master of the order, wears the Grand Collar of the L\u00e9gion, which is presented to him upon his investiture.\n\nThe badge of the L\u00e9gion is a five-armed \"Maltese Asterisk\" (for want of a better description\u2014see Maltese Cross) in gilt (in silver for chevalier) enameled white, with an enameled laurel and oak wreath between the arms. The obverse central disc is in gilt, featuring the head of Marianne, surrounded by the legend R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise on a blue enamel ring. The reverse central disc is also in gilt, with a set of crossed tricolores, surrounded by the L\u00e9gion's motto Honneur et Patrie (Honour and Fatherland) and its foundation date on a blue enamel ring. The badge is suspended by an enameled laurel and oak wreath.\n\nThe star (or \"plaque\") is worn by the Grand Cross (in gilt on the left chest) and the Grand Officer (in silver on the right chest) respectively; it is similar to the badge, but without enamel, and with the wreath replaced by a cluster of rays in between each arm. The central disc features the head of Marianne, surrounded by the legend R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise (French Republic) and the motto Honneur et Patrie.\n\nThe ribbon for the badge is plain red.\n\nThe badge or star is not worn usually, except at the time of the decoration ceremony or on a dress uniform. Instead, one normally wears the ribbon or rosette on one's suit.\n\nMuseum\n\nThe old de Salm mansion on the Quai d\u2019Orsay in Paris has housed the central offices and the Museum of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur since 1804. Built shortly before the French Revolution, the building was burned by the Commune in 1871 and reconstructed from a fund raised by Legionnaires. The mansion has been restored to its original 1789 state, with the exception of the wings added in 1925 for the Museum established by General Auguste Dubail, Grand Chancellor from 1918 to 1934.\n\nThe Museum possesses a complete collection of the Orders of the former Regimes and their various insignia, along with paintings, engravings and important historical mementos.\n\nGallery of images\n\nOriginal L\u00e9gionnaire insignia (1804).\n\nLate Empire L\u00e9gionnaire insignia: the front features Napoleon's profile and the rear, the imperial Eagle.

What is it?\n\nThe Legion of Honor is the highest French decoration and one of the most famous in the world. For two centuries, it has been presented on behalf of the Head of State to reward the most deserving citizens in all fields of activity.\n\n2. What is its purpose?\n\nAs an honor, the Legion of Honor does not include any actual material or financial benefit. However, it is an invaluable source of pride for the recipients and their families and an example of civic service made public.\n\n3. Who is eligible?\n\nAny French citizen with no criminal record, who has demonstrated outstanding merits in the service of the nation, in a military or a civilian capacity. Twenty years of activity at least are required to qualify for the Legion of Honor.\n\n4. How many have received it?\n\nThe Legion of Honor has 79,000 members. On average, 2200 French and 300 foreigners are decorated each year.\n\n5. Can one apply for it?\n\nThe Legion of Honor cannot be applied for.\n\nFrench ministers are responsible for identifying potential honorees, relying on the societal network (parliamentarians, mayors, employers, leaders of trade unions or non-profit organizations, presidents of professional or sports federations...).\n\n6. Can it be turned down?\n\nSome people express their objection in principle to the Legion of Honor though they have not received it. In their case, we cannot speak of refusal.\n\nTurning down the Legion of Honor implies prior admittance to the Order, by decree published in the Official Journal. In this very rare case of refusal, the relevant individuals choose not to receive the decoration.\n\n7. Can it be taken away?\n\nThe honor can be revoked in the event of criminal conviction, or any action that is dishonorable or that may harm the interests of France. The exclusion measure is announced by decree.\n\n8. What does it look like?\n\nThe color of the ribbon is red. The badge is a five-armed Maltese asterisk hung on an oak and laurel wreath. On the obverse is the effigy of the Republic and on the reverse two tricolor flags surrounded by the motto \"Honneur et Patrie\" (Honor and Fatherland).\n\n9. When and how is it worn?\n\nThe Legion of Honor is worn before any other French or foreign insignia, on the left-hand side. On informal attire, one wears lapel insignia (ribbon or rosette). Pendants and small-size decorations are preferred for official ceremonies. The military has its own rules for wearing insignia.\n\n10. How is it evolving?\n\nThe Legion of Honor belongs to its time and adapts to changes in society.\n\nIt recognizes more and more the role of non-profit organizations end employees, the life achievements of persons of modest origins, and the place of women through strict gender parity in each civilian awardees class."}, {"url": "https://www.identifymedals.com/database/medals-by-period/pre-ww1-medals/the-legion-of-honour-medal-france-pre-ww1/", "page_content": "Time Period : Pre-WW1\n\n: Pre-WW1 Institution : 19 May 1802\n\n: 19 May 1802 Country: France\n\nThe Legion of Honour (National Order of the Legion of Honour; or Ordre national de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in French) is the highest French order of merit for military and civil merits. The Legion of Honour was established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte and retained by all the divergent governments and regimes later holding power in France.\n\nThe L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur is a body of men and not an order of chivalry, for Napoleon believed that France wanted a recognition of merit rather than a new system of nobility. The order\u2019s motto is Honneur et Patrie (\u201cHonour and Fatherland\u201d), and its seat is the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur on the left bank of the River Seine in Paris.\n\nThe order is divided into five degrees of increasing distinction: Chevalier, Officier, Commandeur, Grand-officier, and Grand-croix.\n\nThe Legion of Honour Design\n\nThe badge of the L\u00e9gion is a five-armed \u201cMaltese Asterisk\u201d in gilt (made in silver for chevalier) enameled white, with an enameled laurel and oak wreath between the arms.\n\nThe obverse of the Legion of Honour medal central disc is in gilt, featuring the head of Marianne, surrounded by the legend R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise on a blue enamel ring. The reverse central disc is also in gilt, with a set of crossed tricolores, surrounded by the L\u00e9gion\u2019s motto Honneur et Patrie (Honour and Fatherland) and its foundation date on a blue enamel ring. The badge is suspended by an enameled laurel and oak wreath.\n\nThe star (or plaque) is worn by the Grand Cross (in gilt on the left chest) and the Grand Officer (in silver on the right chest) respectively; it is similar to the badge, but without enamel, and with the wreath replaced by a cluster of rays in between each arm. Since the establishment of the Legion, the Grand Master of the order has always been the Emperor, King or President of France. President Emmanuel Macron became the Grand Master of the Legion on 14 May 2017."}, {"url": "https://www.legiondhonneur.fr/en/page/military-medal/398", "page_content": "The Military Medal is the highest French military honor for Non-Commissioned Officers and soldiers.\n\nA reward for extraordinary exploits or long years spent in the army, its motto is \"Value and discipline\".\n\nOften called \u201cthe Non- Commissioned Officer (NCOs\u2019) Legion of Honor,\u201d the Military Medal is the third highest French decoration in the order of precedence, after the Order of the Legion of Honor and the Order of Liberation.\n\nAward criteria\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Arm\u00e9e de Terre\n\n\n\nBeing enlisted in the armed forces for at least eight years\n\nHaving been cited in army dispatches\n\nHaving been wounded in combat or on duty\n\nHaving been distinguished by an act of courage and devotion\n\nIn addition, any application must be based on established merits.\n\nThe Military Medal may be awarded to foreigners.\n\nFor the general public, this decoration is often associated with the military ceremonies that take place notably in the courtyard of the Invalides, in the presence of the President of the Republic, to honor deserving soldiers or soldiers killed in foreign operations, as in recent decades in Chad, Afghanistan or Mali.\n\nThe Military Medal by the numbers\n\nApproximately 2,700 French and 30 foreigners receive the Military Medal each year\n\nMore than a million soldiers and NCOs were decorated in a century and a half of existence\n\n148,000 living military personnel, often veterans, hold the Military Medal\n\nMore than 10,000 women have received the Military Medal since 1859\n\n10 emblems of regiments are decorated\n\nThe Military Medal in history\n\n\n\nEmperor Napoleon III \u00a9 MLH\n\n\n\nThe Military Medal was established by the Prince President, future Napoleon III, 50 years after the Legion of Honor, on January 22, 1852.

Everything changed with the second induction ceremony, on May 10, 1852. That day, Louis Napoleon decorated 1,705 soldiers and NCOs in front of 80,000 soldiers and a huge crowd of Parisians gathered on the Champ de Mars.\n\nBut above all, that day, he displayed great acumen in pinning the decoration onto the uniforms of two new Marshals of France, as a \"supreme reward.\" This initiative, later extended to generals and Admirals for exceptional services, ensured the prestige of the Military Medal forever.\n\nThis is highly symbolic: the humblest soldiers and greatest war leaders are gathered on an equal footing under the same motto: \"Valor and Discipline.\" Since then, the history of the Military Medal has merged with that of the major conflicts of the twentieth century:\n\nWorld War I: 950.000 medals awarded, most posthumously\n\nWorld War II: 300,000 medals\n\nIndochina War: 12,000 medals\n\nAlgerian War: 38,000 medals\n\nFamed Medal holders\n\n\n\nWinston Churchill receiving the Military Medal at the Invalides on May 10, 1947 \u00a9 MLH\n\n\n\nGrand Marshals and Generals: Joffre, Foch, Gallieni, Leclerc, de Lattre de Tassigny, Juin, Lyautey\n\nForeign Generals: Pershing, Eisenhower, Marshal Montgomery\n\nExceptionally, Heads of State and Government: Sir Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt\n\nWar heroes: Airman Georges Guynemer, resistance fighter Jean Moulin\n\nThe pennant of the 3rd company of the 1st RCP (Parachute Chasseur Regiment), decorated in Lebanon in 1983, after the loss of 58 soldiers in an attack.\n\nAwarding and administering the Military Medal\n\nThe Medal is proposed by the Ministry of Defense and approved by the Council of the Order of the Legion of Honor, which is also involved in disciplinary matters.

Crisp, a New Castle resident and a veteran of the Army Air Corps in World War II, was recently awarded the French Legion of Honor for his service in France during that war.\n\nThe French Legion of Honor is an order of distinction first established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. It is the highest decoration bestowed in France. Foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds may receive a distinction from the Legion of Honor. American veterans who risked their lives during World War II and fought on French territory qualify to be decorated as Knights of the Legion of Honor. Veterans must have fought in one of the four main campaigns of the Liberation of France: Normandy, Provence, Ardennes or Northern France.\n\nCarl served in the Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1945. He flew thirty-five missions as a flight radio operator and gunner, including missions in the Ardennes and other locations. Carl was part of the American forces which fought the Germans and liberated France from the Nazi occupation.\n\nSixty-five people gathered on Saturday, Aug. 1, at the Henry County Historical Society to witness the presentation of the medal to Crisp. Those gathered included an honor guard provided by American Legion Post 137 and VFW Post 1282, a number of veterans from several branches of service and service dates, and local dignitaries including New Castle Mayor Greg York, Henry County commissioners Butch Baker and Kim Cronk, County Councilman Richard Bouslog and State Representative Tom Saunders.\n\nCarl and his wife Rachel were joined by daughters Diane Merki, Debra Bierk, Janna Anderson, and granddaughter Katelyn Bierk for the ceremony.

If so, you may be entitled to receive France's highest distinction.\n\nAhead of Remembrance Day, the consulate general of France in Vancouver has put out a call for Canadian veterans who took part in the Dieppe Raid in 1942 or the battles to liberate France in 1944 as they may be eligible for France's National Order of the Legion of Honour.\n\nThe Dieppe Raid in August 1942 had been an unsuccessful attempt by the Allies to get a foothold in France. Nearly 5,000 out of the 6,000 Allied troops that participated in the operation were Canadian. More than half of these men were killed, wounded or captured, and the operation ended in a Nazi victory.\n\nHowever, the lessons learned at Dieppe that set the foundation for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. On June 6, 1944, 14,000 Canadian soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy alongside Allied troops, setting the stage for the liberation of France.\n\nVeterans who participated in these battles could be eligible to receive the France's highest order of merit.\n\n\"It's essential to pay tribute, to recognize their commitment, express our gratitude to them so that we don't forget their commitments,\" Nicolas Baudouin, the French consul general in Vancouver, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe Legion of Honour was first created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 for civilians and military personnel who have demonstrated \"eminent service\" for France.\n\n\"Without any consideration of your background, your military ranks \u2026 if you show bravery and commitment, you're entitled to be awarded the Legion of Honour,\" said Baudouin. \"The only condition is that that you actually serve the French Republic, and that's what these Canadian veterans did when they landed in France.\"\n\nIn 2014, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of D-Day, the French government launched a campaign to identify and award surviving Canadian veterans who participated in the liberation of France. Similar campaigns also took place for American, British and New Zealand veterans.\n\nSo far, 1,154 Canadian veterans have received the honour, although Baudouin said it's unclear how many eligible veterans are remaining. The most recent Canadian recipient was 98-year-old D-Day veteran Joseph Novak of Whitehorse, who received the honour last month.\n\nIf you or someone you know who is eligible, Baudouin said you can contact your nearest French consulate, reach out to Veterans Affairs Canada or get in touch with your local Royal Canadian Legion branch."}]}
