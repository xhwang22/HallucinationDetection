{"Paul Caddis was part of the team that won the Football League Trophy in 2014.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50504541", "page_content": "Is Watford striker Troy Deeney's goal against Leicester in the 2013 Championship play-off semi-final the most iconic EFL goal from the past decade?\n\nAs the decade draws to a close, BBC Sport is reflecting on the past 10 years in the English Football League.\n\nFrom Troy Deeney breaking Leicester City hearts, to Paul Caddis saving Birmingham City and Paolo di Canio managing Swindon Town - it's been eventful.\n\nPart one of our look back focuses on the most memorable on-pitch moments in the Championship, League One and League Two.\n\nThe play-offs\n\nThere's nothing quite like the play-offs for drama and the final minute at Vicarage Road as Watford hosted Leicester City in the second leg of their Championship play-off semi-final in 2013 might be the most dramatic of the lot.\n\nWith the scores tied at 2-2 on aggregate, Leicester were awarded a controversial late penalty when Anthony Knockaert went down in the area. Knockaert took responsibility for the kick, only for Manuel Almunia to deny him from the spot and on the rebound.\n\nWith their opponents reeling, the Hornets launched an immediate counter-attack that ended with Jonathan Hogg heading down a deep cross for the onrushing Troy Deeney to thump past a despairing Kasper Schmeichel in the Foxes goal and send the home side to Wembley.\n\nCue complete pandemonium as home fans and manager Gianfranco Zola stormed onto the pitch, with the Italian taking a spectacular tumble just to round the madness off.\n\nAnthony Knockaert recovered from his penalty heartbreak to win promotion from the Championship twice - with Leicester in 2014 and Brighton in 2017\n\nThat wasn't the only penalty woe the Foxes had in the play-offs this decade.\n\nTheir Championship play-off semi-final against Cardiff City went to spot-kicks in 2010.\n\nThe first six were all successful before French striker Yann Kermorgant stepped up for Nigel Pearson's men. Kermorgant had scored just once in 25 appearances since his arrival from his homeland the previous August so quite what had given him the confidence to try a Panenka penalty is a mystery.\n\nNeedless to say it was not successful, as the ball floated gently into the grateful arms of Bluebirds goalkeeper David Marshall. Mark Kennedy then put the home side in front before Marshall denied Martyn Waghorn.\n\nThe League One play-off final between Sheffield United and Huddersfield in May 2012 might not live long in the memory for anything of note in the goalless 120 minutes, but the penalty shoot-out at the end was some reward for neutrals who stuck with it.\n\nThe Terriers missed their first three kicks to leave their Yorkshire rivals on the verge of promotion to the second tier, only for Danny Wilson's side to lose their nerve when it mattered most.\n\nIt came down to the goalkeepers and, after Town's Alex Smithies confidently slammed home, opposite number Steve Simonsen sent his effort into the Huddersfield fans behind the goal to send Simon Grayson's men up.\n\nLast-day drama\n\nMarcello Trotta's penalty will live long in the memory of Brentford and Doncaster fans - for very different reasons\n\nOne thing was for sure when third-placed Brentford hosted second-placed Doncaster on the final day of the League One season in April 2013; one of them would end up celebrating promotion, while the play-offs would beckon for the other.\n\nAfter a cagey 90 minutes the hosts were dramatically awarded a penalty in the final minute of time added on. Young Fulham loanee Marcello Trotta stood up to take it, knowing a goal would send the Bees into the second tier for the first time in 20 years.\n\nHowever, the Italian smashed his spot-kick against the Rovers crossbar and, after a scramble, the visitors cleared the ball to the safety of striker Billy Paynter on the halfway line.\n\nWith no Bees player in the same postcode as him and with time almost up, Paynter headed towards goal before rolling the ball across the six-yard box where Rovers legend James Coppinger tapped home from all of two yards out in front of the jubilant Doncaster fans.\n\nPaul Caddis' goal saved Birmingham from relegation to League One in 2014\n\nJust over a year later, Rovers were at the opposite end of the last-day emotion spectrum.\n\nThey travelled to runaway champions Leicester needing only to match Birmingham City's result at Bolton to stay in the second tier.\n\nWith 76 minutes on the clock the South Yorkshire side trailed 1-0 but, with Blues 2-0 down, safety seemed to be assured.\n\nA Nikola Zigic goal gave Blues some hope and, with time almost up, defender Paul Caddis headed home from three yards out to send 3,500 travelling Blues fans wild and consign Doncaster to relegation on goal difference.\n\nStarted from the bottom...\n\nEddie Howe guided Bournemouth to promotion from League Two up to the Premier League between 2010 and 2015\n\nOn 2 January 2010, Eddie Howe's Bournemouth fell to a 2-0 home defeat by Northampton Town in League Two.\n\nDespite the disappointing result they were second in the fourth tier, already looking set to make a major improvement on the previous season where a 17-point deduction had left them scrapping for Football League survival.\n\nThe Cherries ended the season in second spot to seal promotion to League One.\n\nThree years later, they went up to the second tier for the first time since 1987, with boss Howe, back for a second spell after a brief stint as Burnley boss, saying leading the club to the Championship \"meant the world\" to him.\n\nHowe was celebrating promotion once again in 2015 as Bournemouth improbably secured their place in the Premier League for the first time.\n\nA 14-game unbeaten run, which included an 8-0 win at Birmingham City, between October and December saw them top the table at the turn of the year and despite late pressure from a resurgent Norwich they held on to reach the top flight, where they have remained ever since.\n\nIt might not quite compare with Bournemouth's rapid rise through the leagues, but Norwich have managed to cram a lot into the past 10 years.\n\nThe Canaries won promotion from League One to the Championship in 2009-10 and secured back-to-back promotions the following campaign to reach the Premier League.\n\nRelegated back to the Championship in 2014, they immediately went back up again in 2015, only to be relegated once more in 2016.\n\nThey won their fourth promotion of the decade last season as they stormed to the Championship title under Daniel Farke.\n\nCurrent Premier League sides Sheffield United, Wolves, Brighton and Southampton all played in the third tier at some stage this decade.\n\nUnlikely promotions\n\nBlackpool boss Ian Holloway celebrates leading Blackpool to the Premier League with a 3-2 play-off final win over Cardiff in 2010\n\nBlackpool - With one of the smallest budgets in the division, Ian Holloway worked miracles to guide the Seasiders to promotion to the Premier League with a play-off final victory over Cardiff City in May 2010.\n\nHuddersfield - The Terriers defied the odds to secure their first ever promotion to the Premier League under German boss David Wagner in May 2017, just one season after finishing 19th in the Championship.\n\nYeovil - It might seem fanciful now the Glovers are a non-league side once more, but in 2013 Gary Johnson guided the Somerset club to the second tier for the first time in their history with a 2-1 play-off final win over Brentford.\n\nBurton - The Brewers won promotion to League One in 2015 and their inaugural season in the third tier went rather better than expected as the Staffordshire side made light of losing boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to QPR to go up to the Championship under Nigel Clough.\n\nAccrington - Despite having the second smallest attendance in the EFL, Stanley won promotion to the third tier for the first time in their history in 2018 under legendary boss John Coleman.\n\nPaul Scholes was Oldham boss?!\n\nPaul Scholes played more than 700 times for Manchester United during his playing career but lasted just 31 days as Oldham boss\n\nYes, among a few surprising EFL appointments in the decade, the former England and Manchester United man spent 31 days in charge of the League Two Latics in 2019.\n\nSol Campbell enjoyed rather more success in his time as Macclesfield boss, helping the Silkmen to avoid relegation to the National League in his first managerial posting.\n\nPaolo di Canio's 21-month spell as Swindon manager was certainly eventful, with the Italian leading them to promotion to League One in his only full season before resigning in February 2013.\n\nDuring his time in the County Ground hotseat, the former West Ham forward had a public fall-out with striker Leon Clarke, called goalkeeper Wes Foderingham \"the worst professional he had ever seen\" before a quick reconciliation, and claimed he had done \"a fantastic job\" to get the team promoted.\n\nSome eyebrows were raised when Derby appointed Frank Lampard as manager in June 2018 but he helped the Rams to the Championship play-off final before leaving to take over at Chelsea after defeat by Aston Villa at Wembley.\n\nOne surprise Championship hiring that didn't work out so well was David Hockaday's spell in charge of Leeds.\n\nThe former Forest Green manager was controversial owner Massimo Cellino's first appointment as head coach at Elland Road, despite never having managed in the Football League before. He was sacked after just six games."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52416192", "page_content": "The 1970 FA Cup final was watched by a UK television audience of 28.5m\n\nEddie Gray collects the ball in the centre circle and immediately sets his sights on Chelsea\u2019s goal. But David Webb has other ideas. Fuelled by fresh memories of his roasting at the hands of the Leeds winger a couple of weeks prior, the defender hits him, both feet off the ground, no prisoners. Bang.\n\nIt takes all of two minutes for the 1970 FA Cup final replay to live up to its billing as a game best avoided by the faint of heart.\n\nIt is a match that has gone down in football folklore as a meeting of pure malice between a defeated Leeds United side renowned for having the muscle to match their magnificence and a victorious Chelsea team with flashiness and ferocity in equal measure.\n\nFootball was a very different game half a century ago, when much greater leniency was shown to crunching, full-bloodied tackles and their aftermath. But even by the standards of the time it made for brutal viewing.\n\nSuch is its enduring reputation, it has been re-refereed twice since by leading officials according to modern interpretations of the rules. In 1997, David Elleray concluded he would have shown six red cards, while this year Michael Oliver opted for 11. external-link\n\nOn the night, referee Eric Jennings brandished just one yellow card.\n\nIn the week of the game\u2019s 50th anniversary, in a month that has seen the loss of two of its beloved protagonists - Peter Bonetti and Norman Hunter - BBC Sport looks back at one of the most notorious encounters in English football history.\n\n\u2018A special sort of animosity\u2019\n\n\u201cPrevious\u201d. This is the polite phrase many of the 1970 final\u2019s participants use to explain the history and lasting grievances being carried into the game at Old Trafford.\n\nOn a grander scale, Leeds-Chelsea was the north-south divide personified. The Blues were seen as the fashionable southern fancy-dans, who hung out drinking champagne with celebrities on the King's Road, while the Whites were perceived as the dour, gritty northerners, smoking cigarettes and playing carpet bowls in their working men's club.\n\nIn truth, the two sides were more alike than they would have been willing to admit - both a blend of brute force and brilliance, each driven and on the way up. This perhaps partly accounts for their bitter rivalry.\n\n\"The rivalry was there because Leeds had a name, a reputation as being dirty,\u201d said Bonetti, in an interview with the Chelsea website in 2018. external-link \u201cI'd call them physical because dirty doesn't sound a very nice word. We matched them in the physical side of things because we had our own players who were physical and that was probably why we were such big rivals. We weren't unalike in the way we played.\"\n\nIn his autobiography, Leeds midfielder Johnny Giles attests to \u201ca special sort of animosity\u201d between the teams.\n\n\u201cI had that bit of \u2018previous\u2019 with Eddie McCreadie,\u201d added Giles. \u201cJohn Hollins, who would usually mark me, could do a bit. And Ron \u2018Chopper\u2019 Harris had made a name for himself.\u201d\n\nChelsea striker Ian Hutchinson put it more simply: \u201cWe hated them and they hated us.\u201d\n\nChelsea had beaten Leeds in controversial circumstances in a 1967 FA Cup semi-final\n\nLeeds still carried lasting scars from their 1967 FA Cup semi-final defeat by the Blues, in which they felt they had a perfectly good Peter Lorimer free-kick ruled out.\n\nIn the 1969-70 season alone they faced each other six times, with Leeds winning both league games, including a 5-2 win at Stamford Bridge, and the Blues coming out on top over two games in a League Cup third-round tie.\n\nThere were also individual scores to be settled, with one of the freshest that between Webb and Gray. Leeds\u2019 Scottish winger had given the Chelsea full-back an absolute chasing in the drawn final at Wembley that prompted the replay.\n\nThe Whites had largely dominated but somehow failed to win on a national stadium surface buried under a mountain of sand, in an attempt to make it playable following poor weather.\n\nWebb was switched to centre-back for the replay to get him away from Gray and give Harris the task of keeping the winger quiet, but fate drew the two back together almost immediately and gave the Chelsea man a chance to make his mark.\n\nThis he did, about halfway up Gray\u2019s left shin.\n\nReferees looked very different back in 1970\n\nBy 2020 standards, this would have earned Webb a first yellow, according to Oliver. His second would follow 12 minutes later for another late, two-footed lunge, this time on Alan Clarke deep in his own half, and a third in extra time. But back in 1970, Jennings kept his whistle from his lips and cards firmly in his pocket.\n\nFurther seemingly clear offences came and went without punishment - Billy Bremner sent spinning from the field by Peter Houseman, Hunter and McCreadie coming to blows, a foot left in by Clarke.\n\nAs renowned Observer journalist Hugh McIlvanney wrote afterwards: \u201cAt times, it appeared that Mr Jennings would give a free-kick only on production of a death certificate.\u201d\n\nWebb recalled later to the Daily Mail: external-link \u201cEvery time he went for his pocket and you thought he was going to book somebody he pulled out his hanky, blew his nose and said, \u2018Get on with it, will you?'\u201d\n\nHarris would more or less finish the job on Gray before the first half was out, catching the winger on the back of his left knee, leaving him with an injury that restricted him for the remainder of the game and crucially robbed Leeds of arguably their most talented attacking player.\n\nEver the hatchet man, Harris would attempt to do the same to Gray\u2019s left-wing colleague Terry Cooper in the second half but succeeded only in tearing right through his shorts.\n\nYears later, Gray was enjoying himself at a black-tie dinner when Harris tapped him on the shoulder, put his hand out and, with a grin, asked: \"Can I have my studs back?\"\n\n\u2018Bites Yer Legs\u2019 and \u2018The Cat\u2019\n\nLeeds recently renamed their South Stand after Norman Hunter\n\nIf Harris\u2019 reputation preceded him, so too did the man at the heart of the Leeds defence, Norman Hunter.\n\nIt would be two more years before the infamous banner that read \u2018Norman Bites Yer Legs\u2019 would be held aloft by Leeds fans at the 1972 FA Cup final, but his uncompromising style was well-publicised.\n\nHis first touch in the 1970 replay - a throw-in - is conducted to a chorus of boos from the Chelsea fans. His second meaningful involvement would provoke a fiercer response.\n\nAfter relinquishing possession following a forward run, Hunter and McCreadie come together in midfield, leading to a brief flurry of post-challenge blows between the two.\n\nLater in the game, the Leeds defender is seen prowling following another heavy challenge, fists clenched and ready for battle.\n\nFor many, this is the indelible image of Hunter on the pitch, but one that does a huge disservice to a player with silk to match the steel, who won 28 England caps and was part of the 1966 World Cup-winning squad aged 22.\n\nIt was certainly not representative of the man - a warm, generous and beloved figure, the death of whom on 17 April was deeply felt not just at Leeds but across the football world.\n\n\u201cI worked with him on the after-dinner circuit,\u201d Harris told the Mail. \u201cOn the field he was an animal, but away from the football you won\u2019t meet a nicer fella, a gentleman.\u201d\n\nBonetti required lengthy treatment in the 1970 replay following a class with Jones\n\nJust five days prior to Hunter\u2019s death, Chelsea lost one of their own all-time heroes in Bonetti, whose influence over the 240 minutes of the 1970 final is perhaps greater than any other.\n\nHis heroics in goal in the first game at Wembley was one of the main reasons for the replay, but even this stellar performance was overshadowed by the fortitude he demonstrated at Old Trafford.\n\nIn the 31st minute he suffered a painful knee injury in a fiercely contested aerial duel with Leeds forward Mick Jones - one that required lengthy treatment and prompted BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme to comment: \u201cThis almost deserves an X-certificate\u201d. He emerged after half-time heavily strapped and unable to take goal-kicks.\n\nJones would take advantage almost immediately after the injury by giving Leeds the lead, but Bonetti would have the last laugh, living up to his reputation as 'The Cat' by launching off his one good leg to make a string of important saves.\n\nFittingly, Bonetti - the foundation on which Chelsea\u2019s first Cup final triumph was built and a revered figure in their history - collected the base of the trophy at its presentation.\n\nA karate kick and Big Jack's little black book\n\nJack Charlton (centre) remains Leeds' record appearance-maker with 773\n\nAs the game wore on and the light faded above Old Trafford, the violence taking place on its pitch only increased.\n\nPeter Osgood fouled Jack Charlton, who immediately leapt to his feet and barged the striker to the turf - an immediate act of retribution that the Leeds centre-back usually saved for his infamous little black book of future victims. external-link\n\nIt was another attempted act of revenge from Charlton that cost Leeds their lead with the defender leaving Osgood unmarked to score as he went off in search of a Chelsea player who had whacked his thigh moments earlier.\n\nThe most brutal moment of all, though, came in the 85th minute.\n\nBilly Bremner, Leeds\u2019 brilliant midfield heartbeat, always gave as good as he got, but in 1970 he was a clear target for the Chelsea players.\n\nIt was for a shove on the Scot that Hutchinson earned the game\u2019s only booking, sparking a running battle between the two for the remainder of the game that saw late tackles, retaliatory kicks and some expressive hand gestures from each.\n\nIt would be McCreadie, though, who would strike the biggest blow, leaping high into the air in the box, missing the bouncing ball and performing a karate kick to the head that \u201calmost cut Bremner in half\u201d according to Blues defender John Dempsey. Jennings, in his final game as a professional referee, waved play on.\n\nThe 1970 win was the first of Chelsea's eight FA Cup victories to date\n\nHutchinson and Webb would have the decisive say and ultimately win the war for Chelsea in extra time, with the former\u2019s booming long throw making its way to the back post off the head of Charlton for the latter to nod home.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw the Leeds players, I knew I could celebrate,\u201d Webb told the Mail. \u201cLeeds would complain about anything. If there was any reason to claim a foul, they\u2019d have been doing it and they weren\u2019t complaining, they were deflated.\u201d\n\nFor Chelsea it represented an historic first FA Cup win and would lead to more silverware in the following season\u2019s European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup.\n\nFor Leeds it was an agonising near miss in a season full of them, coming in a month that saw a second successive league title slip from their grasp and a European Cup challenge end at the hands of Celtic in the semi-finals.\n\nWith scars healed and fury subsided, much has been said about the 1970 FA Cup final replay in the 50 years since by those who played in or witnessed it. Perhaps the most revealing comment belongs to Leeds\u2019 Paul Madeley: \u201cIt was just the way the game was played back then.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/paul-caddis", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nPaul Caddis was born on 19 April, 1988 in Irvine.

He moved to Arsenal and spent four years in north London before retiring in 2019 after he lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final.\n\nCech has dabbled in ice hockey since then, honing his goalkeeping skills in the rink, and has since returned to Chelsea where he now works as a technical/performance advisor and an emergency goalkeeper.\n\nJose Bosingwa\n\nOne of the more contentious members of the Chelsea starting XI, Jose Bosingwa left Chelsea after the Champions League win.\n\nHe moved to Queens Park Rangers and was a part of their infamous relegation campaign from the Premier League in the 2012/13 season.\n\nBosingwa retired in 2016 when he was playing in Turkey.\n\nDavid Luiz\n\nWith captain John Terry suspended, David Luiz led the backline alongside Gary Cahill. The oft-maligned Brazilian is not known for back-to-the-wall defensive performances, but Chelsea certainly provided one on this occasion.\n\nLuiz remained with Chelsea until 2014 when he moved to Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a350million, the highest fee for a defender at the time.\n\nTwo years later, Luiz was back at the club. He remained until 2019 until he left for a second time, signing with Arsenal as Frank Lampard deemed him surplus to requirements. Luiz remains at Arsenal.\n\nClick for Sound Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now Thomas Tuchel - Every change is for a reason\n\nGary Cahill\n\nSigned midway through the 2011/12 season from Bolton, Gary Cahill became one of Chelsea's most decorated and celebrated players. As well as the Champions League, he went on to win two Premier League titles, two FA Cups, two Europa League titles, and a League Cup.\n\nCahill was moved on in 2019 after being frozen out by Maurizio Sarri. He signed with Crystal Palace, where he remains ever-present under Roy Hodgson having made 38 league appearances since the start of the 2019/20 season.\n\n(Image: Photo credit should read ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/GettyImages)\n\nAshley Cole\n\nOne of the most decorated English players in the sport, Ashley Cole moved to Roma in the 2014 summer after losing his place to Cesar Azpilicueta.\n\nHe spent 18 months in Italy before moving to the LA Galaxy.\n\nHe then spent half a season at Derby under Lampard, retiring after the play-off final defeat to Aston Villa, where none other than Terry was stood in the dugout as Dean Smith's assistant.\n\nCole was brought to work as an academy coach at Chelsea by Lampard and also has done some punditry work on Sky Sports.\n\nFrank Lampard\n\nPerhaps the most obvious post-playing trajectory, Lampard left Chelsea as a player in 2014. He initially signed a two-year contract with New York City FC to begin playing in January 2015.\n\nHowever, it was later revealed that he never signed an official contract. Instead, he spent the 2014/15 season with Manchester City, the parent club of the MLS' second New York franchise.\n\nLampard did eventually join NYCFC at the end of the 2014/15 season. He endured a difficult time in America and retired in February 2017 having spent just 18 months in New York.\n\nLampard subsequently moved into coaching. He spent one season with Derby, leading them to the playoff final, before then replacing Sarri at Chelsea.\n\nHe spent just over 18 months as Chelsea head coach before being sacked earlier this season, with Thomas Tuchel replacing the former midfielder.\n\nJohn Obi Mikel\n\nJohn Obi Mikel remained with Chelsea until the 2016/17 season. however, after falling out of the first team, he eventually moved to Chinese side Tianjin TEDA in January 2017 on a free transfer.\n\nMikel spent two years in China before signing a six-month contract with Middlesbrough in the Championship.\n\nHis time under Tony Pulis was short-lived. He signed with Turkish side Trabzonspor at the end of the 2018/19 season, only to leave nine months later due to concerns that play was continuing amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the summer, he signed a free-agent deal with Stoke City. He has made 30 appearances in all competitions this season.\n\nClick for Sound Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now Thomas Tuchel's verdict on Chelsea 2 Everton 0\n\nRyan Bertrand\n\nA young left-back thrust in at left midfield making his Champions League debut symbolised the haphazard, underdog nature of Chelsea's XI that day. But that is the role that Ryan Bertrand filled admirably.\n\nBertrand was never quite able to establish himself as Cole's successor at left-back. He eventually left Chelsea in 2014, signing on loan with Southampton.\n\nHe then made that switch a permanent one and has since gone on to prove his Premier League quality, making north of 200 appearances for the Saints.\n\n(Image: Photo by Popperfoto via Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nJuan Mata\n\nIt is easy to forget just how sensational Juan Mata was between 2011 and 2013. Chelsea's Player of the Season for his first two campaigns at the club, Jose Mourinho's return in 2013 ended any chance of the flair midfielder shining.\n\nSix months after Mourinho's arrival, Mata was moved on, signing with Manchester United in a \u00a337million deal.\n\nMata remains at United, though now only plays a squad role. He has made north of 250 appearances for the club.\n\nSalomon Kalou\n\nA reliable and versatile back-up, Salamon Kalou was surprisingly released by Chelsea after the 2012 Champions League triumph.\n\nThe winger signed with French club Lille on a free transfer. He spent two seasons there, scoring 30 league goals in 67 games.\n\nHe then moved to Hertha Berlin, averaging around a goal every three games over the five seasons he spent there.\n\nIn July 2020, Kalou signed an 18-month contract with Brazilian side Botafogo where he continues to ply his trade.\n\nDidier Drogba\n\nThe man for the moment, Didier Drogba's final kick of a ball in a Chelsea shirt before his return later in the decade was his Champions League-winning penalty. If this night was anyone's, it was Drogba's.\n\nThe legendary centre-forward moved to China, then signed with Galatasaray in 2013.

He also coached Sabail's U19 team.\n\nEssien now works as a coach with Danish team FC Nordsjaelland.\n\nPaulo Ferreira\n\nPaulo Ferreira was already in the twilight of his career by this point. At the end of the 2012/13 season, he retired from playing but remained with the club.\n\nSince then, he has worked in a number of different coaching, scouting and ambassadorial roles with Chelsea.\n\nAt present, Ferreira works as Chelsea's Loan Player Technical Coach.\n\nOriol Romeu\n\nA hugely gifted midfielder whose career was undermined by a vicious knee injury, Oriol Romeu never quite made it at Chelsea.\n\nHe spent the 2013/14 season on loan at Valencia. He then spent the 2014/15 season on loan at Stuttgart before signing with Southampton in 2015 in a \u00a35m deal.\n\nRomeu has since found his footing on the south coast, making over 200 appearances for the club. He is currently a first-team regular under Ralph Hasenhuttl.\n\n(Image: Photo By Tommy Hindley/Professional Sport/Popperfoto via Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nFlorent Malouda\n\nFlorent Malouda, like Kalou, was a versatile and reliable attacking player who was an ever-present and consistent servant for Chelsea over the year.\n\nMalouda's time at the club ended on a sour note. He endured a difficult 2011/12 season and attempted to force an exit in the summer. He was eventually released in 2013.\n\nFollowing his exit, he spent time in Turkey, France, India, and Luxembourg, retiring in the latter country. He then joined Zurich as a coach in early 2019 but was released after just two months.\n\nDaniel Sturridge\n\nSold to Liverpool in the 2012 summer window, Daniel Sturridge left Chelsea soon after the Champions League victory.\n\nSturridge initially thrived at Liverpool, forming a brilliant attacking triumvirate with Raheem Sterling and Luis Suarez.\n\nInjuries have since struck and Sturridge has struggled to ever rediscover his best form.\n\nHe spent six months on loan at West Brom to close out the 2018/18 season, pulling his hamstring against Chelsea in his third appearance for the club.\n\nSturridge eventually left Liverpool in 2019. He signed a three-year deal with Trabzonspor and scored seven goals in 16 appearances before being released in March 2020.\n\nIt was then revealed that he had been handed a four-month worldwide ban for breaching betting rules. Sturridge remains without a club.\n\nSign up to our Chelsea newsletter for the latest transfer news In each football.london Chelsea bulletin, we'll be bringing you the latest breaking news, transfer features and comment pieces, as well as the key talking points for fans.

The move was made permanent just six months int the two-year period before being loaned to Atletico Madrid two days later.\n\nTorres spent the 2015/16 season on loan in Madrid too before signing with the Spanish side on a permanent basis.

Who has won the most different top flights?\" wonders Patrick William O'Riordan.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of players who, like Robben, have won the top flight in four different countries. Deco did it in Portugal, Spain, England and Brazil; Mark van Bommel won it in the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Italy; Jiri Jarosik recorded his four in Czech Republic, Russia, England, Scotland); while Rivaldo has a league medal from Brazil, Spain, Greece, Uzbekistan.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic won the Dutch title with Ajax in 2001-02 as well as in 2003-04; he won the Serie A from 2004-05 to 2008-09 with Juventus and then Internazionale \u2013 although the first two of these were revoked due to the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal \u2013 and he won it with Milan in 2010-11. In between those victories with the Milanese clubs, he won the La Liga title in his solitary season at Barcelona. And with Paris Saint-Germain nine points clear with five games to play, he could soon be added to the list of those who have won four.\n\nSo while a few players are stuck on four, Mateja Kezman has come closest to winning a fifth. The striker won his first league title in the 1998-99 season when playing in the Yugoslavian top-flight for Partizan Belgrade. His second came two season later when he was in the same PSV Eindhoven that took the Eredivisie two seasons in a row. The next one came when he was part of the Chelsea team that won the Premier League with a record 95 points in 2004-05 before he moved to Fenerbahce, following a season with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he won the Turkish title in 2006-07. Finally, Kezman was part of the Bate Borisov side that won the league in 2011 but since he only made six league appearances that season it seems unlikely that he was awarded a medal for that championship despite him being part of the squad and so he is stuck on four with the rest of the gang.\n\nOthers worth mentioning are David Beckham who has three \u2013 England, Spain and the US \u2013 and possibly a fourth provided PSG win Ligue 1 and he makes enough appearances. Yaya Tour\u00e9 has three with Olympiacos, Barcelona and Manchester City \u2013 the midfielder was with ASEC Mimosas in Ivory Coast when they won the title in 2001 but he was only a youth player at the time so the title does not count. Also in the three title club is the current Swansea manger, Michael Laudrup (Italy, Spain and the Netherlands) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (England, Spain and the Netherlands).\n\nThanks to Kriz Walsh, Yuval Weber, Luis Mazariegos and Jachym Vintr\n\nBANNED FROM DEFENDING A TROPHY OR TITLE\n\n\"Conceivably (at least until last Tuesday), M\u00e1laga could have won the Champions League without being able to contend the trophy next year due to a Uefa ban. Has any team ever won a trophy only to be unable to defend their title because of a banning order?\" asks Craig Fawcett.\n\nWith 49 minutes gone in the Camp Nou, Rangers were three goals to the good and cruising to the 1972 European Cup Winners Cup title. Two goals from the Dynamo Moscow duo of Vladimir Eshtrekov and Aleksandr Makhovikov meant that cruise turned into a storm-tossed second-half but the Glasgow club held on for victory. \"However,\" says Robbie Devine, \"following a pitch invasion in which Rangers fans fought with Franco's facist police force, the Gers support being cheered on by the Catalan locals, Uefa imposed a two year ban on the club competing in any European tourney. But after an appeal led by the general manager Willie Waddell the ban was reduced to just the one season.\"\n\nBut Rangers are not the only British team to be unable to defend their title. \"One sort-of example would be Everton who won the Cup Winners Cup in 1985,\" says Mitchell Sandler. \"They wouldn't have defended the trophy as they were league champions that year and so would have been in the European Cup the following season. As it was the Heysel disaster led to a blanket ban on English teams in Europe.\"\n\nMarseille can also be numbered among the clubs who were unable to defend their trophy as Mark Wilson points out. \"Marseille received a European ban after winning the European Cup following shenanigans in a French league match. They were allowed to keep the European title but banned from the following season's competition as well as the Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup.\"\n\nAny more for any more?

In 1991, a round-robin stage or group stage was introduced and multiple teams from a country were allowed to play in the UCL from the 1997-98 season, thereby expanding the number of teams in the tournament.\n\nAs it stands, the main draw of the UEFA Champions League starts with 32 teams, divided into eight groups, playing in a double round-robin group stage.

So at least there\u2019s that...\n\nNwankwo Kanu (Ajax 1995/West Brom 2006)\n\n\u2018King Kanu\u2019 was integral to Ajax\u2019s 1995 Champions League success. He scored a spectacular diving header to open the scoring in the Dutch side\u2019s quarter-final win over Dinamo Zagreb, and came off the bench in the final to help the Amsterdam giants to a famous 1-0 win over Milan.\n\nEleven years later, however, it was an altogether different story. The Nigerian\u2019s wastefulness in front of goal contributed to a miserable season for West Brom, who were relegated with two games to spare. The highs and lows continued at Kanu\u2019s next club Portsmouth where, incredibly, he won the FA Cup before suffering back-to-back relegations from the Premier League and Championship.\n\nRio Ferdinand (Manchester United 2008/QPR 2015)\n\nHarry Redknapp looked to have pulled off a wheeler-dealer bargain in 2014 after convincing Ferdinand to join newly-promoted QPR. The former Manchester United man had won 14 trophies during his 12 years at Old Trafford, including the 2008 Champions League, and was seen as the ideal man to marshal Rangers' ramshackle defence.\n\nBut Ferdinand was a shadow of his former self, battling the personal tragedy of losing his wife Rebecca to cancer. Redknapp tried out a variety of formations to try to accommodate Ferdinand\u2019s fading talents, but to no avail. The ex-West Ham chief resigned that season and QPR finished bottom, shipping 10 more goals than any other side that term. Ferdinand retired that summer.\n\nNicky Butt (Manchester United 1999/Newcastle 2009)\n\nButt was a dependable squad player under Sir Alex Ferguson, but Roy Keane\u2019s suspension meant he started Manchester United\u2019s memorable 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League Final. Butt won 10 major trophies during his time at Old Trafford, but left for Newcastle in 2004 in search of first-team football.\n\nIt proved to be a difficult transition, though, with injury and the sudden sacking of manager Sir Bobby Robson curtailing Butt\u2019s initial impact on Tyneside. Newcastle were in terminal decline by the time he returned to contention, culminating in their relegation from the Premier League in 2009. Butt played on for another season, though, helping the Magpies return to the top flight before hanging up his boots.\n\nFabrizio Ravanelli (Juventus 1996/Middlesbrough 1997, Derby 2002)\n\nRavanelli scored five goals for Juventus en route to Champions League glory in 1996, including one in the final against Ajax. But that summer he swapped Turin for Teesside and mid-table Middlesbrough, in a move few saw coming.\n\nThe fact Boro were paying Ravanelli a reported \u00a342,000-a-week helped, of course, but the White Feather was no freeloader and scored 31 goals in all competitions that season. Boro reached the League Cup and FA Cup finals but ended up losing both and, to make matters worse, were relegated on the final day. Though Ravanelli initially vowed to stay and gain promotion from the First Division, he left two games into the season for the significantly sunnier Marseille.\n\nThe not-so-Fab Ravanelli curse struck again when he signed for Derby in 2001, and the Rams were relegated at the end of his first season.\n\nSEE ALSO Middlesbrough 1996/97: rucks, relegation, cup finals\u2026 and training at a prison\n\nMichele Padovano (Juventus 1996/Crystal Palace 1999)\n\nPadovano had carved out a journeyman striker's career before Marcelo Lippi plucked him from obscurity to back up Ravanelli and Gianluca Vialli at Juventus. He certainly proved his worth, netting the decisive goal in Juve\u2019s quarter-final win over Real Madrid as well as a penalty in the Bianconeri\u2019s 1996 Champions League Final shootout victory over Ajax.\n\nThe Italian\u2019s European pedigree was enough to convince newly-promoted Crystal Palace that they should shell out \u00a31.7m to bring him to Selhurst Park in the summer of 1998. Padovano struggled to adjust to the demands of the English top flight, though, scoring once in 12 outings for a Palace side that ended the season bottom and on the brink of administration. He left for Metz the following summer.\n\nSteve Finnan (Liverpool 2005/Portsmouth 2010)\n\nFinnan holds the remarkable record of having played in the World Cup, Champions League, UEFA Cup, Intertoto Cup, all four levels of the English league football and the Conference \u2013 but that\u2019s only the half of it.\n\nThe Irishman is also among the select few to experience the joy of Champions League success and Premier League relegation. Finnan was part of the Liverpool side that lifted the famous Champions League trophy in 2005, and also in the Reds' starting XI for the 2007 final they lost to Milan.\n\nAfter a short spell in Spain with Espanyol, he returned to England with Portsmouth in 2010. They were relegated that season, though, with Finnan\u2019s final game as a professional coming in that season\u2019s FA Cup final against Chelsea.\n\nNEXT:A three-time winner goes down \u2013 and someone finally does it in the right order\n\nDenis Irwin (Manchester United 1999/Wolves 2004)\n\nIrwin won 13 major trophies during his time with Manchester United, including the 1999 Champions League. When Sir Alex Ferguson opted against renewing his contract in 2002, when he was 36, the Irishman could and probably should have called it a day there.\n\nBut Irwin wanted more, and duly signed for Wolves in the second tier that summer. Initially, it went well: Wolves won promotion to the Premier League in his first season, ending a 19-year stint away from the top flight. Irwin\u2019s final season proved much harder, though, and Wolves suffered the drop alongside Leicester and Leeds. A 5-1 defeat to Blackburn on the opening day set the tone for a season where Wanderers failed to win away from home.\n\nVictor Valdes (Barcelona 2006, 2009, 2011/Middlesbrough 2017)\n\nA serial Champions League winner with Barcelona, Valdes was also custodian for one of the worst Premier League teams in recent memory. He was once one of the best goalkeepers in the world, but a cruciate ligament injury \u2013 followed by an extended spell as back-up to David de Gea \u2013 meant the Spaniard was somewhat rusty by the time he joined Middlesbrough in 2016.\n\nBut despite the appeal of working under compatriot Aitor Karanka, who'd got Boro promoted with a distinctive style of football, the club struggled for identity in the Premier League. Karanka was eventually sacked and Boro finished bottom after winning just five games all season. Valdes opted to leave the Riverside that summer and later retired.\n\nFinidi George (Ajax 1995/Ipswich 2002)\n\nAs part of the Ajax side that won the Champions League in 1995, Finidi\u2019s main contribution came in the semi-final against Bayern Munich, where he scored an absolute screamer as part of a 5-2 win for the Eredivisie side. Six years later after a successful stint in Spain, the Nigerian rocked up at Ipswich Town with fans hopeful that the new \u00a31.3 million signing would help them build on the previous season\u2019s fifth-place finish.\n\nBut despite two goals in a 3-1 win over Derby early in the campaign, George looked out of sorts. He started matches sporadically while Ipswich struggled for goals and creativity, and the end result was relegation from the Premier League. He was released on a free and later rejoined former club Mallorca to see out his career.\n\nMichael Carrick (Manchester United 2008/West Ham 2003)\n\nCarrick pulled off this particular trick in the preferable order. Part of a West Ham team that really was too good to go down but nevertheless did in 2003, he played a season in the Championship before moving on to Tottenham and eventually Manchester United in 2006.\n\nAfter several years of trial and error, Sir Alex Ferguson saw Carrick as the Roy Keane replacement his United team was crying out for. He lived up to the billing too, winning five Premier League titles, an FA Cup, three League Cups, the Europa League and Champions League in 2008 \u2013 scoring in United\u2019s penalty shootout win over Chelsea in the final.\n\nIbrahim Afellay (Barcelona 2011/Stoke 2018)\n\nSigned from PSV Eindhoven in January 2011, Afellay enjoyed several notable cameos for Barcelona in the Champions League that season, setting up Lionel Messi for a goal in the semi-finals against Real Madrid and coming on in the final itself against Manchester United. An anterior cruciate ligament injury sidelined him for much of the following season, though, and the Dutchman ultimately struggling to rekindle the kind of form that made him a Bar\u00e7a player in the first place.\n\nHe ended up at Stoke in 2015, where injuries and attitude problems further curtailed his impact. With the Potters facing a battle to stay up in 2018, Afellay found himself banished from the club for the remainder of the campaign, after his focus was once again called into question. Stoke eventually went down and the player's contract was terminated the following January.\n\nJose Bosingwa (Chelsea 2012/QPR 2015)\n\nBosingwa has felt the emotional extremes of Champions League success and Premier League failure more than most. He was part of the Chelsea team that defied logic to win the Champions League under Roberto Di Matteo; the unsung hero of that campaign too, stepping up in John Terry's red-card absence following the Chelsea captain's early dismissal against Barcelona in the semi-final, and keeping Franck Ribery quiet in the final against Bayern.\n\nStill only 30 when he moved to QPR on a free the following summer, Bosingwa's signing should have been a coup for Rangers. It was anything but. The Portuguese half-arsed it and soon fell out with manager Harry Redknapp after refusing to sit on the bench for a game against Fulham. Booed by his own fans and criticised by team-mates like Joey Barton, Bosingwa emerged as a scapegoat for QPR's big-spending, under-performing side.\n\nThey were relegated with games to spare and he didn\u2019t stay where he wasn't wanted, cancelling the remaining two years of his contract to join Trabzonspor in Turkey later that summer.\n\nNOW READ\u2026\n\nLONG READ Why England's shiny, self-aware new Golden Generation have everyone over a barrel \u2013 and we should love them for it\n\nQUIZ Can you name the 43 highest scorers in Europe\u2019s top five leagues in 2018/19?\n\nWhile you're here, why not take advantage of our brilliant new subscribers' offer?

On that note, here is the exhaustive list of all the players who have got their hands on the prize more than once since the competition's rebranding in 1992 in no particular order.\n\n#12 Marcel Desailly | Marseille 1993, AC Milan 1994\n\nA dejected Marcel Desailly of Chelsea\n\nMarcel Desailly is one of the greatest defenders of his generation and enjoyed a remarkable career for club and country. Having represented the likes of Marseille, AC Milan, Nantes and Chelsea, the central defender won a handful of trophies and was got his hands on the World Cup and the European Championships with France.\n\nWith regard to the Champions League, the Frenchman became the first player in the history of the competition to win it with multiple clubs, as he won it two seasons in a row with Marseille first and then with AC Milan.\n\nDesailly retired in 2006 as one of the finest defenders France has ever produced.\n\n#11 Paulo Sousa | Juventus 1996, Borussia Dortmund 1997\n\nPaulo Sousa\n\nPaulo Sousa had quite the time in the late 90s, as he made a name for himself a reliable midfielder in the heart of a resolute Juventus team. The Portuguese international was one of the most underrated players of the Bianconeri team at the time, as they beat Ajax in the 1996 final to win the Champions League.\n\nIn the same summer, Sousa moved to Borussia Dortmund, where he would make history with the Bundesliga outfit again. He found himself playing in the Champions League final once again and became one of four players to win the competition back-to-back with different clubs.\n\nDortmund beat Sousa's former club Juventus in a historic game which saw Zinedine Zidane's marked out of the game by Paul Lambert. The 49-year-old is currently the manager of Ligue 1 outfit Bordeaux.\n\n#10 Didier Deschamps | 1993 Marseille, 1996 Juventus\n\nDidier Dechamps of Juventus in action\n\nTeammates with Marcel Desailly in 1993 with Marseille and Paulo Sousa in 1996 with Juventus, Didier Deschamps also won the Champions League with two different teams in the modern era.\n\nHaving represented several top clubs including the likes of Valencia and Chelsea, the Frenchman made a name for himself as a reliable presence in the heart of the midfield and was also lauded for his leadership qualities.\n\nDeschamps featured in a staggering four Champions League final's with Marseille and Juventus and was also part of the Valencia squad that lost out to Bayern Munich in the 2001 final.\n\nThe 51-year-old is currently the manager of the French national team and won the World Cup as coach in 2018, having done so as a player in 1998.\n\n#9 Edwin van der Sar | Ajax 1995, Manchester United 2008\n\nChelsea v Manchester United - UEFA Champions League Quarter Final\n\nHailed as one of the great goalkeepers of his generation, Edwin van der Sar waited 13 years between his two Champions League victories \u2014 a fact that happens to shed light on his incredible longevity in the top level.\n\nThe Dutchman was a central figure of Louis van Gaal's impressive Ajax side that unearthed the likes of Clarence Seedorf and Patrick Kluivert amongst others, as he produced the goods consistently for the Eredivisie outfit.\n\n\ud83e\udde4Most @ChampionsLeague clean sheets5\u20e37\u20e3 IKER CASILLAS5\u20e31\u20e3 Gianluigi Buffon5\u20e30\u20e3 Edwin van der Sar4\u20e37\u20e3 Petr Cech4\u20e35\u20e3 Victor Valdes4\u20e32\u20e3 Manuel Neuer pic.twitter.com/aodix7d8qY \u2014 Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) August 4, 2020\n\nThirteen years after his first Champions League victory, Van der Sar was the hero on the night against Chelsea in the 2008 final. Nicolas Anelka's decisive spot-kick was saved by the Dutchman, as Manchester United prevailed in the all-English final at Moscow.\n\nAlso Read: Greatest UEFA Champions League XI of all-time\n\n#8 Clarence Seedorf | Ajax 1995, Real Madrid 1998, AC Milan 2003 & 2007\n\nUEFA Champions League Semi-Final: AC Milan v Manchester United\n\nAnother member of Louis van Gaal's famous Ajax side from the mid-90s, Clarence Seedorf is one of the most versatile midfielders of his generation and enjoyed a playing career spanning over two decades.\n\nThe influential midfielder is the only player in Champions League history to have won the competition with three different clubs, as he accomplished the feat with the star-studded AC Milan team of the early 2000s.\n\nThe Dutchman lost the 2005 Champions League final to Liverpool but still managed to get his hands on the trophy twice with the Serie A side after sealing a controversial move from arch-rivals Inter.\n\nSeedorf finished his career with four Champions League medal and multiple league titles across Europe, with his fitness and longevity earning praise globally.\n\n#7 Deco | FC Porto 2004, Barcelona 2006\n\nBarcelona v Celtic - UEFA Champions League\n\nBrazilian born Portuguese midfielder Deco was one of the crown jewel's of Jose Mourinho's stunning Champions League winning squad with FC Porto in 2004. Under the guidance of his compatriot, Deco became a key player for the club and soon outgrew the Liga NOS side, as he sealed a move to Barcelona.\n\nWith Ronaldinho in the forefront of Frank Rijkaard's star-studded team, Deco was also one of the important players in Barcelona triumph in the 2006 final against Arsenal.\n\nDeco was hailed as one of the very best players in his position and remained a key player for Barcelona, before moving to Chelsea in the summer of 2008.\n\n#6 Samuel Eto'o | Barcelona 2006 & 2009, Inter Milan 2010\n\nFC Internazionale Milano v SV Werder Bremen - UEFA Champions League\n\nSamuel Eto'o is widely regarded as the greatest African footballer of all time and the Cameroonian international enjoyed a remarkable club career in his prime.\n\nPart of two Champions League-winning squad under Pep Guardiola and Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona, Eto'o was a goal machine in the competition and scored in both finals for the Catalan club.\n\nHaving been part of Guardiola's all-conquering side in 2009, the prolific striker was sold to Inter Milan in a swap deal which saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic arrive at the Camp Nou.

In the season that followed, Pique was in the Champions League final once again and faced former club Manchester United.\n\nBarcelona emerged victorious that year and beat the same opponents again in 2011, as they began to scale new heights under Guardiola. Pique got his hands for the fourth time in his career in 2015, as a Luis Enrique led Barcelona side completed the treble that season.\n\nAlso Read: 10 most expensive signings in Premier League history\n\n#4 Xabi Alonso | Liverpool 2005, Real Madrid 2014\n\nReal Madrid CF v Bayern Muenchen - UEFA Champions League Semi Final\n\nXabi Alonso is amongst the most respected midfielders of his generation, as the Spaniard conducted himself with utmost dignity and class throughout his career. The elegant midfielder joined Liverpool in the summer of 2004 and quickly became a key player for Rafa Benitez, as he formed a formidable partnership with Reds captain Steven Gerrard.\n\nThe pair were both on target in the \"Miracle of Istanbul\" against AC Milan in 2005, as Liverpool sensationally came back from 3-0 down to win the Champions League final.\n\nAlonso enjoyed a fruitful spell with the Reds and sealed a return to Spain and was an indispensable member of Carlo Ancelotti's La Decima winning side.

Having been part of Chelsea's unlikely triumph in 2012, Sturridge did not feature in the final that year against Bayern Munich despite being in good form that season.\n\nSeven years later, the England international was once again an unused substitute for Liverpool, as the Reds beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the Champions League final at the Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nSturridge, however, played a key part in Liverpool's road to the final, as he left the club in the summer of 2019 and joined Trabzonspor in the Turkish Super Liga.\n\n#2 Toni Kroos | Bayern Munich 2013, Real Madrid 2016, 2017 & 2018\n\nReal Madrid v Club Atletico de Madrid - UEFA Champions League Final\n\nWidely regarded as one of the finest technicians of his generation, Toni Kroos is also amongst the most decorated players of the modern era. The German maestro burst onto the scene at Bayern Munich and joined a fruitful loan spell with Bayer Leverkusen, where he honed his skill and finally came of age.\n\nBayern Munich finally got their hands on the Champions League title in 2013 in the all-German final against Borussia Dortmund, as they put their past disappointments behind them.\n\nKroos remained with the Bundesliga side for a year after their European triumph and sealed a cut-price move to Real Madrid after failing to agree a new deal with Bayern.\n\nIn the years that followed, the German midfielder went from strength to strength and cemented his status as one of the greats of the modern era, as Real Madrid completed an unprecedented Champions League three-peat.\n\nKroos remains a key player for Los Blancos and is also hailed as a legend for the German national team for his exploits in the 2014 World Cup.\n\n#1 Cristiano Ronaldo | Manchester United 2008, Real Madrid 2014, 2016, 2017 & 2018\n\nReal Madrid v Liverpool - UEFA Champions League Final\n\nIn the Champions League era, no player has won the competition more times than Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ronaldo became one of the most feared attackers in the world at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he helped oversee a new era by spearheading them to four Champions League titles.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Ronaldo announced his decision to leave the club and sealed a stunning switch to Juventus.

But he remained on the bench throughout their 3-0 win over Brazil in the final.\n\n\u201cI have never told this story but I was supposed to come on 10 minutes into the second half,\u201d Henry said in 2006. \u201cBut then Marcel Desailly got sent off and the plan changed.\n\n\u201cAt the start of that tournament, the boss put out youngsters who were not scared and that was fine, but then he chose to go for experience in the quarter-final, semi-final and final.\n\n\u201cI was obviously disappointed not to come on and taste a World Cup final. But I still got the chance to lift the World Cup. I was 20 and I played six games so I can\u2019t be that upset.\u201d\n\nThe striker moved to Arsenal a year later and won two Premier League titles at Highbury but just missed out on the Champions League, losing the 2006 final to Barcelona.\n\nAs the old saying goes, if you can\u2019t beat them, join them \u2013 and the striker swapped Arsenal for Barcelona in the summer of 2007.\n\nHe finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy after beating Manchester United in the 2009 final and also won the Club World Cup a few months later.\n\nGerard Pique\n\nA La Masia academy graduate, Pique left Barcelona for Manchester United in 2004 in search of regular first-team football.\n\nHe was part of the United side that won the Premier League and the Champions League in 2007-08, making 12 appearances in those competitions.\n\nBut the centre-back returned to boyhood club Barcelona and missed United\u2019s Club World Cup win in December 2008.\n\nPique didn\u2019t have to wait very long to get his hands on the trophy as Barcelona beat United in the 2009 Champions League final before overcoming Estudiantes at the Club World Cup.\n\nThe Spain international also started all seven matches at the 2010 World Cup and kept five clean sheets, including their 1-0 win over the Netherlands in the final.\n\nHe\u2019s also won another two more Champions Leagues and two more Club World Cups since completing the set in 2010. Decent career, that.\n\nPedro\n\nThe third Barcelona player to feature on this list, Pedro was promoted to the first team ahead of 2008-09 and was part of the side that won the treble.\n\nHe only made a cameo appearance against Manchester United in 2009 but scored in both the semi-final and the final of the Club World Cup.\n\nThe winger was also named in Spain\u2019s squad for the 2010 World Cup and set up David Villa\u2019s winner in the quarter-final before starting in the semi-final and the final.\n\nPedro won another Club World Cup and two more Champions Leagues with Barcelona before signing for Chelsea in 2015.\n\nHe was a key player for Antonio Conte as Chelsea won the Premier League in 2016-17, registering nine goals and 10 assists in 35 league appearances.\n\nOn this day 10 years ago, Barcelona won the Club World Cup to complete the only sextuple in football history.
