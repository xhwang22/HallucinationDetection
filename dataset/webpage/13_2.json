As lead singer of The Cranberries, the iconic County Limerick-born vocalist was an adventurous and truly singular talent fronting a band who weren\u2019t just one of the great alt-rock acts of the 90s, but an outfit for whom longevity has long been guaranteed.\n\nThat O\u2019Riordan\u2019s untimely death robbed the music world of one its most distinctive voices is undeniable, but the extensive body of work she and her bandmates bequeathed will proudly live on. On their own, the statistics (which inform us that The Cranberries\u2019 seven studio albums have collectively sold over 40 million copies) demand respect, but it\u2019s the rich, bold and diverse content of these seven discs that continues to beguile fans old and new.\n\nListen to the best of The Cranberries on Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group achieved stratospheric success, but in time-honored rock\u2019n\u2019roll tradition, The Cranberries came from the humblest of beginnings. Formed by guitarist Mike Hogan, his bassist brother Noel and drummer Fergal Lawlor, in their native Limerick, during 1989, the classic Cranberries line-up only fell into place when budding vocalist/lyricist Dolores O\u2019Riordan was recruited a year later.\n\nTheir initial dues-paying done on the UK and Irish indie circuits, the band\u2019s first break came when Rough Trade label boss Geoff Travis took over their management. With help from Travis and further endorsement from key industry figures such as BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel and 2FM\u2019s Dave Fanning, in Dublin, The Cranberries signed to Island and cut their much-acclaimed debut album, 1993\u2019s Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?.\n\nThe question posed by the album\u2019s title seemed moot at a time when grunge and alt-rock was on the rise, but the quality of The Cranberries\u2019 debut soon set them apart from the pack. The fiery Celtic soul inherent in O\u2019Riordan\u2019s dextrous vocal delivery ensured that she garnered the lion\u2019s share of the plaudits, but the whole band weighed in with consummate performances, and while the record\u2019s breakthrough hits \u201cDreams\u201d and the melancholic break-up song \u201cLinger\u201d have since defined Everybody Else\u2026, its tracklist also concealed treasures such as \u201cPretty\u201d and the gorgeous, chiming \u201cWaltzing Back.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries - Linger\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nInitially a slow-burner, Everybody\u2019s Doing It\u2026 caught light after the transatlantic success of \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cLinger,\u201d eventually going quintuple-Platinum in the US alone. It barely prepared the band for the runaway success of their second LP, however, the Stephen Street-produced No Need To Argue, which moved 17 million copies worldwide.\n\nThough spawning four UK Top 40 hits, No Need To Argue found The Cranberries stretching sonically. The album\u2019s trailer single, the churning, grunge-inflected \u201cZombie,\u201d was an outspoken protest song concerning the deaths of two young children in an IRA bombing, while the record also spawned introspective fare such as the uileann pipes-enhanced \u201cDaffodil\u2019s Lament\u201d and the evocative \u201cOde To My Family\u201d \u2013 the latter provoking one of O\u2019Riordan\u2019s most affecting vocals.\n\nThe Cranberries - Zombie (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nRiding the crest of a wave, The Cranberries\u2019 third album, To The Faithful Departed, was a muscular, arena-sized rock record which featured several of the band\u2019s signature hits, among them \u201cSalvation\u201d and the upbeat, radio-friendly \u201cWhen You\u2019re Gone.\u201d Riding high on the charts, it eventually peaked at No.2 in the UK and at No.4 on the Billboard 200, en route to going double-platinum.\n\nRelishing the changing trends in the post-Britpop world, The Cranberries enjoyed further success with 1999\u2019s Bury The Hatchet and 2001\u2019s Wake Up And Smell The Coffee. The former spawned strident UK Top 20 hit \u201cPromises\u201d though several of its stand-out tracks, including the wistful, acoustic \u201cJust My Imagination\u201d and \u201cAnimal Instinct\u201c (O\u2019Riordan\u2019s ode to becoming a mother for the first time) harked back to the dreamy indie-pop sound that originally made these Limerick stalwarts\u2019 names.\n\nProduced by a returning Stephen Street, Wake Up And Smell The Coffee arguably remains the dark horse of The Cranberries\u2019 catalog, housing two finely-wrought, if often overlooked singles, \u201cAnalyse\u201d and the environmentally-conscious \u201cTime Is Ticking Out.\u201d In the album\u2019s wake, The Cranberries then went on hiatus, though a reunion in 2009 led to an ambitious comeback album, Roses, in 2012.\n\nThe Cranberries - Analyse (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nProffering their most eclectic set of songs, the Stephen Street-helmed Roses took in everything from the loops and electronica framing \u201cFire And Soul\u201d to the reggae-flavored \u201cRaining In My Heart,\u201d along with plenty of the band\u2019s patented, Celtic-flavoured dream-pop on \u201cTomorrow\u2019 and the blissful \u201cAstral Projection.\u201d\n\nNot a new studio album as such, 2017\u2019s Something Else found The Cranberries recasting ten of their key hits in orchestral and/or \u201cunplugged\u201d-style acoustic settings akin to Tori Amos\u2019 Gold Dust. Issued in April 2017, it showcases the richness and maturity inherent in Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s voice, and while it wasn\u2019t intended as a swansong, Something Else adds a graceful, dignified full stop to a highly covetable artistic legacy.\n\nOutside of The Cranberries, Dolores O\u2019Riordan also recorded two solo albums, Are You Listening? (2007) and 2009\u2019s No Baggage, and collaborated with artists renowned for their maverick approach, among them Zucchero, Jah Wobble and \u2013 more recently \u2013 DARK: a New York-based project also featuring The Smiths\u2019 former bassist, Andy Rourke. That public figures ranging from politicians to Irish President Michael D Higgins are mourning O\u2019Riordan\u2019s passing, and critics cite the debts the likes of Adele and Florence Welch owe her, all proves how deeply she\u2019s left her mark on popular culture.\n\nLooking for more?

The death is \"not being treated as suspicious,\" the statement said, and the case has been given to the coroner's office.\n\nIt will be some time before a cause of her death is established. The Westminster coroner's office told NPR on Friday that a postmortem examination has been done, but that it was awaiting several test results. In the meantime, the coroner's court has adjourned its hearing until April 3, when an internal review will take place; at that point, a date should be set for a full inquest.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the band's surviving members issued a statement on the group's website, saying: \"We are devastated on the passing of our friend Dolores. She was an extraordinary talent and we feel very privileged to have been part of her life from 1989 when we started the Cranberries. The world has lost a true artist today.\"\n\n\"To all those who follow and support Irish music, Irish musicians and the performing arts her death will be a big loss,\" Irish President Michael Higgins said, according to The Irish Times.\n\nO'Riordan was born Sept 6, 1971, and grew up in the Ballybricken area of County Limerick. She was just 18 years old when she auditioned to be a singer with The Cranberries, a group founded in 1989 by two brothers, bassist Mike Hogan and guitarist Noel Hogan, along with singer Niall Quinn and drummer Fergal Lawler as The Cranberry Saw Us. Quinn left the band within a year, and O'Riordan auditioned to be its new singer.\n\nIn 1993, The Cranberries' debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? went to No. 1 in the U.K. and to a Top 20 spot on the Billboard 100. The group's following three albums \u2014 No Need To Argue, To The Faithful Departed and Bury The Hatchet \u2014 also hit the Billboard Top 20.\n\nO'Riordan was the band's primary lyricist and often wrote The Cranberries' music as well. She possessed a singular, instantly recognizable voice that had a smoky hue in full cry, but which she could also hone into a sweet, delicate tone that evoked centuries of Gaelic folk tradition.\n\nThe Cranberries broke up in 2002, when O'Riordan left the band \u2014 but not before they had sold some 35 million albums worldwide. \"I retired, really,\" the singer told WXPN's World Cafe in 2007, saying that by the time the group's fourth album, Bury The Hatchet, was released in 1999, the band had \"burned out\" after having achieved enormous success so early.\n\n\"I didn't know if I'd come back to the music world, the entertainment world. I'd spent so long with The Cranberries. I was a teenager when the band broke \u2014 I spent many, many years touring. I have four kids, so I just wanted to prioritize my family and just be a person.\"\n\nBut O'Riordan found her way back to music, and released her first solo album, Are You Listening?, in 2007, followed by No Baggage in 2009. That same year, however, The Cranberries reunited, and toured with a mix of old hits, songs from O'Riordan's solo work, and new tunes. The band had been touring internationally in 2017, but in July the band announced that O'Riordan was forced to cancel due to ongoing problems with her back.\n\nAmong those marking their mourning on social media are the band Duran Duran. (O'Riordan's ex-husband, Don Burton, was a tour manager for Duran Duran.)\n\nO'Riordan's survivors include three children from her marriage to Burton: Taylor, Molly and Dakota; she also leaves a stepson, Donny."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/dolores-oriordan-cranberries-noel-hogan-talks-singers-life-and-legacy-253632/", "page_content": "Earlier this week, the body of Cranberries singer Dolores O\u2019Riordan was found in a London hotel room. While police have yet to establish a cause of death for the 46-year-old musician, her bandmates and family have been absorbing it all and requesting privacy. \u201cMy friend, partner, and the love of my life is gone,\u201d O\u2019Riordan\u2019s partner Ol\u00e9 Koretsky said in a statement. \u201cMy heart is broken and it is beyond repair.\u201d\n\nNoel Hogan, the Cranberries guitarist who co-founded the group and co-wrote many of their songs with O\u2019Riordan, maintained a decades-long friendship with the singer. The band had planned to tour last year, but cancelled the trek due to O\u2019Riordan\u2019s \u201congoing back problem.\u201d Speaking to Rolling Stone via e-mail, Hogan spoke about the singer\u2019s life, influence and legacy.\n\nMy earliest memory of Dolores singing is the first day I met her [in 1990]. We used to rehearse in a local studio in Limerick called Xeric. Dolores came in to hear us play and we got to hear her sing. She had a small keyboard that she set up and sang a few songs she had written. We were all blown away that this small girl from Limerick had such an amazing voice. The fact that she wasn\u2019t already in a band was a miracle.\n\nIn my opinion, what made Dolores connect with people was her honesty. What you saw was what you got. In the early days, the band was very shy; especially Dolores. She sang with her back to the audience but sang songs that people could relate to. There was no big act. I don\u2019t think people were used to this, and it seemed to resonate with them.\n\nI\u2019m not sure at what point Dolores accepted fame, or if she ever did. We would get a great kick out of it all, as if it were someone else that people were coming to see or talk about. Dolores was a very private person under it all. It was like she went to work and became Dolores the public version, then went home and lived her life away from all that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure at what point Dolores accepted fame, or if she ever did.\u201d\n\nLike anyone, Dolores had grown up by the time our later albums [like 2012\u2019s Roses] came out. When we were in our twenties, we had something to prove. You keep pushing and worrying about what people think. By the time Dolores did the last two albums, she was very relaxed in herself. The pressure was off and it was a great atmosphere to work in. I think she felt far more confident as an artist by then.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nShe was so disappointed when we had to cancel the last tour. She had looked forward to it for so long. She did everything in her power to fix the back problem, but it persisted and won in the end. We were about to start the next album in the coming months \u2013 along with some shows we were looking at. We had hoped the first of these would have been this March.\n\nI spoke to Dolores last Friday and she was great. We spoke about getting back to work \u2013 recording and new tracks we were working on. She sent some of those tracks to me by email on Sunday morning.\n\nTrending Trump Goes After Special Counsel\u2019s Wife in First Post-Indictment Appearance Trump Extremists Demand Civil War, Mass Murder After New Indictment Brittney Griner Targeted in 'Calculated Confrontation' at Dallas Airport The FDA Warned Ozempic Users. They Don\u2019t Give a F-ck\n\nDolores had a lot of things going on in her life over the past 10 years \u2013 good and bad. But she was like a sister to me, and like any family member you would worry and try to be there for them when they need you. It was hard at times, but at the end of the day we would always end up staying in touch. It was a friendship for 29 years.\n\nDolores\u2019 legacy will be her music. She was so passionate about it. There are songs I hear today that we wrote over 20 years ago, and I see and hear people singing along with them. There are only a few artists who get to have maybe one song they are remembered by. Dolores has so many. It\u2019s a great legacy."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/13/she-was-on-a-roll-the-cranberries-on-the-last-days-of-dolores-oriordan", "page_content": "The last time the Cranberries guitarist Noel Hogan saw Dolores O\u2019Riordan was in the Limerick hotel where we are now standing, in November 2017. He had agreed to do an interview with a Chinese journalist: the band are huge in China, apparently, and had a run of arena gigs booked there. O\u2019Riordan was living in New York and she wanted distraction; she decided, in a typically whimsical move, to come to meet the journalist, too, taking the direct flight to Shannon airport. She was in good spirits, although ongoing back problems \u2013 a slipped disc, from picking up a guitar \u2013 had led to a cancelled tour that summer.\n\nChristmas came and went, but the Cranberries were still recording. O\u2019Riordan would send Hogan vocals by email. On 14 January, she emailed him new songs: she had flown to London to mix an album with her side project D.A.R.K. At 1.12am on 15 January, calling from the Park Lane Hilton, she left a friend an excited voicemail in which she said a new recording was sounding \u201cfucking terribly good\u201d. At 2am, she spoke to her mother. Later that night, she died. I meet the band four days before an inquest ruled that the 46-year-old had drowned accidentally in the bath, with high levels of alcohol in her blood. Hogan looks around the lobby and says it is hard to believe that the last time he saw her it was somewhere so mundane.\n\nLetting it Linger \u2026 remaining Cranberries Fergal Lawler, Noel and Mike Hogan. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian\n\nOn the top floor, with its views out over the Shannon river, three Cranberries bear the mark of men still coming to terms with bereavement. Like many bands who lose a member, they threw themselves into activity. Their new album was nearly finished, so they completed it; April and May passed by in a blur. The strangest thing, they tell me, was that working in the studio was not all that different. The three of them would always record by day and Dolores would come in to sing at night, alone, with producer Stephen Street.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d pass each other in the corridor,\u201d says bassist Mike Hogan, Noel\u2019s brother, who was only 20 when the band achieved international fame. \u201cDolores would say: \u2018You know that thing you recorded?\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018You mean the thing that took me five hours to get right?\u2019 She\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s not working!\u2019 This time around, there were nights when we were waiting, looking for her to come in the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaiting for her to come in, like,\u201d echoes his brother. \u201cI found that, at night, I was so exhausted. Not physically, but mentally; those months from when Dolores passed away were intense.\u201d\n\nWhen she first sang, I wondered how and why she wasn\u2019t already in a band. I didn\u2019t want to question our luck Noel Hogan\n\nThe pair, along with drummer Fergal Lawler, are a close-knit circle, managed by one of O\u2019Riordan\u2019s five brothers. She grew up 10 miles out of Limerick in Ballybricken, but they are from the town and met when breakdancing in their teens in the mid-80s. They first saw Dolores when she was 19 and tried out for their band; she was painfully shy and quiet, they all agree, but \u201cwhen she sang\u201d, says Noel, \u201cI wondered how and why she wasn\u2019t already in a band. I didn\u2019t want to question it. We were lucky enough that she had come into this room.\u201d\n\nWhile the four of them shared a love for the Smiths and the Cure, O\u2019Riordan\u2019s vocal style stood alone: it was described by a Melody Maker journalist in 1991 as \u201cthe voice of a saint trapped in a glass harp\u201d. She learned her yodel from her dad, a country music fan, and there were church influences, too. The music mag went to her family home to meet the band and painted an intriguing, kitsch picture: a Jesus clock and holy water from Lourdes, with Christmas turkeys being bred in a shed in the dark. She adored her father, a farm labourer who was injured in a motorbike accident that left him unable to work; she is buried alongside him in St Ailbe\u2019s Church, Ballybricken.\n\nClick here to watch the video for the Cranberries\u2019 Zombie.\n\nO\u2019Riordan recalled an idyllic childhood \u2013 warm beds, hearty dinners, a fair dose of spirituality \u2013 but, in 2013, she told the Irish Independent that between the ages of eight and 12 she had been sexually abused by a family friend. Throughout her life she would flip, in interviews, between poetic positivity and confession.\n\nThe heady combination of raw, emotional lyrics and evocative Irish flavours quickly caught the attention of the wider world: the very first song O\u2019Riordan wrote for the band was Linger, and it remains their biggest hit. Although their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, tanked the first time round, after two US tours Linger was put on heavy rotation by MTV and upon its rerelease the album went to No 1 in the UK. By 1995, it had sold 5m copies in the US. It is being reissued in a box set next month.\n\nDespite their huge commercial success, the Cranberries were never exactly cool in a UK smitten with Britpop; the US was always their second home, where Irish connections were felt so strongly. O\u2019Riordan wrote an international protest song in Zombie, her response to the IRA bombing that killed two children, Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, in Warrington in 1993. Its lyric was so powerfully abstract that Parry\u2019s father, Colin, only realised, on O\u2019Riordan\u2019s death, what had inspired it. Their label was wary of the track\u2019s politics, but the band were not.\n\nNoel, Mike, Dolores and Fergal at an Irish music awards in 2002. Photograph: Paul McErlane/Reuters\n\n\u201cIn the 30 years with Dolores, what she wanted to do lyrically was her thing; we never interfered,\u201d says Noel. \u201cThat first album was all about relationships that she\u2019d had through her teenage years, and to stand there and spurt that out to everyone, you could open yourself to ridicule \u2013 but she didn\u2019t care. That remained with her always. She wrote what she felt was right.\u201d\n\nWhen fame hit, they were all about 20. It was always tougher for Dolores, says Mike, being on the front of the local paper, buying fish fingers at the supermarket. She broke her leg badly on a group ski trip during the recording of their second album \u2013 she wrote songs from her hospital bed \u2013 and, during her protracted convalescence, she began to struggle with depression and anorexia. By 1999, she was listed as the fifth-richest woman in the British Isles, but fame was wrecking her nervous system. By 2003, the band were \u201cburned out\u201d: they saw very little of each other for six years, with O\u2019Riordan living in Canada with her husband, Don Burton, and their three young children. There was a reunion in 2009, but you get the sense of a band kept on their toes by an unpredictable leader.\n\nShe always said she found it hard to write songs when she was happy. Put a bit of misery in her life and it was easier Noel Hogan\n\n\u201cShe would say we needed some time off and a week later she would be bored,\u201d says Noel. \u201cHer emails were like text messages. Fifteen of them, but they\u2019re all like two lines, at two o\u2019clock in the morning \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes when you did want time off you\u2019d be dreading seeing her ringing,\u201d his brother smiles.\n\nAfter her split from Burton, she spent a period living in hotels in New York. In 2014, she had a manic, paranoid episode on a flight from JFK to Shannon and assaulted the cabin crew, reminding them who she was. Shortly afterwards, she invited the Irish journalist Barry Egan into her home and told him how much trouble she was in; it was a cry for help from someone who had grown up in the public eye and who possibly struggled in periods of relative obscurity. \u201cMy life has no control,\u201d she said. Shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. How much did the band know about her problems in her later years?\n\n\u201cIt was only the last few years that she started talking about psychological problems, because she didn\u2019t know herself,\u201d says Lawler. \u201cShe saw a few different therapists and realised what she had and she started getting treatment for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a lot more herself,\u201d says Noel. \u201cEspecially last year, when we were rehearsing: you wouldn\u2019t even know, because they had found the right cocktail of whatever it was she needed to be on. There wasn\u2019t even a case of having to \u2018work around it\u2019. The hardest thing was her back, because playing live she could not move as freely as she used to.\u201d The new album gave her something to focus on, he says. \u201cShe was really psyched about getting back out and really looking forward to China, because that was a big tour for us.\n\n\u201cDolores had an awful lot going on and she was on a roll of being able to write,\u201d he continues. \u201cLyrically, the new album is very strong. She always said she found it hard to write songs when she was happy. She always said: put a bit of misery in her life and it was easier.\n\n\u201cWe will do this album and then that will be it,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is no need to continue.\u201d\n\nThe band step out on to the balcony to do the photoshoot. Noel stood out here with O\u2019Riordan the last time he saw her. This is new for them: no frontwoman, no idea how to stand, to pose, without their focal point.\n\n\u201cWith Dolores, doing pictures was so easy, because you knew exactly what to do,\u201d he smiles. \u201cJust all get behind her.\u201d\n\nThe box set of Everyone Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? is released on 19 October on UMC.

I was talking to her a couple weeks before Christmas she seemed happy and well \u2013 we even spoke about maybe writing some songs together \u2013 unbelievable god bless her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am heartbroken and devastated by the news of the sudden and unexpected passing of Dolores,\u201d says Andy Rourke, the former Smiths bassist who played with O\u2019Riordan in D.A.R.K. \u201cI have truly enjoyed the years we spent together and feel privileged to call her a close friend. It was a bonus to work with her and witness firsthand her breathtaking and unique talent, I will miss her terribly. I send my love and condolences to her family and loved ones.\u201d\n\nBorn in Limerick, Ireland as the youngest in a family of seven children, O\u2019Riordan auditioned to become singer of the Smiths-inspired band The Cranberry Saw Us, formed by brothers Noel and Mike Hogan, in 1990. As lead singer of the Cranberries, O\u2019Riordan fronted what Rolling Stone said in 1995 was \u201cIreland\u2019s biggest musical export since U2.\u201d\n\nThe alternative rock quartet released their debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? \u2013 which spawned the singles \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cLinger\u201d \u2013 in early 1993. After initially failing to make an impact upon release, \u201cLinger\u201d entered heavy rotation on MTV in late 1993, eventually climbing to Number Eight on the Billboard Hot 100. \u201cDreams\u201d was similarly successful upon re-release.\n\n\u201cI know exactly what every song on that album was about,\u201d O\u2019Riordan told Rolling Stone in 1995 of writing Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, which explored \u201ca young woman\u2019s painful failures as an adolescent and her subsequent rebirth as a young adult.\u201d \u201cAnd I know exactly what night I wrote it on and why I wrote it. And I\u2019m kind of proud of them because they do elaborate very much how I felt at that time.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries quickly followed up the multi-platinum success of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? with 1994\u2019s No Need to Argue, another worldwide bestseller that boasted the hit lead single \u201cZombie,\u201d a political rocker about a young child killed in a terror attack. At the height of their fame, the Cranberries also appeared on Saturday Night Live and headlined their own MTV Unplugged concert. Over the course of their career, the Cranberries would sell over 40 million albums worldwide.\n\nRelated\n\nStephen Street, who produced Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? and No Need to Argue, tweeted Monday, \u201cI have just heard the new regarding #DoloresORiordan I need a little time to process what has happened. Suffice to say, I am very sad to lose someone who meant so much to me and to many people across the world. RIP my songbird.\u201d\n\n1996\u2019s To the Faithful Departed yielded two more hits, \u201cSalvation\u201d and \u201cWhen You\u2019re Gone,\u201d before the band\u2019s popularity began to recede. The Cranberries went on hiatus following the release of 2001\u2019s Wake Up and Smell the Roses. O\u2019Riordan embarked a solo career in 2007 with the album Are You Listening? and, in 2016, formed the band D.A.R.K. with the Smiths\u2019 Andy Rourke.\n\n\u201cMy friend, partner, and the love of my life is gone,\u201d D.A.R.K. bandmate and partner Ol\u00e9 Koretsky said in a statement. \u201cMy heart is broken and it is beyond repair. Dolores is beautiful. Her art is beautiful. Her family is beautiful. The energy she continues to radiate is undeniable. I am lost. I miss her so much. I will continue to stumble around this planet for some time knowing well there\u2019s no real place for me here now.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries reunited in 2009, resulting in 2012\u2019s Roses and their latest album, 2017\u2019s Something Else. However, plans to tour in support of the album were cancelled following O\u2019Riordan\u2019s medical issues.\n\n\u201c\u2018Linger\u2019 was the first song I wrote after joining the Cranberries. I was 18, and the youngest member of the band was 16 at the time,\u201d O\u2019Riordan told Rolling Stone in 2017, when the Cranberries released an acoustic version of the single for Something Else. \u201cWe never imagined it\u2019d be such a big hit.\u201d\n\nLate Late Show host James Corden tweeted following news of O\u2019Riordan\u2019s death, \u201cI once met Delores O\u2019Riordan when I was 15. She was kind and lovely, I got her autograph on my train ticket and it made my day. She had the most amazing voice and presence.

There was no point... trying to ruin the legacy of the band,\u201d Noel Hogan said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that Dolores wanted this album done because when you hear the album, you hear the songs and how strong they are, and she was very, very excited to get in and record this.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries formed in Limerick in 1989 with another singer.

She was feeling quite content and strong and looking forward to a new phase of her life,\u201d Lawler said.\n\n\u201cA lot of the lyrics in this album are about things ending... people might read into it differently but it was a phase of her personal life that she was talking about.\u201d\n\nThe group previously announced their intention to split after the release of \u201cIn The End\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely gutted we can\u2019t play (the songs) live because that\u2019s something that\u2019s been a massive part of this band from day one,\u201d Noel Hogan said.\n\n\u201cA few people have said to us about maybe even doing a one off where you have different vocalists... as kind of guests of ours.

The Cranberries are finished.\n\nThe Cranberries were finished the moment their singer, Dolores O\u2019Riordan, died unexpectedly at just 46 years of age in a London hotel room on Jan. 15, 2018, and her friends and bandmates of nearly 30 years knew that instantly. There was never, ever, any question that the Cranberries would continue without her.\n\nBefore she passed away, however, O\u2019Riordan had committed to tape enough worthy material intended for a new Cranberries album that the shell-shocked surviving Crans \u2014 guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler \u2014 were compelled to finish the record they\u2019d tentatively begun with her the previous May before the reality that the Cranberries, as a whole, were finished could properly set in.\n\nNow that In the End is finally being released to the public this Friday \u2014 titled after the winsome folk-pop lullaby that, sadly but appropriately, draws the Irish quartet\u2019s eighth and final studio album to a close \u2014 a genuine reckoning with the future must occur.\n\n\u201cWe started tomorrow last year,\u201d says Noel Hogan, halfway through a promo trip to Toronto with Lawler two Mondays ago, of the posthumous sessions that begat In the End. \u201cSo there\u2019s a whole mix of things going on. Having this distracted us from those thoughts because we were still in \u2018Cranberries\u2019 mode. When people would ask \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 we\u2019d say, \u2018We\u2019re going to do an album\u2019 and it was business as usual, in some respects.\n\n\u201cAnd I guess it\u2019s only really now, as we\u2019re coming to the end of it, that you do start to think, \u2018What is next?\u2019 But I also think there\u2019s a bit of exhaustion amongst us at the moment.\n\nNoel Hogan, left, and Fergal Lawler of the Cranberries are firm that the Irish band will not carry on without its late lead singer Dolores O\u2019Riordan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSince that day in January of last year, really, it\u2019s been full on, you know?\u201d he added. \u201cBetween dealing with her death, where we all very much went to ground in many ways \u2026 and then going straight to London to do the album and working kinda behind the scenes on it since then, it\u2019s been a great distraction to do that. But, I guess, now that this is coming to an end, it\u2019s the time to start thinking about what does happen next.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next will have nothing to do with the Cranberries whatsoever. Nothing.\n\nThe suggestion that Lawler and the brothers Hogan might find their way to making music together under another guise or in a different configuration instantly meets with a terse \u201cno\u201d from both band members. No need to argue, as it were. Not gonna happen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about \u2018together,\u2019 you see, because then you have that Cranberries sound,\u201d says Lawler quietly. \u201cIt just happens when we play together.\u201d\n\nThe three remaining Cranberries were initially reticent to do anything further at all with the songs they\u2019d stockpiled with O\u2019Riordan over the weeks and months leading up to her death from what was eventually ruled to be an accidental drowning attributed to excessive alcohol intoxication in a bathtub at London\u2019s Park Lane Hilton. A coroner\u2019s inquest determined her blood-alcohol level at the time to be four times above the legal limit for driving in the U.K.\n\nDespite some very public wrestling in the past with depression, anorexia and alcoholism, and the concomitant psychological fallout from a period of childhood sexual abuse she revealed to the Irish Independent in 2013, O\u2019Riordan appeared to her bandmates to be in a good place as exploratory work on In the End commenced.\n\n\u201cShe had been through the wars and she was very open about everything that had gone on in her life, and her way of dealing with this type of stuff was to write songs, so she was very, very keen to write,\u201d sighs Hogan. \u201cAnd particularly that summer, it just seemed to be that she had kind of put that behind her and wanted to move on, and this was her way of doing it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Riordan, then living in New York, had enthusiastically emailed Hogan some new material the day before and was in London to mix a second record by D.A.R.K., her groove-oriented side project with former Smiths bassist Andy Rourke and her boyfriend, New York DJ/producer Ol\u00e9 Koretsky, with whom she released the album Science Agrees in 2016.\n\nOn the day she died, she was also planning to hit a studio there to add her own vocals to a Bad Wolves cover of \u201cZombie,\u201d the Cranberries\u2019 signature hit and the lead single from the Limerick-bred quartet\u2019s 17-million-selling 1994 sophomore smash No Need to Argue. That cover subsequently did so well upon issue in February 2018 that the members of Bad Wolves were able to present O\u2019Riordan\u2019s four children and Canadian-born ex-husband, Don Burton with $250,000 in proceeds by last June.\n\nIn the End, such as it existed at the time of her death, was \u201cat the very basic demo stage, nothing too crazy\u201d \u2014 basically just raw vocals \u2014 and \u201ca rough idea of where the songs were at,\u201d Hogan says, so the notion of trying to splice random verses and recording scraps into \u201ccomplete\u201d songs or to gather a bunch of rudimentary tracks together into a posthumous collection was never on the table because \u201cthere isn\u2019t a great history of that.\u201d\n\nOnce they started combing through the odds and sods O\u2019Riordan had left them, however, the Cranberries were struck by the strength of the lyrics and vocal performances. They sensed an album was there.\n\n\u201cWe spoke to her family. We wanted to check with them and see how they would feel and they gave us their blessing that they were all up for it,\u201d says Lawler. \u201cWe put a message on Facebook kind of seeing how fans would feel about it and, again, loads of positivity saying, \u2018We\u2019d love you to do this.\u2019 Because it was almost kind of like a gift that was there, you know?\n\n\u201cAnd for us not to do anything would have been a shame because it would have just finished after Dolores died. That would have been it, kind of left hanging. But with this, it\u2019s kind of a nice closure to the whole thing. \u2018Here\u2019s the last album.\u2019 And the quality of the songs is amazing. I mean, we were extremely blessed.\u201d\n\nBy April, with 11 solid tracks in hand, Lawler and the Hogans headed into the studio with longtime Cranberries producer Stephen Street and a primary goal of making it sound \u201clike it was the four of us in one room at the same time.\u201d The nature of her demos dictate the sound of the record, which often hearkens back to the \u201cLinger\u201d-era sweetness of the Crans\u2019 1993 debut, Everybody Else is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, but they got through it. And they came out of it with a final album that does O\u2019Riordan\u2019s and the Cranberries\u2019 legacies proud.\n\n\u201cIt was a reminder each morning when you\u2019d put on your headphones because you\u2019d go in, you\u2019d have a coffee and be chatting and then, \u2018Right, let\u2019s go\u2019 and suddenly everything comes flying back to you, the reality of what you\u2019re doing and what\u2019s happened,\u201d says Hogan.\n\n\u201cAnd it was only April. So it was very close to the time after she passed away. But you weren\u2019t doing anyone any favours by thinking \u2018Oh, this is awful, I shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u2019 and being depressed. You kind of had to go \u2018We\u2019re here to do a job.\u2019 \u2026 You\u2019d start to forget about all the negativity and you\u2019d kind of go with, \u2018I want each song to be the best that it can be.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd that really will be it.\n\n\u201cWe were strict on what could make it and what couldn\u2019t,\u201d says Hogan.\n\n\u201cThere are some extra little bits of vocals from a verse and then maybe another song might have just a chorus but no verse and some humming ideas where she wasn\u2019t sure what she was going to do, and they\u2019ll never be heard,\u201d vows Lawler. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be happy if we released that.\u201d\n\nWhich, of course, is the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d kill us,\u201d says Lawler. \u201cShe would haunt us from the grave, she would.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is an afterlife,\u201d chuckles his bandmate. \u201cShe\u2019d be standing there waiting.\u201d\n\nLawler laughs again. \u201cHands on hips, going, \u2018What the hell were you thinking?\u2019\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/dolores-oriordan-funeral-mourners-pay-tribute-cranberries-singer", "page_content": "Hundreds of mourners gathered to pay tribute to the Cranberries singer Dolores O\u2019Riordan on Tuesday as she was buried in her native Ballybricken, near the city of Limerick.\n\nIn the parish church where O\u2019Riordan once sang in the local choir, Canon Liam McNamara said the number of people she had helped through her songs was \u201cimpossible to count\u201d and that she rescued countless people from \u201cthe darkness of depression\u201d with her music.\n\nHer talents were used \u201cgenerously for the benefit of others\u201d, McNamara said of the pop star, who was found dead at a London hotel on 15 January.\n\n\n\nInside a packed Saint Ailbe\u2019s Catholic church in Ballybricken, County Limerick, a service began with a recording of Ave Maria, sung by O\u2019Riordan and Luciano Pavarotti.\n\nDuring his homily, McNamara recalled his first encounter with the singer.\n\nAli Hewson, the wife of Bono from U2, arrives outside St Ailbe\u2019s parish church in Ballybricken ahead of Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s funeral.
