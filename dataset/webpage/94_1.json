It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting Den Store Kro i Fredensborg marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled Norsk fjellandskap med elv (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.

Just google the same question and it\u2019s hard to find any list that doesn\u2019t include the Scandinavian nation. Yet, if you were to turn back the clock by four hundred years and ask the same question again, there would likely be no mention of Norway. If anything the idea that the northern country would be considered beautiful would have been seen as utterly bizarre.\n\nSince Norway hasn\u2019t dramatically transformed in the last four centuries, at least as far as I know, why are the two opinions so discordant? The answer is in the eye of the beholder. Aesthetic values change over time. We\u2019ve all seen how drastically fashion changes every decade or so, what was hip one day becomes unfashionable the next. Most other aesthetic considerations changed through time as well, even if few can keep up with the breakneck pace the world of apparel devours through different styles. In fact, through most of human history, aesthetic tastes changed slowly, driven in large part by shifts in the underlying conditions of the world people live in. But even our appreciation of something as everlasting and unchanging as nature has transformed radically through the ages. In fact, for medieval people, wild untamed nature was not something to be thought of as beautiful.\n\nLooking up to an imposing mountain pass with steep walls of pure rock hanging over a green valley or watching a nature documentary of some remote lush jungle forest you may ask yourself how anyone could not think nature to be beautiful. What you may not take into account is that once you\u2019re done staring at the awe-inspiring view you can simply get in your car and drive away. Or even more easily, when watching a great nature documentary narrated by a soothing British voice on Tv, you can click a little red button at the top of your remote and be done with nature for the day. That was obviously not the case for someone living at the turn of the first millennium.\n\nA mountain crossing for a man of the middle ages was a dreadful task, with chances of landslides, snowstorms, or even a simple fall, all of which could result in death. Lush woods meant predators. Powerful rivers meant drowning. You wouldn\u2019t calmly watch a storm rolling in if you were concerned with the very likely possibility of a flood. To the medieval man, simply put, nature meant danger, not beauty. It is hard to appreciate something when you\u2019re scared it can damage your livelihood or even kill you. Beauty, by contrast, was something safe, something man-made and which man could control."}, {"url": "https://www.fineartphotographyvideoart.com/2017/02/Johan-Christian-Dahl.html", "page_content": "Johan Christian Claussen Dahl\ud83c\udfa8 (24 February 1788 - 14 October 1857), often known as J.

Johan Christian Dahl was also an outstanding master of the romantic style in European visual arts. His paintings glorify the beauty of the majestic and harsh homeland of the Vikings, and the best masterpieces of creativity are still admired by the audience. The painter\u2019s biography is closely intertwined with Germany, and most of his works are in the national museum in the capital of Norway.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl was the founder of the Norwegian Art Society. Its beautiful landscapes were highly appreciated by art connoisseurs of other European countries.\n\nBiography of Johan Christian Dahl\n\nJohan Christian Dahl was born on February 24, 1788 in Bergen in the family of a simple Norwegian fisherman. The local priest early discerned in the boy remarkable abilities for science and took him to study in order to educate him as a minister of the church. But it soon became clear that Johan loves drawing most of all and the pastor decided to help him get a decent art education.\n\nSince 1803, under the patronage of his spiritual mentor, the young man became an apprentice to the most famous Bergen painter of those years, Johan Georg M\u00fcller. For 5 years, Dahl was mainly engaged in sketches of theatrical scenery and helped the teacher to paint portraits. Thanks to another mentor, Lyder Sagen, he read several books on painting theory and became interested in landscapes.\n\nstudies in Copenhagen\n\nIn 1811 Johan Dahl left for Copenhagen to continue his studies at the Danish Academy of Arts. He lived in the capital of Denmark for 6 years, constantly took part in art exhibitions and won recognition from the local public. Here, the young artist had his first influential admirer the Danish heir to the throne and future king Christian VIII, who later bought dozens of his paintings.\n\nIn September 1818, Johan Dahl went to Dresden and this city was destined to become the artist\u2019s second homeland. In the capital of Saxony at that time, a powerful group of romantic artists formed, led by Caspar David Friedrich. Dahl made a good impression on the famous German master of painting, and a strong friendship soon struck between them, which ended only with the death of Frederick, 22 years after their first meeting.\n\nIn Dresden, Johann Dahl continued to paint landscapes with enthusiasm, finding wonderful views for sketching in the vicinity of the city. Already in 1820, after several successful exhibitions, he was admitted to the Saxon Academy of Arts. Then the artist married Emily von Bloch, and a year later, at the invitation of Prince Christian, he left for Italy. But Dahl did not like life in hot lands, he missed the harsh Scandinavian nature and returned to Dresden at the first opportunity.\n\nJohan Dahl became a professor at the Dresden Academy\n\nSince 1824, Johan Dahl became a professor at the Dresden Academy and held this honorary position until his death. From time to time he went to his native Norway for several months, where he made many sketches for future paintings. And returning to Germany, he embodied his achievements in beautiful masterpieces. Gradually, the talented painter gained immense prestige among his colleagues and became one of the most popular romantic artists in all of Europe.\n\nTragic events in the artist\u2019s life\n\nUnfortunately, Johan Dahl\u2019s successful career did not help him avoid tragic events in his family life. In 1827, his wife Emily died giving birth to her fourth baby, and two years later his two older children died of scarlet fever. Out of grief, the artist even stopped painting and did not pick up a brush for several months. But then he married his young student Amalia and was preparing to become a father again. Alas, the second wife died in childbirth in December 1830. After that, the master never again tried to arrange family life and was engaged in raising children on his own.\n\nIn 1850, Johan Dahl visited Norway for the last time, where he donated a number of his works to the newly created National Gallery and made some sketches from nature. Returning to Saxony, the artist managed to paint a whole series of landscapes before leaving this world forever. On October 17, 1857, at the age of 69, Johan Dahl died in Dresden, where he was buried. But in 1834, the remains of the great romantic landscape painter were transported to Norway and interred in the churchyard of the Church of St. James in Bergen.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl is rightfully one of the greatest romantic artists in Europe. His name is known far beyond the borders of Norway, but it was the harsh Scandinavian landscapes that brought the master well-deserved fame and success.\n\nThe most famous paintings by Johan Christian Dahl\n\nThe famous painter of the 19th century left to his descendants dozens of unique masterpieces.

He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and H\u00e5konshallen in Bergen.\n\nEarly life\n\nDahl came from a very simple background \u2013 his father was a modest fisherman in Bergen, Norway \u2013 and he would later look back at his youth with bitterness. He regretted that he never had a \"real teacher\" in his childhood and, despite all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\nTime at Bergen\n\nAs a boy, Dahl was educated by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen Cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803 to 1809 Dahl studied with the painter Johan Georg M\u00fcller, whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings. Another mentor, Lyder Sagen, showed the aspiring artist books about art and awakened his interest in historical and patriotic subjects. It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting \u201cDen Store Kro i Fredensborg\u201d marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nAbroad in Dresden\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way:\u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled \u201cNorsk fjellandskap med elv\u201d (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nAbroad in Italy\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nMentorship\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nReturn home\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late 'Fjord at Sunset' (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nLater life\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830 Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Caroline and Siegwald.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was also among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang and Henrik Heftye, he also founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDeath\n\nDahl died lonely and bitter after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948), was erected on the facade of the Vestlandske kunstindustrimuseum in Bergen. In 1934, his remains brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany. His place in the pantheon of European artists is secure and his influence on the course of art history is indelible.\n\nHonors\n\nDahl had both the Orders of Vasa and St. Olav bestowed on him by the King of Norway and Sweden. He also received the Order of Dannebrog from Denmark. The three honors testify to his extraordinary cultural impact throughout Scandinavia.\n\nNotable works\n\nMany of his works may be seen in Dresden, notably a large picture titled Norway and Storm at Sea. The Bergen Kunstmuseum in Bergen, Norway, contains several of his more prominent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen (1851), Fra Stedje i Sogn (1836), Hjelle i Valdres (1850), Lysekloster (1827), Stedje i Sogn (1836) and Bjerk i storm (1849).\n\nThe National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design - The National Gallery, Oslo has a large collection of his works, including Vinter ved Sognefjorden (1827), Castellammare (1828), Skibbrudd ved den norske kyst (1832), Hellefoss (1838), Fra Stalheim (1842), Fra Fortundalen (1842) and Stugun\u00f8set p\u00e5 Filefjell (1851). Significant works (with their titles in Norwegian) include the following:\n\nVesuv i utbrudd (1826)\n\nVinter ved Sognefjorden (1827)\n\nCastellammare (1828)\n\nSkibbrudd ved den norske kyst (1832)\n\nFra Stedje i Sogn (1836)\n\nHellefoss (1838)\n\nStalheim (1842)\n\nFra Fortundalen (1842)\n\nBjerk i storm (1849)\n\nHjelle i Valdres (1850)\n\nStugun\u00f8set p\u00e5 Filefjell (1851)\n\nM\u00e5b\u00f8dalen (1851)"}, {"url": "https://picryl.com/collections/johan-christian-dahl-17881857-ed7f08", "page_content": "PICRYL is the largest media source for public domain images, scans, and documents.

A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany."}, {"url": "https://culturical.com/johan-christian-dahl/", "page_content": "Johan Christian Dahl is a famous Norwegian painter of the 19th century, the founder and greatest representative of the landscape genre in the painting of this northern country. Johan Christian Dahl was also an outstanding master of the romantic style in European visual arts. His paintings glorify the beauty of the majestic and harsh homeland of the Vikings, and the best masterpieces of creativity are still admired by the audience. The painter\u2019s biography is closely intertwined with Germany, and most of his works are in the national museum in the capital of Norway.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl was the founder of the Norwegian Art Society. Its beautiful landscapes were highly appreciated by art connoisseurs of other European countries.\n\nBiography of Johan Christian Dahl\n\nJohan Christian Dahl was born on February 24, 1788 in Bergen in the family of a simple Norwegian fisherman. The local priest early discerned in the boy remarkable abilities for science and took him to study in order to educate him as a minister of the church. But it soon became clear that Johan loves drawing most of all and the pastor decided to help him get a decent art education.\n\nSince 1803, under the patronage of his spiritual mentor, the young man became an apprentice to the most famous Bergen painter of those years, Johan Georg M\u00fcller. For 5 years, Dahl was mainly engaged in sketches of theatrical scenery and helped the teacher to paint portraits. Thanks to another mentor, Lyder Sagen, he read several books on painting theory and became interested in landscapes.\n\nstudies in Copenhagen\n\nIn 1811 Johan Dahl left for Copenhagen to continue his studies at the Danish Academy of Arts. He lived in the capital of Denmark for 6 years, constantly took part in art exhibitions and won recognition from the local public. Here, the young artist had his first influential admirer the Danish heir to the throne and future king Christian VIII, who later bought dozens of his paintings.\n\nIn September 1818, Johan Dahl went to Dresden and this city was destined to become the artist\u2019s second homeland. In the capital of Saxony at that time, a powerful group of romantic artists formed, led by Caspar David Friedrich. Dahl made a good impression on the famous German master of painting, and a strong friendship soon struck between them, which ended only with the death of Frederick, 22 years after their first meeting.\n\nIn Dresden, Johann Dahl continued to paint landscapes with enthusiasm, finding wonderful views for sketching in the vicinity of the city. Already in 1820, after several successful exhibitions, he was admitted to the Saxon Academy of Arts. Then the artist married Emily von Bloch, and a year later, at the invitation of Prince Christian, he left for Italy. But Dahl did not like life in hot lands, he missed the harsh Scandinavian nature and returned to Dresden at the first opportunity.\n\nJohan Dahl became a professor at the Dresden Academy\n\nSince 1824, Johan Dahl became a professor at the Dresden Academy and held this honorary position until his death. From time to time he went to his native Norway for several months, where he made many sketches for future paintings. And returning to Germany, he embodied his achievements in beautiful masterpieces. Gradually, the talented painter gained immense prestige among his colleagues and became one of the most popular romantic artists in all of Europe.\n\nTragic events in the artist\u2019s life\n\nUnfortunately, Johan Dahl\u2019s successful career did not help him avoid tragic events in his family life. In 1827, his wife Emily died giving birth to her fourth baby, and two years later his two older children died of scarlet fever. Out of grief, the artist even stopped painting and did not pick up a brush for several months. But then he married his young student Amalia and was preparing to become a father again. Alas, the second wife died in childbirth in December 1830. After that, the master never again tried to arrange family life and was engaged in raising children on his own.\n\nIn 1850, Johan Dahl visited Norway for the last time, where he donated a number of his works to the newly created National Gallery and made some sketches from nature. Returning to Saxony, the artist managed to paint a whole series of landscapes before leaving this world forever. On October 17, 1857, at the age of 69, Johan Dahl died in Dresden, where he was buried. But in 1834, the remains of the great romantic landscape painter were transported to Norway and interred in the churchyard of the Church of St. James in Bergen.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl is rightfully one of the greatest romantic artists in Europe. His name is known far beyond the borders of Norway, but it was the harsh Scandinavian landscapes that brought the master well-deserved fame and success.\n\nThe most famous paintings by Johan Christian Dahl\n\nThe famous painter of the 19th century left to his descendants dozens of unique masterpieces.

Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Dahl spent much of his life outside of Norway, his love for his country is clear in the motifs he chose for his paintings and in his extraordinary efforts on behalf of Norwegian culture generally. Indeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway. He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and H\u00e5konshallen in Bergen.\n\nEarly life\n\nDahl came from a very simple background \u2013 his father was a modest fisherman in Bergen, Norway \u2013 and he would later look back at his youth with bitterness. He regretted that he never had a \"real teacher\" in his childhood and, despite all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\nTime at Bergen\n\nAs a boy, Dahl was educated by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen Cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803 to 1809 Dahl studied with the painter Johan Georg M\u00fcller, whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings. Another mentor, Lyder Sagen, showed the aspiring artist books about art and awakened his interest in historical and patriotic subjects. It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting \u201cDen Store Kro i Fredensborg\u201d marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nAbroad in Dresden\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way:\u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled \u201cNorsk fjellandskap med elv\u201d (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nAbroad in Italy\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nMentorship\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nReturn home\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late 'Fjord at Sunset' (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nLater life\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830 Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Caroline and Siegwald.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was also among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang and Henrik Heftye, he also founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDeath\n\nDahl died lonely and bitter after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948), was erected on the facade of the Vestlandske kunstindustrimuseum in Bergen. In 1934, his remains brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany. His place in the pantheon of European artists is secure and his influence on the course of art history is indelible.\n\nHonors\n\nDahl had both the Orders of Vasa and St. Olav bestowed on him by the King of Norway and Sweden. He also received the Order of Dannebrog from Denmark. The three honors testify to his extraordinary cultural impact throughout Scandinavia.\n\nNotable works\n\nMany of his works may be seen in Dresden, notably a large picture titled Norway and Storm at Sea. The Bergen Kunstmuseum in Bergen, Norway, contains several of his more prominent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen (1851), Fra Stedje i Sogn (1836), Hjelle i Valdres (1850), Lysekloster (1827), Stedje i Sogn (1836) and Bjerk i storm (1849).\n\nThe National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design - The National Gallery, Oslo has a large collection of his works, including Vinter ved Sognefjorden (1827), Castellammare (1828), Skibbrudd ved den norske kyst (1832), Hellefoss (1838), Fra Stalheim (1842), Fra Fortundalen (1842) and Stugun\u00f8set p\u00e5 Filefjell (1851). Significant works (with their titles in Norwegian) include the following:\n\nVesuv i utbrudd (1826)\n\nVinter ved Sognefjorden (1827)\n\nCastellammare (1828)\n\nSkibbrudd ved den norske kyst (1832)\n\nFra Stedje i Sogn (1836)\n\nHellefoss (1838)\n\nStalheim (1842)\n\nFra Fortundalen (1842)\n\nBjerk i storm (1849)\n\nHjelle i Valdres (1850)\n\nStugun\u00f8set p\u00e5 Filefjell (1851)\n\nM\u00e5b\u00f8dalen (1851)"}, {"url": "https://www.fineartphotographyvideoart.com/2017/02/Johan-Christian-Dahl.html", "page_content": "Johan Christian Claussen Dahl\ud83c\udfa8 (24 February 1788 - 14 October 1857), often known as J.

He was also the first to acquire genuine fame and cultural renown abroad. As one critic has put it, J.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Dahl spent much of his life outside of Norway, his love for his country is clear in the motifs he chose for his paintings and in his extraordinary efforts on behalf of Norwegian culture generally.\n\nIndeed, if one sets aside his own monumental artistic creations, his other activities on behalf of art, history, and culture would still have guaranteed him a place at the very heart of the artistic and cultural history of Norway.\n\nHe was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and H\u00e5konshallen in Bergen. | \u00a9 Wikipedia"}]}
