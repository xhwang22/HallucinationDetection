The IOC's executive board approved the reallocation of medals during Thursday night's meeting, with Team Canada moving up into the silver medal position. The Chinese quartet of Su Bingtian, Xie Zhenye, Tang Xingqiang and Wu Zhiqiang posted a time of 37.79 seconds to finish behind Italy, Great Britain and Canada in Tokyo. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had found that English sprinter Chijindu Ujah had committed an anti-doping rule violation and his team's result from the 4x100m relay had been disqualified.\n\nTeam China (Red) compete with Team Great Britain during the men's 4x100m relay final on day fourteen of the Tokyo Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Japan, August 6, 2021. /CFP Team China (Red) compete with Team Great Britain during the men's 4x100m relay final on day fourteen of the Tokyo Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Japan, August 6, 2021. /CFP\n\nCAS acknowledged that Ujah had not challenged the decision in his written submissions to the hearing and that he claimed he had \"not knowingly or intentionally doped\". \"I'm sorry that this situation has cost my teammates the medals they worked so hard and so long for, and which they richly deserved. That is something I will regret for the rest of my life,\" Ujah said in a statement in February. The latest twist in the Olympic relay drama meant China have clinched their first ever Olympic medal in a relay event. It also increased China's medal count in Tokyo to 89 medals \u2013 38 gold, 32 silver and 19 bronze. To get upgraded to bronze represented another huge boost for China's up-and-coming track and field team, who put up a brilliant performance in Tokyo.\n\nChina's Su Bingtian celerates after finishing six in the men's 100m at the Tokyo Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Japan, August 1, 2021. /CFP China's Su Bingtian celerates after finishing six in the men's 100m at the Tokyo Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, Japan, August 1, 2021. /CFP"}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/george-bovell-iii", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1983\n\nFirst Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games Sydney 2000\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTeam Trinidad and Tobago"}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2022/07/07/a-celebration-of-trinidad-and-tobagos-olympic-medallists/", "page_content": "A celebration of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s Olympic medallists\n\nTrinidad and Tobago's Keshorn Walcott competes to win the gold medal in the men's javelin throw final at the athletics event of the 2012 Olympic Games on August 11, 2012 in London, England. (AFP PHOTO) -\n\nTRINIDAD AND Tobago have made their mark on the Olympic stage, bringing joy to the people of this country. Weightlifter Rodney Wilkes got the ball rolling at the 1948 London Games which was followed by some memorable performances. Sprinter Hasely Crawford, javelin thrower Keshorn Walcott and a men\u2019s 4x100-metre team all reached the top of the podium and the efforts of swimmer George Bovell and sprinter Ato Boldon will never be forgotten.\n\nOn Tuesday, TT added a third gold medal to this country\u2019s tally as the men\u2019s 4x100m relay team were upgraded to gold, 14 years after earning a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThis reporter takes a look back at the 19 medals (three gold, five silver and 11 bronze) this country won in the history of the Olympic Games.\n\nTT have picked up medals in three sports at the Olympics \u2013 track and field, weightlifting and swimming.\n\nGOLD\n\nCrawford won TT\u2019s first gold medal at the 1976 Montreal Games.\n\nCrawford had stiff competition heading into the Games as the event included 1972 gold medallist Valeriy Borzov of Soviet Union and the highly favoured Donald Quarrie of Jamaica.\n\nIn the second semifinal, Crawford sealed a place in the final by winning in 10.22 seconds. Quarrie was second in 10.26.\n\nIn the final, Crawford became a household name in TT when crossed the finish line in 10.06. Quarrie was second in 10.08 and Borzov had to settle for bronze in 10.14.\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Jamaica won the men\u2019s 4x100m event, led by legendary sprinter Usain Bolt.\n\nJamaica won the event in 37.10 in a then Olympic and world record.\n\nTT finished second in 38.06.\n\nHowever, in 2017, the International Olympic Committee revealed that Jamaica team member Nesta Carter had violated the anti-doping code by testing positive for methylhexaneamine. Jamaica were disqualified and TT were announced as the new winners.\n\nThe TT team of Richard Thompson, Marc Burns, Keston Bledman, Emmanuel Callender and Aaron Armstrong received their medals in a short Olympic medal reallocation ceremony at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Tuesday.\n\nNot much was expected of Walcott heading into the 2012 London Games. By the end of the Games, Walcott was considered one of this country\u2019s greatest Olympians.\n\nWalcott, only 19 at the time, was still a national junior athlete.\n\nIn the qualifying round, he sealed a place in the final by throwing 81.75m on his third and final throw. Walcott had the tenth best throw among the 12 finalists.\n\nIn the final, Walcott broke the national record with a throw of 84.58m to cop gold.\n\nIt was Walcott\u2019s day as Vitezslav Vesely of Czech Republic, who threw a massive 88.34m in the qualifying round, could only manage an 83.34m throw in the final to snatch bronze.\n\nAntti Ruuskanen of Finland took silver with an 84.12m effort.\n\nSILVER\n\nTT made their Olympic debut at the 1948 London Games with five athletes.\n\nWeightlifter Wilkes became this country\u2019s first Olympic medallist after finishing second in the men\u2019s featherweight.\n\nWilkes, nicknamed the Mighty Midget, died in 2014 at age 89.\n\nWendell Mottley was one of many formidable 400m runners this country produced in the 1960s. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Mottley grabbed a silver medal in the men\u2019s 400m event. It was a memorable Games for TT as it was the first Olympics that this country claimed medals in track and field.\n\nTT had to wait 36 years before earning another silver medal. During the 2000 Sydney Games, TT fans had to set their alarms to wake up in the wee hours of the morning to watch Ato Boldon in action because of the 14-hour time difference.\n\nIt was worth it in the end as Boldon finished second in the men\u2019s 100m event. From the mid 1990s to early 2000s TT\u2019s track and field medal hopes relied almost entirely on Boldon\u2019s shoulders.\n\nBoldon inspired a new wave of sprinters and at the 2008 Beijing Games, Richard Thompson announced himself.\n\nThompson was in the form of his life heading into the Beijing Games.\n\nRunning for Louisiana State University, Thompson won the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track Athlete of the Year award and the SEC Men's Outdoor Track Athlete of the Year award.\n\nThompson copped silver in the men\u2019s 100m final behind Bolt, who set a world record of 9.69.\n\nFour years later at the 2012 London Olympics, the quartet of Thompson, Bledman, Callender and Burns took silver in the men\u2019s 4x100m event. It was the most successful Olympics for TT as the team left London with four medals.\n\nBRONZE\n\nEleven of TT\u2019s 19 medals are bronze with Wilkes grabbing the first one at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Following up his silver medal four years earlier, Wilkes took bronze in the men\u2019s featherweight.\n\nWilkes was not the only TT weightlifter to earn a medal at the games as Lennox Kilgour was third in the men\u2019s middle-heavyweight division.\n\nAt the 1964 Tokyo Games, Edwin Roberts became the first TT track and field athlete to cop a sprint medal with his bronze in the men\u2019s 200m event.\n\nRoberts was joined by Mottley, Kent Bernard and Edwin Skinner in the men\u2019s 4x400m race. They did not leave empty-handed, ending third.\n\nIt was a dry period for TT between 1964 and 1996 as during that time Crawford\u2019s gold medal in 1976 was the lone podium finish.\n\nAt the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Boldon ended TT\u2019s drought by copping bronze medals in both the 100m and 200m.\n\nThe 100m final was drama-filled. Linford Christie of Great Britain, the former Olympic champion, false started to add more tension to the race.\n\nBoldon then false started and on the third attempt to start the race Christie false started again and was disqualified.\n\nChristie was reluctant to leave the track but, when he eventually left, the race began.\n\nBoldon led at the 60m mark, but Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Donovan Bailey of Canada surged to the front. Bailey grabbed gold in a new world record of 9.84, Fredericks was second in 9.89 and Boldon had to settle for bronze in 9.90.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 200m final, Boldon copped his second bronze medal of the Games when he stopped the clock in 19.80.\n\nAmerican Michael Johnson broke the world record on his way to gold in 19.32 and Fredericks was second in 19.68.\n\nBoldon snatched his third bronze medal of his illustrious Olympic career in the men\u2019s 200m event at the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\nBovell was the next athlete to get bronze for TT becoming the first swimmer to earn an Olympic medal at the 2004 Athens Games. A few TT swimmers competed at the Olympics before Bovell.\n\nBovell\u2019s achievement was celebrated as it was TT\u2019s only medal at the 2004 Games.\n\nBovell, competing in the men\u2019s 200m individual medley, touched the wall in one minute, 58.80 seconds (1:58.80) in a new national record.\n\nAmerican swim legend Michael Phelps won in an Olympic record of 1:57.14 and countryman Ryan Lochte was second in 1:58.78.\n\nAt the 2012 London Games, TT, as they did in 1964, showed their prowess in the men\u2019s 400m event.\n\nLalonde Gordon earned bronze in the men\u2019s 400m event and the men\u2019s 4x400m team also took bronze. The TT relay contingent included Gordon, the late Deon Lendore, Jarrin Solomon, Renny Quow, Machel Cedenio and Ade Alleyne-Forte.\n\nTT could not continue their prolific form at the 2016 Rio Olympics as a bronze medal by Walcott in the closing stages of the meet was the only medal earned. It was his second medal after winning gold four years earlier."}, {"url": "https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-03-21/China-takes-bronze-after-Britain-stripped-of-Olympic-4x100m-medal-18zSKlCr5Hq/index.html", "page_content": "L-R: Su Bingtian, Xie Zhenye, Tang Xingqiang and Wu Zhiqiang of Team China celebrate after the men's 4x100 meters relay final during the Tokyo Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, August 6, 2021. /CFP\n\nL-R: Su Bingtian, Xie Zhenye, Tang Xingqiang and Wu Zhiqiang of Team China celebrate after the men's 4x100 meters relay final during the Tokyo Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, August 6, 2021. /CFP\n\nTeam China have been awarded the bronze medal in the men's 4x100 meters relay at the Tokyo Olympics, their first Olympic medal in the sport, after Team Great Britain were stripped of their silver medal, according to the athletes' profiles recently updated on the official website of World Athletics.\n\nBritish sprinter CJ Ujah was confirmed to have violated anti-doping regulations as he was tested positive for banned substances ostarine and S-23, commonly used to build muscle, after the race on August 6, 2021.\n\nTeam Italy won the gold and the silver would be awarded to Team Canada.\n\nChina's medal tally at the Tokyo Olympics would improve to 89 in total \u2013 38 gold, 32 silver and 19 bronze medals."}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/14/olympics-not-life-or-death/", "page_content": "Olympics not life or death\n\nIn this Aug 19,2004 file photo, TT\u2019s George Bovell adjusts his crown after winning the men\u2019s 200m individual medley bronze medal, at the 2004 Olympic Games at the Olympic Aquatic Center in Athens.

I feel sorry for all those athletes who sacrificed so much, trained so hard and some of them who take on lots of debts and spend years after the Olympics paying off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to see their hopes and dreams crushed like that, and have to postpone everything by a year.\n\nHowever, Bovell III said, \u201cA lot of athletes after the Olympics, experience something called \u2018post-Olympics depression\u2019. It\u2019s where after the Olympics, they\u2019re lost, they don\u2019t know what to do next. They cannot even see beyond the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even living in reality. They\u2019re living in illusions, this kind of collective psychosis as Olympics being the most important thing in the universe. I think this is a reality check. If you fail to live with reality, reality would come and live with you, and you\u2019re not ready for it.\u201d\n\nThe former men\u2019s 200m IM short-course world record holder added, \u201cI think this, for a lot of athletes who have very unhappy lifestyles, mentally unhealthy, very unhappy people, it puts things in perspective. The Olympics is not life or death, it\u2019s just sports and something (we) do because (we) love it. If you need to (get) a medal in the Olympics to prove that you are a champion, if you need that external validation then, deep down inside, you are a loser.\n\n\u201cIf you are secure with yourself, you understand who you are and you understand your limitations, you wouldn\u2019t need any external validation. You don\u2019t need anybody else to tell you you\u2019re great. There are a lot of Olympic gold medallists who, deep down inside, still feel like losers.\u201d\n\nBovell III, who was inducted into the First Citizens Sports Foundation\u2019s Hall of Fame on Sunday, continued, \u201cYou need to be secure with yourself and say are you really doing it for the Olympic status and can show off on social media, because that is a big illusion, or are you doing it because you love it, because it\u2019s a path to self-mastery.\n\n\u201cWhen you control your mind, you control how you think, you have control over yourself. Instead of your environment and your life dictating how you should feel, you choose how you should feel.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/07/olympics-swimming-mixed-medley-relay-strategy-dave-durden-greg-meehan", "page_content": "The Tokyo Olympics feature three new events in the pool: the women\u2019s 1,500-meter freestyle, the men\u2019s 800-meter freestyle and the 4\u00d7100-meter mixed medley relay. Americans Katie Ledecky dominated the 1,500 while Bobby Finke pulled off an incredible comeback to win the 800.\n\nBut the 4\u00d7100 mixed medley relay\u2019s final is set for Saturday morning in Tokyo and Friday night in the U.S., and this new Olympic event could end up being the best and most fun relay in the pool. This event is already part of the world championships\u2019 lineup, and based on prelims earlier this week, the final is going to be a wild, must-see race.\n\nThe medley relay features 100s of backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle \u2013 in that order \u2014 and for the mixed medley relay, two men and two women in any order will tackle the legs.\n\nAnd how coaches put together what they believe is the best combination of swimmers involves a ton of strategy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of data points to help us make the best decision to help that relay get on the podium and hopefully win gold for the U.S.,\u201d Team USA\u2019s men\u2019s head coach Dave Durden said earlier this month at Olympic training camp.\n\nTeams will have to weigh their best specialized swimmers against the most advantageous order based on gender \u2014 all while considering what lineup their competitors might put forth.\n\nCheck out the relay from 2019 world championships, via NBC Sports:\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIn prelims at the Tokyo Games, Team USA\u2019s lineup had Regan Smith swimming backstroke, Michael Andrew doing breaststroke, Tom Shields on butterfly and Abbey Weitzeil anchoring with freestyle. The team finished second with a time of 3:41.02 in its heat to Great Britain \u2014 which broke the Olympic record with a 3:38.75 race \u2014 and the two teams are seeded 1-2 going into the final.\n\nHowever, lineups are likely to change for the final, and Team USA\u2019s mixed medley relay final could include Caeleb Dressel, Lydia Jacoby or Ryan Murphy. (SwimSwam broke down the many, many options for how the American relay team could look.)\n\nDurden continued explaining how he and Team USA\u2019s women\u2019s coach Greg Meehan will determine the final lineup:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of math that goes into some of those decisions, but there\u2019s also some environmental circumstances that we\u2019re looking at: Who we\u2019re swimming next to, where we\u2019re swimming in heats, where we\u2019re swimming \u2014 knock on wood \u2014 potentially, into the finals, how our athletes are moving through the front half of the meet. \u201cSo there\u2019s that and looking at the event orders at those particular sessions and making sure that we\u2019re prepping people or we\u2019re swimming people in the right way that\u2019s not impacting their individual swims but also helping us as Team USA win a gold medal.\u201d\n\nRelated Caeleb Dressel was overcome with emotion after winning gold in the 100 freestyle with an Olympic record\n\nSo when will fans know who exactly is on Team USA\u2019s mixed medley relay team? Likely not too long before the final itself.\n\nMeehan explained:\n\n\u201cAn hour before the end of the session, we\u2019ll have a relay card turned in that\u2019ll be the plan that\u2019s communicated externally. The one nice thing about where the mixed medley falls \u2014 somewhat similar to the respective men\u2019s medley [and] women\u2019s medley [relays] \u2014 is it\u2019s on the tail end of the meet, and we\u2019ll have seen a lot of things at that point. \u201cWe\u2019ll have seen most of the hundreds of stroke and 100 freestyles, and so we\u2019ll have a good sense of where everybody is and just utilize that \u2014 along with all the things that Dave mentioned \u2014 to put together those four individuals \u2026 at night prelims who are going to help Team USA make the final a day and a half later. \u201cAnd then for those four who are going to be on it at finals to go compete for a gold medal, we\u2019re just going to kind of simplify from that.\u201d\n\nJoining the U.S. and Great Britain in the 4\u00d7100 mixed medley relay final are China, Australia, Italy, Netherlands, the Russian Olympic Committee and Israel.\n\nThe final is scheduled for about 11:45 a.m. Saturday morning in Japan, which is about 10:45 p.m. ET.

I had doubts in the backstroke, but I pushed through the pain and just looked to bring it home.\"\n\nBovell's leadoff butterfly stroke was a 26.22, which put him in sixth at the first turn. He then turned over to clock a 29.94 in the backstroke, which moved him into third behind eventual gold-medalist and world record holder Michael Phelps of the United States and silver-medalist Ryan Lochte, also an American.\n\nWith 100-meter to go, Bovell registered a 33.95 in the breaststroke leg, the best split in the field, before clocking a 28.64 to out-touch Laszlo Cseh of Hungary by .04 seconds.\n\n\"George did this in a meet where he was struggling. He wasn't performing up to his or our (the Auburn coaches) standards up to this point,\" Auburn coach David Marsh said. \"But he stepped up tonight and got the job done.

It means a lot.\"\n\nThere will be no medal in the men's 4x400m for Great Britain.\n\nCameron Chalmers, Joseph Brier, Lee Thompson and Michael Ohioze fell well short of Saturday's final after coming sixth in their semi-final.

Carlos finished third, behind Australia's Peter Norman. When the three men \u2013 all donning Olympic Project for Human Rights badges \u2013 went to the podium to receive their medals, Smith and Carlos removed their shoes and stood in black socks as a tribute to black people in poverty. Then, during \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" they bowed their heads and gave the traditional \"black power\" salute of a raised, black-gloved fist. Then-IOC president Avery Brundage suspended Smith and Carlos for making a political statement during the Olympics.
