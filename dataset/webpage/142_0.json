{"Jack Straw was born on 3 August 1946.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Straw", "page_content": "Jack Straw, in full John Whitaker Straw, (born August 3, 1946, Essex, England), British Labour Party politician who held numerous government posts, including home secretary (1997\u20132001), foreign minister (2001\u201306), leader of the House of Commons (2006\u201307), and lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice (2007\u201310).\n\nStraw studied law at the University of Leeds and then received training as a barrister in London at the Inns of Court School of Law (now The City Law School, part of City University London). He served (1971\u201374) on the Inner London Education Authority and was its chair in 1973, before working as a special adviser to Labour Party cabinet ministers Barbara Castle (1974\u201376) and Peter Shore (1976\u201377). After a brief stint as a television researcher, Straw entered Parliament in 1979 as MP for Castle\u2019s former seat of Blackburn, Lancashire. He rose steadily through Labour\u2019s ranks and was elected to the party\u2019s opposition shadow cabinet in 1987. During the party\u2019s internal ideological conflict in the 1980s, he moved from being a traditional left-winger to becoming a more centrist modernizer. He was the first leading member of the Labour Party to propose that it repeal its socialist commitment\u2014Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution\u2014to the state control of industry. In 1994 Straw managed Tony Blair\u2019s successful campaign to be elected party leader, and one of Blair\u2019s first acts on becoming leader was to win the party\u2019s agreement to rewrite Clause IV.\n\nFollowing Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997, Straw was appointed home secretary. He quickly established his progressive credentials by setting up an inquiry into charges of racism in the London police force, promoting the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and refusing to allow the former Chilean head of state, Augusto Pinochet, to return home following Pinochet\u2019s October 1998 arrest in London. (The arrest followed a request by the Spanish government that Pinochet be extradited to Spain to face charges of murder. He was allowed to return to Chile in March 2000 when a panel of doctors advised that he was unfit to face trial.) Straw upset many progressives, however, by initiating legislation to withdraw the right of some defendants to be tried by a jury, introducing stricter requirements for people seeking political asylum in Great Britain, diluting Labour\u2019s pre-1997 election promise to establish a freedom of information law, and resisting calls to decriminalize the consumption of so-called \u201csoft\u201d drugs, such as marijuana.\n\nIn a 2001 cabinet reshuffle, Straw received the foreign and Commonwealth affairs portfolio. As foreign minister, Straw supported the invasion of Iraq as well as the expansion of the European Union (EU). Despite the latter position, however, Straw was a known skeptic of the euro, the EU\u2019s single currency. Shortly after Labour\u2019s poor showing in the May 2006 local elections, Blair overhauled his cabinet, and Straw was removed as foreign minister and made leader of the House of Commons. Later that year he caused controversy when he stated that Muslim women should not wear full veils. After Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007, Straw was named justice secretary and lord chancellor, thereby becoming the first member of the House of Commons to take up the latter post. The following year he outlined potential reforms to the House of Lords, which included the election of a certain percentage of members and a reduction in the number of lords. In 2009 he sparked debate after stating that oil deals with Libya had played a \u201cvery big part\u201d in the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi\u2014a Libyan convicted of bombing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988\u2014from a Scottish prison. In the general election of 2010 Straw easily retained his Blackburn constituency but lost his cabinet position when Labour was ousted from office. In February 2015 Straw temporarily resigned from the Labour Party after allegations surfaced of his involvement in an influence-peddling scandal that resulted from a sting investigation conducted by Channel Four and The Daily Telegraph. Having already announced in 2013 that he would not stand for reelection, Straw retired from the House of Commons in 2015."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Straw", "page_content": "John Whitaker 'Jack' Straw (born 3 August 1946 in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, England) is a British politician.

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010, the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw's maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family. Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\"\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\" He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978 he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006 Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. They have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nHe supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015 He was Given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/jack-straw/", "page_content": "John Whitaker \"Jack\" Straw (born 3 August 1946) is an English politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackburn from 1979 to 2015. Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010, the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family). Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nStraw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice Straw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\".\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nStraw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001. Straw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn Straw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\" He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978, he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006, Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. The couple have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nStraw supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015, he was given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jack.straw/1718238", "page_content": "Jack Straw Edit Profile\n\nalso known as John Whitaker\n\npolitician statesman\n\nJohn Whitaker \"Jack\" Straw was a British politician and statesman.\n\nBackground John Whitaker was born 3 August 1946 at Buckhurst Hill, Essex.\n\nEducation He was educated at Brentwood School, at the University of Leeds, and at the Inns of Court, School of Law. He was called to the bar in 1972.\n\nCareer Before entering Parliament, Straw worked as a barrister and a political adviser to Barbara Castle and Peter Shore.\n\n\n\nStraws parliamentary career began in 1979 when he became M.P. for Blackburn, the seat he has represented ever since. He was appointed opposition spokesman on treasury and economic affairs (1980-1983) and then opposition spokesman on the Environment (1983\u20141987). Rising swiftly, he served as shadow education secretary between 1987 and 1992 and as shadow environment secretary from 1992 to 1994. He then became shadow home secretary in 1994, becoming official home secretary upon labour\u2019s general election victory in May 1997.\n\nAchievements One of his most controversial moves in this office\u2014a move that many interpreted as a signal of his drift toward the Conservative policies of Michael Howard, the previous home secretary\u2014was the adoption, on 12 January 1999, of a policy aimed at ensuring that those convicted three times of burglary are given at minimum a three-year prison sentence.

For a woman, it also represents her father, and later her husband. The Sun is one of the most important symbols in the birth chart, as much as the Ascendant, then the Moon (a bit less for a man), the ruler of the Ascendant and the fast-moving planets. It's element is fire; it is hot and dry, it governs Leo, is in exaltation in Aries and is in analogy with the heart. It represents the boss, authority, beside the father and the husband ; the age of the Sun goes from 20 years old to about 40, following the Venus age when one is aware of his seductive power. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary, passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Sun. Sun in Leo You display a firm will and a certain nobleness of heart. You make use of, and sometimes, you abuse of your persuasion powers in your efforts to project a brilliant image of yourself. Your generosity is unlimited towards the people who do not antagonize your beliefs. But you do not accept to be contradicted, and you do not tolerate errors and defeats. You are sensitive to power struggles and you strive to keep your image and your panache free from all stain. No one can step on your toes! Leo is ambitious and he does not rest until the exhibited power he conquered is fully respected. Therefore, you properly fulfil the responsibilities you are entrusted with, but above all, you make it a point of honour to show that you are up to any situation. Whenever you have the opportunity to prove yourself in your activity, your fighting spirit, votre majestic persuasion powers and your conquering mind are amazing. You need to wield power. It is indispensable for you to feel comfortable and to be at your best. Leo must be cautious not to mistake his territory with that of his neighbour! The respect for borders - affective, social and professional - can spare you the delusions and the backlashes inherent to the love for power. If this condition is met, individual legitimate ambition becomes a source of creativity. Sun Dominant If the Sun is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Solarian: you loathe pettiness and Machiavellian manoeuvre, and you are fond of natural nobleness as well as of direct and honest attitudes. You endeavour to get out of muddled or dark situations as quickly as possible. Your need for transparency may lead you to make cut-and-dried judgments such as yes or no, and black or white. However, your honesty commands your entourage's consideration. At times, you come across as authoritarian. It is true that you never want to be thought of the notable absentee, and that you manage to make people pay attention to you, as well as to your plans and your assessments. To this end, the Solarian sometimes develops a great talent for placing himself under the spotlight without missing a single opportunity to arouse interest. Some other Solarians, although more discreet, still manage to be the focus of any debate, even in situations of exclusion. It is your way of being present even though you are actually not there... More than other people, you appreciate the esteem extended to you. It is useless to cheat with you, since in all areas you consider establishing enduring relationships only with those who love you, admire you, respect you, or express some degree of affection to you. Your will to straighten out your inter-personal relationships is your strength and sometimes, your Achilles' heel. You cannot achieve anything behind the scenes. Therefore, your comportment is marked with heroism, and your stands are devoid of ambiguity, in the sense that your commitments are unfailing, and your rebuffs, final. Interpretation of the 10\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"Two scantily dressed women are seated in the company of a man at a table where a sumptuous dinner is served.\" (Janduz version) Sensual, self-lenient, and lazy character. One is dragged by friends and circumstances into over-indulgence and bad habits, too much drinking, eating, and sex. It is indispensable to struggle against one's natural cowardice and to stick to high moral standards. However, if the natal chart indicates strong probity, this degree describes a righteous, calm, and rather shy person who is endowed with the qualities required for fulfilling high-ranking positions. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.

For a man, she represents his mother and later his wife, and his relationship with women in general. For a woman, the Moon is almost as important as the Sun and the Ascendant. Her element is water, she is cold and moist, she rules Cancer, is in exaltation in Taurus and is in analogy with the stomach. She symbolizes the mother, wife, the crowd, the Moon is associated with birth and childhood. Tradition also matches her with the end of life, after Saturn the old age, it is thus customary to go back to one's place of birth to die: the end of life meets the very beginning. Temperament: Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, non Active and Primary, Nervous or Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Moon. Moon in Libra On the day and at the time of your birth, the Moon was in the sign of Libra. You loathe violence. Your nature is sociable and you are keen to maintain harmony in your environment. You are sensitive to \"the spirit of the times\", to prevailing trends and currents. Because you pick up the moods of the people who surround you, you can be diplomatic. As you adopt the characteristics of your environment, you may become vulnerable. Your surrounding models may influence your tastes and your habits: you readily espouse your entourage's standards and aesthetic concepts. You can take advantage of your strong sensitivity in order to express yourself through a \"beyond the home\" activity that requires fineness, aesthetical sense, and good taste. Moon Dominant If the Moon is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Lunarian: the driving force behind your actions is mainly the pursuit of well-being and tranquillity. Your sensitive and romantic self lives on those periods of rest during which you let your imagination wander at will. This is your way of finding inspiration and balance. Nothing is allowed to disturb your feeling of fulfilment and security within a harmonious cell, be it a family or a clan. More than other people, the Lunarian is attached to those moments during which one forgets one's worries and lets oneself cast adrift aimlessly, with no other goal than to be lulled into an ambiance, a situation, or a perfect moment. Many people do not understand such absences and their meaning, which is to regain strength. These people readily describe you with such unflattering terms as apathy and nonchalance. Never mind! Some inspirations require surrendering as well as striking a balance derived from alternate action and passivity. Your qualities are expressed to the fullest in situations which demand familiarity and privacy. Your capacities to respect and blend into your environment is at least as valuable as some other people's aggressive dispositions. However, you are well-advised to avoid indolence and renunciation out of laziness or indifference. Interpretation of the 24\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"The sun shines bright on a flowery promontory where a peacock spreads its tail.\" (Janduz version) Ambitious, proud, and frivolous character. Success and wealth are achieved owing to one's good-looking features and sex-appeal. However, if the natal chart indicates strong moral and intellectual qualities, thanks to a devoted mentor, and although one never asked for it, one achieves considerable success and prosperity and remains simple and nice.

Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees.

Mercury in Leo Mercury describes your relations, your communication skills and the way you relate to the external world. However, other astrological elements also influence these areas. The sign Mercury occupies is significant only if Mercury is part of your planetary dominantes. In your chart, Mercury is in Leo. You want to explain and to control complex situations. You express yourself straightforwardly and directly, at the risk of hurting your entourage. Communication means to figure out the character and the specificity of each individual; you need to understand and to define the personality of your interlocutor so as to clarify the relationship. On the human plane, you are sensitive to power struggles and to the power exerted. Mercury Dominant If Mercury is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Mercurian: the tradition points out the importance of communication. From idle but enriching chatters to observation gift, such a dominant endows you with a wide range of expression. Human beings have one thousand facets and one thousand masks they wear according to circumstances and the fortunes of the game of life. You take the role of an observer who is avid for novelties, discoveries, and surprises. Everything catches your attention and becomes an opportunity for new encounters, relationships, and learning. The world amazes you, amuses you sometimes, and stimulates your curiosity. Because the most important thing is to discover, and because you consider that each new situation is packed with potentialities, you try to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Although your open-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also enables you to carefully avoid sticking to only one immutable and rigid view. The slightest sign enables you to perceive the other side of the coin, as well as the infinite complexity of people and of situations. On the human plane, you seek the dialogue and the information without which you know that you are not able to fully grasp the nature of your interlocutor. This keen interest in the Unknown sharpens your inter-relational skills. All these qualities are traditionally associated with Mercury. Interpretation of the 9\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A skeleton hangs at the branch of a storm-stricken oak.\" (Janduz version) Fundamentally courageous and altruistic character, though short-tempered and melancholic. One readily works to help other people, even though one knows that no profit is to be expected in return. Indeed, one believes that inner riches and spiritual advancement are invaluable. Skin and fur trade is very favoured. This degree indicates that physical dangers come from transportation and sport. Hunting is strongly advised against.

You need to understand all the aspects of your sentimental life. Therefore, you do not commit your affectivity in tortuous or hazardous paths. This attitude may be interpreted as a form of reserve, of modesty or of shyness. You complicate your amorous relationships for fun... Moderation in all things, even and particularly in love! Appearances are misleading: your behaviour may seem cautious, even shy or timid, however, your affectivity is strong... Your heart is discreet and its impulses are controlled and moderate. You do not want your relationship to run out of your control. Your soul is loyal, you are helpful when necessary and you avoid crises, clashes and tragedies in order to not endanger your couple. You are keen to maintain the balance of your unions. But, as you strive too relentlessly to keep your happiness intact, you may lose it. You do not dare to play the games of passion and of love at first sight. You fear burning feelings. In these conditions, it is important that you do not smother your emotions and you take the risk of experiencing a passionate love. Feelings cannot be calculated and they obey very few laws. Venus Dominant If Venus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Venusian: you are a sensual and emotional person particularly receptive to the natural likes and dislikes aroused by your contact with people. You are prone to frequent instinctive aversions and true passions which are exclusively driven by the feeling of love. The heart has its reasons which Reason knows nothing of... Your balance is based on the richness of your affective life. Without love, the Venusian is resourceless, lost, and deprived of any reason for living. You have an obvious and strong will to charm and to arouse the attachments without which you cannot properly function. Every area of your life is thus marked by your affectivity. The danger is that you may \"be taken in\" by charm. In such cases, you would prefer to keep your emotions under better control. Thus, hyper-sensitivity has its own inconveniences. Nevertheless, better than anyone else, you know how to play with feelings and attractions. Although you are sometimes caught in the traps of an over sensitive emotionalism, feelings remain your best assets in many circumstances. There is another aspect to the Venusian dominant. According to the Tradition, this planet rules the Arts, and you are endowed with some degree of artistic dispositions, ranging from good to excellent. Interpretation of the 23\u00b0 Virgo symbolic degree \"A bare-chested man is seated on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea and, protecting his eyes with his hand, watches a trapped wild goose striving to free itself.\" (Janduz version) Misanthropic, independent, and selfish character. One may be estranged from one's family, or becomes an exile or an outlaw. The goose portends some deprivation of liberty, often owing to lack of morals, politics, or just bad luck. This degree indicates potential eye problems or impaired sight. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.

For a woman, Mars corresponds to the kind of man she's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is rather symbolized by the Sun, Mars is the lover, not the husband). Fire is its element, it is hot and dry, and it rules Aries and Scorpio (along with Pluto), is in exaltation with Capricorn and is in analogy with the muscles and the spleen. It represents the soldiers, sportsmen, warriors, surgeons, blacksmiths... ; the age of Mars goes from 42 to 50 years old. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type. It is a Choleric. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mars. Mars in Virgo The planet Mars indicates how you react to life concrete stimulations. It also describes your fighting spirit, your abilities to stand for yourself and to take action. With Mars in Virgo, you strive to control your emotions and to reduce your field of activity in order to keep a maximal level of efficiency in your actions. When you commit yourself into something, you display a strong ingenuity and resourcefulness and you intervene at the right time. Your actions are as efficient as they are discreet. You may not feel comfortable when the situation you face is not logical. The whims of fate are not your allies: but you analyze properly more stable situations and you handle them methodically well. You seldom take inconsiderate actions and you prefer to take the time to weigh up the pros and the cons before undertaking anything. Your entourage may see your reserve and your restraint as a lack of boldness. Mars Dominant If Mars is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Marsian: in your hand-to-hand struggle for life, you demonstrate an acute and active sense of confrontation with the world, with other people, and with your own destiny. You need to take action and to fight for your projects and your desires. You perceive all situations with deep intensity, and you react to the here and now without bothering to step back in order to ensure that events are under your control. You take up challenges with excessive foolhardiness as a consequence of your impulsiveness. However, better than anyone else, you know how to mobilise your resources in case of crisis. You take action whenever it is necessary to do so, and you are present in a timely manner. With Mars, your attitudes are dictated by the realities of the moment, by your emotions, and by everything which proved to have worked in the past. When this dominant is not well integrated, it may bring about an aggressive or impulsive behaviour. Therefore, you must learn to control your hyper-sensitivity and your fits of temper. You are also endowed with Marsian qualities: the fighting spirit and the taste for duel without which one may find oneself overwhelmed by events. When this willpower is well channelled, its precious energy enables to cope with all sorts of contingencies. There are a thousand ways to win, and a thousand challenges to take up with the enthusiasm and the dynamism which make life so worthy. A certain idea of life which is wild, passionate, and in tune with events. Interpretation of the 26\u00b0 Virgo symbolic degree \"In his workshop, a disheartened carpenter stands idle whereas his employee cheerfully pulls the workbench cluttered with badly maintained tools.\" (Janduz version) Clumsy, incompetent, and lazy character. One is handicapped by a lack of skills, and above all, by the certainty that wealth can be achieved without effort. Passivity may encourage people who are more active and hard-working to grasp all the good opportunities. However, the courageous employee of the image also stands for the person influenced by this degree. All it takes to become successful is to pull oneself together, get proper training and start practicing, straight away. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Its element is Air, it is hot and moist, and it rules Sagittarius and Pisces (along with Neptune), is in exaltation with Cancer and is in analogy with the hips and endocrinal system. It represents the governors, magistrates, professors, religious men too; the age of Jupiter goes from 50 to 55 or even 70 years old. Temperament: Sanguine Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is an extrovert Choleric. Actually the humid version of Mars, inclined to action like him. For more information, see the page dedicated to Jupiter. Jupiter in Libra The planet Jupiter symbolizes expansion, broadness and generosity. Jupiter is associated with the functions of synthesis, enthusiasm and optimism. In your natal chart, his house position is more important than his sign position because, like Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Jupiter in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Jupiter in Libra endows you with sociability, popularity and charm! You are very appreciated because your open-mindedness and your generosity naturally prompt you to compromise in all things: what is important to you is not to have the last word, but to reach an agreement with your entourage and to establish nice relationships with them. You are diplomatic and your sense of justice is expressed in a humanistic and benevolent way. Jupiter Dominant If Jupiter is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Jupiterian: because this planet brings about a keen interest in social and professional success, the Tradition considers it to be beneficial. Indeed, you know how to adjust to events and to jump at the chance when it arises. The members of your entourage gladly entrust you with high responsibilities because they are often impressed by your learning skills and your adaptation abilities as you deal with new structures and new languages. What is the secret of your good star? It is your self-confidence which wins public support. Now, what is the secret of your charm? Definitely, enthusiasm, euphoria, and exaltation. Exaggeration also. When this dominant is well integrated, it is a factor of affluence and optimism, and a certain degree of joviality enables you to easily fit into various spheres. It constitutes your main asset to manage your life. However, you must at times curb your desire for integration, lest your sense of opportunity turns into extreme opportunism. Here also, the key to success lies in a correct estimate of everyone's chances and possibilities. Although management is one of your forte, and you can adjust your objectives to current realities better than other people, you lack the hindsight which enables you to avoid short-term vagaries and daily fluctuations. If you strive too much to adapt, you run a risk of betraying yourself. This is the other traditional side of the coin with \"The Greater Benefic\"! Interpretation of the 20\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"A dwarf riding a donkey jumps over a broken bridge.\" (Janduz version) Intelligent, conceited, and wily character. Instead of focusing on hard work and enhancing one's skills, one spends too much time plotting and gossiping. But it won't take long before people understand one's dishonest nature and spread the word. It is necessary to adopt a more respectable behaviour in order to earn back the esteem of friends and colleagues and avoid serious setbacks.

Saturn in Leo The planet Saturn symbolizes contraction, effort, time, limitation and concentration. Saturn eliminates anything that is not authentic, sooner or later. It is impossible to cheat him as he gives an irresistible desire to form a coherent whole with oneself, in responsible and wise ways. He is the great purifier. He represents our limitations but also our truth. In your natal chart, the house position where Saturn is posited is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Saturn in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Saturn in Leo tends to detach you from pleasure and leisure and gives you a serious and responsible nature. These are good qualities if Saturn is not badly aspected, even if your inclination for having fun is not particularly increased by this planetary configuration... Saturn Dominant If Saturn is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Saturnian: you gladly leave to other people the decision to take life as it comes. As far as you are concerned, you prefer to take advantage of your experiences in order to discover, to grow, and to question yourself. Interpretation of the 0\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A lion on a rock stares at the sunrise, while a man scornfully brandishes a chopped lion head.\" (Janduz version) Generous, benevolent, and dignified character endowed with great leadership capacities. One enjoys people's esteem, even that of one's enemies. If one is involved in seafaring, one may be entrusted with high-ranking positions in government. If the natal chart is very afflicted, vile instincts and shameful ambitions prompt to wield power in a tyrannical manner, in which case the body is over-weighted, and the physical appearance loses the natural majesty which is the attribute of this sign.

Fire is its element, it is dry, and it rules Aquarius, is in exaltation with Scorpio and is in analogy with the brain and the nerves. It represents inventors, odd characters, revolutionaries. Temperament: Nervous to the extreme Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary type; it is a Passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Uranus. Uranus in Gemini The planet Uranus symbolizes originality, independence and cerebral energy bursting suddenly. Uranus triggers the irresistible need for freedom that we have in ourselves. Uranus tends to break the constraints that have become unbearable and gives us the courage and the will to get rid of what has become a burden; when he is well aspected, he also indicates genius. In your natal chart, Uranus' house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Uranus in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Uranus in Gemini increases tenfold your nervousness and may incline you to be interested in a heap of very varied topics in deep and original ways. Uranus Dominant If Uranus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Uranian: personal values are prevailing. Inner certainties fuel an inflexible will and a desire to call attention on yourself as well as to follow your beliefs through. This planet prompts you to behave with determination, to put forward your own truth, and to start your personal revolution. More than other people, you are willing to keep some degree of autonomy in all circumstances, and you often display an individualistic nature. In order to achieve your ideal of freedom and independence, you may act like a despot as you try to convince and to impose your views, whether smoothly or forcefully. Regardless of the flexibility of your comportment, some situations demand an absolute firmness as well as uncompromising, frank and straightforward attitudes. People may criticise you for your intransigence and say that you are a hardliner. Outsider's opinions don't matter! The most important thing is that you act in all conscience and reach your primary objectives. More than anyone else, you know how to use your willpower and to focus your energy on a precise aim, relentlessly, whatever the consequences might be. In the chapter of qualities, let's mention a definite sense of responsibility, an innovative mind open to techniques and modern ideas, as well as a natural self-discipline which overcomes many an obstacle. Therefore, people are well-advised not to hound you into a corner. Interpretation of the 20\u00b0 Gemini symbolic degree \"A man nonchalantly seated on a horse holds a bowl towards another man, carefree, and wealthy, who cleverly throws coins at him.\" (Janduz version) Superficial, anxious, and adventurous character. Should the natal chart concur, one can achieve fame and wealth in politics thanks to the support of powerful and devoted friends. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Water is its element, it is moist, it rules Pisces, is in exaltation in Cancer, though some authors say it is Leo, and is in analogy with the vegetative system. It represents dreamers, mediums, magicians, merchants of illusion, drug addicts. Temperament: rather Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active, Primary or Secondary type; it is a Sentimental, or sometimes Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Neptune. Neptune in Libra The planet Neptune symbolizes extreme receptivity, intense emotional sharpness, impressionability and inspiration; it is the planet of mediums, mystics and religious faith. In an astrological chart, it indicates dilution, vagueness, understanding one's environment through emotions and the absence of clear and determined limits and structures. In your natal chart, Neptune's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Neptune in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Neptune in Libra endows you with idealism and pacifism. You dream of a world of peace, freedom, equality and tolerance. Your exchanges with others are genuine. You are listening to, and on the lookout for, all the emotions that you find to be so deliciously nurturing. Neptune Dominant If Neptune is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Neptunian: your intuition is highly developed. You are of a contemplative nature, and you are particularly receptive to ambiances, places, and people. You gladly cultivate the art of letting-go, and you allow the natural unfolding of events to construct your world. You follow your inspirations, for better or for worse. At times, you display an extraordinary clairvoyance gift. You seem to be able to read your subconscious like a book, and you track down subtle underlying mechanisms, flaws, or open breaches. This innate intuition might explain the strokes of good luck which the Neptunian is sometimes credited with. However, you may also be the victim of illusions and misleading intuitions. You are an idealist, and you let your deepest aspirations prevail over the realities of the moment. Then, you set off in quest of some quixotic objective, living like a Don Quixote who relentlessly pursues an impossible dream. You have a great talent for psychology and the mysteries of the human soul. Since you instinctively perceive people's intents and motivations, as you swim in the complexity of human nature, you feel in your element. The subtlety of your perceptiveness is the source of both special affections and irrevocable rejections. What is the danger of such a dominant? If it is not offset by other influences in your natal chart, you may not have an iron will. Your trump card is your instinct, which may be developed to the extent that it becomes clairvoyance. Interpretation of the 6\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"A raptor, with blood dripping from its claws, flies in front of a triangle of fire which seems to be hung between heaven and earth.\" (Janduz version) Passionate, self-righteous, and determined character. Depending on the natal chart, one is symbolised by the bird of prey or the triangle. The former describes an aggressive and spiteful person who puts his intelligence at the service of base ambitions and does not hesitate to resort to cruel actions in order to defeat his opponents. There are dangers of severe injuries by fire and sword. As for the triangle, it indicates a strong interest in spirituality, religion, or sociology, but also some sort of over-assertiveness which borders on intolerance. In both cases, one must renounce all forms of excess and violence. Then, as one ages, one becomes able to help other people overcome psychological and moral crises.

Its element is indefinite; burning (like lava in fusion ?), it rules Scorpio, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the sexual organs and excretion. It represents dictators, sadistic people, violent characters, is instinctive and powerful but also mysterious with hidden strengths. Temperament: rather Bilious Characterology: Emotive or non-Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is a Passionate Choleric type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Pluto. Pluto in Leo The planet Pluto symbolizes deep disruptions and upheavals, domination and sexual instincts, and the inner power we have in ourselves. Pluto destroys in order to reconstruct and he provokes painful crises that are needed in metamorphosis. Pluto is our deepest instincts' brutal force. It is the hidden and unconscious violence that can explode in us with incredible intensity before being projected in our actions; in itself, the planet is not negative: the might and the intensity of its energy are beyond the conceivable but it can be funnelled. Pluto is the only possibility we have at our disposal to overcome our inner blocks and to eliminate outgrown situations that have become inextricable. Pluto's energy is valuable because of its usefulness for the irreversible destruction of what constitutes a problem and not because of its negative side and its perversity. Pluto allows to reconstruct and to regenerate parts of our personality or whole stretches of our life, provided that we manage to funnel his wild energy and to step back. It is impossible to tame this energy, given its essence. However, it is possible to take advantage of it for a precise aim, through a temporary identification of some parts of us with this energy. In such a case, the outcome is our final evolution and even, our transformation. In your natal chart, Pluto's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Pluto is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Pluto in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality and they are not to be really taken into account, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Pluto in Leo may give you an authoritarian and, even, despotic nature. But your charisma and your radiance are intensified. Pluto Dominant If Pluto is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Plutonian: you sometimes feel like a foreigner who does not belong to the world, to its laws, and its concerns. The rules of life in society are not necessarily yours. You are interested in what is unknown and in the subtle laws of a hidden order. So, you take malicious pleasure in ridiculing the patterns you find too simplistic or too rigid. You also revel in underlining the limits of explanations you deem too common. There is something unconventional about the way you are, the way you think, and the way you act. What is your specificity made of? Is it an extraordinary partner? A life off the beaten path? Or do you only distance yourself from conventional morals? In any case, you have the feeling, sometimes quite vague, that you come from nowhere, and that you do not belong to any definite group... In short, it means that you cannot be simplified in order to conform to existing models. The gap between you and ordinary mortals is also an element of your strength. Your deep clear-sightedness, firstly, enables you to put things into perspective and to grant them only the attention they deserve. Your other remarkable asset is your capacity to intervene from behind the scenes, to secretly organise events, and to bring about the desirable outcome without seeming to impose or to dictate anything. However, you must still overcome one of the major difficulties of this dominant, which is to get people to accept your difference and to smoothly fit into your environment. Interpretation of the 11\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A beautiful white bull grazes in the shade of a big tree near a woman who reads quietly.\" (Janduz version) Benevolent, calm and active character. A high-ranking female exerts a fortunate influence. One enjoys wealth, whether it is inherited or acquired by one's own efforts. Life unfolds in peace and happiness. This degree often indicates that properties are bequeathed by relatives who have no children. In the natal chart of a female, this degree describes a personality which is particularly charming, demure, and celibate. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Most astrologers consider it as a kind of \"mediator\" between Saturn and outer planets. Consequently, Chiron is of Saturn's nature and at the same time is influenced by Uranus, the first slow-moving planet. Astrologically, it symbolizes wisdom, patience and the faculty to reduce others' sufferings: it is said to be the \"great healer\" of the zodiac. Like all the secondary bodies, it must be in close conjunction with planets or angles in order to fully express its action. %TEXTES_22%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_23% Ceres, the biggest of the four minor asteroids used besides Chiron, is associated with the mythological goddess of growing plants and harvest and also symbolizes physical constitution, vitality and fertility. She's also known as Demeter, according to the astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, linked to the symbolism of the mother but in a less emotive and more physical way than the Moon. Ceres is thought to be the ruler of Virgo, in exaltation in Gemini, in exile in Pisces and in fall in Sagittarius. Keywords associated with Ceres could be order, practical sense, worry, precision, modesty, method, sobriety, motherhood, fertility, the Earth: a kind of a more cerebral Moon... %TEXTES_23%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_24% Pallas is sometimes used in modern Astrology: she represents intelligence, abstract and global thinking talents. It is usually considered to be a determining element in political strategy. %TEXTES_24%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_25% Juno is the asteroid corresponding to the adaptation to the marital partner and to the defence of individual rights; it is thus used in the field of marriage. %TEXTES_25%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_26% Vesta is rarely used and brings the ability to efficiently devote oneself to a cause. %TEXTES_26%\n\nTrue North Node 19\u00b026' \u042f Gemini The North Node (True Node here) represents the goals that must be achieved during life, in the karmic sense according to some traditions. Its position in house indicates in what field an effort is necessary in order to evolve. The North Node is often called the Dragon's head, it is usually considered beneficial, a bit like Jupiter with the planets. The Lunar nodes are fictional points and not actual heavenly bodies: they are the intersections of the Moon with the Ecliptic (the path made by the Sun in its orbit as seen from the Earth). The axis of the Lunar nodes moves 19 degrees each year, namely a bit more than three minutes each day. The South Node is diametrically opposed to the North Node, therefore it faces it (it's not drawn here, it's the same symbol but upside down). It symbolizes what has already been achieved or acquired, in a karmic sense: it's the past from which it's advised to move on in order to progress. The South Node is rather negative, of a Saturnian nature: the experience through suffering. Interpretation of the 19\u00b0 Gemini symbolic degree \"In the middle of the night, two men in uniform holding their horse by the bridle walk side by side. Nearby, three snakes crawl away.\" (Janduz version) Discreet, shrewd, and clear-sighted character endowed with extra-sensory perception. Wealth and fame can be achieved in the military, sports - especially horse riding - science, or pharmaceutical research, most often thanks to the support of powerful friends. Enmities and plots are easily overcome. However, there is a danger that an outstanding success is followed by a sudden ordeal and disgrace. One must be wary of people with a high-pitched voice because they are most likely to have a slanderous tongue and to master the art of calumny. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nTrue Lilith 10\u00b037' \u042f Sagittarius Lilith or the Dark Moon (True Lilith here) represents the uncrossable threshold, taboos, the individual's provocative and fascinating side, including on a sexual level. She symbolizes violence and \"untameability\", the radical and deep-seated refusal to submit. The keywords for Lilith can be sterility, sadism, perversity, castration, sadomasochism, eroticism, orgasm, forbidden fantasies, marginality, cruelty; redemption, illumination, rebelliousness... Lilith's opposite point is called Priapus; it is the Lunar perigee, the position where the Moon is closest to the Earth. It symbolizes man's primitive nature, the horror hidden in our deepest self; masochism, extreme sensuality, impulsiveness, irrationality and excess. Physically speaking, the Dark Moon is the focal point unoccupied by the Earth: it is not a concrete body but a mathematical point. Interpretation of the 10\u00b0 Sagittarius symbolic degree \"A monkey riding a wolf makes funny faces at the tiger crawling behind them.\" (Janduz version) Treacherous, crafty, and violent character devoid of qualms. Objectives are attained through dangerous, cunning, and even cruel strategies. The natal chart indicates whether intelligence and subterfuges are put at the service of noble goals such as the defence of the nation's higher interests, or whether they only serve base personal ambitions. In both cases, enmities abound, and property loss is highly likely. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Firstly, it has nothing to do with fortune! In modern astrology, it is actually used to enhance a planet or angle when in close conjunction with it: it thus amplifies the meaning associated to the point affected by its presence. It is calculated in the following way: Part of Fortune = AS + Moon - Sun (it is the Moons position when the Sun rises) The classical Part of Fortune, of which the calculus method is unchanged whether in a diurnal or nocturnal chart, is usually distinguished from the diurnal/nocturnal Part of Fortune which is calculated by the formula AS + Sun - Moon for a nocturnal chart, and AS + Moon - Sun in a diurnal chart. We currently use the latter formula for our astrological programmes.

Its interpretation is controversial, because certain astrologers pay no attention to it. The Vertex is sometimes considered to be the second Descendant because, like the latter, it is related to communication and exchanges. It has to do with associations and fated encounters, those that are not chosen, and reveals the type of sensitivity and reactivity we have in our dealings with other people: a refined and tolerant way in Libra, straightforward and spontaneous in Aries, etc. %TEXTES_44%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_45% The East Point is a fictitious point at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the East of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir.

From 2007 to 2010, he was the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and the Secretary of State for Justice, appointed as part of Prime Minister Gordon Brown's first Cabinet. He also served as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001, Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 and Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons from 2006 to 2007 under Tony Blair, and is one of only three people to have served in Cabinet continuously from 1997 to 2010 (the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling).\n\nAstrological portrait of Jack Straw (excerpt)\n\nDisclaimer: these short excerpts of astrological charts are computer processed. They are, by no means, of a personal nature. This principle is valid for the 63,426 celebrities included in our database. These texts provide the meanings of planets, or combination of planets, in signs and in houses, as well as the interpretations of planetary dominants in line with modern Western astrology rules. Moreover, since Astrotheme is not a polemic website, no negative aspect which may damage the good reputation of a celebrity is posted here, unlike in the comprehensive astrological portrait.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHere are some character traits from Jack Straw's birth chart. This description is far from being comprehensive but it can shed light on his/her personality, which is still interesting for professional astrologers or astrology lovers.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, you can get at your email address your astrological portrait (approximately 32 pages), a much more comprehensive report than this portrait of Jack Straw.\n\n\n\n\n\nN.B.: as this celebrity's birth time is unknown, the chart is arbitrarily calculated for 12:00 PM - the legal time for his/her place of birth; since astrological houses are not taken into account, this astrological profile excerpt is less detailed than those for which the birth time is known.\n\nThe dominant planets of Jack Straw\n\nWhen interpreting a natal chart, the best method is to start gradually from general features to specific ones. Thus, there is usually a plan to be followed, from the overall analysis of the chart and its structure, to the description of its different character traits.\n\nIn the first part, an overall analysis of the chart enables us to figure out the personality's main features and to emphasize several points that are confirmed or not in the detailed analysis: in any case, those general traits are taken into account. Human personality is an infinitely intricate entity and describing it is a complex task. Claiming to rapidly summarize it is illusory, although it does not mean that it is an impossible challenge. It is essential to read a natal chart several times in order to absorb all its different meanings and to grasp all this complexity. But the exercise is worthwhile.\n\nIn brief, a natal chart is composed of ten planets: two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, three fast-moving or individual planets, Mercury, Venus and Mars, two slow-moving planets, Jupiter and Saturn, and three very slow-moving planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Additional secondary elements are: the Lunar Nodes, the Dark Moon or Lilith, Chiron and other minor objects. They are all posited on the Zodiac wheel consisting of twelve signs, from Aries to Pisces, and divided into twelve astrological houses.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate the importance of each planet. This is what we call identifying the dominant planets. This process obeys rules that depend on the astrologer's sensitivity and experience but it also has precise and steady bases: thus, we can take into account the parameters of a planet's activity (the number of active aspects a planet forms, the importance of each aspect according to its nature and its exactness), angularity parameters; (proximity to the four angles, Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant and Imum Coeli or Nadir, all of them being evaluated numerically, according to the kind of angle and the planet-angle distance) and quality parameters (rulership, exaltation, exile and fall). Finally, other criteria such as the rulership of the Ascendant and the Midheaven etc. are important.\n\nThese different criteria allow a planet to be highlighted and lead to useful conclusions when interpreting the chart.\n\nThe overall chart analysis begins with the observation of three sorts of planetary distributions in the chart: Eastern or Western hemisphere, Northern or Southern hemisphere, and quadrants (North-eastern, North-western, South-eastern and South-western). These three distributions give a general tone in terms of introversion and extraversion, willpower, sociability, and behavioural predispositions.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThen, there are three additional distributions: elements (called triplicity since there are three groups of signs for each one) - Fire, Air, Earth and Water - corresponding to a character typology, modality (or quadruplicity with four groups of signs for each one) - Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable - and polarity (Yin and Yang).\n\nThere are three types of dominants: dominant planets, dominant signs and dominant houses. The novice thinks astrology means only \"to be Aries\" or sometimes, for example, \"to be Aries Ascendant Virgo\". It is actually far more complex. Although the Sun and the Ascendant alone may reveal a large part of the character - approximately a third or a half of your psychological signature, a person is neither \"just the Sun\" (called the sign) nor just \"the first house\" (the Ascendant). Thus, a particular planet's influence may be significantly increased; a particular sign or house may contain a group of planets that will bring nuances and sometimes weaken the role of the Ascendant, of the Sun sign etc.\n\nLastly, there are two other criteria: accentuations (angular, succedent and cadent) which are a classification of astrological houses and types of decanates that are occupied (each sign is divided into three decanates of ten degrees each). They provide some additional informations.\n\nThese general character traits must not be taken literally; they are, somehow, preparing for the chart reading. They allow to understand the second part of the analysis, which is more detailed and precise. It focuses on every area of the personality and provides a synthesis of all the above-mentioned parameters according to sound hierarchical rules.\n\nWarning: when the birth time is unknown, which is the case for Jack Straw, a few paragraphs become irrelevant; distributions in hemispheres and quadrants are meaningless, so are dominant houses and houses' accentuations. Therefore, some chapters are removed from this part.\n\nFor all paragraphs, the criteria for valuation are calculated without taking into account angles and rulerships of the Ascendant and of the Midheaven. The methodology retains its validity, but it is less precise without a time of birth.\n\nElements and Modes for Jack Straw\n\nJack Straw, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.\n\nCheers for communication and mobility, Jack Straw! The predominance of Air signs in your chart favours and amplifies your taste for relations and for all kinds of short trips, whether real (travels) or symbolic (new ideas, mind speculations). You gain in flexibility and adaptability what you lose in self-assertion or in pragmatism.\n\nYour natal chart shows a lack of the Water element, with only 0.00% instead of the average 25%. Whether you are aware of it or not, affective values bring about problems, for you or your close friends. In general, a lack of Water does not necessarily mean that you are unable to love as much as others do. However, you may find it difficult to express the deepness of your heart and of your feelings. In the best cases, you come to terms with it, you adjust, you manage to show more affection or, why not, you pretend to be really affected! In the worst cases, you get into the terrible habit of repressing these essential values and you tend to forget that they are the basis of the richest and strongest bonds between human beings.\n\nThe twelve zodiacal signs are split up into three groups or modes, called quadruplicities, a learned word meaning only that these three groups include four signs. The Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable modes are more or less represented in your natal chart, depending on planets' positions and importance, and on angles in the twelve signs.\n\nThe Fixed mode corresponds to a majority of elements in your chart, Jack Straw, and represents the desire for security and durability: you are able to concretely appreciate a situation and its stability. You definitely prefer to play the role of a loyal, obstinate and hard-working person, rather than to try new and risky experiences - beware, however, not to confuse obstinacy with intransigence. You structure, cement, and strengthen everything you find on your way: it is your nature, although you are not especially interested in swiftness: slow and steady...\n\nAdvertisements\n\nDominants: Planets, Signs and Houses for Jack Straw\n\nThe issue of dominant planets has existed since the mists of time in astrology: how nice it would be if a person could be described with a few words and one or several planets that would represent their character, without having to analyse such elements as rulerships, angularities, houses, etc!\n\nThe ten planets - the Sun throughout Pluto - are a bit like ten characters in a role-play, each one has its own personality, its own way of acting, its own strengths and weaknesses. They actually represent a classification into ten distinct personalities, and astrologers have always tried to associate one or several dominant planets to a natal chart as well as dominant signs and houses.\n\nIndeed, it is quite the same situation with signs and houses. If planets symbolize characters, signs represent hues - the mental, emotional and physical structures of an individual. The sign in which a planet is posited is like a character whose features are modified according to the place where he lives. In a chart, there are usually one, two or three highlighted signs that allow to rapidly describe its owner.\n\nRegarding astrological houses, the principle is even simpler: the twelve houses correspond to twelve fields of life, and planets tenanting any given house increase that house's importance and highlight all relevant life departments: it may be marriage, work, friendship etc.\n\nIn your natal chart, Jack Straw, the ten main planets are distributed as follows:\n\nThe three most important planets in your chart are the Sun, Mercury and Pluto.\n\nOne of the dominant planets in your natal chart is the Sun. He symbolizes will, magnetism, sense of honour and dignity. You are a Solar being, and you often display charismatic and leadership qualities. Your warmth and your persuasive power lead you far away from pettiness. You enjoy thinking big and, consequently, you move forward according to what you decide.\n\nYour Solarian weakness may be related to the sin of pride or to excessive authority. The frontier between pride and vanity is tenuous: be careful not to overstep it and to keep the nobleness of heart that is part of your charm.\n\nWith Mercury among your dominant planets, you are certainly cerebral, nervous, swift, curious, quick-witted, and you love to communicate. Your psychological pattern is intellectual, all the more so since Mercury is important, with its whole set of assets but also of weaknesses, obviously.\n\nYour sensitivity, emotions, and heart's impulses give precedence to thinking, which can lead people to believe that you are a playful and witty but heartless person, intellectualizing situations and juggling with words and numbers whilst ignoring human aspects of things. Of course, it is said that cats always land on their feet - this is your Mercurian strength and your trump card!\n\nYour weakness lies in your nervousness, and you may miss your goal because of your \"over-intellectualization\" that may be detrimental to other kind of energies such as instinct, spontaneity, heart, sensitivity, etc.\n\nWith Pluto as a dominant planet in your chart, you are a magnetic and mighty predator, like the Scorpio sign ruled by this planet, who needs to exert pressure on others in order to \"test\" them. You are always ready to evolve, to risk destruction for reconstruction - including your own - to live more intensely whilst imposing your secret authority on things and on people you encounter.\n\nYou may come across as wicked, cruel or too authoritarian, but actually you only follow your instinct, you sound people out, and you like to exert your domination simply because your vital energy is too powerful to remain inside. You are inclined to be passionate, with hidden motivations. You are sometimes misunderstood but one of your great Plutonian assets is to go successfully through each life ordeal with ever growing strength.\n\nIn your natal chart, the three most important signs - according to criteria mentioned above - are in decreasing order of strength Leo, Libra and Virgo. In general, these signs are important because your Ascendant or your Sun is located there. But this is not always the case: there may be a cluster of planets, or a planet may be near an angle other than the Midheaven or Ascendant. It may also be because two or three planets are considered to be very active because they form numerous aspects from these signs.\n\nThus, you display some of the three signs' characteristics, a bit like a superposition of features on the rest of your chart, and it is all the more so if the sign is emphasized.\n\nWith Leo as a dominant sign, you naturally shine brightly. Your dignity, your sense of honour, and your generosity can almost turn you into a solar mythological hero, a knight or a lord from the ancient times. People may blame you for your selfishness, your pride or your somewhat loud authority, but if you are self-confident, kind-hearted and strong-willed, it surely makes up for your little flaws, as long as they remain moderate...\n\nWith Libra as a dominant sign in your natal chart, you love to please, to charm, and to be likeable. Moreover, you are naturally inclined towards tolerance and moderation, as well as elegance and tact, as if you were meant to please!

He served (1971\u201374) on the Inner London Education Authority and was its chair in 1973, before working as a special adviser to Labour Party cabinet ministers Barbara Castle (1974\u201376) and Peter Shore (1976\u201377). After a brief stint as a television researcher, Straw entered Parliament in 1979 as MP for Castle\u2019s former seat of Blackburn, Lancashire. He rose steadily through Labour\u2019s ranks and was elected to the party\u2019s opposition shadow cabinet in 1987. During the party\u2019s internal ideological conflict in the 1980s, he moved from being a traditional left-winger to becoming a more centrist modernizer. He was the first leading member of the Labour Party to propose that it repeal its socialist commitment\u2014Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution\u2014to the state control of industry. In 1994 Straw managed Tony Blair\u2019s successful campaign to be elected party leader, and one of Blair\u2019s first acts on becoming leader was to win the party\u2019s agreement to rewrite Clause IV.\n\nFollowing Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997, Straw was appointed home secretary. He quickly established his progressive credentials by setting up an inquiry into charges of racism in the London police force, promoting the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and refusing to allow the former Chilean head of state, Augusto Pinochet, to return home following Pinochet\u2019s October 1998 arrest in London. (The arrest followed a request by the Spanish government that Pinochet be extradited to Spain to face charges of murder. He was allowed to return to Chile in March 2000 when a panel of doctors advised that he was unfit to face trial.) Straw upset many progressives, however, by initiating legislation to withdraw the right of some defendants to be tried by a jury, introducing stricter requirements for people seeking political asylum in Great Britain, diluting Labour\u2019s pre-1997 election promise to establish a freedom of information law, and resisting calls to decriminalize the consumption of so-called \u201csoft\u201d drugs, such as marijuana.\n\nIn a 2001 cabinet reshuffle, Straw received the foreign and Commonwealth affairs portfolio. As foreign minister, Straw supported the invasion of Iraq as well as the expansion of the European Union (EU). Despite the latter position, however, Straw was a known skeptic of the euro, the EU\u2019s single currency. Shortly after Labour\u2019s poor showing in the May 2006 local elections, Blair overhauled his cabinet, and Straw was removed as foreign minister and made leader of the House of Commons. Later that year he caused controversy when he stated that Muslim women should not wear full veils. After Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007, Straw was named justice secretary and lord chancellor, thereby becoming the first member of the House of Commons to take up the latter post. The following year he outlined potential reforms to the House of Lords, which included the election of a certain percentage of members and a reduction in the number of lords. In 2009 he sparked debate after stating that oil deals with Libya had played a \u201cvery big part\u201d in the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi\u2014a Libyan convicted of bombing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988\u2014from a Scottish prison. In the general election of 2010 Straw easily retained his Blackburn constituency but lost his cabinet position when Labour was ousted from office. In February 2015 Straw temporarily resigned from the Labour Party after allegations surfaced of his involvement in an influence-peddling scandal that resulted from a sting investigation conducted by Channel Four and The Daily Telegraph. Having already announced in 2013 that he would not stand for reelection, Straw retired from the House of Commons in 2015."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Straw", "page_content": "John Whitaker 'Jack' Straw (born 3 August 1946 in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, England) is a British politician.

I've been staying in Preston and come over on the train to meet him in his flat in Blackburn, the constituency he has held for Labour for 31 years. \"A taxi driver in Preston told me visiting Blackburn was like going back in time,\" I tell him. \"Rude sod,\" says Straw. \"Preston is a brash, soulless place. Write that down!\"\n\nI've been invited to spend the day with Straw, justice secretary, lord chancellor and one of only three ministers to serve in every cabinet since 1997 (Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are the others). He is the great survivor, and plenty of people hold that against him. At 63, he is fighting Blackburn for the eighth time. His obituary was written prematurely in 2005, when his opponents thought his role as the foreign secretary who oversaw the Iraq war would see him defeated in a constituency where almost a third of the electorate are of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin. Against the odds, he won with a majority only slightly trimmed to 8,000.\n\nStraw hopes, if Labour win in May, to remain in his present job to oversee the far-reaching constitutional changes outlined (rather belatedly, given that the party has had 13 years to essay them) in recent weeks: abolition of the Lords, to be replaced by an elected 300-seat Senate, and a referendum on the introduction of an \"alternative vote\" system for elections to the Commons, allowing voters to rank candidates in order of preference. His opponents believe a war waged over nonexistent weapons of mass destruction will be his political epitaph, but he hopes it might be this new constitutional settlement.\n\nThe first person I meet at his flat is a detective, who is tucking a revolver into a holster inside his jacket. \"I've been under house arrest for 13 years,\" Straw tells me as he makes a cup of tea in his messy little kitchen. Doesn't it drive you mad, I ask him. \"It has simply gone with the jobs I've done [he was formerly home secretary and foreign secretary]. You get used to it. You just have to get on with your life. When people become ministers, there's a grave danger they become detached from the public they're serving, and there's a double danger if you're doing a very high-profile job which carries protection.\"\n\nStraw is obsessed with not losing touch. A working-class lad from Essex, he likes to see himself as a man of the people, and earthy, homespun Blackburn \u2013 he worked here for Barbara Castle in the mid-1970s and inherited her seat \u2013 provides his roots. \"You can deal with as many generalisations as you like in the cabinet room,\" he says, \"but there's a very sharp end to being an MP in Blackburn, and the very sharpest end is being in a constituency surgery dealing with individuals' problems.\" That's why he rejects PR for the Commons, believing it would divorce MPs from specific communities.\n\nI sit through four hours of his surgeries in Blackburn, and it's a tour de force. Accompanied by his constituency secretary and two case workers, he rattles through almost 40 cases, spanning asylum, businesses being denied overdrafts, a couple who live close to Blackburn Rovers' ground complaining that fans urinate in their garden, and the extraordinary story of a police raid on an alleged drug dealer. He listens attentively (chewing gum to aid concentration), quickly distinguishes important pieces of information from nonsense, and is tough when he needs to be.\n\nHe and his team eat bananas to fortify themselves in the minibus on the way from the first surgery to the second \u2013 they both take place in community centres with a strong police presence. He had mocked me earlier for not knowing the price of bananas. \"I've always known their price,\" he says. \"It must be something to do with growing up under rationing.\"\n\nStraw also spends a couple of hours at Blackburn College, where he is attending a governors' meeting and giving a talk to a group of politics students about cabinet government. We walk the half-mile or so to the college, with the detectives in tow, Straw saying hello to everyone as he goes (including one surprised-looking passerby twice). A woman harangues him about the Jon Venables case as he passes. \"You should have opened your mouth,\" she shouts. \"We're all parents.\" \"Hang on a minute, do you want to talk about it?\" he responds, pursuing her down the street to argue the point, which he proceeds to do for the next 10 minutes. Straw loves to argue and is famous for carrying his soapbox into Blackburn town centre on a Saturday morning to take on all-comers. \"There were five children in my family and arguing was how we used to entertain ourselves,\" he says.\n\nExuding combativeness\n\n\n\nI ask him later why he felt he had to keep the details of Venables' alleged crime secret. \"I understand why people feel angry about it,\" he says. \"It's been a huge issue across the country, but particularly in the north-west, and people's memories are still very raw, but I had to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice process. That sounds rather pompous or abstract, but it's about ensuring that if there are charges to be laid they can be properly tried. It would least of all be in the interests of the Bulger family if that was not the case. That's why I thought it important to hold the line.\"\n\nStraw exudes combativeness. \"I've just sent Nick Robinson [the BBC's political editor] a text,\" he tells me when we resume our walk to the college, \"asking him if the Sun report that he earns \u00a3275,000 is true. He sends me texts all the time, so I thought I'd send him one. He hasn't replied yet.\" Straw is not a fan of BBC mega-salaries. \"They're destroying the BBC,\" he says. \"Mark Thompson earns far too much. I get \u00a3140,000 a year and I get by. If I'd stayed at the bar or gone into business, I could probably have earned more, but I didn't. I went into politics because I wanted to.\" The son of a Labour-supporting mother, he recalls making his first speech at the age of 13. He appears to have been born in, or perhaps on, that soapbox.\n\nAt the college, he improvises his lecture, arguing that Mrs Thatcher began the move away from cabinet government and Tony Blair, with his fondness for so-called \"sofa government\", accentuated it. Straw distances himself from such informality. \"Although we ended up on opposite sides over the war, Robin Cook and I were firm friends and allies, and we were both strong believers in process and in cabinet government,\" he tells the students. Gordon Brown, he adds, sits somewhere between Thatcher and Blair in his attitude to cabinet, and \"has strengthened the operation of cabinet government very considerably\".\n\nStraw takes questions for 40 minutes, and the first questioner is not going to let him off the hook over the Iraq war. \"In your evidence to the Chilcot inquiry,\" says a young man called Michael, \"you said that if you had opposed military action it wouldn't have gone ahead. Did you feel under pressure from Tony Blair to go along with the invasion?\" \"If I had resigned in March 2003,\" replies Straw, \"it would probably have led to Tony Blair's resignation and the collapse of the government . . . I came to the view that military action was the only answer. Did I feel under pressure from Tony Blair? Not particularly. I made the final speech [in the Commons debate] in favour of military action. I'm not trying to run away from it. You can't make a decision like this out of moral cowardice.\"\n\n'Time will show that Iraq is a much better place'\n\nFor Straw, the war is never far away and in London a few days later, in his modest office on the ninth floor of the Ministry of Justice, I quiz him further about it. \"If you are involved as closely and intensively in a decision to go to war as I was, you have to accept the responsibilities that go with that, and I do,\" he says. \"You can't back away from it. But there was no lie. . . It's too easy for people to say everybody knew there were no WMD. No, everybody did not know that. Poor David Kelly said to me that he believed the war was justified, and plenty of others took that view.\"\n\nHe blames Saddam for not complying with the inspection regime, the Iraqi delegation to the UN for lying, the French for \"poisoning\" relations in the security council. \"I was certain \u2013 and I'm still certain \u2013 that if we'd simply pulled back, the capacity of the international community to deal with Iraq would have been degraded, and [Saddam] would have been re-empowered and got all his programmes going. The Middle East has never been particularly stable, but it would have been worse now. Although this was not the justification for the war and I don't pretend that it was, I think time will show that Iraq is a much better place [for the removal of Saddam].\"\n\nWas it wise to tell the Chilcot inquiry that he, a former lawyer, was used to going against the opinion of his legal advisers? \"It's led to a lot of chuckles here [at the Ministry of Justice],\" he says. \"As home secretary I had enjoyed a very good relationship with the lawyers \u2013 we tried to argue things through. When I went to the Foreign Office, they had not been used to having somebody who was a lawyer. I took a close interest in the management of the place, and I didn't see legal advice as holy writ. It is the attorney [general] who supplies the holy writ; everything else is a contribution to a legal debate.\"\n\nStraw says all this good-naturedly. He is not even put out when I mention Julian Glover's piece about him in the Guardian recently. \"[Straw's] political life, which has echoes of the careers of scores of cabinet ministers, is a parable for the way that keeping your head down and doing the job you've been given \u2013 and funking the moments, big and small, when you should have raised your head and said no \u2013 can lead in the end to a sort of disgrace,\" wrote Glover.\n\nHow did he feel reading that? \"I don't feel it's an accurate assessment, but worse has been written about me. If you do these jobs, people are going to say disobliging things about you.\" And the broader point that he has put his own survival above his conscience? \"It's easy to say that. You could say the same about Alistair Darling or Ken Clarke, one of the great survivors of the Conservative government. But people may survive, funnily enough, because they are quite good at their jobs. You never know, that's a possibility.\"\n\nStraw believes he is a very good minister. When I ask him how he has survived, his answer is all about the mechanics of government rather than the machinations of party politics. \"You have got to have a clear agenda, but equally you've got to be ready to have your mind changed. By clear agenda I don't mean being bone-headed or cloth-eared, so you don't listen to what other people are saying to you, because therein lies damnation. You've got to be able intellectually to do the job. You've got to turn the paper round. That may sound bureaucratic, but you've got to keep the show on the road, and keeping the show on the road is dealing with stuff that comes out of a clear blue sky, dealing with what is apparently routine and then dealing with the development of policy as well \u2013 you've got to keep all three going. One other thing is you've got to have a sixth sense, which I've got [he touches wood as he says it], to spot things that are small but could turn big. Then, when an emergency does arise, working out what the angles are and how you deal with them.\"\n\nReforming the House of Lords\n\nIn his flat in Blackburn, he has a picture of the 1999 cabinet on the wall. Several of its members are now dead; plenty of others have busted careers. Straw is still pushing the paper round, however \u2013 furiously so at the moment, as he develops his blueprint for replacing the Lords. He is keen to publish a detailed set of recommendations, but has been meeting resistance from Lord Mandelson (note the title) in Labour's democratic renewal council, in essence the cabinet masquerading under another name. Straw seems confident of winning this heavyweight battle, and says Lords reform will be a key part of Labour's manifesto. \"For the first time we will be able to go into the election with a clear and detailed set of proposals to replace the Lords with an elected second chamber. In terms of a debate which is 100 years old next year, this is a significant step, building on the way we have reformed the Lords since 1997.\"\n\nHe had hoped to put detailed proposals before parliament before it goes into recess tomorrow, and may yet do so if Mandelson, who it is suggested has doubts about an all-elected second chamber, can be pacified. But even if that is blocked, he insists it will form part of the manifesto. He envisages an all-elected 300-seat house, with elections starting at the general election of 2014/15, in constituencies of a size similar to those in the European elections and using an open-list PR system. The powers of this new chamber, probably called the Senate, will be set out in statute. He believes a commitment to an all-elected second chamber will demonstrate Labour's radicalism and \"underline that it is the party determined to restore faith in parliament\".\n\nI complain that the proposed Senate will be made up of party hacks. \"The Duke of Wellington put up a lot of objections to democracy on the grounds that you get the wrong people elected, the great unwashed, and sometimes this is true,\" he says. Isn't it a bit late to be unveiling this just before an election, in a move that Straw's opponents have dismissed as a political gimmick? \"To get this far is actually astonishing,\" he counters. \"For the first time since the war we've got something of a consensus about the policy, with all three parties committed to, as a minimum, a mainly elected second chamber, but it takes a lot of time.\"\n\n'My mother got me interested in politics'\n\n\n\nStraw was born in 1946, one of five children. His mother, who is the key influence on his life and is now in her late 80s, taught in a primary school; his father had been a conscientious objector in the war and spent time in jail as a result. \"In some ways he was a sad man because this act \u2013 I think it was a wrong thing to do but it was also very courageous \u2013 defined the rest of his life,\" says Straw. \"He was an industrial chemist, but had to take low-paid clerical jobs after the war because people weren't terribly keen on employing him. We lived in a two-bedroom flat in Buckhurst Hill, then moved to a maisonette on a council estate in Loughton. We weren't poverty-stricken, but it was a very pinched existence, though thanks to my ma there were books in the house. My mother got me interested in politics, and most of the people we knew were in the Labour party. It was a Tory area, so that gave you a good fighting spirit.\"\n\nHis parents separated when he was 10. \"My father left and I didn't see him for years,\" says Straw. \"We made contact with him when I was 21. There was in his later life a rapprochement with him, which was good. He died on 1 March 2002 [Straw, ever the lawyer, likes to give specific dates]. I was in India and on the way to Australia, but fortunately my private secretary and my wife got me back and I was able to see him on the day before he died, which was great, and we had a funeral send-off for him which was terrific, with the five of us.\" Straw, a practising Christian, clearly believes in the notion of a good death, of facing it head-on as if it was a political problem capable of solution.\n\nStraw won a scholarship to Brentwood School, where he boarded, putting up with the fact that he was seen as a bit of a yob from a council estate; putting up, too, with being in a dormitory of eight boys. \"I didn't have a bedroom by myself until I was 19,\" he says. He went on to Leeds University to study law, was elected president of the university's union and, in 1969, of the National Union of Students, qualified as a barrister, stood for Labour in the safe Tory seat of Tonbridge in 1974, worked for Barbara Castle and fellow Labour minister Peter Shore, had a brief stint as a researcher on Granada Television's World in Action, and won Blackburn for Labour in 1979, arriving just as the party was entering 18 years of opposition. So great was his disappointment at Labour failing to win the anticipated victory in the 1992 election that he almost quit politics.\n\nIs he sorry never to have made the very top? \"No, I'm not. I don't want you to get the wrong idea that I'd be reticent about that. If somebody came into this room, and said, 'The palace is on the phone, would you like to be prime minister?', I'd say yes, though it's a bit late now. But I'm more than pleased with my career. I've been extraordinarily lucky, given where I came from.\" But didn't he, as Andrew Rawnsley suggests in his book The End of the Party, spend the summer of 2008 plotting to oust Gordon Brown, possibly to install himself as party leader and PM? \"No, look, it was much more inchoate than that,\" he says. \"That period between the Crewe byelection and the Glasgow East byelection was really difficult. There was concern about where the party was. I was not organising a conspiracy \u2013 far from it. I was never directly involved in plotting in the sense in which you describe it. I was caught in a firestorm. Everybody was talking to everybody else. I always had this sense that it wasn't going to go anywhere and we had to stabilise the party, but if you're in the middle of these things they're extremely difficult to handle.\"\n\nThe alleged plot against Gordon Brown\n\nHe says Rawnsley never discussed the alleged plot with him, and that he has yet to read the book. He prefers novels and political histories that take him away from the contemporary cut-and-thrust, and is currently reading Great Expectations, his wife \u2013 the former senior civil servant Alice Perkins \u2013 having given him a complete set of Dickens for their 30th wedding anniversary. He will eventually get round to reading Rawnsley's book, he says, but thinks the title is \"nonsense\" and disputes the much-publicised allegation \u2013 he admits he read the extracts in the Observer \u2013 that Brown is a bully. \"I know Gordon pretty well. I'm not part of his most inner circle, but I've studied him at close quarters for many years and had an office close to his on the shadow cabinet corridor in the early 1990s, and I've never witnessed him bullying anyone or behaving improperly.\" Whether they really get on is hard to fathom. Straw is deaf in his right ear; Brown blind in his left eye. \"He sits to the left of Gordon in cabinet,\" a colleague of Straw's tells me, \"so he is on Brown's blind side and Gordon is on his deaf side.\"\n\nAt the governors meeting at Blackburn College, I am amused that Straw has to sit filling out a police-check form to allow him contact with students. \"It seems a bit de trop, but I'll do my bit,\" he tells the other governors. I notice he uses a fountain pen, and gives his middle name \u2013 Whitaker, which suggests that though his parents were short of money, they weren't short of aspirations for their son. Throughout the day, he is rushing off to photocopy things for me \u2013 the lawyer's faith in documents \u2013 and at one point rather thoughtlessly barges into a class at the college to demand help in finding a photocopier. He is exhausting company \u2013 he makes fun of my lack of knowledge of German politics as well as my ignorance of the price of bananas \u2013 but is surprisingly easy to talk to, not in the least bit intimidating or swaggering despite a tendency to bark \"What?\" every so often because of his partial deafness.\n\n\"Come and meet a mandarin,\" he says at the Ministry of Justice, pulling me into the permanent secretary's office to say hello. Straw has been in the ministerial business for so long, its trappings no longer faze him, and he treats his young team in the constituency and in his personal office at the ministry as if they were chums. In his braces, sharp suit and contact lenses \u2013 he looks younger now than he did in that 1999 cabinet photo \u2013 he comes across as a trendy headmaster at a high-achieving school. State-run, of course, since it is education along with health that he believes are the pillars of the New Labour achievement.\n\nWhat about those who say the three governments of which he has been a key member have failed to match the bright promise of 1997? \"There are always the professionally disappointed,\" he says. \"This is an eternal verity on the left \u2013 that there are always people around waiting to be disappointed.\" Again he cites Blackburn \u2013 a town transformed, with a new hospital, reduced crime, rising educational standards, improved transport links. His constituency aides talk of Blackburn as \"The town that Jack built\", and I see now why he was so annoyed at my Preston taxi driver's remark. In 31 years as an MP and 13 at the heart of government, he believes he has helped pull the town and the country of which it is, in his eyes, a microcosm out of its petrified past.\n\nIn May, we will discover whether the voters agree. The great survivor is hoping for a last hurrah. One day, he says, he will put his life on paper \u2013 the early struggles and the insider's view of the New Labour ascendancy should make for an intriguing read \u2013 but not yet. \"If you start writing your memoirs, it seems as though you've hung up your spurs, and I haven't finished.\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/20/jackstraw", "page_content": "Is Jack Straw a widely-popular and successful home secretary? Or is he an authoritarian opponent of freedom of information and trial by jury, as painted by civil libertarians? The answer to these questions may decide whether he is a contender for the top job if Tony Blair stands down and Gordon Brown fails to unite the cabinet behind him.\n\nThe real answer is that Mr Straw, widely seen as a decent man in politics, is a sure-footed, practical improver and cunning tactician. Nowhere was this clearer than in his handling of the Pinochet imbroglio from October 1998 onwards. The Tory right were seeking to canonise the Chilean ex-dictator while leftwing MPs hoped to crucify him. Mr Straw successfully got Pinochet off his hands and handed him back to Chile.\n\nPart of his reputation as an authoritarian is hardly his fault. The short-lived Cabinet Office minister David Clark's liberating freedom of information white paper, published in 1998 and subsequently watered down, could never have got by the restrictive lord chancellor, Derry Irvine. But Mr Straw took the blame. He also brought in his own much more restrictive version, getting it on the statute books in 2000.\n\nMr Straw has shown similar determination in his effort to limit trial by jury for petty criminals who, he argues, are \"playing the system\" very expensively. He sees this as a practical reform, not a betrayal of principle. He took the same view about legislation allowing the security services to intercept private emails.\n\nMr Straw has been just as pragmatic in accepting cabinet decisions which run against his sympathies. Nobody who knows him doubts he still fervently supports first-past-the-post and had doubts about the closed list system of proportional representation. But he accepted this in Scotland and Wales as part of Tony Blair's \"project\" to cosy up with the Liberal Democrats, for whom he himself has no time.\n\nHe is not in the Blairites inner-circle but bides his time on its outer soft-left fringe. His views derive from a practical, pragmatic examination of his own experience and those of his constituents.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown was worrying about the danger of a skills shortage, as made fashionable by US president Bill Clinton's adviser Robert Reich, Mr Straw privately pointed to the tens of thousands of skilled workers sacked in two recessions.\n\nHis ability to identify with his Blackburn constituents troubled by \"neighbours from hell\" on their council estates came from his own experience as a child on a council estate in Loughton, Essex. His father, Arthur, was an insurance clerk and conscientious objector who had met his mother, a teacher, in the peace pledge union. They were divorced when he was ten and he was brought up by a single mother. \"We had very little money. There were five children and no father but we didn't get into trouble.\"\n\nIf he is strong on anti-racism, announcing an immediate inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case, it is partly because of his experience at Brentwood school where he became deputy head boy but was bullied.\n\nAn Aldermaston marcher at 12, a Labour party member by 15, he started on the sensible left as president of Leeds student union and the national union of students. His ambition for political office was whetted on Islington borough council.\n\nHe gave up the bar to become, at 27, special adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security. He also met his wife Alice Perkins during his time there. She was a high flying junior civil servant, and is currently deputy to Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary. The Straws are the most formidable power couple in Whitehall.\n\nHis time with Barbara Castle left him not only with a wife but also a deep-rooted Euroscepticism. This continued when she was sacked by James Callaghan in 1976. Mr Straw swiftly became adviser to Peter Shore, the Europhobe environment secretary.\n\nWith Mr Shore, he helped found the Labour common market safeguards committee, urging withdrawal from the EEC at Labour's 1980 Wembley conference. He was on Mr Shore's leadership campaign team too in 1980 and again in 1983.\n\nWhen Barbara Castle decided to retire from safe Blackburn, she recommended Jack Straw, who had already contested hopeless Tonbridge, as her parliamentary successor, which he became in 1979.\n\nHis party loyalism is of long standing. He tried to dissuade Tony Benn from contesting the deputy leadership against Denis Healey in 1981. He attacked both the SDP deserters and the radicals who provoked them into deserting. When Militant tried to unseat him at Blackburn, he secured 70% backing for the long procedure to expel the Blackburn Six. After Labour's 1983 defeat he warned that a majority of voters opposed its anti-nuclear defence policies. He later advised that London's loony-left councils were making the party unelectable.\n\nAs Labour's education spokesman 1987-92, Mr Straw increasingly fought a two-front war against Kenneth Baker and the Tories facing him and against the Bennite hard-left \"flat earthers\" behind him. It was then that he formed an alliance with Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in opposition to a joint slate for the shadow cabinet linking the soft-left Tribune group and the hard-left Campaign group of Tony Benn.\n\nAs education spokesman, he kept the teachers' unions at arms' length and insisted on frequent testing, high educational standards, quality control and consumer choice. He was, after all, a teacher's son.\n\nHe was the first in the \"reform Clause IV\" field with his 1993 pamphlet, 'Policy and Ideology', angering Labour's leader, John Smith, who thought it was a dead issue. He also advocated downgrading the monarchy to Scandinavian proportions.\n\nWhen Tony Blair succeeded to the leadership in 1994, he handed over to Jack Straw his portfolio of shadow home secretary. Famously, Mr Straw attacked aggressive beggars and squeegee merchants. But he failed to make an expected triumph over home secretary Michael Howard's sacking of Derek Lewis, the prison services chief, because of Tory heckling and his own tinnitus. To his embarrassment Mr Blair even took to the despatch box to challenge Mr Howard. Yet only months later, Mr Straw was doing Mr Howard's job.\n\nHe has done it ever since, a reassuring figure in the New Labour pantheon: confident, able and modestly ambitious. These are traits which may yet put him in the running to enter Number 10.\n\nAsk Aristotle about Jack Straw"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/37c796bc4f9f4a48b4f5b15687888cfb", "page_content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Jack Straw, a former British foreign secretary and an elder statesman of the opposition Labour Party, said Friday that he will not seek re-election to Parliament.\n\nStraw, 67, has been a legislator in Britain\u2019s House of Commons for 34 years and also served as home secretary and justice secretary.

He was also the minister who handled the incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights into British law. But he got little credit for that; it merely damned him in the eyes of conservatives who see the convention as a foreign plot to let crooks go free and give IRA gunmen compensation for not being arrested with kid gloves. And now, hey presto, Jack Straw has changed hats: out, a week ago, went the bug-eyed but Europhile Robin Cook, and in came Mr Straw to speak for Britain to the world. In particular, to the EU\u2014a union for which, until now, he has expressed no visible enthusiasm whatever.\n\nSo what does Tony Blair's new foreign secretary bring to the council table? Could his appointment be a heavy hint to other EU countries that their recalcitrant British partners plan to be even more stroppy than before? No. Whatever Mr Blair's reasons for shifting Mr Cook\u2014the latter's friends and enemies will offer you quite a menu\u2014this was not one of them. In Britain's general election on June 7th, Mr Blair has just ground into the dust a Conservative Party whose slogan was \u201cIn Europe, not run by Europe\u201d, and even that by the end of the campaign had begun to sound almost Europhiliac, set against the off-message hostility of many Tories, not least Margaret Thatcher. In contrast, the EU-ardent Liberal Democrats are riding high, whereas the United Kingdom Independence Party, although it has three members in the European Parliament, is not even visible in the dust. At this moment, Mr Blair no more needs to pander to Britain's Eurosceptics than to the Grand Cham of Tartary.\n\nMr Blair, however, was not born yesterday. He knows that moments pass, and that the British public, little as it loves the Tories, loves the EU's single currency even less. And he is sworn, at some unspecified date, to a referendum on that issue. There is also one force that he need not pander to, but cannot ignore: his finance minister (and rival) Gordon Brown, who will accept membership of the euro-zone when the Treasury's five economic tests for doing so are met, maybe, but not a day before. Who better to put in charge of Britain's European policy than a loyal ally, and one who cannot be accused of letting any private passion for the EU outweigh his duty to the public interest?\n\nNot that Mr Straw's career, on the face of it, reveals any passion for foreign affairs, in any direction. Twenty years ago, it is true, he was a stalwart of Labour's anti-European wing. Yet in the string of posts as spokesman on this and that which he held from soon after he entered Parliament in 1979 until he won high office in 1997, none looked out to the wide world. Here, however, is an adaptable man. Born in 1946, as a schoolboy he was a marcher against Britain's nuclear weapons, in the 1970s a councillor in a London borough widely known as \u201cthe Socialist Republic of Islington\u201d. By the mid-1980s he was, accurately, denouncing his party's then anti-nuclear stance and its \u201cloony-left\u201d local councils as making it unelectable. As home secretary, he let Britain's police arrest Augusto Pinochet in 1998, but he was happy later, on grounds of health, to let the general go.\n\nAnd whatever his lack of passion, ignorant of the EU Mr Straw is not. When its interior ministers have met, there for four years he has been\u2014\u201cco-operative, innovative, constructive, better prepared than almost any other British minister,\u201d says a British Euro-addict. A \u201cformidable\u201d member of the ministerial council, says an EU commissioner. For a senior politician, Mr Straw is unusually ready to listen. Few doubt that, having listened, he will be rapidly in command of his wider briefs\u2014 though it will take some doing to match Mr Cook's grasp of the Balkans\u2014before deciding, firmly, what's best for Britain and (how could there be a difference?) for Labour and Jack Straw.\n\nDown-to-earth, up from Essex\n\nDo not mock: that happy coincidence of interests might be a real one. Britain's voters may be right or wrong about what is best for them, but they and Mr Straw think much alike. They do not want asylum-seekers in their country or liberalism in their interior ministry. They value the jury system, but they value a \u201cguilty\u201d verdict on the guilty more. The all-informed press that most of them want is the tabloids. Likewise, they do not want to be run from Brussels, but they are not mad keen on Whitehall either. And though they prefer the pound to the euro, few of them, witness the election, would go to the barricades to save it.\n\nNot by chance does Mr Straw share this down-to-earth outlook. He is that rarity in the first Blair government, a very English Englishman: son of a clerk and a teacher, pacifists both; council-estate childhood just outside London, the Essex side, the one where the nobs do not live; parental divorce; then the usual path upward for the unusual cut-above-working-class youth of the 1960s\u2014state-aided independent school, red-brick (Leeds) university, student politics, the Bar, political aide in 1974 to flaming-red Barbara Castle at the mud-grey department of social services. Divorced and remarried himself by 32, Mr Straw knows how the real world lives. If there is a whiff of \u201cold Labour\u201d about him, it is that of practical social betterment, not the dream-world leftism that (as Islington must have taught him) seldom achieves it.\n\nOrganised betterment, that is: Mr Straw is a manager, a man of performing government. (\u201cFreedom of information? That's for oppositions,\u201d as one watcher quotes him.) How high he may hope, at 54, to manage himself, who knows? He keeps his cards close to his chest.

He served (1971\u201374) on the Inner London Education Authority and was its chair in 1973, before working as a special adviser to Labour Party cabinet ministers Barbara Castle (1974\u201376) and Peter Shore (1976\u201377). After a brief stint as a television researcher, Straw entered Parliament in 1979 as MP for Castle\u2019s former seat of Blackburn, Lancashire. He rose steadily through Labour\u2019s ranks and was elected to the party\u2019s opposition shadow cabinet in 1987. During the party\u2019s internal ideological conflict in the 1980s, he moved from being a traditional left-winger to becoming a more centrist modernizer. He was the first leading member of the Labour Party to propose that it repeal its socialist commitment\u2014Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution\u2014to the state control of industry. In 1994 Straw managed Tony Blair\u2019s successful campaign to be elected party leader, and one of Blair\u2019s first acts on becoming leader was to win the party\u2019s agreement to rewrite Clause IV.\n\nFollowing Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997, Straw was appointed home secretary. He quickly established his progressive credentials by setting up an inquiry into charges of racism in the London police force, promoting the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and refusing to allow the former Chilean head of state, Augusto Pinochet, to return home following Pinochet\u2019s October 1998 arrest in London. (The arrest followed a request by the Spanish government that Pinochet be extradited to Spain to face charges of murder. He was allowed to return to Chile in March 2000 when a panel of doctors advised that he was unfit to face trial.) Straw upset many progressives, however, by initiating legislation to withdraw the right of some defendants to be tried by a jury, introducing stricter requirements for people seeking political asylum in Great Britain, diluting Labour\u2019s pre-1997 election promise to establish a freedom of information law, and resisting calls to decriminalize the consumption of so-called \u201csoft\u201d drugs, such as marijuana.\n\nIn a 2001 cabinet reshuffle, Straw received the foreign and Commonwealth affairs portfolio. As foreign minister, Straw supported the invasion of Iraq as well as the expansion of the European Union (EU). Despite the latter position, however, Straw was a known skeptic of the euro, the EU\u2019s single currency. Shortly after Labour\u2019s poor showing in the May 2006 local elections, Blair overhauled his cabinet, and Straw was removed as foreign minister and made leader of the House of Commons. Later that year he caused controversy when he stated that Muslim women should not wear full veils. After Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007, Straw was named justice secretary and lord chancellor, thereby becoming the first member of the House of Commons to take up the latter post. The following year he outlined potential reforms to the House of Lords, which included the election of a certain percentage of members and a reduction in the number of lords. In 2009 he sparked debate after stating that oil deals with Libya had played a \u201cvery big part\u201d in the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi\u2014a Libyan convicted of bombing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988\u2014from a Scottish prison. In the general election of 2010 Straw easily retained his Blackburn constituency but lost his cabinet position when Labour was ousted from office. In February 2015 Straw temporarily resigned from the Labour Party after allegations surfaced of his involvement in an influence-peddling scandal that resulted from a sting investigation conducted by Channel Four and The Daily Telegraph.

In this photo we show you his maiden speech, made on the 13th June 1979.\n\nFollowing Labour\u2019s landslide in 1997 he was appointed Home Secretary and has since served as Foreign Secretary (2001 \u2013 2006) and Leader of the House of Commons (2006 \u2013 2007). Jack served as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice from 2007 \u2013 2010. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the seventeenth century not to be a peer. Despite having held high office for many years Jack continued to be a committed and visible constituency MP, regularly taking questions on all issues standing on his soapbox in the town centre, holding several surgeries a month around the town and running many neighbourhood residents meetings throughout Blackburn.\n\nSylvia Liddle (now Roe Lee ward Councillor) campaigning with Jack Straw on King William Street in the 1980s (courtesy of Lancashire Telegraph\n\nJack is married with one son and one daughter and two grandchildren.

Jack was famous across the country for holding regular open-air meetings in Blackburn town centre \u2013 he was the only MP to do so.

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010, the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw's maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family. Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\"\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\" He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978 he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006 Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. They have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nHe supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015 He was Given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Jack_Straw", "page_content": "This article is a stub.

In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family). Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nStraw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice Straw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\".\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nStraw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001. Straw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn Straw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\" He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978, he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006, Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. The couple have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nStraw supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015, he was given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Jack_Straw", "page_content": "Jack Straw (born 3 August 1946) is a British politician who was the Member of Parliament for Blackburn from 1979 to 2015. Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary throughout Brown's premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention of standing down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.[1]\n\nImpropriety\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and the Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015, the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised the conduct of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph.\n\nNo Sir or Lordship\n\nIn February 2016, The Guardian reported \"Jack Straw to be 'denied knighthood and peerage' under Jeremy Corbyn\" explaining that Straw's support for Iraq War and comments in \u2018cash for access\u2019 sting among reasons for denial:\n\nHaving served as home secretary, foreign secretary and then lord chancellor, Straw is understood to have been lined up for a seat in the Lords during the final days of Ed Miliband\u2019s period as party leader. But he suspended himself from party membership last February after being secretly filmed by undercover reporters while apparently offering his services to a private company for cash. This prevented an offer of a peerage at the time.\n\nAlthough Straw was subsequently cleared of misconduct by the parliamentary standards watchdog, his chances of a seat in the Lords are said to have disappeared after Corbyn\u2019s election as leader in September:\n\n\u201cThe chances of Jeremy awarding him with either a knighthood or a peerage are close to zero,\u201d said one senior party source, before adding: \u201cActually, they are zero.\u201d\n\nStraw, who stood down as MP at the last general election, did not respond to requests for comment. He is currently serving on a panel that is reviewing the Freedom of Information Act, although his appointment was criticised by some, as he has been a vocal opponent of the act.\n\nOn Monday, the Guardian reported that Straw led two of the Whitehall departments most likely to reject public requests for information. Straw\u2019s ministries never ranked higher than 15 out of 21 government departments in terms of releasing information in full, according to a Guardian analysis of government-wide figures.\n\nAccording to party sources, there are several reasons for the decision not to nominate the former minister for a peerage: his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq; a damages claim that is being brought against him by a Libyan couple who were \u201crendered\u201d to one of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s prisons; an ongoing inquiry by Westminster\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) into that and other rendition allegations; and the words that were captured by the undercover reporter.\n\nIt appears Straw\u2019s support for the war in Iraq counts most heavily against him among the Labour leader and his closest supporters.\n\nSting operation\n\nBoth Straw and the Tory MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the then chair of the ISC, were caught in a sting mounted by the Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 in February last year. The transcript of the exchanges indicated that Straw hoped for a seat in the Lords. The two men were filmed as they offered to use their positions as politicians in return for payments of thousands of pounds from a fictitious Chinese company. At one point, one of the reporters asked Straw about the implications of his leaving the House of Commons. Straw replied: \u201cWell, the implications are that I can do a lot more for you.\u201d\n\nA Telegraph reporter then asked: \u201cAh ha, in what way?\u201d\n\nJS: \u201cWell, it\u2019s not subject to regulation. Obviously ... I\u2019m still the same person \u2013 I mean, if you are a member of parliament and you have commercial interests, you have to be so careful ... if I was ever to stand up in the House of Commons and talk about sugar, I could end up being disqualified \u2026 Because there are very strict rules against advocating on behalf of companies who are paying you.\u201d\n\nTel: \u201cRight.\u201d\n\nJS: \u201c ... Well obviously if I\u2019m not in the House of Commons, I\u2019m not in that position. I could end up in the House of Lords, so you\u2019re aware ... you may have seen that ...\u201d\n\nTel: \u201cThat\u2019d be good. You mentioned.\u201d\n\nJS: \u201c ... I mean there\u2019s speculation in the paper at the moment \u2013 no one has said anything to me officially. But the rules there are different and plenty of people have commercial interests there.\u201d\n\nTel: \u201cAh great, so you\u2019ll be able to help us a lot more potentially?\u201d\n\nJS: \u201cI\u2019ll be able to help you more, Claire, I\u2019ll be able to help you more.\u201d\n\nBoth politicians denied any wrongdoing, and said that they had acted in accordance with parliamentary rules. Rifkind was suspended from his parliamentary party while Straw suspended himself. Senior Labour sources say Straw had been in line for a peerage until this point.\n\nIn September, Conservative sources briefed journalists that Rifkind would be \u201cnear the top of the list\u201d the next time David Cameron proposed a list of new political peers.\n\nThe Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Kathryn Hudson, and the House of Commons standards committee cleared both of any wrongdoing and criticised the way the exchanges had been reported.\n\nBoth the Telegraph and Channel 4 were angered by the commissioner\u2019s conclusions. The Telegraph published a leader which condemned them as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and \u201cshameful\u201d, while Channel 4 reported itself to the regulator, Ofcom.\n\nIn December, Ofcom found that the reporting was of significant public interest and did not unfairly represent the two politicians. It also concluded that the undercover filming was \u201cproportionate and warranted\u201d.\n\nRendition\n\nA damages claim is being brought against Straw by Abdelhakim Belhadj, who was abducted in Thailand and flown to Tripoli along with his pregnant wife, Fatima Bouchar, in March 2004, with the assistance of MI6 and the CIA.[2] Straw was foreign secretary at the time.\n\nA cache of secret documents that detailed the involvement of MI6\u2019s then head of counter-terrorism, Mark Allen, in that rendition was discovered during the 2011 Libyan revolution. After Straw gave an interview to the BBC in which he said that \u201cno foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time\u201d, well-placed sources told the Guardian that the rendition operations were \u201cministerially authorised government policy\u201d.\n\nGovernment lawyers are arguing that the claim should be thrown out on the grounds that the case will involve the acts of other countries.

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010, the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct. Ofcom in contrast judged that the journalists' work had been fair and of significant public interest.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family). Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nIn 1966, he was elected as chair of Leeds University Union Labour Society by a majority consisting largely of members of the Leeds University Union Communist Society who had joined Labour Society immediately before the Annual General Meeting. Led by Straw, Labour Society disaffiliated itself from the Labour Party and changed its name to the Leeds University Union Socialist Society.\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\".\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nThe high court in London agreed in January 2017, against the wishes of the Conservative Party (UK) government, to hear a judicial review against the decision to not prosecute Straw and former head of MI6 Mark Allen (businessman) in the case of the abduction and alleged torture of Iraqi politician Abdel Belhaj.Belhaj and his pregnant wife were abducted in Bangkok in 2004 after a tip-off from Mi6 and were held for seven years in Tripoli where, Belhaj alleges, he and his wife were repeatedly tortured. The English Crown Prosecution Service had decided in June 2016 to not prosecute any members of the UK government citing a \"lack of evidence\" and the challenge to that decision resulted in the decision to allow a judicial review.\n\nAfter a successful action by the Conservative Party (UK) government the high court announced in July 2017 that the judicial review would be held in private and that evidence relating to the defence by the government and security services would neither be made available to Belhaj or his legal team nor made public. Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that \"I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi\u2019s Libya. It took about a half hour, and I never saw any of the evidence against me. Later a guard came to my cell and tossed in a red jumpsuit \u2013 that was how I found out that the secret court had sentenced me to die\" and continued \"what kind of a trial will it be if we put in a mountain of evidence and government officials can simply refuse to answer us\". In response, Straw stated that he was opposed to extraordinary rendition and had not been complicit in it.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\"\n\nHe said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\"\n\nResponding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph.\n\nStraw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nMedia regulator Ofcom however took a different view, judging in December 2015 that the journalists had investigated a matter of significant public interest and that their presentation had been fair.\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978, he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006, Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. The couple have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nStraw supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015, he was given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "https://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2017-starr-forum-brexit-europe-and-trump", "page_content": "Starr Forum: Brexit, Europe, and Trump\n\nApril 6, 2017\n\nWatch the video of this event\n\n\n\nSpeaker: John Whitaker \"Jack\" Straw, Former Foreign Secretary, U.K.\n\nJohn Whitaker \u201cJack\u201d Straw is an English politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackburn from 1979 to 2015.
