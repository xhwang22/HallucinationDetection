{"Tathagata Satpathy has been a vocal critic of the central government's policies on language and culture.": [{"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/tathagata-satpathy-interview-cong-defamation-rahul-gandhi-8542406/", "page_content": "With Congress leader Rahul Gandhi convicted of criminal defamation last month, and subsequently disqualified as Lok Sabha MP, there have been calls for a review of the criminal defamation legislation in India. It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct. Also, must admit I have personally not felt fear or threatened, as yet."}, {"url": "https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tathagata-satpathy-quits-721624.html", "page_content": "Senior BJD MP Tathagata Satpathy on Tuesday announced quitting politics to return to full-time journalism even as he emphasised that he has no \"ill-will\" against Odisha Chief Minister and party chief Naveen Patnaik.\n\nSatpathy, who represents Dhenkanal in Odisha and edits Odia newspaper 'Dharitri' and English daily 'Orissa Post', will not be contesting again as he wanted to focus more on the newspapers he edits and spend more time with family.\n\n\"There is no ill-will against the BJD or the party chief.

Our MPs never obstructed the functioning of Parliament. They have not only raised issues exclusive to the state but also participated in discussions that had national impact. Under the leadership of Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik, who has a national outlook, we have tried to perform as a responsible party.\n\nWas the BJD an opposition party or an ally of the ruling BJP?\n\nWe supported the Union government on issues that were pro-India. We opposed wrong policies like the Land Acquisition Bill, violence by cow vigilante groups, the JNU issue and many more.\n\nIn the last few months, many regional party leaders including some CMs have been trying to stitch a coalition of opposition parties. But Patnaik has not stepped out of Odisha. What does it mean in the context of the upcoming election?\n\nI have not spoken to Patnaik regarding this matter. But if every CM took the responsibility for the well-being of their citizens, there will be effective governance. This is not to say that Patnaik has resolved every problem. He has focussed on providing clean and effective governance and has been successful to a great extent. That is why the people of the state have repeatedly elected him. Patnaik is not a run-of-the-mill politician. He has carved out a niche for himself. As far as the upcoming elections are concerned, Patnaik is focussing only on the state. The BJD will continue to work for the development of Odisha.\n\nIs the Lok Sabha election not your priority?\n\nPolitically, Patnaik moves with equal vigour for both (Assembly and general elections). His campaign style is unique \u2014 he spends a day at a parliamentary constituency and during that time he covers all the assembly areas in it. He travels by helicopter and the Lok Sabha candidate accompanies him. The candidate for the particular Assembly seat joins him at the venue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat will the BJD focus on in its election campaign?\n\nThe pro-poor and pro-farmer policies and their implementation. We will also show to the people that whenever the Congress and the BJP were in power at the Centre, Odisha was neglected even though it contributed substantially to the exchequer. We are not considered politically powerful because we have lesser number of seats in the Lok Sabha.\n\nWho is the BJD\u2019s primary opponent?\n\nThe BJP is facing a downward slide at the national level. I can see a perceptible change in the popularity of the party in Odisha also. The BJP is on a decline and the Congress is not gaining. So the fight will be against the BJP and Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf no party manages to get a majority in the Lok Sabha polls, what will be the BJD\u2019s stance?\n\nAs far as I know, Patnaik will always try to maintain an equidistance. But I would also underline that he will ensure a stable government at the Centre. He will not maintain equidistance at the cost of the Union of India. Whichever government comes to power, if it serves the people of this country and takes care of the interests of Odisha, the BJD will support.\n\nDo you think the KALIA (Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation) scheme can resolve the agrarian crisis in the state?\n\nThe Kalia scheme is a meticulously planned programme. It covers farm labourers, sharecroppers and landowning farmers. In fact, farm labourer will get more money than land-owning farmers. But I am aware that the scheme alone cannot resolve the crisis. It\u2019s true that we have been in power for nearly two decades. The allegation that we have not created enough cold storage is not acceptable. These time-consuming and capital-intensive projects cannot be built by the states alone."}, {"url": "https://thewire.in/politics/tathagata-satpathy-bjd-lok-sabha-modi-bjp", "page_content": "Tathagata Satpathy is one of the more articulate opposition members in the Lok Sabha who is heard with interest by all sides. A senior Biju Janata Dal leader and chief whip of the party in the House, 61-year-old Satpathy has the knack of saying things in such a way that he is heard by his critics and admirers alike.\n\nIn the recently concluded monsoon session, Satpathy, who is also the editor of the widely circulated Oriya daily Dharitri and the English daily Orissa Post, took a dig at the \u2018cow worshipers\u2019 in the ruling side, telling them plainly that they should learn to recognise their mother as the Jersey variety found in abundance at present cannot be called the \u201choly Indian cow\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with The Wire, he laments that those who came to power in New Delhi by using the vehicle of democracy are now attempting to break it down. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to maintain the vehicle that has brought them from Ayodhya to Delhi.\u201d\n\nA fourth-term Lok Sabha MP, Satpathy says he does not buy that there is no alternative to Narendra Modi in 2019. He hopes for the arrival of the Indian spring in politics and is confident of the re-emergence of the regional parties. He claims that even their joining forces could not be ruled out though the picture at present is \u201chazy\u201d.\n\n\u201c2019 is an open field. What can be predicted is not worth predicting. What cannot be predicted is most likely what seems impossible now.\u201d\n\nExcerpts:\n\nHow do you see the scenario in 2019 Lok Sabha polls as BJP looks unstoppable since the opposition parties have failed to get their act together so far?\n\nA lot of people say BJP may go in for snap polls. I disagree somewhat with this assessment. The people leading BJP are well aware that polls before time create an atmosphere not conducive to those who summon the polls. We saw this in 2004 and many times in the past 70 years.\n\nSo 2019 is an open field. What can be predicted is not worth predicting. What cannot be predicted is most likely what seems impossible now.\n\nBut, there is no opposition unity now?\n\nIf you remember, in 1977 Indira Gandhi seemed the strongest, the most powerful, and obviously because of the Emergency not worth messing with. And since there were no opposition leaders worth their salt at that time, the outcome was considered predictable by many.\n\nHowever, one thing I remember was that an average Indian was praising Indira Gandhi and keeping quiet when asked about others. I sense a similar situation of bhakts praising their leader today, although the bhakts are also becoming somewhat feeble.\n\nBut BJP chief Amit Shah is being hailed as \u2018Chanakya\u2019 after the party\u2019s landslide in Uttar Pradesh, suggesting thereby that New Delhi will be retained via Lucknow again.\n\nI will not be the competent person to comment on any individual. But then in the same breath one must admit that Uttar Pradesh over the past few decades had a very muddled and tumultuous politics. People of UP probably wanted to check out an alternative and they did what they did. To take credit for people\u2019s decision is like a windsock that blows in the same direction that wind blows.\n\nAt the end of three years of Narendra Modi dispensation, how do you assess the NDA\u2019s achievements and failures? Would you see glass as half full?\n\nAfter three years, the BJP government looks to have fully emptied the glass. I would give only the example of Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, which was touted as the pet project of the prime minister.\n\nToday, most of the BJP MPs have refrained from choosing one particular village in their respective constituencies. Similarly, one has to look at Swachh Bharat programme for which all of us are paying through our nose in form of hefty cess in every single transaction. Instead of making people aware about cleanliness, if you start taking money, then it becomes your sole responsibility to ensure cleanliness everywhere. If you want to see how effective the Swachh Bharat programme is, all one needs to do is go in and around New Delhi railway stations.\n\nBut the government claims that it has made a surgical strike on corruption through demonetisation and ushering in GST.\n\nI have yet to see how demonetisation has helped the economy. GST is not unique to India, but what is unique is multiple layers of taxes. That \u2018one nation, one tax\u2019 slogan is obviously a big sham. Today\u2019s reports that the industrial output has dipped to 2% as against 7.1% in same April-June quarter in 2016 should be an indicator of how helpful demonetisation and GST have been for our people.\n\nBJP is suggesting that when Narendra Modi has to only contend with Rahul Gandhi, then there is no challenge to it in 2019. Where is the option they ask. Your comments.\n\nPeople do not always look for a single individual when they want to escape from the yoke of one individual.\n\nIt seems you do not see much relevance of Congress in the next elections.\n\nI see re-emergence of regional parties which may be the only path out of a non-democratic attitude at the Centre. So it is not necessarily an alternative individual or the Congress that can be a threat. It could be a group of people willing to lead a pro-democracy movement. Let us think of an Indian spring.\n\nBut regional parties are getting decimated as we saw in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, there is politics of intimidation by Modi-Shah against them.\n\nJust that some regional parties had become complacent and they had to take a beating. I am sure all of them including SP (Samajwadi Party) and BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) will tie their shoe laces and will be fighting fit in the very near future. Even joining of regional forces may not be ruled out at this moment even though the picture may seem a bit hazy today.\n\nBut you have seen that the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has developed cold feet.\n\nNot every regional party is like Nitish Kumar and his JD(U). It is fair to change political partners but never when you are elected in one partnership and you change mid-course.\n\nIf Nitish Kumar would have called for elections and gone with BJP that would have been a sign of a true democrat. Today it becomes easy to label such actions with a negative colour.\n\nSunil Gatade is a senior journalist.\n\nNote: This article was erroneously credited to M.K. Venu earlier.

The present law actually mandates a system wherein people can be jailed for speaking their minds. I have decided to move a private member's bill in the winter session (in November-December),\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe MP from Dhenkanal in Odisha maintained that lately he has been also provoked by \"two contradictory judgements\" on defamation laws.\n\n\n\n\"In one case, the Supreme Court, on the request of petitioners Subramanian Swamy, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, considered the validity of the existing law and said it is constitutional. But in another case, the apex court counselled Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa to understand that public figures must face criticism. I am looking for more clarity,\" Satpathy said.\n\n\n\nIn its ruling in May, the apex court had noted that \"the right to freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right\" and that freedom of expression has to be \"balanced with the other person's right to reputation\", he said, but in August it said differently on Jayalalithaa's petition, pointing out that the criminal defamation law should not be misused.\n\n\n\nMaintaining that the existing laws have been \"generally abused\", he said that, in his bill, he is trying to focus on three basic features: \"Remove criminality, protect reputation and codify and strengthen civil proceedings as the lower courts, in the absence of effective guidelines, create problems for subordinate judges to process cases.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are so many inherent contradictory issues in the defamation law. One can file both criminal and civil suits. The defamation amount is left to anybody's wild imagination. One popular news magazine was sued for Rs 500 crore. Is that magazine worth that huge amount?\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy, who has a penchant for taking as a compliment words like \"maverick\" hurled at him, said: \"As editor and publisher of my newspaper 'Dharitri', after a five-year defamation case in court, I was fined Rs 50,000 and jailed for six months.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether his decision to push the bill would seek to protect the media as, on a number of occasions, defamation cases are filed against journalists and media organisations, Satpathy said, albeit in a lighter vein: \"It is just the opposite. Actually, I want to protect the rich and my politician friends from you all bad journalists.\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy maintained that on the broader level, he looks at the issue of need for changes in the defamation law from a social perspective, saying: \"If my suggestions are accepted and changes are brought about, this will go a long way in strengthening the judicial process vis-a-vis freedom of expression.\"\n\n\n\n\"So far the reforms we talk about are confined to the economic paradigm only. But we must note, we live in a society and not in an economy per se. So, unless we bring social reforms, we cannot have a sound legal system which would ultimately make economic reforms sustainable,\" he contended.\n\n\n\nHe said the initial response on his move from members of parliament has been overwhelming. \"I have got good response and MPs have assured cooperation. I have also spoken to (Union Law Minister) Ravi Shankar Prasad and (BJP MP) Subaramanian Swamy, who happens to be at the receiving end of defamation laws,\" he said.\n\n\n\n(Nirendra Dev can be contacted at nirendra.n@ians.in)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bjd-mp-tathagata-satpathy-quits-active-politics-to-refocus-on-journalism-5612355/", "page_content": "Four-time MP and BJD\u2019s chief whip in the outgoing 16th Lok Sabha Tathagata Satpathy on Tuesday announced his retirement from active politics.\n\nThe MP from Dhenkanal said he would not contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe reason, he said, was his desire to go back to journalism. \u201cThere is a need for more fearless voices in journalism now,\u201d Satpathy, owner and editor of leading Odia-language newspaper Dharitri, told The Indian Express.\n\n\u201cDistancing myself from politics to refocus on journalism,\u201d Satpathy said. \u201cI realised that politics is not the only means to support people.

While India does not have an existing legislation for net neutrality, TRAI has come up with a consultation paper that seeks views of the public on the matter. The debate, which has whipped up enormous intensity in the last few weeks, is supported by online petitions like this one on change.org which has already garnered more than 1,00,000 signatures.\n\nIn his letter, Satpathy argues that he uses the internet in different ways, by using messaging apps to keep contact with his staff, using cloud services to prepare documents and video calling to keep in touch with his constituents.\n\n\u201cInternet forms an integral part of how I do my work, therefore I see this move by TRAI as a threat to my functioning as a representative,\u201d the BJD MP writes in his letter.\n\nHe also argues in his letter that charging separately for over-the-top services will be seen as restricting the access to internet. Depicting TRAI\u2019s move as going against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s dream of a digital India, Satpathy writes that the step will be against the \u201cdesires of those who wish to make India a modern nation.\u201d\n\nThe letter talks about how the net neutrality principle is not an \u2018elitist\u2019 problem as it also affects people with affordable smartphones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are a growing country and we should have proper laws in place, not to regulate, but to encourage the use of internet,\u201d he writes.\n\nRead Satpathy\u2019s full letter below."}, {"url": "https://www.oneindia.com/politicians/tathagata-satpathy-34879.html", "page_content": "A Journalist by Profession turned Politician is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.
