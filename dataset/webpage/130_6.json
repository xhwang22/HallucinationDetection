{"Bill Brown established himself as Celtic's first-choice goalkeeper and made over 500 appearances in all competitions.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/07/guardianobituaries.football", "page_content": "The goalkeeper Bill Brown, who has died aged 73, played a major part in Tottenham Hotspur's achievement of the Championship and FA Cup double in 1960-61, the first double of the 20th century. He was also capped 28 times for Scotland.\n\nBorn in Arbroath, he had played forward as a schoolboy, but when he joined the Carnoustie Juveniles club he went into goal and stayed there throughout his career.\n\nIn 1948, he was signed as a \u00a37 a week part-time professional by Dundee, to the displeasure of his dairyman father, who insisted he learn a trade. Brown complied by training as an electrical engineer. His sporting life could have ended prematurely when he broke his nose and jaw and fractured a cheekbone in a trial for the Scotland youth team, but he recovered.\n\nSix-foot-tall Brown established himself as an outstanding goalkeeper with Dundee, giving the lie to the English belief that Scottish keepers were a joke. He was agile, commanding and courageous, never flamboyant. He did his national service in the RAF, and represented it in goal. On demobilisation he became a full time professional at Dundee, much admired by his manager, former Rangers and Scotland centre-forward Willie Thornton. But competition among Scottish goalkeepers was such that Brown was international goalkeeping reserve 25 times.\n\nWith Dundee, he played 215 Scottish League games from 1950 to 1959, winning a League Cup medal in the 1951-52 season. His debut for Scotland could hardly have been more difficult or more impressive. In June 1958, during the World Cup finals in Sweden, he was picked to replace Tommy Younger against France. Scotland lost 2-1, but Brown impressed France's attacking pair, Juste Fontaine and Raymond Kopa. He continued to win caps for Scotland until November 1965.\n\nDundee, needing money for new floodlights, sold him to Tottenham in 1959 for \u00a316,500. He played 222 League games for Spurs, missing just one in their double-winning season. In 1962, he added another FA cup medal when Spurs beat Burnley in the Wembley final.\n\nFinding abundant time on his hands in London, Brown joined the sales staff of a printing company and later opened a printing firm in Soho with a partner. Things at Tottenham began to go wrong, when, early in 1964, at the age of 32, when a keeper might be expected to be in his prime, he was dropped from the team by the manager, Bill Nicholson (obituary, October 25 2004). He never fully regained his place, facing opposition from the young Northern Irishman Pat Jennings.\n\n\"It came as a tremendous shock to us when he was dropped by Spurs,\" said Ian McColl, then team manager of Scotland. \"I regard Brown as the best keeper in Britain.\" Brown angrily announced that he had no intention of playing in Tottenham's reserves. That his form had suffered was proved when he did leave Spurs in 1966 for humble Northampton Town. And there, too, he lost his place, in March 1967.\n\nThe following summer, he flew to Canada to play for the shortlived Toronto Falcons in the \"unofficial\" soccer League which sprang up that year, unsanctioned by FIFA. Because of that he and another British player were banned when he was on the point of joining non-League Hastings United. For Brown this proved a blessing, for he stayed on in Canada, taking a post with the land development section of the Ontario government, from which he retired in 1995.\n\nIn 1988, he had a heart attack which persuaded him to cut out the 40 cigarettes he smoked each day. In 1994 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he survived that, too.\n\nHe leaves his wife Elaine, two daughters and a son.\n\n\u00b7 William (Bill) Dallas Fyfe Brown, footballer, born October 8 1931; died November 30 2004"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/williams-evan/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Samuel Evan Williams\n\naka: Evan Williams\n\nBorn: 15 July 1943\n\nBirthplace: Dumbarton\n\nSigned: 14 October 1969\n\nLeft: 6 May 1974\n\nPosition: Goalkeeper\n\nFirst game: St Mirren home league 2-0 1 December 1969\n\nLast game: Basle away European cup 2-3 27 February 1974\n\nInternationals: none\n\nBiog\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how important you were to Celtic until you weren\u2019t there anymore, and I didn\u2019t realise that goalkeeper is the hardest position of all.\u201d\n\nJock Stein to Evan Williams\n\nEvan Williams was a reserve keeper at Wolverhampton Wanderers when he moved to Celtic in October 1969 for a moderate fee after being out on loan to Tommy Docherty\u2018s Aston Villa. It was a remarkable change of fortune for the Dumbarton-born keeper who suddenly swapped reserve league football for European glory nights with Jock Stein\u2019s Hoops.\n\nEvan Williams made his Celtic debut on December 1st 1969 and he kept a clean sheet as the Bhoys won a home league encounter with St Mirren 2-0. He went on to be one of the few Celtic players to do themselves justice in the 1970 European Cup final defeat to Feyenoord where he saved Celtic from a considerable beating. Many actually say he was our best player on the night. He had also been impressive in the pivotal semi-final ties against the much vaunted Leeds United. It was a real reward to be involved in those matches, and he more than played his part.\n\nEvan was an under-rated member of a hugely successful Celtic side and had a wonderful record in games against Rangers in which he excelled and saw off John Fallon and Denis Connaghan for the keeper\u2019s jersey.\n\nHe was first choice goalkeeper and showed consistency in the title winning years of 1970, 1971 and 1972. He had an excellent game in the Scottish Cup Final replay in 1971 when Celtic triumphed 2-1 over Rangers and then had an easier game a year later in the 6-1 final thrashing of Hibs.\n\nHe did take criticism for the shock 4-1 League Cup Final reverse to Partick Thistle in October 1971, though in truth none of the goals conceded were necessarily his fault.\n\nIn a Celtic View article in 2008, Evan recalled playing against Fiorentina in March 1970 in Florence. The Italians were given an indirect free kick on the edge of the area and one of their player shot directly at goal and Evan moved out of the way to allow the ball to hit the net and coolly placed the ball for a goal kick to the initial bemusement of the celebrating Fiorentina players.\n\nCeltic won through 3-1 on aggregate v Fiorentina and at the end of the game the Swedish referee waited at the final whistle at the tunnel for Evan. He then congratulated him on his knowledge of the rules of the game. Feeling quite chuffed with himself he went into the dressing room where Jock Stein balled at him never to do that again and that he was \u2018to bloody well keep the ball out and NEVER to let the ball in!\u2018.\n\nIn time, Ally Hunter was to join Celtic from Kilmarnock in January 1973, and Evan was to then fell from grace. His last opportunity was against Basel in a European Cup quarter-final away leg when he lost two bad goals, one to future Borussia Dortmund manager Ottmar Hitzfeld, and he never played for Celtic\u2019s first team again.\n\nEvan Williams eventually departed Parkhead in the summer of 1974 when he was released by the club before signing on for Clyde. By then he had made 148 appearances and helped himself and the team to four league championship titles and two Scottish Cup victories.\n\nEvan Williams was a popular and capable Celtic goalkeeper and taking over from the great Ronnie Simpson was never to be an easy task for any aspiring keeper. A very high benchmark to come up against, but he succeeded with a great shut-out rate of 40%.\n\nHis later activities include short spells with Stranraer and Falkirk, and periods in charge of his original junior club Vale of Leven and as Assistant to Harry Hood at Albion Rovers. After many years out of the game Evan took charge of Ardeer Thistle in August 2001, brought in a whole new team and saved them from folding. He departed in March 2003.\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201cAfter I\u2019d finished I was at a dinner with Ronnie and Jock sat down next to us. He wanted to apologise. \u2018I didn\u2019t realise how important you were to Celtic until you weren\u2019t there anymore,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I didn\u2019t realise that goalkeeper is the hardest position of all\u2019.\u201d\n\nEvan Williams (2016)\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1969-74\n\n82 19 25 22 148 Shut-outs\n\n36 6 8 9 59 (40%)\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nScottish League\n\nScottish Cup\n\nPictures\n\nArticles\n\nEvan Williams: a bhoy\u2019s own story\n\n(from Celticfc.net site)\n\nDavid Friel\n\nAS part of a series taken from the Celtic View, we have been taking a trip down memory lane with a host of past Celtic favourites to get their own personal take on what it was like to pull on the Hoops. Next up is Evan Williams\u2026\n\nIT was a tough job, but somebody had to get it. When Ronnie Simpson, the \u2018Faither\u2019 of the Lisbon Lions, had to call it a day, a young man called Evan Williams was plucked from Wolves and thrown into the lions\u2019 den.\n\nThe Dumbarton-born goalkeeper made a total of 148 appearances for the Hoops and walked away with four league titles and two Scottish Cups to his name.\n\nDuring his career, Evan had spells with Third Lanark, Wolves, Aston Villa and Clyde, but his heart always remained at Celtic. This is his Bhoy\u2019s Own Story.\n\nMy first memory of Celtic was going to games as a young boy. I lived in Dumbarton and my next door neighbour took me along one Saturday because I\u2019d helped him with his garden. My heroes were Willie Fernie and Bertie Peacock. I just loved watching them play football. Fernie was incredible. His touch was unbelievable and he was a very under-rated footballer. Bertie Peacock was one of the hardest men I ever saw playing football. I became a goalkeeper at a young age but I always wanted to play outfield. At school, I started as an outfield player but for some reason always ended up as a goalkeeper. They finally made me captain just to keep me happy. I was a midfielder first of all but didn\u2019t last long and then found out I had a bit of talent as a goalkeeper. I was quite small when I was young, so I never got a game for the senior team at school. That probably put me off to start with, but I took a growth spurt and that made a difference.\n\nIn the late 1960s, I was playing with Wolves and I went on loan to Aston Villa. I\u2019d been told that Celtic were interested in me but I wasn\u2019t totally sure. There were rumours that they wanted me, but there were also rumours that they wanted Frank Munro. The two of us didn\u2019t know what to believe. When Sean Fallon came to games, he\u2019d always stand behind the goal, so you knew he was there. I did quite well at Villa and one day the phone rang and it was Sean. In his thick Irish accent, he just said: \u2018Now don\u2019t you be signing for anybody\u2026we\u2019re coming for you\u2019 and that was it. When I finished my loan spell at Villa, I was offered a contract but I said no. I knew Celtic were coming in for me and when I went back to Wolves, the manager Bill McGarry said he wanted me in his first team for the next game against Spurs. But he\u2019d always said he\u2019d let me go back home if the chance came up. He told me a club in Glasgow wanted to speak to me and I knew it was Celtic. That was at 10am and I managed to make the 11am train home. Sean met me at the station. I went to see Celtic play Ayr United that night and signed. I made my league debut in December 1969.\n\nThe highlight of my time at Celtic was undoubtedly the European Cup final in 1970 against Feyenoord. I know we lost the game but to reach that level and represent Celtic on such a big occasion meant a lot to me. Just playing with the Lisbon Lions was another highlight. I came up from Wolves and when I first walked out in to the dressing-room they were all just sitting there. I can remember saying to myself, \u2018Simpson, Craig, Gemmell\u2026\u2019 but they treated me as one of the lads. It wasn\u2019t like that at every club. I played with teams and it would take you six or seven months to feel part of it all. At Celtic, I felt at home straight away. On my first day, Bobby Murdoch came over and started talking. I\u2019d met him at a Parish function before. I felt part of the team right from the word go. My best game for Celtic was probably the European Cup final as well, but I was also proud of my record in games against Rangers. I very rarely lost a derby and I had a good number of shut-outs as well. I loved the Glasgow derbies. When you win, the feeling is hard to explain. It was just brilliant. You walked about with a smile on your face for days. I never got any hassle either. They only time I was ever frightened was after we beat Rangers 2-0 at Ibrox and I had to get the train to Bridgeton. I walked off with my collar up, hoping that nobody would recognise me.\n\nI followed in the footsteps of Ronnie Simpson at Celtic and he was one of the best goalkeepers of all time. He was different class and a hero of mine when growing up. I remember getting magazines in the 1950s when Ronnie was playing for Newcastle. He was a star way back then as well. Gordon Banks was another top goalkeeper. Nowadays, I\u2019m a huge fan of Artur Boruc. He is a fantastic goalkeeper and has a real aura about him. You can see him giving his defenders confidence. When he\u2019s fully on-song, he\u2019s different class \u2013 the best Celtic goalkeeper ever. I love the way he throws the ball, the way he kicks the ball and the way he goes about the game. For me, he\u2019s worth between 15 to 20 points a season for Celtic. I think goalkeeping has changed a lot over the years. You need to kick the ball more now but that wouldn\u2019t have bothered me. A few times at Celtic, I dribbled past players and big Jock went off his head. I always found Jock Stein hard, but fair. He was hard on goalkeepers, but I got on well with him. I remember reading a newspaper article in the early 1970s and Jock said that, pound for pound, I was his best signing.\n\nYou need confidence as a goalkeeper. You can\u2019t afford to be a shrinking violet because the team depends on you so much. One of the funniest stories from my time at Celtic was when we played Fiorentina in Europe. We won 3-0 at Celtic Park, but we were 1-0 down in the second leg. Just after half-time, they got a free-kick and Amarildo bent it round the wall. It was coming towards me and I stepped out of the way and let it hit the net. I knew it was an indirect free-kick, but Jock was going mental on the sidelines. Afterwards, he had a real go at me, but I knew the rules and the goal was disallowed. I actually remember the referee coming up to me after the game and patting me on the back. He was delighted someone knew the laws of the game. Confidence was something I always had. I never bothered about mistakes. I never let them get to me.\n\nI always liked playing at Old Trafford and Villa Park. In Scotland, I quite liked playing at Pittodrie, but nothing compares with Celtic Park. Setting foot on that pitch for the first time was a dream come true. My debut was in a Glasgow Cup match against Clyde. We won 5-1 but I dropped the ball in the first minute and Clyde scored. I didn\u2019t let it get to me though. I was never one to dwell on mistakes. I can remember a game at Morton when Jock Stein had a go at me for something. I turned to him and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it boss, it\u2019s in the past\u2019. He went right through me but that\u2019s just the way I was. My theory was that if I let things get to me, it wouldn\u2019t do any good. What\u2019s in the past, is in the past. I\u2019m still like that today.\n\nThe best players I ever faced were the likes of George Best and Denis Law at Manchester United. Best was different class, but Law was the same. Denis was a great footballer, but he always gave you a clatter when you challenged him as well. He never got pulled up for it, he had it down to a fine art. They were great players, but the Lions were just as good, probably better. I remember coming to Celtic at first and thinking I was fit. I\u2019d been a full-time pro for six years and I thought I was in good shape. But the level of fitness at Celtic Park was unbelievable. It took me about three months to get up to speed. It was all ball-work in training, but those boys were fit. I think that Celtic side were better than Man United in those days. The Lions could have gone to England and had a lot of success. They had a great belief and an aura about them. Everyone wanted the ball. As a goalkeeper that was great, because I liked to throw it out. And if you didn\u2019t throw the ball to one of them, they would let you know they weren\u2019t happy.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t been a footballer, I would have been a joiner. After finishing with football, that\u2019s the profession I chose. I\u2019m a project manager now. I also did a bit of coaching at Yale University in America, but when I came back I started back on the building sites and it\u2019s all gone from there. I often get people coming up to me on site asking if I\u2019m the Evan Williams who played for Celtic. Before I became a footballer, I worked with the council. I then went part-time at Third Lanark, and from there I became a full-time professional.\n\nMy advice to any young football player, goalkeeper or outfield, is that it\u2019s easy to get there, but the hardest part is to stay there. They might think that by signing for Celtic at 16, they have made it. That\u2019s not the case. When you get that kind of chance, you need to work even harder to make the grade. A lot of kids show a lot of potential when they are teenagers and then they disappear. They have to make the most of the chance they are given. The competition at Celtic Park will always be tough. When I played, we could win on a Saturday and play well, but Jock would still change the team. You have to get on with it. You can\u2019t be a prima donna.\n\nInterview with Celticfc.net (Oct 2012)\n\nLooking back to 1969, how did the move to Celtic arise?\n\nI actually knew six months before it happened that I was going to Celtic. Sean Fallon used to phone me up when I was on loan to Aston Villa and he would say \u201cDon\u00b4t be signing for anybody, we\u00b4ll be coming in for you.\u201d The move to Celtic was actually activated by a priest from Shettleston. Sean Fallon had been talking at a function about getting a goalkeeper in, saying that Ronnie wouldn\u2019t last forever and that one wasn\u2019t enough anyway as Celtic needed three or four keepers. Father Crawley asked \u201cWhat about Evan Williams at Wolves, the ex-Third Lanark player?\u201d That\u00b4s what activated it.\n\nDid the move come at a good time in your career?\n\nWhen I played for Third Lanark I played at Celtic Park and lost 1-0. Celtic scored in the last seconds and I went to Wolves just after that. I was told Celtic had been interested in me but Wolves had offered Third Lanark more money. I was desperate to come to Celtic though. I was down in England when they won the European Cup and you would have thought I was already playing for Celtic the way I went on, the Wolves players gave me a lot of stick. They had to remind me I was playing for them, not Celtic.\n\nThe move clearly meant a lot to you then?\n\nOh yes, I was a Celtic fanatic as a boy and I would go to all the games when I was younger. It was always Celtic, Celtic, Celtic. I knew all about the history, it\u00b4s a family club, and it\u00b4s something that comes from your family. My grandchildren are all Celtic fans, they aren\u2019t meant to have the strips but they\u00b4ve all got them.\n\nHow easy was it to settle in at the club once you had signed?\n\nI think out of the five clubs I played at, this was the easiest and that\u00b4s because of the players. We\u00b4re still friends today, they made it very easy for me to settle in. Bertie Auld was the first player I met, and then Bobby Lennox but all the boys were great \u2013 Tommy Callaghan and Big Billy too. They all made me feel welcome, when we went away we wouldn\u2019t sit with the same guy every time. We\u00b4d always sit with a different bunch but we\u00b4d all still sit together. I still see them regularly because I work at the park nowadays.\n\nIt was two months before you made your competitive debut, was that because it was hard to shift Ronnie Simpson from his position?\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to walk into the team when I arrived. I thought I was fit having played for Wolves and Aston Villa but in reality I was a mile behind. They were a lot fitter than the teams I played with down south with and it took me two months to get up to their fitness. And the way Jock Stein trained you, you had to be fit. It wasn\u2019t half a shock to my system.\n\nDid you feel extra pressure to impress when you were handed your chance, especially considering goalkeepers have less time to make an impact than outfield players?\n\nI\u00b4ve said this a hundred times \u2013 would you rather play with East Stirling or Celtic. Obviously you\u00b4d rather play for Celtic so you have got to forget about the pressure and get on with it. You\u00b4re getting the chance to take it, because it won\u00b4t come around again. If you don\u00b4t then you\u00b4re back in the reserves and more or less out of the road.\n\nYou played in a number of European matches for Celtic, what was your highlight?\n\nThe European Cup final is obviously one but so are the Leeds games. The two games against Inter Milan when we went out on penalty kicks were also great games. We would come to Celtic Park and the queues were right down London Road with people trying to get in.\n\nWas the atmosphere as good back then as it is now?\n\nThe crowd is great just now, but in those days, when The Jungle started singing, the noise was unbelievable. It would get everyone going and the atmosphere was brilliant.\n\nWere you a fan of the away trips?\n\nWhen you\u00b4re playing pro you start to take it all for granted, but when you get to go to places like Lisbon, Budapest and Paris, it was great. Coming from an ordinary working class family I never did those sorts of things. Nowadays people take it for granted and go abroad, but we didn\u2019t do that so every time we\u00b4d go away it would feel like a holiday we were going on.\n\nWhat were your highlights from the domestic Celtic matches?\n\nMost of my highlights when I was at Celtic were mostly the games against Rangers. I only lost twice so I loved the derbies. I wouldn\u2019t have liked it to have been the other way around anyway. I really enjoyed one which we won 2-0 at home and I had an awful lot to do that day. I think I got 10 out of 10 in the paper so I was really proud of that. There was another one, when I was down at Wolves, I saved a penalty against Liverpool and I got 10 out of 10 for that game as well.\n\nWhat was it like to play inside a packed Celtic Park?\n\nIt\u00b4s just a dream, getting to go out on the park. Nowadays when the players go out to warm up there aren\u2019t many fans in the stadium because they all seem to materialise at kick-off time, but back then we would go out to warm up and there would already be about 40,000 inside.\n\nDo you have regrets over how your Celtic career ended?\n\nIt has a lot to do with yourself at times. I think I let my standards slip in the sense I bought the pubs. The boss warned me and told me not to buy pubs but I said that I needed to look after my kids later on. It was the worst thing I could every have done though, because those years in the pub were a waste of time in my life. I was working in there while playing and it didn\u2019t work.\n\nBuying a pub used to be a common career path for footballers. Why was that?\n\nI think in those days the pubs were busy and it was a license to print money. But nowadays it\u2019s hard work. It was hard work then as well but you were in this smoky atmosphere all the time.\n\nWhat did you do after you left Celtic in 1974?\n\nI worked as a sports manager in Drumchapel for a while. I played with Falkirk and Clyde in between and then I went to America to coach in a high school. After that I went to a college before getting a job at a university. At first I did women\u00b4s football and I had my own soccer camp out there, but my wife didn\u2019t like it, she didn\u2019t fancy it at all. We were in New Jersey and then Connecticut. I did a bit of coaching and a Celtic Supporters\u2019 Club asked me to come back out in the summer, so I did that. The team then came over here and played against the Scottish champions and beat them, so they offered me a job over there in the building trade. I had done a little bit of joinery work before so I continued that over there. In America the football was only spread over four months so we did that as well as the building trade. But it was full football coaching, it wasn\u2019t just looking after the keepers,\n\nWhat did you think of the women\u00b4s football in America?\n\nIt is very big over there, I remember once there was a crowd of 15,000, and at that time it was a shock to my system. I\u00b4d never seen women\u00b4s football before but there are a lot of good players and it\u00b4s very popular there.\n\nSo after you retired from football altogether, what did you do?\n\nI went back to back to being a joiner and then I ended up as foreman. I then became a site agent, and then the contracts manager. When I retired from that I became the project manager.\n\nYou\u00b4re still a regular face around Celtic Park. What do you think of the current squad?\n\nI work in the hospitality so I\u00b4m seeing everyone all the time. I think the current side are getting better all the time and they\u2019ve definitely improved each year. They\u00b4re not the finished article yet but they\u00b4re getting there slowly but surely. I would love to see them dig up another Henrik Larsson or Jimmy Johnstone, to give us a wee buzz.\n\nWhat do you think of the current keepers integrating yoga into their training regime?\n\nI didn\u2019t know they did that. I can\u00b4t really criticise or praise that because I\u00b4ve never done it myself. I was a goalkeeper, not a football player, it\u00b4s a specialised position. On a Tuesday and Thursday afternoon all we would do is kick and throw the ball for hours. I used to get so fed up, but after a few years I noticed it was working, I was better at kicking and throwing.\n\nCeltic\u2019s keeper of the flame still carrying the torch\n\nCeltic\u2019s keeper of the flame still carrying the torch\n\nGraham Spiers\n\nhttp://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/celtics-keeper-of-the-flame-still-carrying-the-torch.118641532\n\nTuesday 17 February 2015\n\nFor those of us of a certain vintage, it is staggering to think that Evan Williams is now 71 years old.\n\nIn my mind\u2019s eye this former goalkeeper \u2013 dark, handsome, and once described by Jimmy Johnstone\u2019s wife, Agnes, as the most attractive Celtic player \u2013 is still 29 and keeping guard for Jock Stein. And, memorably, is between the sticks on the night of April 19 1972 when Celtic faced Inter Milan in the European Cup semi-final.\n\nIt was a halcyon time for Stein and Celtic. From 1967 through 1974 they achieved the equivalent of a European Cup final or semi-final appearance every other year, and Williams came unexpectedly to the party. He had been a Wolves reserve goalie for the previous three years before Stein signed him in October, 1969. Williams went from a pay of \u00a380 a week at Wolves to \u00a350 at Celtic but within months would play in the final of Europe\u2019s elite club competition.\n\nSome Celtic fans remember his fine display in that 1970 final against Feyenoord in Milan, when he actually preserved Celtic, even in defeat. Others, though, recall a near-frozen Williams being unable to keep Inter\u2019s penalties at bay in 1972 as Celtic strove to make their third European final in six years.\n\n\u201cThe thing I remember about that night in Glasgow was how cold it was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was April but I think there was even a wee bit of frost on the ground. I didn\u2019t have a great deal to do \u2013 unlike the first leg when I\u2019d plenty \u2013 and by the time the penalties came round I was pretty cold.\u201d\n\nAfter both legs had finished 0-0, Dixie Deans infamously blazed Celtic\u2019s opening kick over the bar before Inter went on to convert five out of five. \u201cIn the five minutes between the end of extra-time and the penalties Big Jock said to me, \u2018throw a coat around yourself,'\u201d recalls Williams. \u201cI said, \u2018no boss, gimme a ball, I need to dive about with a ball.\u2019 It was one of many disagreements \u2013 or debates \u2013 I had with Jock. He regularly accused me of representing \u2018the goalkeepers\u2019 union\u2019.\u201d\n\nWilliams lasted five years as Celtic goalkeeper but his place seemed to be forever under threat. First Denis Connaghan arrived, and then Ally hunter, as Stein clawed around trying to find the right man. But Williams prevailed, had a magnificent record against Rangers, and was well-loved by many Celtic fans. He would also speak his mind.\n\n\u201cI had plenty of debates with Jock Stein,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d quite often say to him \u2013 as did Ronnie Simpson \u2013 that we should get a goalkeeping coach in. A goalkeeper has to do many different things: catch, kick, punch, parry, get his angles right. It\u2019s a specialist position. But Jock wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been at Wolves where I had a brilliant goalkeeping coach in Fred Davies. He ripped my game apart and put it all back together. England at that time produced some of the best goalkeepers in the world: Gordon Banks, Peter Shilton, Ray Clemence and others. But at Celtic, Big Jock always insisted on doing it himself.\u201d\n\nRonnie Simpson, whom Williams effectively came to replace, once joked that Williams \u201cwas not five minutes in the door and he was telling Stein how to do things.\u201d But Williams, who stood just 5ft 10in, felt he had good evidence on his side.\n\n\u201cNot long after I arrived at Celtic in 1969 we faced Leeds United in the European Cup semi-final. Down at Leeds in the first leg big Jack Charlton had stood on my toes at corner kicks \u2013 that\u2019s what he did \u2013 and so Jock hatched a plan for the second leg.\n\n\u201cHe wanted Billy McNeill to stand between me and Charlton. I said, \u2018boss, look, hang on\u2026that means I\u2019ve to climb above two of the tallest men in British football to get to the ball\u2026that won\u2019t work.\u2019 It was one of many times I discussed or disagreed with Jock over my job.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls that, while he took Stein to task, Stein would quite often defend him. When one reporter tried to point out to Stein that Williams was uncapped at international level, Stein growled: \u2018That disnae matter\u2026he\u2019s the Celtic goalkeeper.\u2019 Their relationship was one of combative respect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d speak my mind, but not in a loud way, and Jock was always receptive, he would go away and think about it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cActually, Big Jock was great for listening and taking other opinions on board. And it was just as well, because Celtic didn\u2019t have quiet players at that time. Guys like Big Billy and Bertie [Auld]\u2026they didn\u2019t t hold back. But Jock took things on board, he was an open book in that sense. Also, maybe 90% of the time he was right.\u201d\n\nNow, nearly 43 years after that famous night in Glasgow, Williams says he looks on in awe at the current Celtic goalkeeper. He heaps praise on Craig Gordon, whom Williams believes may be one of the greatest goalkeepers ever to pull on a Celtic shirt.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a superstar,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI think he is absolutely top-class. What a con by Celtic and Peter Lawwell to get this guy for nothing after his two years of injury. And, though Craig is a very modern goalie on one sense, in another way he\u2019s just like the old days. It\u2019s all the rage today for goalies to fist or parry the ball, but Craig comes and catches it. If he is playing then I think Celtic will always have a chance.\u201d\n\nInterview: Evan Williams on helping Celtic win six in a row\n\nhttp://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/interview-evan-williams-on-helping-celtic-win-six-in-a-row-1-4409256\n\nEvan Williams, now 73, was Celtic s goalkeeper the last time they clinched six in a row. Picture: John Devlin\n\nAidan Smith\n\nThe last time Celtic won six in a row, the greatest football team Scotland has ever seen had one final day in the sun together. But it lasted mere seconds before a scripted piece of sentimental theatre concluded and Evan Williams was able to become an honorary Lisbon Lion.\n\nIt was 1 May, 1971, the title having been clinched three days before. Picking their way across the rubble of the old Parkhead stand as the club re-built off the park as well as on it, the ageing European Cup-winning heroes faced up to Clyde with the 41-year-old Ronnie Simpson back between the sticks. \u201cFrom the kick-off Wispy [Willie Wallace] passed to Stevie [Chalmers] and the ball was knocked back to Ronnie who booted the ball out for a shy,\u201d recalls Williams. \u201cThen the boss signalled for me to replace Faither, which was what we called Ronnie \u2013 and as I always like to tell folk, that was the day I got to play with the Lions.\u201d\n\nCeltic keeper Evan Williams holds up the trophy after his side defeated Hibs in the 1972 Scottish Cup final at Hampden. Picture: TSPL\n\nYou can find footage of the 6-1 victory over Clyde on YouTube with the sagely Bob Crampsey making the observation that a \u201ccanny\u201d Jock Stein was not prepared to risk Simpson even in such an inconsequential match, given that the veteran hadn\u2019t played since Williams\u2019 arrival the season before, and when there was an Old Firm Scottish Cup final to be contested the following Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf 6 turned out to be 9,\u201d sang Jimi Hendrix, and for Celtic of course six did. Williams collected medals for four of those championships. He helped the club lift the cup in \u201971, and to retain it the following year. And in mere months he went from performing in front a few thousand at Carlisle United, out on loan in England\u2019s second tier, to a starring role in Celtic\u2019s second European Cup final.\n\nBut, as he reveals over a cheese and ham sandwich in a Dumbarton cafe, this brilliant man-manager known to all as Big Jock didn\u2019t quite know how to handle the custodians of the game. \u201cHere\u2019s a funny thing: Jock didn\u2019t like goalies,\u201d says Williams, now 73. \u201cRonnie and I debated this a hundred times. To him it was like we were a necessary evil. He was never off our backs.\u201d\n\nWilliams may not have been the daftest keeper in the world but he was definitely a member of the goalies\u2019 union designed to protect this special breed. To go with his dark good looks he displayed a pronounced insouciance and this would confound Stein.\n\nEvan Williams in the thick of the action during the 1971 Scottish Cup final against Rangers at Hampden which ended 1-1, with Celtic going on to win the replay. Picture: SNS\n\n\u201cI remember a game at Morton when I dropped the ball and that was us one-nil down. Big Jock got stuck into me at half-time and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, boss, that\u2019s in the past.\u2019 He was speechless. I don\u2019t think anyone had ever brushed off his criticism like that. We went back out and scored five goals.\u201d\n\nThen there was Williams\u2019 first foreign assignment, the away leg of the quarter-final against Fiorentina on the road to the \u201970 final of the European Cup. \u201cThey got a free-kick, which [Luciano] Chiarugi hammered over our wall and into the net. I didn\u2019t move but that was deliberate. Jock rushed round behind the goal as I was fetching the ball. \u2018What the bloody hell are you doing?\u2019 he said, and he never swore.\n\n\u201cThe Fiorentina players and crowd were celebrating like mad but the referee disallowed the goal as the free-kick had been indirect. I knew this, which was why I stayed still. I suppose that was a bit like the goalies\u2019 Russian roulette: hoping the official remembers his decision in the mayhem.\n\n\u201cAfterwards when we\u2019d won the ref came to our dressing room. \u2018Well done, goalkeeper,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s good that someone knows the rules\u2019.\u201d Now Williams is laughing. He\u2019s remembering his antics in a Parkhead game against Hearts: \u201cOne of their boys chased a long ball, I trapped it and nutmegged him. Then a short while later I dribbled round Drew Busby.\u201d Both pieces of audacity sprung moves which led to goals in another victory. \u201cBoth times the ground fell silent. \u2018Is that goalie aff his heid?\u2019 \u2018Christ, he\u2019s done it again!\u2019\u201d Stein\u2019s reaction is not recorded.\n\nBefore replacing Simpson, Williams had to take over from Jocky Robertson at Third Lanark, no less daunting in its way. He retains a deep affection for the club, not least in the 50th anniversary year of their sad demise, and is looking forward to catching up with old Hi-Hi boys at an upcoming reunion. But Celtic were always his team. In return for helping with the gardening, a neighbour in Dumbarton took him to see Charlie Tully, Willie Fernie and Bertie Peacock and he was hooked. Stein was playing that day, too.\n\nWilliams journeyed to Wolverhampton Wanderers to play for a manager called Ronnie Allen. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like Scotsmen, had no time for us.\u201d The club had a goalkeeping coach, Fred Davies, who deconstructed Williams\u2019 game and put it back together in better shape. \u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t dive properly, didn\u2019t kick well, couldn\u2019t throw the ball!\u201d Williams was loaned out to Aston Villa in England\u2019s old Second Division where at least there was a Scot in charge \u2013 Tommy Docherty.\n\n\u201cThe Doc was the complete opposite of Jock. He always had to be the glamour man. I met him for the first time in 47 years a couple of months ago and he was still yon chirpy way. When Celtic came for me he told me I was mad for wanting to sign for them and was annoyed I did. Later I reckoned I might have got a game for Scotland but when I met the Doc in [Glasgow\u2019s] North British Hotel after he\u2019d been made national team manager he told me I was never going to be capped by him. Jock heard this and told him to get out the door. \u2018Don\u2019t you dare talk to my players like that,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s already playing for the best team in the world\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Parkhead starting wage was \u00a350. Williams would have earned more than double staying in England but his heart was set. On the day of the 1967 European Cup final he bet his Wolves team-mates \u00a35 that Celtic would triumph \u2013 \u201cA lot of money back then\u201d \u2013 and the entire 18-man squad couldn\u2019t resist the offer. \u201cThey thought Scottish football was hopeless.\u201d\n\nAt hopeless Celtic he was introduced to a new team-mate whose nickname was \u201cGod\u201d and after seeing Bobby Murdoch close-up he was moved to agree. This was after his first training session when Bertie Auld and Tommy Gemmell were asked by Stein to take him under their wing, a classic prank resulting.\n\n\u201cAt Wolves I was used to being ready early but these two were farting around. \u2018Och, I need extra pants,\u2019 said Bertie. \u2018These socks are awfie dirty,\u2019 said Tommy. When we were eventually walking up the road to Barrowfield they asked me what I wanted for breakfast. I wasn\u2019t sure about this but they said: \u2018Come on, we always get a roll and sausage and a cup of tea from Maggie\u2019s cafe.\u2019 I was munching away just as Big Jock\u2019s green Merc went past. Those jokers, who were behind me, had already chucked their rolls in a bin. Jock fined me 25 quid, half my wage. I couldn\u2019t clype on Bertie and Tam otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been part of the gang.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 debut came in the Glasgow Cup when he fumbled a high ball and Clyde scored. The groans from the fans he translated as \u2018Not another rubbish goalie!\u201d But the laidback Williams shrugged off the error. There\u2019s a funny story, too, from his first Old Firm match: \u201cI took my place in the tunnel at Ibrox behind Billy McNeill but Bertie squeezed in front. \u2018Son,\u2019 he said, \u2018when you\u2019ve done something for this club you can stand here. Billy\u2019s the captain and I\u2019m the general. I\u2019ll go second today.\u2019 He asked me if I was nervous. I said I was excited. I was keen to find out if I could play in front of 80,000. If I couldn\u2019t I knew it was probably Dumbarton or St Mirren for me.\n\n\u201cWe had to wait ages for the Rangers boys. [Referee] Tiny Wharton had to rap on their door. Bertie must have thought the delay would get to me. Then [John] Greig and the rest of that crowd appeared. \u2018How are you doing, John?\u2019 said Bertie. \u2018Fine, Bertie,\u2019 said John. \u2018John, this is our new goalie. He says he\u2019s not nervous, he\u2019s excited. Can you believe that?\u2019 Then Bertie said: \u2018By the way, we\u2019re on eight quid a man to beat you today.\u2019 Greig said: \u2018We\u2019re on 32 quid to beat you.\u2019 Bertie said: \u2018Aye but our eight quid\u2019s guaranteed!\u2019\u201d Celtic won, Williams keeping a clean sheet, and he\u2019s proud of his Old Firm record. \u201cI played against Rangers 18 times \u2013 14 wins, two draws and only two defeats \u2013 and I think overall my shutout rate was 46 per cent.\u201d\n\nWilliams didn\u2019t oust Simpson from the team. \u201cRonnie got carried off in a League Cup semi-final against Ayr United the day I signed and that was him finished.\u201d The man he rates as \u201cthe cleverest goalie there was\u201d became a mentor and Williams\u2019 rivalry for the position would be with John Fallon. \u201cJohn wrote a book recently in which he criticised Big Jock. I don\u2019t think you do that. He said he couldn\u2019t understand how Ronnie and myself got to play in European finals when he was the better keeper. What was our relationship like? I tolerated him.\u201d\n\nStein\u2019s Celtic, post-Lisbon, were changing and evolving. The sixth title was won with telling contributions from Davie Hay, Tommy Callaghan and Harry Hood, who banged in 33 goals that season. The Quality Street Gang broke through from the reserve team and every Wednesday Kenny Dalglish & Co would play a match against the Lions. \u201cThey often beat us, one time 4-0,\u201d recalls Williams.\n\nThen there was the great enigma, George Connelly. Williams talks fondly of his brilliant but troubled team-mate \u2013 dubbed Scotland\u2019s Franz Beckenbauer \u2013 who would walk away from fame at 26. \u201cHe was so different off the park from on it. On it, he was a genius. He could take the ball from me on my six-yard line and start an attack from there. He could make the ball talk.\n\n\u201cBut when the game was done he could be so quiet. There could be a big group of us chatting and George wouldn\u2019t say a word. He was a nice boy but very sensitive and when Davie Hay, his big pal, left the club [for Chelsea] he was lost.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t join in the banter. If we were all telling rude jokes or swearing George was out of it. Wee Lou [Macari] would sometimes wind him up. On the flight back from playing Ujpest Dozsa George was having a sneaky wee beer. Lou shouted: \u2018Another beer for Connelly!\u2019 This caused Jock, who frowned on alcohol, to turn round. The rest of us had to tell Lou to shut up or we\u2019d all get fined.\n\n\u201cGeorge was the sort of guy who if you said \u2018What\u2019s wrong with your hair?\u2019 he\u2019d worry about it all day. You had to be able to laugh at yourself although some of the jokes went too far. Dixie [Deans] would put salt in your tea instead of sugar. That might be a funny thing to do as a laddie, but at nearly 30? One time Lou was annoying me. \u2018You big dumpling,\u2019 he kept saying. So I hooked him.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 four daughters have given him nine grandchildren but he became a widower three years ago when his wife Anna died of breast cancer. The pair were childhood sweethearts and Williams is full of praise for her courage. \u201cShe fought the cancer for 20 years. The doctors were astonished. She took up golf late and won 23 tournaments. In one of them she got three holes-in-one.\u201d\n\nAfter Fiorentina in the run to their second European Cup final, Celtic took part in the \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d with Leeds United. Williams, a key performer in the semi-final, had history with Leeds from his time in England. \u201cPlaying for Wolves, Jack Charlton had stood on me as Johnny Giles hit a corner and he nodded the winner, so in the first leg at Elland Road I sorted him out with a dunt in the back. In the tunnel at Hampden before the return he made all these big threats but never came near me.\u201d\n\nWilliams was reckoned to be Celtic\u2019s best performer in the final against Feyenoord in Milan, but to no avail. Were the team complacent? \u201cI don\u2019t know. We just didn\u2019t play well. It was the best day of my football life and the saddest as well.\u201d Four years at Celtic ended after another Euro defeat, away to Basel. By then Stein had signed Ally Hunter. Williams had acquired two pubs, which disappointed Big Jock, and he admits the boss\u2019s concerns were proved right. \u201cI\u2019d pop into one of them on a Friday to show face and end up having a couple of pints. For a footballer, even a goalie sat on the bench, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d His career wound down at Clyde and Stranraer, by which time his hands, the tools of his trade, were giving him shooting pains up his back.\n\nWho\u2019d be a goalie? Williams is glad he was. And so, ultimately, was Stein. \u201cAfter I\u2019d finished I was at a dinner with Ronnie and Jock sat down next to us. He wanted to apologise. \u2018I didn\u2019t realise how important you were to Celtic until you weren\u2019t there anymore,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I didn\u2019t realise that goalkeeper is the hardest position of all\u2019.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47187256", "page_content": "Scott Bain has only made 13 appearances for Celtic this season, but he has started his club's last seven games. Has Brendan Rodgers anointed him first-choice goalkeeper?\n\nAlthough his rival for the position, Craig Gordon, has enjoyed a successful stint over the past two seasons, he has at times seemed at odds with Rodgers' style of football. That is an area in which Bain has thrived whenever offered the opportunity.\n\nSo if Bain has been promoted - and he certainly looks favourite to start Thursday's Europa League meeting with Valencia - what makes him a better option between the posts? BBC Scotland assesses the numbers to try and find out.\n\nA new type of goalkeeper\n\nThe perceived wisdom seems to be that Bain is Rodgers' preferred stopper because he's better with the ball at his feet. And as far as the stats are concerned that certainly seems to be the case.\n\nBefore Sunday's Scottish Cup tie against St Johnstone, Bain and Gordon had an almost identical average of passes per 90 minutes (22.41 and 21.89 respectively) but while Bain's accuracy stood at an impressive 96.5%, Gordon's took a notable dip to 86.2%. And things only got worse for the senior goalkeeper when we dived even further into both player's passing stats.\n\nGordon averaged 6.92 long passes per match, which was almost three times greater than Bain's average of 2.34. Yet what is perhaps most telling is that Gordon's accuracy with said punts up the park stood at just 62%, while Bain tended to find his preferred target 81.2% of the time.\n\nA similar trend comes to the fore when we look at both players' forward passing. While Gordon, again, has attempted far more than Bain per match (12.31 to 9.78 respectively) the accuracy of his passing stands at 78%. Bain, on the other hand, completes 94% of his.\n\nEssentially, Gordon and Bain make a similar number of passes per game but the former tends to focus on longer, less accurate passes while Bain seems more interested in shorter passes that tend to reach their target with far more regularity.\n\nOld-fashioned shot-stopping\n\nWhen it comes to the more traditional aspects of a goalkeeper's job, there is much less to choose between the Celtic duo.\n\nAlthough Gordon is perhaps best regarded as a great saver of shots, Bain tends to save more on average per match.\n\nAgain, before Sunday, the younger goalkeeper was saving an average of 85% of shots fired towards him each game, compared to Gordon's 75%.\n\nOn the other hand, Gordon was the better of the two when it comes to dominating in the air. Despite only being four inches taller, he won 89% of aerial duels in the Celtic box, compared to Bain's 87.5%.\n\n'He understands the game'\n\nRodgers himself says Bain fulfils his bread-and-butter goalkeeper duties while also possessing a \"wonderful view of the game\".\n\n\"He understands when it needs speeding up, when it needs controlling. And for my teams throughout my life that's how I've always had it,\" the Celtic manager said last week.\n\n\"The goalkeepers don't need to be 6ft 4ins or 6ft 5ins as long as they've got good agility, can make saves and then they can participate in the game when we have the ball.\n\n\"You then need a goalkeeper who can stay calm and pick out the lines of pass that we would want him to. He's very, very good.\""}, {"url": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/04/18/nba-boston-celtics-coach-bill-russell-red-auerbach/", "page_content": "54 years ago today, Boston Celtics legendary big man Bill Russell accepted the position offered him by the man who\u2019d been the only coach he\u2019d ever had as a pro \u2014 Red Auerbach \u2014 to become the first African American coach in modern sports history.\n\nThe offer, which was made midway through the season, seemed too good to be true to the Celtics center luminary despite nearly a decade of friendship between Auerbach and Russell.\n\nThe two conferred privately about having the Louisiana native succeed Red in the role, with Russell putting his initial skepticism on the table at the outset.\n\nIn an article by Russell in the Record-American Sunday Advertiser chronicling the eventful changing of the guard, the San Francisco product asked Auerbach, \u201cDo you really want me [as head coach of the Celtics], Red, or is this a token gesture?\u201d\n\nI haven't been doing threads on Boston sports history on the weekends, but April 18 is a biggie.

I asked you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d came Russell\u2019s reply.\n\nBut the truth was that there was trepidation among the team about what might next; whether the franchise would be successful under a new mind with new plans and new ideas. When word got out that there might not, in fact, be a new mind at the helm after all, his teammates began to pressure Russell to take the position.\n\nBut the Monroe native bided his time, carefully considering the offer.\n\nIt was, after all, a different time \u2014 segregation was still a hot-button issue, and the tumult of the civil rights era in full swing. Would he be used as \u2014 or turned into \u2014 a scapegoat if things went wrong?\n\nThe architect of the Celtics 1960s dynasty must have gotten a sense his friend and player would not take the job, and began scheduling a search, even while preferring Russell for the job.\n\nThe Hall-of-Fame center was having lunch with a popular sportswriter of that era, Bill McSweeny, and the topic of Red\u2019s successor as coach came up.\n\nOn this day, Red names Bill Russell head coach; Sam Jones drafted https://t.co/jcc6F3hOsF \u2014 The Celtics Wire (@TheCelticsWire) April 17, 2020\n\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to coach?\u201d McSweeny asked him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they need me, to tell you the truth,\u201d he answered. \u201cI think they have a good coach coming in [Alex] Hannum. So, I\u2019ve dropped the whole idea. I\u2019d have to really be wanted to take this job, and you know me \u2014 I don\u2019t go anywhere I\u2019m not wanted.\u201d\n\nTaken aback, McSweeny replied to Russell, \u201cListen \u2014 they want you. They think you don\u2019t want the job, and they\u2019re taking Hannum as a second choice.\u201d\n\nThe rest, of course, is history \u2014 and some of the most important of the franchise. Russell\u2019s acceptance would be announced after a Game 1 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, and while the deal had already been ironed out, helped catalyze Boston to come back and win the series.\n\nAuerbach would stay on as general manager, but did not meddle much in the day-to-day affairs of Russell\u2019s tenure, and the trust that built the second act of the Celtics 1960s dynasty was built on the bedrock of their relationship.\n\nTwo more championships would come to the team under Russell\u2019s tenure before his abrupt departure from the team and the wider Celtics community for some years, cementing Russell\u2019s \u2014 and Red\u2019s \u2014 legacies as all-time greats in multiple roles."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2736241/2021/07/29/do-not-pin-blame-on-barkas-and-bain-celtics-problems-run-a-lot-deeper-than-needing-a-new-goalkeeper/", "page_content": "The deja vu was chronic.\n\nScott Bain was picked ahead of Vasilis Barkas for the second leg of Celtic\u2019s Champions League qualifier against Midtjylland after the latter\u2019s horrendous error last week.\n\nBut after 60 minutes without Celtic conceding a shot on target, Bain fumbled an easy cross across his six-yard-box that nearly resulted in a goal and Celtic\u2019s young defence \u2014 which, despite all the mitigating circumstances, were relatively composed until the incident \u2014 became visibly unnerved.

They again played well in spells, as they did last week, and again they looked agonisingly lacking in player quality in important positions. Again, they had to field a back five that has a credible case to be the weakest in living memory playing in a competitive game. Again, the once-talismanic Odsonne Edouard underperformed. But there was also deja vu from last season.\n\nCeltic veer between one first-team goalkeeper and another, each producing their share of errors while the same unimaginative names are once again touted as potential saviours. Would Fraser Forster return for the fifth time? Would Joe Hart make the move up north to potentially rehabilitate his career as Forster did in 2019-20? The Celtic of 2021-22 looked at the Celtic of 2020-21 and said \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having.\u201d\n\nCeltic are in discussions with Tottenham about bringing Hart, who Celtic held tentative talks with last summer before buying Barkas, to Glasgow. Although he is not someone Ange Postecoglou requested himself, he is someone the new manager will desperately hope can solve the goalkeeping crisis.\n\nIt is not a recent crisis. It is one that began in earnest when Craig Gordon\u2019s form fell away during the second half of 2018-19, and Bain was recruited as an alternative. Bain\u2019s adequacy in the final few months of that season, and Forster\u2019s incredible loan spell during 2019-20, have revealed themselves to be temporary bandages applied to a still-open wound.\n\nBarkas has yet to make a decisive save of note in a competitive game for Celtic, after 23 games in all competitions this season and last. It was hoped, without much substance, that he might come good under new management in Postecoglou. His awful error in the first leg of this Midtjylland tie derailed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBain performed commendably enough in his first six months at Celtic, but his accountability for a number of errors which culminated in elimination against Cluj in the 2019-20 Champions League qualification rounds stressed the need for an upgrade. Forster was brought in, and everything was fleetingly rosy, but Barkas\u2019s struggles at the beginning of last season saw Bain elevated once more to first choice. He laboured to nail down the position with further errors, including those in both of the 4-1 humiliations against Sparta Prague in the Europa League. Academy keeper Conor Hazard even briefly deputised in the winter.\n\nBluntly, there has not been a goalkeeper which the manager, their team-mates and the fans have felt fully confident in for almost three years.\n\nWhether Hart is the solution is uncertain. An experienced, Premier League-winning former England international inevitably carries their own weight of credibility. But that Hart has not been the first-choice goalkeeper at a club since his ill-fated loan spell with Torino in 2016-17 is a concern. As is his save percentage, which has only exceeded 70 per cent twice in the last six seasons, according to Instat. That he struggled to adapt to Pep Guardiola\u2019s sweeper-keeper demands also suggests he would have similar issues with Postecoglou\u2019s style of play.\n\nBarkas and Bain are not of the required standard to be a Celtic No 1 (Photo: Craig Williamson/SNS Group via Getty Images)\n\nFans might argue that no matter how far Hart\u2019s stock has fallen, surely he still has to represent an improvement on what Celtic have available to them. They also, rightly, hold Celtic\u2019s goalkeeping coach Stevie Woods in the highest esteem. He is a figure Gordon and Forster wax lyrical about for rehabilitating their waning careers when they initially arrived at Celtic (Forster specifically for his fourth spell in 2019-20). They might argue that what Woods did with Forster and Gordon, he can do so again with Hart.\n\nBut while Hart might come good, he is not a player tailor-made for a Postecoglou team or one requested by him. The only signing who has been is Kyogo Furuhashi, who was ineligible to play in this fixture. After last night\u2019s game, Postecoglou delivered the most thinly veiled of barbs towards the Celtic hierarchy: \u201cI obviously haven\u2019t done a good enough job of convincing people we need players in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goalkeeper crisis, as crucial and as prolonged as it is, is just one bullet point on a to-do list that stretches across an entire notebook, with one month remaining of the transfer window.\n\nIt is one of the many positions that needs urgently addressing \u2014 positions that should have been addressed weeks if not months ago. The signings cannot be low-cost punts, agent recommendations, or leftovers from previous recruitment shortlists, but players Postecoglou actively wants.\n\nThe futures of previously high-value assets Edouard, Olivier Ntcham and Ryan Christie still need to be resolved, with the two former available to leave on free transfers next summer, and the latter available to do so in January.\n\nBluntly, there is a lot of work to do.\n\n(Main image: Ryan Christie shows the pain of Celtic\u2019s exit in Denmark.

It is probably the closest thing football has to a sacred number that hasn\u2019t been retired.\n\nThe numbers in today\u2019s article, on the other hand, break with the traditions and established aesthetics of the sport. Some are truly cursed, some are weird and silly, and some are endearing in their own way.\n\nFor full disclosure, I have a slight preference for Spain\u2019s system of only allowing first team members to wear numbers up to 25, with number 1 and 13 reserved for goalkeepers. In general, I dislike the chaotic hellscape of Serie A\u2019s kit numbers, and I hate players using their birth year as a kit number.\n\nWithout further ado...\n\nCursed Kit Numbers: Goalkeepers\n\nThe unwritten rules for goalkeepers are simple and clear: as the first player on the team sheet, they should wear number 1. Number 13 is also used for goalkeepers in many countries; traditionally it has been reserved for the back-up goalkeeper, though plenty of starting keepers have worn the number in recent years. See La Liga\u2019s Jan Oblak and Thibaut Courtois wearing number 13 for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Real Madrid, respectively.\n\nOther than number 1 and number 13, goalkeepers are fairly free to choose what they like. There aren\u2019t many traditional numbers for their position, but some people still manage to make entirely wrong choices\u2026 For example:"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3614522/2022/09/26/illan-meslier-hugo-lloris-france-goalkeeper-no1/", "page_content": "The day will come when France and Hugo Lloris no longer go hand in hand, but not yet, and not before the goalkeeper breaks a tantalising national record.\n\nLilian Thuram, who was part of the World Cup-winning side in 1998, is their leading appearance-maker with 142 caps.\n\nLloris sits on 139, close enough to go past Thuram before 2022 is out. Lloris made his international debut in 2008 and his reign as No 1, and now captain, is proof of his longevity and of goalkeepers in general. To put it another way, on the day of Lloris\u2019 international debut, Illan Meslier was eight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeslier, Leeds United\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper for the past two years, has a vested interest in Lloris\u2019 career and has watched it closely for a while. Lloris was a role model and an inspiration, a compatriot playing at the level he aimed for, but more and more, the goalkeeping fraternity in France have been thinking about the national team\u2019s succession plan and wondering how the natural order may change.\n\nLloris turns 36 in late December and though Thuram\u2019s record is there to be taken, it remains to be seen if mixing international duty with club football at Tottenham Hotspur appeals beyond this year\u2019s World Cup, his fourth.\n\nIt will be occurring to France and their head coach, Didier Deschamps, that the man who lifted the World Cup as captain at Russia 2018 cannot go on forever, leaving a decision about where the gloves go next.\n\nThere was a trial for life without him when Lloris pulled out of the squad for this week\u2019s Nations League games against Austria and Denmark because of a thigh strain. Deschamps had two other keepers in his camp, West Ham United\u2019s Alphonse Areola and AC Milan\u2019s Mike Maignan, and the need for a third dangled the possibility of a first senior call-up in front of Meslier. Instead, Deschamps drafted in Alban Lafont, the 23-year-old who plays for Nantes in Ligue 1.\n\nMeslier has played through the France age groups (Photo: Thomas Eisenhuth/Bongarts/Getty Images)\n\nLafont is uncapped but has been heading for this opportunity since his time as a junior pro at Toulouse. Like Meslier, he has represented France at several youth levels and it was Lafont\u2019s exit from the under-21 scene that made way for the Leeds man to establish himself as No 1 in that age category.\n\nMeslier\u2019s under-21 caps have now reached double figures, mounting up as Lafont continued to grow domestically in Ligue 1, a division in which he has made more than 200 appearances. The highly-capable Lafont had the distinction of earning a 10 out of 10 match mark from the notoriously stingy French media outlet L\u2019Equipe after a game against title-bound Paris Saint-Germain last season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeslier, though, has probably never felt closer to a full international call-up than he does now.\n\nAt 22, his days in the under-21 set-up are drawing to a close. He is eligible for next summer\u2019s European Championship in Romania and Georgia on account of his age when qualifying began and he is more established as a Premier League first choice than he has ever been.\n\nThis season is his third in England\u2019s top division and, barring injury, it will take him past 100 club appearances for Leeds. The month of fixtures behind him has shown positive development in his game, showing fewer of the flaws that exist alongside his obvious talent.\n\nWith Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha leaving in the transfer window just closed, sold for a combined total of more than \u00a390million ($101.6m), Meslier is fast becoming the player at Elland Road with the highest price tag and the biggest reputation.\n\nIn simple terms, he is the player the club are most likely to receive big money bids for next summer, and it is no surprise that with Lloris into his mid-thirties and on course to be out of contract after the 2023-24 season, Tottenham are as interested in Meslier as anyone.\n\nLeeds consider his acquisition from Lorient back home for a fee of \u00a35million in 2020 to be one of the best bits of business they have done in years \u2014 and they are confident his potential will give him a shot at an extended international career.\n\nFrance and Deschamps, for now, are understood to be happy with Meslier in the junior ranks, convinced that it is better for him in the short term. The squad, who topped their qualification group without losing a game and conceded only five goals in the process, have nine months to prepare for those Under-21 Euros \u2014 a biennial competition France haven\u2019t won since 15 months before Meslier was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving Meslier to call upon should enhance their chances of a successful tournament and a full call-up from Deschamps is likely to wait.\n\nThat was reiterated on Thursday when, in the wake of Lloris\u2019 withdrawal, Maignan suffered a calf injury and was replaced by Areola at half-time in a 2-0 home win over Austria. Deschamps turned to a 37-year-old Steve Mandanda, now with Rennes, as Maignan\u2019s replacement, leaving Meslier to start for the under-21s in Friday\u2019s 1-0 win over their German counterparts instead. They play Belgium\u2019s youngsters today (Monday).\n\nFor Meslier, promotion internationally would be the next step in a career that has pushed him hard and fast.\n\nHis time at Leeds has been impressive, productive and, at the same time, unforgiving. He has been unchallenged as their first choice for the past two seasons and avoided sinking in the strongest of leagues, even if he has conceded goals at a high rate.\n\nLeeds shipped 54 goals in their first year back in the Premier League and then 79 in their second, an average of 1.75 a game across the two years. Some of the blame lies with Meslier but much more of it sits with the players in front of him \u2014 a defence that deteriorated as time went on. Last season, Leeds faced the third-highest total of shots on goal in the division. Meslier made more saves, 143, than any other keeper. One of his strengths was the ability to avoid collapsing mentally amid constant pressure.\n\nThis season, Meslier\u2019s game has looked more accomplished again, with his agility matched by the high standard of his basics. In their most recent game, Leeds conceded five times at Brentford, where Meslier was again compromised by poor defending, but before that their record for the new season stood at five concessions in five league matches.\n\nLeeds have been working with Meslier to enhance his focus and reaction times, using methods in training such as electronic boxes that light up randomly and require him to press the right buttons with his hands or feet in split seconds before he deals with an incoming shot. The idea is that repetition under heightened stress makes rapid adjustments come more naturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff use strength bands with him in certain drills and have created routines involving multiple small goals and games of hand tennis, all designed to sharpen his decision-making.\n\nNew head coach Jesse Marsch\u2019s switch from man-marking, the system favoured by predecessor Marcelo Bielsa, has required the club\u2019s keepers to change their thinking with it. Marsch is said to regularly challenge Meslier to demonstrate why he has the scope to be one of the best keepers of his generation.\n\nTo prove that in France\u2019s national team, he will need to be patient.\n\nThe glimmer for him is that injury to Maignan, which will keep him out for at least three weeks \u2014 not far off the opening games of the World Cup in the third week of November. But even with Maignan joining Lloris in being out of the full squad, Meslier was left with the under-21s.\n\nThis could have been the moment when the door first opened but Leeds are sure that the call will come before long, vindicating what they tell him continuously: that he arrived in England as a French goalkeeper but, with the right dedication and graft, he could make himself the French goalkeeper.\n\n(Top photo: George Wood/Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://khelnow.com/football/premier-league-top-10-goalkeepers-most-clean-sheets", "page_content": "Premier League\n\nThe reliability of these custodians has provided utmost help to their teams.\n\nThe Premier League has always been praised by football fans across the world for its thrilling matches and goals galore. Yet no one thinks about the tireless role which goalkeepers play in helping a team win. A keeper\u2019s role has evolved over time with managers now preferring sweeper goalkeepers \u2013 who can build attacks from the back and make out-of-line saves.\n\nHowever, keeping a clean sheet still remains the main priority for every defence and goalkeeper. Particularly in a fast-paced league like the Premier League, keeping clean sheets is not an easy task. Despite the hostile environment of the Premier League, some legendary goalkeepers of the game have succeeded.\n\nToday, we are going to take a look at the 10 goalkeepers with most clean sheets in the Premier League.\n\n10. Brad Friedel (Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, Liverpool) \u2013 132 clean sheets\n\nBrad Friedel is an American goalkeeper and is one of the first players from his country to make his mark in the English Premier League. The American shot-stopper arrived in the Premier League in the 1997-98 season when Liverpool signed him as a backup option.\n\nAfter spending three years at Anfield, he moved to Blackburn Rovers where he spent eight years as the first-choice keeper and kept 77 clean sheets in 290 appearances. Friedel then went on to play for two more clubs in the league before retiring at White Hart Lane in 2015.\n\n9. Tim Howard (Manchester United, Everton)- 132 clean sheets\n\nIf Brad Friedel was the first American goalkeeper to make his mark in the Premier League, Tim Howard took the baton from him. His Premier League career began when Sir Alex Ferguson recruited him as a first-choice keeper at Manchester United. However, after the 2003/04 season, he became Edwin van der Sar\u2019s backup at the club.\n\nIn his four years at Manchester United, he made only 45 appearances. Howard then moved to Everton where he established himself as one of the safest hands in the Premier League. He made 329 appearances for the Toffees and kept 116 clean sheets before leaving Goodison Park in 2016.\n\n8. Edwin van der Sar (Manchester United, Fulham)- 132 clean sheets\n\nEdwin van der Sar is a Manchester United legend and arguably the greatest custodian of their goal. Although many people don\u2019t know it, he started his career with Fulham in the Premier League, which led Manchester United to sign him. The custodian has kept 132 clean sheets in his 313 appearances in the Premier League, out of which 90 came in the Red Devils jersey.\n\n7. David de Gea ( Manchester United) \u2013 133 clean sheets\n\nDavid de Gea has been at Manchester United since 2011. (Courtesy: Manchester United)\n\nMoving into 7th place after his clean sheet against Newcastle United in Premier League 2022-23 is David de Gea. Having started the first game of this season as United\u2019s No. 1, the Spaniard has now been their first-choice keeper for 12 years straight. Interestingly, de Gea is one of the few players Sir Alex Ferguson personally scouted. The custodian has recently reached over 500 appearances for the club across all competitions.\n\nDavid de Gea\u2019s best season was in 2017-18, when he kept 18 clean sheets from 37 appearances. The keeper is still just 31 years old and has many peak years left in his kitty. Surely, the Spanish goalkeeper can still climb up the ladder if he keeps his performance up to the mark.\n\n6. Pepe Reina (Liverpool, Aston Villa)- 136 clean sheets\n\nPepe Reina became a fan favourite at Anfield through his heroics. (Courtesy: Liverpool Echo)\n\nPepe Reina is another iconic goalkeeper from Premier League\u2019s history and one of the biggest fan favourites at Anfield. In 285 appearances for Liverpool between 2005 and 2014, he kept 134 clean sheets. Reina then returned to the Premier League in 2020 after he joined Aston Villa on loan and kept two clean sheets in 12 appearances. Among keepers with over 100 clean sheets, Reina maintained the highest clean sheet percentage of 45.79.\n\n5. Nigel Martyn (Leeds United, Everton, Crystal Palace)- 137 clean sheets\n\nNigel Martyn is the first Englishman on the list and one of few goalkeepers to make over 200 appearances for two different clubs in English football. The English goalkeeper had his best run at Leeds United, where he kept 82 clean sheets in 207 appearances. Martyn ended his reign in the Premier League with Everton in 2006 after making 86 appearances for the Toffees.\n\n4. David Seaman (Arsenal, Manchester City)- 141 clean sheets\n\nDavid Seaman is an Arsenal legend and one of few keepers with over 40% clean sheet ratio in his career. He made 403 appearances for Arsenal in the 1990s and was among the league\u2019s safest custodians. Seaman kept 138 clean sheets for the Gunners before joining Manchester City. With three clean sheets in 19 appearances in 2003/04, he ended his career at Manchester City.\n\n3. Mark Schwarzer (Middlesbrough, Fulham, Chelsea, Leicester City) \u2013 151 clean sheets\n\nThe next name on the list is Mark Schwarzer, one of the legendary players from Australia to establish himself in English football. During his time in PL, the Aussie goalkeeper made 514 appearances for four clubs. He is best known for his time at Middlesbrough, where he made 366 appearances and kept 92 clean sheets.\n\n2. David James (Liverpool, Portsmouth, Aston Villa, Manchester City, West Ham United) \u2013 169 clean sheets\n\nFact: David James played the role of a manager-player at Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters. (Courtesy: Portsmouth)\n\nDavid James takes the second spot on this prestigious list of the best Premier League goalkeepers. Over the course of his 18-year Premier League career, the English goalkeeper made 572 appearances. He played for five clubs in the competition and was the first-choice keeper for all of them. His last Premier League appearance came with Portsmouth in 2009/10.\n\n1. Petr Cech (Chelsea, Arsenal) \u2013 202 clean sheets\n\nPetr Cech is the only goalkeeper to touch the 200 clean sheet mark in Premier League. During his prestigious career, the Czech Republic goalkeeper played for two of the biggest London clubs. In the Premier League, he kept 202 clean sheets with a stellar clean sheet percentage of 45.60. Cech ended his football career in 2019 after over 15 years in the Premier League. But, after about 18 odd months, he again made a comeback at Chelsea, appearing once for the U-23 side against Tottenham Hotspur!\n\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and join our community on Telegram.\n\n** This article was last updated on October 17, 2022."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/ranking-5-best-goalkeepers-premier-league-season-2020-21-mendy-ederson", "page_content": "The 2020-21 Premier League season turned out to be an interesting one for goalkeepers. The English top-flight boasts some of the best shot-stoppers in the business, but some of the usual suspects performed well below expectations for one reason or the other.\n\nLiverpool superstar Alisson Becker could be classed in this category, as the Brazilian endured a relatively underwhelming reason by his lofty standards. He made amends with a series of eye-catching displays at the business end of the season and topped it off with a historic goal against West Bromwich Albion, but Alisson made a few uncharacteristic errors in the 2020-21 campaign.\n\n\ud83d\udcaf Alisson was the only player with a 100% conversion rate in the Premier League in 2020/21\ud83d\ude1c Clinical pic.twitter.com/SgCY313dLp \u2014 WhoScored.com (@WhoScored) May 25, 2021\n\nIn stark contrast, a handful of goalkeepers outside the traditional top six made a massive impression, while new signings also took to their first season in the Premier League with aplomb.\n\nGoalkeepers are scrutinized more than most other players in world football, as their mistakes make bigger headlines than the saves they make. The 2020-21 season was no different, as the harsh realities of being the guardian of the sticks were at times brutally exposed by attackers.\n\nOn that note, here are the five best goalkeepers of the 2020-21 Premier League season.\n\n#5 Kasper Schmeichel | Leicester City\n\nChelsea v Leicester City: The Emirates FA Cup Final\n\nKasper Schmeichel has been one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the Premier League over the years and enjoyed yet another fantastic season in the top flight. The Danish international is incredible with the ball at his feet, while he is also the leader of the Leicester City backline.\n\nBrendan Rodgers' side narrowly missed out on a place in the UEFA Champions League next season, but Schmeichel was one of his most reliable players. He played every minute of Premier League football and recorded 11 clean sheets, while he finished the season with zero errors leading to goals.\n\nSchmeichel did, however, jeopardize his side's UCL hopes on the final day of the season. He came off his line for a corner but failed to gather the ball, as it resulted in a goal for Tottenham Hotspur. Nevertheless, the experienced goalkeeper made 88 saves over the course of the season and was largely a reliable figure between the sticks for the Foxes.\n\n#4 Illan Meslier | Leeds United\n\nLeeds United v Manchester United - Premier League\n\nLeeds United took the Premier League by storm after securing promotion from the Championship and finished ninth on the league table with 59 points to their name. While a handful of players enhanced their reputations under Marcelo Bielsa, Illan Meslier's performances between the sticks turned heads across Europe.\n\nThe Frenchman became the youngest goalkeeper in Premier League history to record 10 clean sheets, as he broke Joe Hart's 13-year record in February. Still just 21 years of age, Meslier's reactions are amongst the best in the business, while he also has a knack for coming off his line quickly to suffocate opposition attackers.\n\nIllan Meslier in the Premier League in 2020/21:833 passes140 saves35 appearances24 punches11 clean sheetsThe Leeds number one played more minutes than any other U22 PL player (3,150) and is the youngest ever PL goalkeeper to keep 11 clean sheets.Fully Deserved. \ud83c\udfc6 #LUFC https://t.co/8JXSdwWDtM \u2014 LUFCDATA (@LUFCDATA) May 23, 2021\n\nHe made 35 appearances in the Premier League and recorded 11 clean sheets, as Leeds made their presence felt in their return to the top-flight.\n\n#3 Emiliano Martinez | Aston Villa\n\nCrystal Palace v Aston Villa - Premier League\n\nEmiliano Martinez finally got his big break in the Premier League after swapping Arsenal for Aston Villa last summer. The Argentine shot-stopper delivered a string of magnificent displays for the Gunners at the business end of the 2019-20 season and earned himself a move to Villa Park, where he has quickly established himself as a fan favorite.\n\nUnder Dean Smith, Martinez was an ever-present in the 2020-21 season and recorded a staggering 15 clean sheets, while he also saved one penalty. Martinez had to wait for his time to shine in the Premier League, but he now looks like a fantastic goalkeeper and has proved to be a terrific addition to an exciting Aston Villa squad.\n\n#2 Edouard Mendy | Chelsea\n\nManchester City v Chelsea - Premier League\n\nWith Kepa Arrizabalaga failing to live up to the hype, Chelsea opted to snap up Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy last summer. The Senegalese goalkeeper was hailed as a decent addition, as he joined the club for a modest \u00a322 million fee. He immediately hit the ground running and replaced Arrizabalaga between the sticks, as he impressed with his shot-stopping prowess and ability on the ball.\n\nThe inspiring Edouard Mendy story:\u2022Unemployed at 23 with a pregnant wife\u2022Trains until he got his first pro contract at 24\u2022Helps Reims get promotion to and survive in Ligue 1\u2022Moves to Rennes at 27 where Cech scouts him\u2022Joins Chelsea and will now play in the #UCLfinal\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc pic.twitter.com/DeAbx7nmvc \u2014 ChelseaFCBlogs (@ChelseaFCBlogs_) May 23, 2021\n\nMendy is one of the first names on the team sheet under Thomas Tuchel and has added some much-needed stability to the Chelsea backline, with the addition of Thiago Silva also proving to be an astute one for the Blues.\n\nMendy kept 16 clean sheets and saved one penalty in his debut season in the Premier League. He has firmly established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper and looks set to enjoy a long career at Stamford Bridge.\n\n#1 Ederson Moraes | Manchester City\n\nManchester City v Everton - Premier League\n\nHailed as one of the best ball-playing goalkeepers in world football, Ederson enjoyed another outstanding Premier League season with Manchester City. He won his third league title in four years and also got his hands on the Golden Glove for the second season in succession, as he made 36 appearances in the top-flight.\n\nEderson picks up his second consecutive Premier League Golden Glove \u270b\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com/We5Hz5EMIw \u2014 ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) May 23, 2021\n\nEderson's ball-playing ability is second only to Manuel Neuer, while he is also amongst the very best shot-stoppers in the business.
