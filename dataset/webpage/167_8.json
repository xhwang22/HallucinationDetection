{"Raymond Harry Brown's invention was the precursor to the modern video game console, and it paved the way for the development of the gaming industry.": [{"url": "https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/the-father-of-the-video-game-the-ralph-baer-prototypes-and-electronic-games/video-game-history", "page_content": "Video Game History\n\nFrom the earliest days of computers, people have found ways to play games on them. These early computer programmers weren\u2019t just wasting time or looking for new ways to goof off. They had practical reasons to create games.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, computers took up entire rooms and were so expensive that only universities and large companies could afford them. Most people had both a limited understanding of what these electronic behemoths were able to do and an unfamiliarity with the types of mathematical equations these machines were regularly programmed to compute. Games like tic-tac-toe or William Higinbotham\u2019s 1958 Tennis for Two were excellent ways to attract public interest and support. As an added bonus, computer programmers were able to learn from the creation of games as well because it allowed them to break away from the usual subroutines and challenge the computer\u2019s capabilities.\n\nIt was this mindset that led a group of MIT students during the 1960s to create one of the first and most groundbreaking computer games. Students Steve Russell and his friends were granted access to the school\u2019s new PDP-1 computer providing they used it to create a demonstration program that (1) utilized as many of the computer\u2019s resources as possible and \u201ctaxed those resources to the limit,\u201d (2) remained interesting even after repeated viewings, which meant that each run needed to be slightly different and (3) was interactive.\n\nInspired by the science fiction novels Russell and his friends enjoyed, these computers \u201chackers\u201d decided to create a dueling game between two spaceships. The result, called \u201cSpacewar,\u201d caused a sensation on campus and variations on the game soon spread to other universities that had computer engineering programs.\n\nAlthough Spacewar was fun to play, it was never destined for released to the general public, since computers were still too expensive for personal use. To play Spacewar one needed access to a research facility\u2019s computer, which kept the game\u2019s influence limited to the small computer technology sphere.\n\nIn fact, video games did not get their true start from computer programmers, but from an engineer skilled in another major invention of the 20th century: the television set. By the 1960s, millions of Americans had invested in televisions for their homes, but these television sets were only used for the viewing of entertainment. Engineer Ralph Baer was certain this technology could be used to play games.\n\nIn 1966, while working for Sanders Associates, Inc., Baer began to explore this idea. In 1967, assisted by Sanders technician Bob Tremblay, Baer created the first of several video game test units. Called TVG#1 or TV Game Unit #1, the device, when used with an alignment generator, produced a dot on the television screen that could be manually controlled by the user. Once Baer had established how it was possible to interact with the television set, he and his team were able to design and build increasingly sophisticated prototypes.\n\nSanders senior management were impressed with Baer\u2019s progress and assigned him the task of turning this technology into a commercially viable product. After a few years and numerous test and advancements, Baer and his colleagues developed a prototype for the first multiplayer, multiprogram video game system, nicknamed the \u201cBrown Box.\u201d Sanders licensed the Brown Box to Magnavox, which released the device as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972.\n\nWith fewer than 200,000 units sold, Magnavox Odyssey was not considered a commercial success. Among the contributing factors, poor marketing played a large role. Many potential consumers were under the impression\u2014sometimes encouraged by Magnavox salesmen\u2014that Odyssey would only work on Magnavox televisions. Ultimately, the problem was that Magnavox saw Odyssey as a gimmick to sell more television sets. Executives at Magnavox lacked the vision to see that television games had the potential to become an independent industry, and did not give the product the support it needed.\n\nMeanwhile, a creative young entrepreneur named Nolan Bushnell remembered playing Spacewar during his years as a student at the University of Utah. He began to think of ways that the game could be retailed. Bushnell had past experience with amusement park arcades and had witnessed firsthand the popularity of pinball machines. He believed that Spacewar would make a successful coin-operated machine.\n\nIn 1971, Nutting Associates, a coin-op device manufacturer, released Bushnell\u2019s idea as \u201cComputer Space.\u201d However, while Spacewar had been an enjoyable game, Computer Space proved too complex for the casual game player to understand quickly. The changes that were required to convert the two-player Spacewar to a one-player game made Computer Space frustratingly difficult for those who did learn how to play.\n\nThough Computer Space was a flop, Bushnell still believed that coin-operated video games could be successful. After seeing a demonstration of Magnavox Odyssey\u2019s table tennis game in May 1972, Bushnell set about trying to create an arcade version of the same game. He and his business partner, Ted Dabney, formed Atari, Inc., in June 1972, and released Pong, an arcade ping-pong game, that same year. The first Pong machine was installed in Andy Capp\u2019s Tavern, a bar located in Sunnyvale, California. A few days later, the tavern owner called Atari to send someone out to fix the machine. The problem turned out to be that the cashbox was filled with too many quarters. The coins had overflowed and jammed the machine. Atari clearly had a sensation on its hands.\n\nEmboldened by Pong\u2019s success, Atari partnered with Sears, Roebuck & Company to produce a home version of the game in 1975. Magnavox sued for patent rights infringement. The case was heavily in Magnavox\u2019s favor. Ralph Baer had carefully documented his work. Magnavox could prove that they demonstrated Odyssey to the public in 1972 and that Bushnell had attended the demonstration. (It was even confirmed later that Bushnell had played Odyssey\u2019s tennis game.) Rather than face a lengthy and undoubtedly unsuccessful court case, Atari settled with Magnavox.\n\nThe home version of Pong was just as successful as the arcade version. Atari sold 150,000 units in 1975 alone (compared to the 200,000 Odysseys that took Magnavox three years to sell.) Other companies soon began to produce their own home versions of Pong. Even Magnavox began to market a series of modified Odyssey units that played only their tennis and hockey games. Of these first-generation video game consoles, the most successful was Coleco Telstar, due in part to some luck and the help of Ralph Baer.\n\nColeco, a toy company that later became known for the wildly popular Cabbage Patch Doll in the early 1980s, was just beginning to branch out into video games. Acting on a recommendation from Ralph Baer, Coleco was the first company to place a major order for General Instruments\u2019 AY-3-8500 chip, on which most Pong console clones were based. When General Instruments, which had underestimated the interest in the chip, had trouble meeting production demands, Coleco was at the top of the priority list. While Coleco\u2019s competitors waited for months until General Instruments could complete their orders, Coleco cornered the market.\n\nAt a crucial moment, Coleco Telstar did not pass the interference tests needed for Federal Communications Commission approval. Coleco had a week to fix the problem or the unit would need to be totally redesigned before it could be resubmitted for FCC approval. The process could potentially take months, putting the company well behind its competitors. Without FCC approval, Coleco would be stuck with warehouses full of units that they could not sell.\n\nThe company turned to Sanders and Ralph Baer in hopes that Baer\u2019s experience would be able to help them. Baer found their solution within the week and Coleco received its FCC approval. Telstar sold over one million units in 1976, before being overshadowed by the next generation of video game consoles.\n\nProduced between 1976 and 1983, these second-generation consoles, such as the Atari VCS (also known as the Atari 2600), Mattel\u2019s Intellivision, and ColecoVision, featured interchangeable game cartridges that were retailed separately, rather than games that came preloaded in the unit. This advance allowed users to build a library of games. There was soon a wide variety of games to choose from, but, ironically, this surplus proved to be the one of the key reasons that the industry faced a serious crash during the early 1980s.\n\nIn a classic case of supply outpacing demand, too many games hit the market, and many were of inferior quality. Further complicating matters, there were too many video game consoles from which to choose. Beyond the flooded market, video games consoles now faced growing competition from computers.\n\nThe bulky, room-sized expensive computer behemoths were a thing of the past. The age of the home computer had arrived. For many, purchasing a versatile computer, like the Apple II, Radio Shack\u2019s TRS-80, or the Commodore 64, which could play games in addition to running a multitude of other programs, seemed a more logical investment than buying a system devoted solely to gaming.\n\nSales of video game consoles and cartridges plunged in 1983 and 1984. Many companies like Mattel and Magnavox discontinued their video game lines completely, while Atari, the leader in the field, struggled to remain afloat. Video games remained popular arcade features, but it seemed that the era of home video game systems had ended.\n\nBut in 1985, a small Japanese company proved just the opposite. That year, Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), whose popularity and commercial success surpassed any previous game console. No longer a novelty, video games found a firm foothold mainstream American life, just as Ralph Baer had predicted they would."}, {"url": "https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/the-father-of-the-video-game-the-ralph-baer-prototypes-and-electronic-games/biography", "page_content": "Biography\n\n1923\n\nRalph Baer was born March 8, 1922, in Germany\u2014a dangerous time and place for Jewish children and their families. Baer faced increasing anti-Semitism growing up. The Nuremberg Laws\u2014a series of highly repressive measures passed in 1935 that deprived German Jews of political and social freedom\u2014forced him to leave school at age thirteen, though he pursued his studies on his own.\n\n\n\nUnlike so many during that time, the Baer family was fortunate to have the means to escape Germany for America months before Kristallnacht\u2014the Night of Broken Glass\u2014in 1938. On November 9 of that year, Nazi troops throughout Germany smashed windows of stores and homes owned by Jews and set fire to synagogues, injuring\u2014and even killing\u2014German citizens of Jewish decent. These state-sponsored, anti-Jewish riots are considered to be the start of the Holocaust. Because most of his mother\u2019s family had immigrated to the United States in 1895, there were plenty of relatives who were willing to sponsor Ralph Baer and his family, a key immigration law requirement in America at that time.\n\n\n\n1939 As a young immigrant, Baer had the freedom to choose his own future. He graduated as a radio service technician in 1940 and worked in the field for three years until he was drafted into the U.S. Army. He served one year stateside and two years overseas in Europe where he was assigned to Military Intelligence.\n\nAfter the war, Baer attended the American Television Institute of Technology in Chicago on the G.I. Bill. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television Engineering in 1949 and was consistently employed as an engineer afterwards. In 1955, he joined Sanders Associates, an electronics firm that did most of its work for the military.\n\nDuring this same period, Baer started his own family. He and Dena Whinston married in 1952 and they had three children: sons James (born 1955) and Mark (born 1957) and daughter Nancy (born 1960). To be closer to his family, Baer set up a lab in his basement to work on any after-hours projects.\n\n1944\n\nIn 1966, Baer had an epiphany while waiting at a bus stop. He remembered how, as a new graduate in 1951, he had proposed to the television company that employed him that they should build games into their brand of television sets to differentiate them from those of their competitors. The proposal was rejected, but, fifteen years later, Baer realized that the idea still had merit. By the 1960s, millions of Americans had invested in televisions for their homes, which meant that there was already a large potential market for a product that would allow them to interact with their television sets.\n\nThe next morning at work, Baer wrote a detailed four-page memo specifying his ideas, and how they could be applied, to convince his company to support a modest research and development project. Baer, in an oral history interview that can be found at the National Museum of American History\u2019s Archive Center, recalled that \u201cwhat stands out is the intent. I\u2019m in a military electronics company and I\u2019m starting to write a document\u2014it\u2019s a disclosure\u2014saying to myself, \u2018How do I write this? This has nothing to do with anything! I don\u2019t want anybody who reads this to get turned off.\u2019 So, I made it sound like it applied to whatever the hell it was I was supposed to be doing. So the first thing I don\u2019t do is call it a toy. But I can call it gaming.\u201d Gaming was a term regularly used in the military and gave the project the appearance of being within the company\u2019s scope of interest\n\nHowever, even Baer recognized that this was going to be a stretch. This was one of the reasons he intended video games to be a commercial product from the very start. He would later admit that \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to be embarrassed or what to be. . . . At Sanders, I was supposed to be running a division, not fussing around with TV games, which is what they were called for many years.\u201d\n\nFortunately, this did not deter Baer\u2019s supervisors. They agreed to a modest research project. In 1967, Baer with the assistance of Bob Tremblay, a technician who worked with Baer at Sanders, created the first of several video game test units. Called TVG#1 or TV Game Unit #1, the device, when used with an alignment generator, produced a dot on the television screen that could be manually controlled by the user.\n\nOnce Baer had established how it was possible to interact with the television set, he and his team, comprised of engineers William Harrison and William Rusch, were able to design and build increasingly sophisticated prototypes. Sanders senior management were impressed with Baer\u2019s progress and charged him with the task of turning this technology into a commercially viable product. After a few years and numerous tests and advancements, Baer and his colleagues developed a prototype for the first multiplayer, multiprogram video game system, nicknamed the \u201cBrown Box.\u201d Sanders licensed the Brown Box to Magnavox, which released the device as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972.\n\n\n\nBaer continued to be interested in video game development and to be involved in various projects, both acting for Sanders and under his own initiative. When Sanders decided they wanted to be more directly involved with the video game business, Baer led a team to develop a series of arcade games for them to license. He also encouraged Magnavox to improve Odyssey.\n\nWhen Coleco Telstar, another first-generation video game system, did not pass interference tests needed for Federal Communications Commission approval, the company turned to Sanders and Ralph Baer in hopes that Baer\u2019s experience would be able to help them. Baer found their solution within the week. Coleco received its FCC approval and Coleco Telstar sold over one million units in 1976.\n\nIn 1975, Baer began an independent consulting business, separate from his work at Sanders, to develop electronic toys and games. He partnered with Marvin Glass & Associates in Chicago, the toy design firm responsible for some of the most successful American toys of the 20th century, on several electronic games. The most successful of these was Simon, the electronic memory game. Baer officially retired from Sanders in 1987 to work full time on his consulting business. He continued to invent electronic toys and games until his passing on December 6, 2014.\n\n\n\nRalph Baer donated his video game prototypes, objects, notes, and schematics to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in 2006. In 2014, the Museum collected his workshop to become the landmark object for its Innovation Wing."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/history-of-video-games", "page_content": "Today, video games make up a $100 billion global industry, and nearly two-thirds of American homes have household members who play video games regularly. And it\u2019s really no wonder: Video games have been around for decades and span the gamut of platforms, from arcade systems, to home consoles, to handheld consoles and mobile devices. They\u2019re also often at the forefront of computer technology.\n\nThe Early Days\n\nThough video games are found today in homes worldwide, they actually got their start in the research labs of scientists.\n\nIn 1952, for instance, British professor A.S. Douglas created OXO, also known as noughts and crosses or a tic-tac-toe, as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Cambridge. And in 1958, William Higinbotham created Tennis for Two on a large analog computer and connected oscilloscope screen for the annual visitor\u2019s day at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York.\n\nIn 1962, Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology invented Spacewar!, a computer-based space combat video game for the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1), then a cutting-edge computer mostly found at universities. It was the first video game that could be played on multiple computer installations.\n\nHISTORY Vault: Game Changers: Inside the Video Game Wars Brought to life by Academy Award-winning director Daniel Junge, this is the untold story of the personal battles that gave rise to the multibillion-dollar video game industry. WATCH NOW\n\nDawn of the Home Console\n\nIn 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype multiplayer, multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as \u201cThe Brown Box.\u201d\n\nBaer, who\u2019s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.\n\nYet, one of the Odyssey\u2019s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari\u2019s Pong, the first arcade video game, which the company released in 1972. In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade counterpart.\n\nMagnavox, along with Sanders Associates, would eventually sue Atari for copyright infringement. Atari settled and became an Odyssey licensee; over the next 20 years, Magnavox went on to win more than $100 million in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its video game patents.\n\nIn 1977, Atari released the Atari 2600 (also known as the Video Computer System), a home console that featured joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-colored games, effectively kicking off the second generation of the video game consoles.\n\nThe video game industry had a few notable milestones in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including:\n\nThe release of the Space Invaders arcade game in 1978\n\nThe launch of Activision, the first third-party game developer (which develops software without making consoles or arcade cabinets), in 1979\n\nThe introduction to the United States of Japan\u2019s hugely popular Pac-Man\n\nNintendo\u2019s creation of Donkey Kong, which introduced the world to the character Mario\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s release of its first Flight Simulator game\n\nThe Video Game Crash\n\nIn 1983, the North American video game industry experienced a major \u201ccrash\u201d due to a number of factors, including an oversaturated game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous E.T., an Atari game based on the eponymous movie and often considered the worst game ever created.\n\nLasting a couple of years, the crash led to the bankruptcy of several home computer and video game console companies.\n\nThe video game home industry began to recover in 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), called Famicom in Japan, came to the United States. The NES had improved 8-bit graphics, colors, sound and gameplay over previous consoles.\n\nNintendo, a Japanese company that began as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, released a number of important video game franchises still around today, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nAdditionally, Nintendo imposed various regulations on third-party games developed for its system, helping to combat rushed, low-quality software. Third-party developers released many other long-lasting franchises, such as Capcom\u2019s Mega Man, Konami\u2019s Castlevania, Square\u2019s Final Fantasy, and Enix\u2019s Dragon Quest (Square and Enix would later merge to form Square Enix in 2003).\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made waves again by popularizing handheld gaming with the release of its 8-bit Game Boy video game device and the often-bundled game Tetris. Over the next 25 years, Nintendo would release a number of successful successors to the Game Boy, including the Game Boy color in 1998, Nintendo DS in 2004, and Nintendo 3DS in 2011.\n\nThe First Console War\n\nAlso in 1989, Sega released its 16-bit Genesis console in North America as a successor to its 1986 Sega Master System, which failed to adequately compete against the NES.\n\nWith its technological superiority to the NES, clever marketing, and the 1991 release of the Sonic the Hedgehog game, the Genesis made significant headway against its older rival. In 1991, Nintendo released its 16-bit Super NES console in North America, launching the first real \u201cconsole war.\u201d\n\nThe early- to mid-1990s saw the release of a wealth of popular games on both consoles, including new franchises such as Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, a fighting game that depicted blood and gore on the Genesis version of the game.\n\nIn response to the violent game (as well as congressional hearings about violent video games), Sega created the Videogame Rating Council in 1993 to provide descriptive labeling for every game sold on a Sega home console. The council later gives rise to the industry-wide Entertainment Software Rating Board, which is still used today to rate video games based on content.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, video games leaped to the Big Screen with the release of the Super Mario Bros. live-action movie in 1993, followed by Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat over the next two years. Numerous movies based on video games have been released since.\n\nWith a much larger library of games, lower price point, and successful marketing, the Genesis had leapfrogged ahead of the SNES in North America by this time. But Sega was unable to find similar success in Japan.\n\nThe Rise of 3D Gaming\n\nWith a leap in computer technology, the fifth generation of video games ushered in the three-dimensional era of gaming.\n\nIn 1995, Sega released in North America its Saturn system, the first 32-bit console that played games on CDs rather than cartridges, five months ahead of schedule. This move was to beat Sony\u2019s first foray into video games, the Playstation, which sold for $100 less than the Saturn when it launched later that year. The following year, Nintendo released its cartridge-based 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64.\n\nThough Sega and Nintendo each released their fair share of highly-rated, on-brand 3D titles, such as Virtua Fighter on the Saturn and Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64, the established video game companies couldn\u2019t compete with Sony\u2019s strong third-party support, which helped the Playstation secure numerous exclusive titles.\n\nSimply put: Sony dominated the video game market and would continue to do so into the next generation. In fact, the Playstation 2, released in 2000 and able to play original Playstation games, would become the best-selling game console of all time.\n\nThe Playstation 2, which was the first console that used DVDs, went up against the Sega Dreamcast (released in 1999), the Nintendo Gamecube (2001), and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox (2001).\n\nThe Dreamcast\u2014considered by many to be ahead of its time and one of the greatest consoles ever made for several reasons, including its capability for online gaming\u2014was a commercial flop that ended Sega\u2019s console efforts. Sega pulled the plug on the system in 2001, becoming a third-party software company henceforth.\n\nModern Age of Gaming\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360, Sony\u2019s Playstation 3, and Nintendo\u2019s Wii kicked off the modern age of high-definition gaming. Though the Playstation 3\u2014the only system at the time to play Blu-rays\u2014was successful in its own right, Sony, for the first time, faced stiff competition from its rivals.\n\nThe Xbox 360, which had similar graphics capabilities to the Playstation 3, was lauded for its online gaming ecosystem and won far more Game Critics Awards than the other platforms in 2007; it also featured the Microsoft Kinect, a state-of-the-art motion capture system that offered a different way to play video games (though the Kinect never caught on with core gamers or game developers).\n\nAnd despite being technologically inferior to the other two systems, the Wii trounced its competition in sales. Its motion-sensitive remotes made gaming more active than ever before, helping it appeal to a much larger slice of the general public, including people in retirement homes.\n\nTowards the end of the decade and beginning of the next, video games spread to social media platforms like Facebook and mobile devices like the iPhone, reaching a more casual gaming audience. Rovio, the company behind the Angry Birds mobile device game (and, later Angry Birds animated movie), reportedly made a whopping $200 million in 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Skylanders: Spyro\u2019s Adventure brought video games into the physical world. The game required players to place plastic toy figures (sold separately) onto an accessory, which reads the toys\u2019 NFC tags to bring the characters into the game. The next few years would see several sequels and other toy-video game hybrids, such as Disney Infinity, which features Disney characters.\n\nThe 8th generation of video games began with the release of Nintendo\u2019s Wii U in 2012, followed by the Playstation 4 and Xbox One in 2013. Despite featuring a touch screen remote control that allowed off-TV gaming and being able to play Wii games, the Wii U was a commercial failure\u2014the opposite of its competition\u2014and was discontinued in 2017.\n\nIn early 2017, Nintendo released its Wii U successor, the Nintendo Switch, the only system to allow both television-based and handheld gaming. Microsoft released its 4K-ready console, the Xbox One X, in late 2017, and followed up in 2020 with the Xbox Series X and Series S. In 2020, Sony released the Playstation 5, a successor to Playstation 4.\n\nWith their new revamped consoles, both Sony and Microsoft currently have their sights set on virtual reality gaming, a technology that has the potential to change the way players experience video games.\n\nSources\n\n\u2018Spacewar!\u2019 The story of the world\u2019s first digital video game.

It reminded me of some truly great gaming moments I experienced growing up with the first version. That got me thinking: how did we get here?\n\nNo, not us, not humanity. That\u2019s a whole different article entirely. I\u2019m talking about video game history. Day one stuff.\n\nWhat started it all? What allowed me to play as Joan of Arc and her French compatriots during the Hundred Years\u2019 War?\n\nThe evolution of video games is a rather recent phenomenon in our history. Only a true gamer would know what I am about to tell you, so let\u2019s get this history lesson started.\n\nWho Invented the First Video Game?\n\n\n\nI think it isn\u2019t entirely unreasonable that the first videogame ever was Pong. We all love and appreciate Pong. Pong is often cited as one of the first widely released games for Atari, so it gets a lot of limelight.\n\nThe first real video game wasn\u2019t invented by the talented team at Atari headed by Nolan Bushnell. No, that honor belongs to William Higinbotham.\n\nIn the 1950s, Higinbotham created Tennis for Two. Higinbotham created this game as a fun diversion, to show the power of technology.\n\nLike many in history, he didn\u2019t fully grasp the significance of his for a foray into video gaming.\n\nWhat followed was \u2018Spacewar!\u2019 a game developed by Steve Russell in 1962 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT). This was a two-player game in which both players faced off in an intense dogfight, each player controlling either the \u2018wedge\u2019 or the \u2018needle\u2019. The game included gravity effects and faster than light travel.\n\nIt sounds like a current-generation game, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nWhat Was the First Game Console?\n\n\n\nToday we have a great slew of options for video gaming fun. We all know Xbox and PS4, but what about the very first console?\n\nThat honor belongs to the Magnavox Odyssey, invented by Ralph Baer. Being able to play video games in one\u2019s home; the idea was revolutionary. I believe that we may take it for granted today, but people used to have to journey to the local arcade, pizza parlor, or bowling alley to play their favorite games.\n\nLeave the comfort of my own bed?\n\nNo thanks!\n\nThe Golden Age of Arcade Games\n\n\ufeff\n\nSpeaking of arcade games, the late 1970s and early 1980s experienced an impressive boom in popularity, bringing in serious commercial success.\n\nSpecifically, the release of Space Invaders for arcade systems in 1978 marked a new dawn for games. If you don\u2019t know Space Invaders, what rock have you been living under?\n\nThis simple, yet addictive game features the player as a lone gunner ship occupying the bottom of the screen. The top half has the titular space invaders encroaching on the player, increasing in speed as their numbers dwindle. This frantic speed was surprisingly unintended, as the game developer had trouble programming them to remain a consistent speed. He kept it in the game and the rest is history.\n\nCan you imagine if the alien invaders just kept their normal, slow pace the entire time? Not only would Space Invaders be super easy, but there would be no stakes to play for. It would be a boring exercise in merely shooting enemies. Instead, we have an adrenaline-filled defense of the earth.\n\nArcades were filling up with players, and some serious money was coming in. After the millions in quarters earned by Space Invaders, it wouldn\u2019t be long until a successor in the most-played arcade game mantle was once again taken up by a new contender.\n\nThis was in the form of the beloved Pac-Man.\n\n\n\nIn each level, the player must navigate through a maze without dead ends, chomping all of the white dots, mixed with fruit, for points.\n\nSounds easy enough, right?\n\nThe entire time the player is hounded by colorful ghosts, hellbent on killing Pac-Man. The player has an opportunity for revenge, for if they get one of the bigger dots located at the corners of the maze, they can get revenge on the ghosts: they become vulnerable and can be eaten for extra points.\n\nPac-Man was an international hit and spawned multiple spin-offs like Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nTrouble in Gaming Paradise\n\n\n\nAs revolutionary as those arcade games were, the gaming industry was facing a crisis: the market was being saturated, making sales and development suffer. The rise of PC gaming also made arcade games less interesting to many consumers.\n\nWas this to be the end of video games as we know them? It sure seemed like it.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, the sheer volume of gaming options seemed to be muscling out arcade games, which experienced over 1500 closures, not to mention seriously suffering economic setbacks.\n\nThere is that famous rumor that Atari had all of their remaining copies of the abysmal E.T. the Extraterrestrial buried in a New Mexico landfill. It became an urban legend, often being repeated as a humorous, but a cautionary tale. Turns out that it was partially true; a Canadian film crew traveled to the landfill, excavated and found copies of E.T., as well as other discarded Atari cartridges.\n\nSerious analysts and economists were pessimistic when evaluating gaming\u2019s future.\n\nWas it to be a one-time fad?\n\nLuckily for us, the development of consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), gave the market a big boost.\n\nIf the gaming markets weren\u2019t aided by these different factors, you might be filling your cart with Steam sale items and playing the newest Call of Duty Modern Warfare. Perish the thought!\n\nThe NES, Accessories, and The Legend of Zelda\n\n\n\nThe NES was a best-selling console, producing games from 1985 to 1995. The first releases were Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. The NES was also revolutionary for including multiple accessories with the console, enhancing the already new and appealing gameplay.\n\nSome of you may remember Duck Hunt\u2014the game where you need to shoot ducks with a light gun. This was called the \u2018Zapper\u2019 and was released as an accessory in 1985. This allowed the player to feel as if they were shooting their prey on screen. Just remember to hit 100% of the time, or else that pesky hunting dog will laugh at you!\n\nWith the NES pulling some seriously heavyweight, the designer of Donkey Kong, Shigeru Miyamoto, really got a chance to shine.\n\nIn 1987, Nintendo released The Legend of Zelda.\n\nThis is the first appearance of our silent protagonist, Link, as he slays baddies and completes his quest. Miyamoto was inspired by his love of nature, as well as the adventuring he would do as a child. He harnessed his imagination and created of the most beloved franchises in video gaming.\n\nAny idea of how many Zelda games there are? Probably around 8 or something, right? How about 19 in the main series, not even mentioning the spin-offs and appearances in the Super Smash Bros. series.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was extremely influential to me as a video gamer. It inflamed my imagination, something that Miyamoto set out to do so many years ago.\n\nThe SNES and PlayStation\n\n\n\nThe Nintendo Entertainment System established Nintendo literally as a household name. They doubled down and released their follow up console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.\n\nThis is where Nintendo dominated the games market.\n\nSNES is perhaps the most iconic gaming system ever released. While still using cartridges, the SNES upped the ante with graphical capabilities, game design, and audio. It was the bridge between the old world of video games and the modern era.\n\nFor example, Star Fox was a famous example of using 3D graphics in a home console game. Nintendo also impressed the world by developing the console\u2019s top 3 selling games in the console\u2019s history: Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, and Super Mario Bros. 3. Not only can they develop winning consoles, but their games rule.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sony had developed the first major disc-based consoles, the PlayStation in 1994. The PlayStation introduced games like Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VIII, and Silent Hill. These titles included extensive, impressive cutscenes, often including recorded dialogue.\n\nGames were getting closer and closer to being movie-like. The narratives were able to be more in-depth, moodier and more atmospheric. A game like Silent Hill would have never succeeded in any system but the PlayStation. The atmosphere, the sound, the graphics; they all hit the mark at the right place and time. The variety and graphical powerhouse the consoles were at the time made a lasting impact on gaming.\n\nN64 and PlayStation 2\n\n\n\nThe next two releases from Nintendo and Sony would be so revolutionary in design that we are still feeling the impacts from both of them well into the present.\n\nIn 1996, the Nintendo 64, (named for the 64-bit processing), was released to great fanfare. All of your favorite Nintendo characters were now in fully realized 3D. A highlight was Super Mario 64. In it, Mario must make his way through Princess Peach\u2019s castle, experiencing a multitude of vastly different worlds. The sheer scope of this game had many players reeling.\n\nLikewise, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Donkey Kong 64 brought back many loveable characters to share the modern gaming stage. Alongside the PlayStation, the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn made up what is known as the fifth console generation.\n\nNot to be outdone, Sony released what is still the best-selling console of all time: the PlayStation 2. Released in 2000, the PS2 has sold over 150 million units. This console brought us hits like Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Grand Theft Auto games.\n\nAn amazing feature of the PS2, the backward compatibility, allowed for gamers who had an extensive collection of original PlayStation games to be able to play them effortlessly on their new PS2 consoles. This tradition continued well into the present, (albeit a little more limited with other companies like Microsoft, with consoles like Xbox).\n\nPS2 had a lifespan of 13 years, releasing classic games that many of us remember fondly. Luckily for us, we can easily access these titles from the Sony store.\n\nMicrosoft and World of WarCraft\n\n\n\nMostly focusing on PC gaming, Microsoft blew everyone away with releasing their very first console, the Xbox, in 200. With blockbuster hits like Halo revolutionizing multiplayer, Microsoft was not to be trifled with.\n\nThey went a step further by introducing Xbox LIVE, their subscription-based online gaming service. This meant you could regularly game with buddies online, buy DLC and access different goodies. In turn, this gave the anticipated release of Halo 2 even more acclaim.\n\nHalo 2 broke sales records and had people funneling onto Xbox LIVE to finally play Halo\u2019s addictive multiplayer online against people a world away. The time for trash talk was over; you now had the chance to put the question to rest: who is the best Halo player you know?\n\nAt the same time, Blizzard, the creators of StarCraft, created their most ambitious and popular product yet: World of Warcraft.\n\nIt was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG or MMO), where you inhabited the land Azeroth from the Warcraft franchise, leveled up your unique character, did raids, and got some serious loot. It was a smash hit and become a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nThe TV comedy South park did an entire episode about WoW, including a fictional weapon called \u2018the sword of truth\u2019. Blizzard eventually made the Sword of Truth an actual in-game item. Art imitates art!\n\nThe Wii and Big Budgets\n\n\n\nBlack Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s cold, it\u2019s early, and you need to get a hold of one of the most talked-about consoles ever made; the Nintendo Wii.\n\n\u201cThe Wii?\u201d you ask. Yes, the name is a bit\u2026unconventional.\n\nHowever, it brought a motion-based play to the table. This encouraged players to get off the couch and physically take part in their adventures.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess had players swinging swords with actual arm motions and Wii Sports playing a myriad of lighthearted sports games.\n\nThis era was the start of true big-budget gaming. Millions of dollars were now being spent on the development of games; some were the same budgets as blockbuster Hollywood productions.\n\nFor example, Destiny, a first-person shooter by Bungie, allegedly had a budget of almost half a billion dollars! This would take the world of gaming even higher into the cultural zeitgeist. It wasn\u2019t an isolating pastime anymore; it was true pop culture, right alongside movies, music, and TV.\n\nToday\n\n\n\nThe game industry shows no signs of stopping. Indeed, it seems since the end of the gaming crash in 1985, game developers have had an insatiable hunger to produce consoles and games.\n\nAs a gamer, we have never been more privileged. We have our pick of the litter: will it be the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PC, Mac, mobile, or the Wii U? They are even releasing versions of the classic SNES and NES systems, allowing for newer gamers to travel back in time and see what the \u2018dark ages\u2019 were like. VR consoles are seemingly the new piece of gaming hardware to look out for and cross platform gaming is the latest in multiplayer tech.\n\nWhichever you choose, look back fondly on the timeline of video game history, be grateful that Pac-Man had to walk so Kratos could run."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/science/history-of-science/The-rise-of-modern-science", "page_content": "In 1543, as he lay on his deathbed, Copernicus finished reading the proofs of his great work; he died just as it was published. His De revolutionibus orbium coelestium libri VI (\u201cSix Books Concerning the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs\u201d) was the opening shot in a revolution whose consequences were greater than those of any other intellectual event in the history of humankind. The scientific revolution radically altered the conditions of thought and of material existence in which the human race lives, and its effects are not yet exhausted.\n\nAll this was caused by Copernicus daring to place the Sun, not the Earth, at the centre of the cosmos. Copernicus actually cited Hermes Trismegistos to justify this idea, and his language was thoroughly Platonic. But he meant his work as a serious work in astronomy, not philosophy, so he set out to justify it observationally and mathematically. The results were impressive. At one stroke, Copernicus reduced a complexity verging on chaos to elegant simplicity. The apparent back-and-forth movements of the planets, which required prodigious ingenuity to accommodate within the Ptolemaic system, could be accounted for just in terms of the Earth\u2019s own orbital motion added to or subtracted from the motions of the planets. Variation in planetary brightness was also explained by this combination of motions. The fact that Mercury and Venus were never found opposite the Sun in the sky Copernicus explained by placing their orbits closer to the Sun than that of the Earth. Indeed, Copernicus was able to place the planets in order of their distances from the Sun by considering their speeds and thus to construct a system of the planets, something that had eluded Ptolemy. This system had a simplicity, coherence, and aesthetic charm that made it irresistible to those who felt that God was the supreme artist. His was not a rigorous argument, but aesthetic considerations are not to be ignored in the history of science.\n\nCopernicus did not solve all of the difficulties of the Ptolemaic system. He had to keep some of the cumbrous apparatus of epicycles and other geometrical adjustments, as well as a few Aristotelian crystalline spheres. The result was neater, but not so striking that it commanded immediate universal assent. Moreover, there were some implications that caused considerable concern: Why should the crystalline orb containing the Earth circle the Sun? And how was it possible for the Earth itself to revolve on its axis once in 24 hours without hurling all objects, including humans, off its surface? No known physics could answer these questions, and the provision of such answers was to be the central concern of the scientific revolution.\n\nMore was at stake than physics and astronomy, for one of the implications of the Copernican system struck at the very foundations of contemporary society. If the Earth revolved around the Sun, then the apparent positions of the fixed stars should shift as the Earth moves in its orbit. Copernicus and his contemporaries could detect no such shift (called stellar parallax), and there were only two interpretations possible to explain this failure. Either the Earth was at the centre, in which case no parallax was to be expected, or the stars were so far away that the parallax was too small to be detected. Copernicus chose the latter and thereby had to accept an enormous cosmos consisting mostly of empty space. God, it had been assumed, did nothing in vain, so for what purposes might he have created a universe in which Earth and humankind were lost in immense space? To accept Copernicus was to give up the Dantean cosmos. The Aristotelian hierarchy of social place, political position, and theological gradation would vanish, to be replaced by the flatness and plainness of Euclidean space. It was a grim prospect and not one that recommended itself to most 16th-century intellectuals, and so Copernicus\u2019s grand idea remained on the periphery of astronomical thought. All astronomers were aware of it, some measured their own views against it, but only a small handful eagerly accepted it.\n\nIn the century and a half following Copernicus, two easily discernible scientific movements developed. The first was critical, the second, innovative and synthetic. They worked together to bring the old cosmos into disrepute and, ultimately, to replace it with a new one. Although they existed side by side, their effects can more easily be seen if they are treated separately."}, {"url": "https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/10-2-the-evolution-of-electronic-games/", "page_content": "10.2 The Evolution of Electronic Games\n\nLearning Objectives Identify the major companies involved in video game production. Explain the important innovations that drove the acceptance of video games by mainstream culture. Determine major technological developments that influenced the evolution of video games.\n\nPong, the electronic table-tennis simulation game, was the first video game for many people who grew up in the 1970s and is now a famous symbol of early video games. However, the precursors to modern video games were created as early as the 1950s. In 1952 a computer simulation of tic-tac-toe was developed for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC), one of the first stored-information computers, and in 1958 a game called Tennis for Two was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a way to entertain people coming through the laboratory on tours (Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2008).\n\nThese games would generate little interest among the modern game-playing public, but at the time they enthralled their users and introduced the basic elements of the cultural video game experience. In a time before personal computers, these games allowed the general public to access technology that had been restricted to the realm of abstract science. Tennis for Two created an interface where anyone with basic motor skills could use a complex machine. The first video games functioned early on as a form of media by essentially disseminating the experience of computer technology to those who did not have access to it.\n\nAs video games evolved, their role as a form of media grew as well. Video games have grown from simple tools that made computing technology understandable to forms of media that can communicate cultural values and human relationships.\n\nThe 1970s: The Rise of the Video Game The 1970s saw the rise of video games as a cultural phenomenon. A 1972 article in Rolling Stone describes the early days of computer gaming:\n\nReliably, at any nighttime moment (i.e. non-business hours) in North America hundreds of computer technicians are effectively out of their bodies, locked in life-or-death space combat computer-projected onto cathode ray tube display screens, for hours at a time, ruining their eyes, numbing their fingers in frenzied mashing of control buttons, joyously slaying their friend and wasting their employers\u2019 valuable computer time. Something basic is going on (Brand, 1972).\n\nThis scene was describing Spacewar!, a game developed in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that spread to other college campuses and computing centers. In the early \u201970s, very few people owned computers. Most computer users worked or studied at university, business, or government facilities. Those with access to computers were quick to utilize them for gaming purposes. Arcade Games The first coin-operated arcade game was modeled on Spacewar! It was called Computer Space, and it fared poorly among the general public because of its difficult controls. In 1972, Pong, the table-tennis simulator that has come to symbolize early computer games, was created by the fledgling company Atari, and it was immediately successful. Pong was initially placed in bars with pinball machines and other games of chance, but as video games grew in popularity, they were placed in any establishment that would take them. By the end of the 1970s, so many video arcades were being built that some towns passed zoning laws limiting them (Kent, 1997). The end of the 1970s ushered in a new era\u2014what some call the golden age of video games\u2014with the game Space Invaders, an international phenomenon that exceeded all expectations. In Japan, the game was so popular that it caused a national coin shortage. Games like Space Invaders illustrate both the effect of arcade games and their influence on international culture. In two different countries on opposite sides of the globe, Japanese and American teenagers, although they could not speak to one another, were having the same experiences thanks to a video game. Video Game Consoles The first video game console for the home began selling in 1972. It was the Magnavox Odyssey, and it was based on prototypes built by Ralph Behr in the late 1960s. This system included a Pong-type game, and when the arcade version of Pong became popular, the Odyssey began to sell well. Atari, which was making arcade games at the time, decided to produce a home version of Pong and released it in 1974. Although this system could only play one game, its graphics and controls were superior to the Odyssey, and it was sold through a major department store, Sears. Because of these advantages, the Atari home version of Pong sold well, and a host of other companies began producing and selling their own versions of Pong (Herman, 2008). A major step forward in the evolution of video games was the development of game cartridges that stored the games and could be interchanged in the console. With this technology, users were no longer limited to a set number of games, leading many video game console makers to switch their emphasis to producing games. Several groups, such as Magnavox, Coleco, and Fairchild, released versions of cartridge-type consoles, but Atari\u2019s 2600 console had the upper hand because of the company\u2019s work on arcade games. Atari capitalized off of its arcade successes by releasing games that were well known to a public that was frequenting arcades. The popularity of games such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man made the Atari 2600 a successful system. The late 1970s also saw the birth of companies such as Activision, which developed third-party games for the Atari 2600 (Wolf). Home Computers The birth of the home computer market in the 1970s paralleled the emergence of video game consoles. The first computer designed and sold for the home consumer was the Altair. It was first sold in 1975, several years after video game consoles had been selling, and it sold mainly to a hobbyist market. During this period, people such as Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, were building computers by hand and selling them to get their start-up businesses going. In 1977, three important computers\u2014Radio Shack\u2019s TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and the Apple II\u2014were produced and began selling to the home market (Reimer, 2005). The rise of personal computers allowed for the development of more complex games. Designers of games such as Mystery House, developed in 1979 for the Apple II, and Rogue, developed in 1980 and played on IBM PCs, used the processing power of early home computers to develop video games that had extended plots and story lines. In these games, players moved through landscapes composed of basic graphics, solving problems and working through an involved narrative. The development of video games for the personal computer platform expanded the ability of video games to act as media by allowing complex stories to be told and new forms of interaction to take place between players.\n\nThe 1980s: The Crash Atari\u2019s success in the home console market was due in large part to its ownership of already-popular arcade games and the large number of game cartridges available for the system. These strengths, however, eventually proved detrimental to the company and led to what is now known as the video game crash of 1983. Atari bet heavily on its past successes with popular arcade games by releasing Pac-Man for the Atari 2600. Pac-Man was a successful arcade game that did not translate well to the home console, leading to disappointed consumers and lower-than-expected sales. Additionally, Atari produced 10 million of the lackluster Pac-Man games on its first run, despite the fact that active consoles were only estimated at 10 million. Similar mistakes were made with a game based on the movie E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, which has gained notoriety as one of the worst games in Atari\u2019s history. It was not received well by consumers despite the success of the movie, and Atari had again bet heavily on its success. Piles of unsold E.T. game cartridges were reportedly buried in the New Mexico desert under a veil of secrecy (Monfort & Bogost, 2009). As retail outlets became increasingly wary of home console failures, they began stocking fewer games on shelves. This action, combined with an increasing number of companies producing games, led to overproduction and a resulting fallout in the video game market in 1983. Many smaller game developers did not have the capacity to withstand this downturn and went out of business. Although Coleco and Atari were able to make it through the crash, neither company regained its former share of the video game market. It was 1985 when the video game market picked up again. The Rise of Nintendo Nintendo, a Japanese card and novelty producer that had begun to produce electronic games in the 1970s, was responsible for arcade games such as Donkey Kong in the early 1980s. Its first home console, developed in 1984 for sale in Japan, tried to succeed where Atari had failed. The Nintendo system used newer, better microchips, bought in large quantities, to ensure high-quality graphics at a price consumers could afford. Keeping console prices low meant Nintendo had to rely on games for most of its profits and maintain control of game production. This was something Atari had failed to do, and it led to a glut of low-priced games that caused the crash of 1983. Nintendo got around this problem with proprietary circuits that would not allow unlicensed games to be played on the console. This allowed Nintendo to dominate the home video game market through the end of the decade, when one-third of homes in the United States had a Nintendo system (Cross & Smits, 2005). Nintendo introduced its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the United States in 1985. The game Super Mario Brothers, released with the system, was also a landmark in video game development. The game employed a narrative in the same manner as more complicated computer games, but its controls were accessible and its objectives simple. The game appealed to a younger demographic, generally boys in the 8\u201314 range, than the one targeted by Atari (Kline, et. al., 2003). Its designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, tried to mimic the experiences of childhood adventures, creating a fantasy world not based on previous models of science fiction or other literary genres (McLaughlin, 2007). Super Mario Brothers also gave Nintendo an iconic character who has been used in numerous other games, television shows, and even a movie. The development of this type of character and fantasy world became the norm for video game makers. Games such as The Legend of Zelda became franchises with film and television possibilities rather than simply one-off games. As video games developed as a form of media, the public struggled to come to grips with the kind of messages this medium was passing on to children. These were no longer simple games of reflex that could be compared to similar nonvideo games or sports; these were forms of media that included stories and messages that concerned parents and children\u2019s advocates. Arguments about the larger meaning of the games became common, with some seeing the games as driven by ideas of conquest and gender stereotypes, whereas others saw basic stories about traveling and exploration (Fuller & Jenkins, 1995). Other Home Console Systems Other software companies were still interested in the home console market in the mid-1980s. Atari released the 2600jr and the 7800 in 1986 after Nintendo\u2019s success, but the consoles could not compete with Nintendo. The Sega Corporation, which had been involved with arcade video game production, released its Sega Master System in 1986. Although the system had more graphics possibilities than the NES, Sega failed to make a dent in Nintendo\u2019s market share until the early 1990s, with the release of Sega Genesis (Kerr, 2005). Computer Games Flourish and Innovate The enormous number of games available for Atari consoles in the early 1980s took its toll on video arcades. In 1983, arcade revenues had fallen to a 3-year low, leading game makers to turn to newer technologies that could not be replicated by home consoles. This included arcade games powered by laser discs, such as Dragon\u2019s Lair and Space Ace, but their novelty soon wore off, and laser-disc games became museum pieces (Harmetz, 1984). In 1989, museums were already putting on exhibitions of early arcade games that included ones from the early 1980s. Although newer games continued to come out on arcade platforms, they could not compete with the home console market and never achieved their previous successes from the early 1980s. Increasingly, arcade gamers chose to stay at home to play games on computers and consoles. Today, dedicated arcades are a dying breed. Most that remain, like the Dave & Buster\u2019s and Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s chains, offer full-service restaurants and other entertainment attractions to draw in business. Home games fared better than arcades because they could ride the wave of personal computer purchases that occurred in the 1980s. Some important developments in video games occurred in the mid-1980s with the development of online games. Multiuser dungeons, or MUDs, were role-playing games played online by multiple users at once. The games were generally text-based, describing the world of the MUD through text rather than illustrating it through graphics. The games allowed users to create a character and move through different worlds, accomplishing goals that awarded them with new skills. If characters attained a certain level of proficiency, they could then design their own area of the world. Habitat, a game developed in 1986 for the Commodore 64, was a graphic version of this type of game. Users dialed up on modems to a central host server and then controlled characters on screen, interacting with other users (Reimer, 2005). During the mid-1980s, a demographic shift occurred. Between 1985 and 1987, games designed to run on business computers rose from 15 percent to 40 percent of games sold (Elmer-Dewitt, et. al., 1987). This trend meant that game makers could use the increased processing power of business computers to create more complex games. It also meant adults were interested in computer games and could become a profitable market.\n\nThe 1990s: The Rapid Evolution of Video Games Video games evolved at a rapid rate throughout the 1990s, moving from the first 16-bit systems (named for the amount of data they could process and store) in the early 1990s to the first Internet-enabled home console in 1999. As companies focused on new marketing strategies, wider audiences were targeted, and video games\u2019 influence on culture began to be felt. Console Wars Nintendo\u2019s dominance of the home console market throughout the late 1980s allowed it to build a large library of games for use on the NES. This also proved to be a weakness, however, because Nintendo was reluctant to improve or change its system for fear of making its game library obsolete. Technology had changed in the years since the introduction of the NES, and companies such as NEC and Sega were ready to challenge Nintendo with 16-bit systems (Slaven). The Sega Master System had failed to challenge the NES, but with the release of its 16-bit system, Sega Genesis, the company pursued a new marketing strategy. Whereas Nintendo targeted 8- to 14-year-olds, Sega\u2019s marketing plan targeted 15- to 17-year olds, making games that were more mature and advertising during programs such as the MTV Video Music Awards. The campaign successfully branded Sega as a cooler version of Nintendo and moved mainstream video games into a more mature arena. Nintendo responded to the Sega Genesis with its own 16-bit system, the Super NES, and began creating more mature games as well. Games such as Sega\u2019s Mortal Kombat and Nintendo\u2019s Street Fighter competed to raise the level of violence possible in a video game. Sega\u2019s advertisements even suggested that its game was better because of its more violent possibilities (Gamespot). By 1994, companies such as 3DO, with its 32-bit system, and Atari, with its allegedly 64-bit Jaguar, attempted to get in on the home console market but failed to use effective marketing strategies to back up their products. Both systems fell out of production before the end of the decade. Sega, fearing that its system would become obsolete, released the 32-bit Saturn system in 1995. The system was rushed into production and did not have enough games available to ensure its success (Cyberia PC). Sony stepped in with its PlayStation console at a time when Sega\u2019s Saturn was floundering and before Nintendo\u2019s 64-bit system had been released. This system targeted an even older demographic of 14- to 24-year-olds and made a large effect on the market; by March of 2007, Sony had sold 102 million PlayStations (Edge Staff, 2009). Computer Games Gain Mainstream Acceptance Computer games had avid players, but they were still a niche market in the early 1990s. An important step in the mainstream acceptance of personal computer games was the development of the first-person shooter genre. First popularized by the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3D, these games put the player in the character\u2019s perspective, making it seem as if the player were firing weapons and being attacked. Doom, released in 1993, and Quake, released in 1996, used the increased processing power of personal computers to create vivid three-dimensional worlds that were impossible to fully replicate on video game consoles of the era. These games pushed realism to new heights and began attracting public attention for their graphic violence. Another trend was reaching out to audiences outside of the video-game-playing community. Myst, an adventure game where the player walked around an island solving a mystery, drove sales of CD-ROM drives for computers. Myst, its sequel Riven, and other nonviolent games such as SimCity actually outsold Doom and Quake in the 1990s (Miller, 1999). These nonviolent games appealed to people who did not generally play video games, increasing the form\u2019s audience and expanding the types of information that video games put across. Online Gaming Gains Popularity A major advance in game technology came with the increase in Internet use by the general public in the 1990s. A major feature of Doom was the ability to use multiplayer gaming through the Internet. Strategy games such as Command and Conquer and Total Annihilation also included options where players could play each other over the Internet. Other fantasy-inspired role-playing games, such as Ultima Online, used the Internet to initiate the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) genre (Reimer). These games used the Internet as their platform, much like the text-based MUDs, creating a space where individuals could play the game while socially interacting with one another. Portable Game Systems The development of portable game systems was another important aspect of video games during the 1990s. Handheld games had been in use since the 1970s, and a system with interchangeable cartridges had even been sold in the early 1980s. Nintendo released the Game Boy in 1989, using the same principles that made the NES dominate the handheld market throughout the 1990s. The Game Boy was released with the game Tetris, using the game\u2019s popularity to drive purchases of the unit. The unit\u2019s simple design meant users could get 20 hours of playing time on a set of batteries, and this basic design was left essentially unaltered for most of the decade. More advanced handheld systems, such as the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear, could not compete with the Game Boy despite their superior graphics and color displays (Hutsko, 2000). The decade-long success of the Game Boy belies the conventional wisdom of the console wars that more advanced technology makes for a more popular system. The Game Boy\u2019s static, simple design was readily accessible, and its stability allowed for a large library of games to be developed for it. Despite using technology almost a decade old, the Game Boy accounted for 30 percent of Nintendo of America\u2019s overall revenues at the end of the 1990s (Hutsko, 2000).\n\nThe Early 2000s: 21st-Century Games The Console Wars Continue Sega gave its final effort in the console wars with the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. This console could connect to the Internet, emulating the sophisticated computer games of the 1990s. The new features of the Sega Dreamcast were not enough to save the brand, however, and Sega discontinued production in 2001, leaving the console market entirely (Business Week). A major problem for Sega\u2019s Dreamcast was Sony\u2019s release of the PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2000. The PS2 could function as a DVD player, expanding the role of the console into an entertainment device that did more than play video games. This console was incredibly successful, enjoying a long production run, with more than 106 million units sold worldwide by the end of the decade (A Brief History of Game Console Warfare). In 2001, two major consoles were released to compete with the PS2: the Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube. The Xbox was an attempt by Microsoft to enter the market with a console that expanded on the functions of other game consoles. The unit had features similar to a PC, including a hard drive and an Ethernet port for online play through its service, Xbox Live. The popularity of the first-person shooter game Halo, an Xbox exclusive release, boosted sales as well. Nintendo\u2019s GameCube did not offer DVD playback capabilities, choosing instead to focus on gaming functions. Both of these consoles sold millions of units but did not come close to the sales of the PS2. Computer Gaming Becomes a Niche Market As consoles developed to rival the capabilities of personal computers, game developers began to focus more on games for consoles. From 2000 to the end of the decade, the popularity of personal computer games has gradually declined. The computer gaming community, while still significant, is focused on game players who are willing to pay a lot of money on personal computers that are designed specifically for gaming, often including multiple monitors and user modifications that allow personal computers to play newer games. This type of market, though profitable, is not large enough to compete with the audience for the much cheaper game consoles (Kalning, 2008). The Evolution of Portable Gaming Nintendo continued its control of the handheld game market into the 2000s with the 2001 release of the Game Boy Advance, a redesigned Game Boy that offered 32-bit processing and compatibility with older Game Boy games. In 2004, anticipating Sony\u2019s upcoming handheld console, Nintendo released the Nintendo DS, a handheld console that featured two screens and Wi-Fi capabilities for online gaming. Sony\u2019s PlayStation Portable (PSP) was released the following year and featured Wi-Fi capabilities as well as a flexible platform that could be used to play other media such as MP3s (Patsuris, 2004). These two consoles, along with their newer versions, continue to dominate the handheld market One interesting innovation in mobile gaming occurred in 2003 with the release of the Nokia N-Gage. The N-Gage was a combination of a game console and mobile phone that, according to consumers, did not fill either role very well. The product line was discontinued in 2005, but the idea of playing games on phones persisted and has been developed on other platforms (Stone, 2007). Apple currently dominates the industry of mobile phone games; in 2008 and 2009 alone, iPhone games generated $615 million in revenue (Farago, 2010). As mobile phone gaming grows in popularity and as the supporting technology becomes increasingly more advanced, traditional portable gaming platforms like the DS and the PSP will need to evolve to compete. Nintendo is already planning a successor to the DS that features 3-D graphics without the use of 3-D glasses that it hopes will help the company retain and grow its share of the portable gaming market.\n\nVideo Games Today The trends of the late 2000s have shown a steadily increasing market for video games. Newer control systems and family-oriented games have made it common for many families to engage in video game play as a group. Online games have continued to develop, gaining unprecedented numbers of players. The overall effect of these innovations has been the increasing acceptance of video game culture by the mainstream. Home Consoles The current state of the home console market still involves the three major companies of the past 10 years: Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. The release of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 led this generation of consoles in 2005. The Xbox 360 featured expanded media capabilities and integrated access to Xbox Live, an online gaming service. Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3 (PS3) was released in 2006. It also featured enhanced online access as well as expanded multimedia functions, with the additional capacity to play Blu-ray discs. Nintendo released the Wii at the same time. This console featured a motion-sensitive controller that departed from previous controllers and focused on accessible, often family-oriented games. This combination successfully brought in large numbers of new game players, including many older adults. By June 2010, in the United States, the Wii had sold 71.9 million units, the Xbox 360 had sold 40.3 million, and the PS3 trailed at 35.4 million (VGChartz, 2010). In the wake of the Wii\u2019s success, Microsoft and Sony have introduced their own motion-sensitive systems (Mangalindan, 2010). Key Takeaways In a time before personal computers, early video games allowed the general public to access technology that had been restricted to the realm of abstract science. Tennis for Two created an interface where anyone with basic motor skills could use a complex machine. The first video games functioned early on as a form of media by essentially disseminating the experience of computer technology to those without access to it.\n\nVideo games reached wider audiences in the 1990s with the advent of the first-person shooter genre and popular nonaction games such as Myst. The games were marketed to older audiences, and their success increased demand for similar games.\n\nOnline capabilities that developed in the 1990s and expanded in the 2000s allowed players to compete in teams. This innovation attracted larger audiences to gaming and led to new means of social communication.\n\nA new generation of accessible, family-oriented games in the late 2000s encouraged families to interact through video games. These games also brought in older demographics that had never used video games before. Exercises Video game marketing has changed to bring in more and more people to the video game audience. Think about the influence video games have had on you or people you know. If you have never played video games, then think about the ways your conceptions of video games have changed. Sketch out a timeline indicating the different occurrences that marked your experiences related to video games. Now compare this timeline to the history of video games from this section. Consider the following questions: How did your own experiences line up with the history of video games? Did you feel the effects of marketing campaigns directed at you or those around you? Were you introduced to video games during a surge in popularity? What games appealed to you?\n\nReferences\n\nA Brief History of Game Console Warfare, \u201cPlayStation 2,\u201d slide in \u201cA Brief History of Game Console Warfare.\u201d\n\nBrand, Stewart. \u201cSpace War,\u201d Rolling Stone, December 7, 1972.\n\nBusiness Week, \u201cSega Dreamcast,\u201d slide in \u201cA Brief History of Game Console Warfare,\u201d Business Week, http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/.\n\nCross, Gary and Gregory Smits, \u201cJapan, the U.S. and the Globalization of Children\u2019s Consumer Culture,\u201d Journal of Social History 38, no. 4 (2005).\n\nCyberiaPC.com, \u201cSega Saturn (History, Specs, Pictures),\u201d http://www.cyberiapc.com/vgg/sega_saturn.htm.\n\nEdge staff, \u201cThe Making Of: Playstation,\u201d Edge, April 24, 2009, http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-playstation.\n\nEgenfeldt-Nielsen, Simon.

A New York native, Lawson is one of the few African American engineers who worked in computing at the dawn of the video game era.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nBorn in New York City on December 1, 1940, Gerald Anderson Lawson is famous for being a video game pioneer, helping develop the first cartridge-based home video game console system. Lawson's father was a longshoreman and his mother worked for New York City. He had one brother, Michael.\n\nInspired as a child by the work of George Washington Carver, Lawson dabbled in electronics growing up, repairing televisions to make a little money before enrolling at Queens College, part of the City University of New York. His interest in computing led him in the 1970s to Silicon Valley's Homebrew Computer Club, of which he was the only Black member at the time. While with the club, he crossed paths with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. (In an interview, he referred to Jobs as a business-minded \"sparkplug\" and recalled being unimpressed when he interviewed Wozniak for a job.)\n\nVideo Game Pioneer\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Lawson helped create the Fairchild Channel F, a home entertainment machine that was produced in 1976 by Fairchild Semiconductor, where he worked as director of engineering and marketing. (Only years earlier, Mike Markkula, co-founder of Apple Computers Inc., had headed marketing for the company.) Though basic by today's standards, Lawson's work allowed people to play a variety of games in their homes and paved the way for systems such as the Atatri 2600, Nintendo, Xbox and Playstation.\n\nOne of the few Black engineers in his industry, Lawson later said that colleagues were often surprised to find out that he was African American: \"With some people, it's become an issue. I've had people look at me with total shock. Particularly if they hear my voice, because they think that all Black people have a voice that sounds a certain way, and they know it. And I sit there and go, 'Oh yeah? Well, sorry, I don't.'\"\n\nDeath\n\nLawson died in Mountain View, California, on April 9, 2011, due to complications relating to his diabetes. He was survived by his wife, Catherine, and two children.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Jerry Lawson\n\nBirth Year: 1940\n\nBirth date: December 1, 1940\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: New York\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Jerry Lawson brought interchangeable video games into people's homes with the invention of the Fairchild Channel F, the precursor to modern video game systems.\n\nIndustries\n\nTechnology and Engineering\n\nAstrological Sign: Sagittarius\n\nNacionalities\n\nAmerican\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nJerry Lawson joined Silicon Valley's Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s, and during his tenure with the club, was its only Black member.\n\n\n\nJerry Lawson's work paved the way for systems such as the Atatri 2600, Nintendo, Xbox and Playstation.\n\n\n\nJerry Lawson headed engineering and marketing for Fairchild Semiconductor just years after Mike Markkula, co-founder of Apple Computers Inc., left the company.\n\nDeath Year: 2011\n\nDeath State: California\n\nDeath City: Mountain View\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Jerry Lawson Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/inventors/jerry-lawson\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: August 11, 2020\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 3, 2014\n\nQUOTES\n\nWith some people, it's become an issue.

It predated some of the most popular ones we know\n\nBy Doug Norrie |\n\nThe video gaming industry has become a 100s of billions of dollars behemoth at this point, operating with a massive market share and becoming part of the fabric of our current society. It\u2019s been a long time coming though I think few saw that this would ever grow to its current size. Video games are as much a part of our culture as anything else, especially on the entertainment side of things. They account for huge sums of money in the economic system and are used for hours and hours on end by folks of all ages. But where did it all start? What was the first video game console? How did we get to this place?\n\nMuch of that can be seen and explored in our History of Gaming Consoles which looks at the path and journey of these machines over many, many decades. It\u2019s a long and winding story, starting pretty innocently (though intuitively) in a research institute and growing at an almost exponential pace over the years.\n\nHere we\u2019ll look back at the first video game console and what it meant for the industry. How was it born and what did it ultimately give life to in this market? For many, the first video game console might not be what you\u2019d expect, and it didn\u2019t even necessarily have the staying power of what would come after. It laid some of the groundwork, though others went and ran with the idea and concept for their own gain. Let\u2019s take a look at the build-up for the industry and then what would become the first viable video game console to hit the market.\n\nTHE FIRST VIDEO GAMES\n\nIn the history of video gaming consoles, it makes sense that the first steps along this journey wouldn\u2019t be a box, some controllers, and a wealth of games showing up in living rooms around the world. Of course not. Though that\u2019s what would ultimately help grow the industry as a whole, before gaming consoles could take root as viable sellers, there had to be an established baseline for video games in general.\n\nMuch of this can be traced back to two specific games developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Those were Tennis for Two and SpaceWar!. Back at a time when computers were still a long way off from being in everyone\u2019s homes and offices, there were select groups out there working with this relatively new technology. Though it had military applications to start (what tech doesn\u2019t?), there were some folks exploring how everyday users could interact with the machines in a way that could be both fun and entertaining. At this point, there didn\u2019t seem to be any big push to bring computer games to the marketplace mostly because there were so few computers. But that didn\u2019t mean some weren\u2019t thinking about the possibilities.\n\nThe first was William Higinbotham who was working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. We began the first iteration of the video game console, or at least its bones when he helped create and manufacture the game Tennis for Two. This was played on what looked like a radar readout screen and Higinbotham helped bring about the first iterations of the controller or joystick. Connected to the computer and readout, Tennis for Two allowed for two players to knock a ball back and forth using the controls. Sound like Pong? Yeah, it should. This game was essentially the predecessor for that game which came around 14 years later.\n\nThe other game which came around near the beginning of this timeline was SpaceWar! which was developed by a group of MIT students in 1962. This was another game using a similar display as Tennis for Two though it brought in that science-fiction element that would become a backbone of early gaming. In this game, two players (a ship and a wedge) were in a \u201cbattle\u201d to shoot each other while moving around the screen and avoiding the gravitational pull of the \u201cstar\u201d in the center.\n\nWAS ATARI OR NINTENDO THE FIRST GAME CONSOLE?\n\nIf you were to ask most folks, those without extensive knowledge of the history of the first video game console, it\u2019s likely that they would say one of two things: Atari or Nintendo. In many ways, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be wrong seeing as how these two were, most definitely, the video game consoles that appealed the most to the masses. We will get to both in a little bit with just a little more detail. But it\u2019s worth noting here that they weren\u2019t the first video game consoles. Far from it.\n\nWhat Atari and Nintendo did was capitalize on a growing video game movement while also learning from the mistakes of their predecessors. Sure, this could be the story of almost any successful company in any industry, but in the gaming world it\u2019s particularly apt because there was so much some of the first companies did right, but also a ton they did wrong. Frankly, it\u2019s still happening today. So no, Atari and Nintendo weren\u2019t the first. And as we know they definitely weren\u2019t the last either.\n\nARCADE GAMES ON THE RISE\n\nTennis for Two and SpaceWar! are widely considered to help shape the video game industry, but neither really had any real commercial success. The movement had started and there were now plenty of folks out there who wanted to bring video games and consoles to the masses. There were somewhat parallel timelines and tracks happening during the late 1960s and 1970s that dovetailed in a way to help bring about the first video game console.\n\nFor starters, in 1971 coin-op arcade games began to gain popularity with the release of Computer Space, the first arcade cabinet box game manufactured and delivered to different locations. It took its approach from SpaceWar! and ended up gaining some traction, though was far from an industry mover.\n\nWhile Computer Space was first, it wasn\u2019t necessarily credited with kickstarting the next wave of video games in arcades. That was Pong which came out in 1972. Taking its direction from Tennis for Two (see how we are building here?), the game was manufactured and developed by Atari. Though not the first video game console, Pong is credited with essentially bringing this medium into the zeitgeist.\n\nInterestingly enough (though obviously not a coincidence) the two games had the same creators, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney who would found Atari. It was under the latter banner that they put out Pong and it completely worked this time around. The game was a hit in local establishments and helped Atari gain footing in the video game industry, setting the stage for what would happen next for the company. But before that happened, someone else had to develop the first video game console.\n\nTHE BROWN BOX\n\nLet\u2019s meet Ralph Henry Baer who is sometimes (and probably correctly) credited as the \u201cFather of Video Games\u201d. No, he didn\u2019t create the first one, that\u2019s been established. But Baer was the one who oversaw the development of the device that would eventually help people bring video game consoles into their own homes. That\u2019s because Baer was one of the first people who saw video games as a viable market mover and he also visioned something that, at the time, few were thinking about. Rather than developing a single-player video game for computer systems (still hard to come by) or for cabinet games (you still had to go somewhere to play them) he wanted to find a way to use something so many already had in their homes.\n\nAmazingly, not everyone was able to see this as viable and many actually scoffed at the idea. Regardless, Baer pushed ahead and with a small team at what would be called BAE Systems, the group developed what was known as the Brown Box. In many ways, this device was the precursor for the modern-day development of video game consoles. It was, like the name suggests, a brown box that could connect to television sets through connections in the back.\n\nAttached two the box were two \u201ccontollers\u201d each with knobs that could control what was happening on the screen. Sure, it looks antiquated now, but at the time this was a revolutionary device, one that finally could bring video gaming into people\u2019s homes if they so chose. Frankly, for decades the video gaming industry wouldn\u2019t diverge all that much (at least aesthetically) from what Baer first created with the Brown Box.\n\nENTER MAGNAVOX WITH THE FIRST VIDEO GAME CONSOLE\n\nBaer knew he had something big on his hands, or at least he thought he did based on some initial reactions. So he went about shopping the Brown Box to various folks. He found a taker in 1972 when Magnavox agreed to buy the system and began mass-producing it for the market. In the acquisition, they changed the name from Brown Box to Magnavox Odyssey. It\u2019s hard to argue with that move and the latter certainly would have seemed like the branding shift at the time. It connected to televisions through an input on the unit and, at the time, basically acted like a channel on the television screen. Magnavox reworked the exterior casing to fall more in line with the color schemes of television sets at the time.\n\nAt the time of the release, the Magnavox Odyssey included 12 games that came with the console. These were broken up among six different cards that were inserted into the device. Those games really spoke to the simplicity of the time and looking back almost looked like a time capsule in and among themselves. The first video game console games were Table Tennis, Ski, Simon Says, Tennis, Analogic, Hockey, Football, Cat and Mouse, Haunted House, Submarine, Roulette, and States. There were other games that were sold separately.\n\nWhile the Magnavox Odyssey did distinguish between the names of the games, it\u2019s worth noting here that almost all of them were of the same baseline type of play. They involved white balls and something like paddles on the screen to move the former around. The mechanics changed slightly, but the viewer now, with video games coming so far, one would probably think they were all the same game.\n\nAnd really the only way to distinguish between and among the games was to put an overlay on the television screen, a separate piece outside of the video game console. This meant essentially tracking the game yourself. It\u2019s hard to blame Magnavox and Baer obviously, they had done something no one had done before and lit a video game fuse forever. But because of the clunkiness and the cost ($99 or $675 dollars in today\u2019s money), the Magnavox Odyssey didn\u2019t take off at all.\n\nTHE FIRST VIDEO GAME CONSOLE IS A BUST\n\nSomeone always needs to be first and they often need to take the lumps in order to push forward an entire industry. That\u2019s definitely the case with the first video game console. Though it came along at a time when there was nothing else on the market, it failed to gain a real market foothold. As mentioned, the price was extremely high at the time, making it cost-prohibitive, to say the least. And because video games, from a name recognition aspect, hadn\u2019t become everyday talking points, many didn\u2019t see the need to put one of them in their own homes.\n\nAnd because this was a new venture, there were aspects of the video game experience that wouldn\u2019t carry over into future iterations from other companies. Namely, the Magnavox Odyssey came with components and pieces like the aforementioned video overlays, but also dice, chips, cards, and play money that was supposed to be used in conjunction with the different games. This was likely done for two reasons. The first was to help ease the transition from traditional board games into what was happening on the television screen. Folks just simply weren\u2019t used to playing games strictly on a screen with a controller. And also, the games themselves needed to be livened up in some way mostly because they were pretty boring.\n\nIn all, the Magnavox Odyssey, the first video game console, only ended up selling 350,000 units, a number well below the original expectations. And because the name was associated with a particular brand of televisions at the time (Magnavox, duh) there could have been some confusion about the compatibility with other brands. This all led in some part to the Odyssey being underwhelming in terms of sales.\n\nTHE NEXT VIDEO GAME CONSOLE IS REALLY THE FIRST\n\nMagnavox Odyssey didn\u2019t have the commercial success its creators thought it might have out of the box, but it did lead the way for Atari to take the world by storm a few years later. The company had been developing cabinet games for a few years, inspired by Pong and then adding games like Space Invaders and Asteroids to the mix. These already had arcade cabinet game name brand credibility, making the shift to the home console much smoother and much more profitable. But none of it would have happened without the Magnavox Odyssey hitting the shelves first."}, {"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/053115/how-video-game-industry-changing.asp", "page_content": "Video games have been around for decades, providing entertainment for children and adults alike. They have evolved significantly from the early days of computer games and the first versions of Nintendo and Atari. The days of pixelated screens and limited sounds are a distant memory as video games have become more lifelike than ever. As technology continues to improve, so do video games.\n\nVideo game creation has become increasingly complex, and the cost of creating a game to run on one of the major consoles has risen with this greater complexity. It was once unthinkable to sink millions into development costs, but games today can cost tens and even hundreds of millions. This has pushed game development into Hollywood movie territory in terms of production and marketing costs.\n\nThe video game sector is immensely large. In fact, it is larger than the movie and music industries combined, and it is only growing. Though it doesn't get the same attention that the movie and music industry does, there are over two billion gamers across the world. That is 26% of the world's population.\n\nIt's no surprise that companies want a piece of the pie. In 2020, the gaming industry generated $155 billion in revenue, By 2025, analysts predict the industry will generate more than $260 billion in revenue. As such, tech companies are looking to get involved in this revenue stream. Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and Apple (AAPL), have all made plans to enter the video game industry.\n\nKey Takeaways Video games have been around for decades, but their popularity has increased in recent years.\n\nThe video game sector is larger than the movie and music industries combined.\n\nTech giants Google, Meta, and Apple have all made plans to enter the gaming industry.\n\nSubscription streaming services are the future and will be beneficial to video game companies.\n\nTechnical innovations, expanding market demographics, and an increase in video game-related merchandise have all contributed to the video game industry's new scope.\n\nStreaming and the Involvement of Tech Companies\n\nNontraditional gaming companies, like Meta, Apple, and Google, are getting into the industry. The tech industry is looking for ways to make video game streaming as natural as streaming a song on Spotify or a movie on Netflix.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) has already been in the gaming industry through its popular Xbox console. In 2019, the company introduced Project xCloud, a video game streaming service that allows users to stream Microsoft's Xbox games to PCs or other devices. The service became fully functional in September 2020 and can be accessed by subscribers to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.\n\nIn 2016, Meta began developing a gaming platform with Unity Technologies, which makes a game development framework for people to make video games. Google launched its program, Stadia, which is Google's cloud gaming service, that allows users to play streaming video games with extremely high quality. It is available through Google's browser, phones, tablets, and desktop computers.\n\nThe key goal for all of these companies is to allow players to stream video games without the need for a computer or a video game console. As this trend continues, purchasing physical video games in the form of cartridges or discs is becoming increasingly rare.\n\nSubscription streaming services are the future and will be beneficial to video game companies, like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts, as manufacturing, shipping, and storage costs will all disappear. Subscription services have also allowed for revenue generation to occur throughout the year, whereas traditionally, games were bought during holidays and other big occasion events.\n\nTechnical Innovations\n\nVirtual reality is here. Oculus VR, a subsidiary of Meta, is working hard on improving the quality of the virtual reality headsets it has already released. Oculus VR was purchased by Meta in 2014 for $2 billion. The Oculus Quest 2 is Meta's latest offering of the product.\n\nVideo games have already surpassed many other forms of entertainment as far as immersion goes, and virtual reality will add yet another layer. There will also be further experimentation with controls, such as adding voice, touchscreens, and gestures to game mechanics when consoles add peripherals to take in those inputs.\n\nApple is also targeting the release of a virtual reality headset in 2021 or 2022.\n\nCalifornia-based Roblox Corporation (RBLX) was the largest gaming company, with a market capitalization of $74.88 billion in November 2021.\n\nMerchandising\n\nLike Hollywood, the video game industry needs to spin more revenue off of its intellectual property because the product costs a lot to make. Merchandising is already around, with t-shirts, figures, hats, mugs, and more. The Halo series on Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has spread to other forms of content through novels and comic books in addition to an upcoming television series and a long-rumored movie. This may become the approach for all successful video game series to follow.\n\nIn fact, the popular video game, Assassin's Creed, a game developed by Ubisoft, was made into a movie in 2016 with prominent actors. Sega's popular Sonic the Hedgehog game was made into a successful movie in 2020, starring well-known actors, and set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game\u2013based movie.\n\nMarket Demographics Are Expanding\n\nAnother trend in the video game industry is the expansion of the market as far as demographics go. People are playing games both earlier and later in life, and the gender mix is nearing par. The top-level gamers competing in eSports leagues have gained enough recognition that they can apply for the professional athlete visa when entering the U.S. Gaming has a wide appeal, and it is still growing.\n\nVideo games have become so popular on a mass scale that certain players stream videos of themselves playing video games at home and make hundreds and thousands of dollars by doing so. This has become another revenue generation sector of the video game market.\n\nVintage Video Games\n\nAs the world becomes nostalgic and we see reboots and remakes of loved films and shows from decades ago, the same is happening for video games. Vintage video games from the early days of the industry are in high demand and have become extremely popular, not only with older players who experienced the games first-hand but also with a new generation of players.\n\nMany companies have taken advantage of this nostalgia and released updated versions of their consoles. Nintendo (NTDOF), more than any other company, has successfully taken advantage of this interest in retro video games by releasing Nintendo Classic Mini and Nintendo Switch, two consoles that allow for playing classic Nintendo video games. This has become a solid revenue stream for companies that were around at the early stages of the industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe video game industry has always been about innovation. New technology, new controls, and new experiences are to be expected. As the world moves more and more to time spent on mobile phones, streaming services, and mobile phone game playing will become an important arena for revenues, and large tech companies will look to leverage their current framework to get involved.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting change in the video game industry is the expanding demographics of gamers. With more people playing games, creating demand for more immersive entertainment, and looking for easier ways to access games, the future of the video game industry looks bright."}, {"url": "https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/who-invented-video-games.htm", "page_content": "\" \" Long before the days where we could play video games without an actual controller, we had simpler versions such as Tennis for Two, courtesy of one William Higinbotham. See more video game system pictures. Michal Czerwonka/ Getty Images\n\nIn 2011, the video game industry pulled in $17.01 billion for physical software, making its way into many, many households globally in the process [source: Brightman]. How did the gaming juggernaut get its start? The answer is surprisingly complicated. In the late 1940s, Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle R. Mann patented the descriptively named Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device, an electronic device incorporating screen overlays that users would hold while playing a few basic games.\n\nIn 1958, William Higinbotham created another notable precursor to modern video games while working at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. The simple diversion, called Tennis for Two, was displayed on an oscilloscope. Imagine one of those screens you might see hooked up next to a patient's bedside with a very basic video game on it, and you've got it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough these and other electronic games captured audiences and imaginations across the country, the first true video game -- one that transformed electronic signals into pictures on a screen by way of something called a raster pattern -- wouldn't come along until 1967. That's when an engineer named Ralph H. Baer created the first prototype of what would later become the Magnavox Odyssey, a groundbreaking video game console that, along with countless imitators, would spark the video game craze of the '70s [source: The Lemelson Center].\n\nToday, Baer is widely referred to as the \"Father of Video Games,\" quite a distinction for someone who began his career as a radio technician in the early '40s. After serving as a small arms expert throughout World War II, Baer enrolled in the American Television Institute of Technology, graduating with a degree in television engineering. In 1951, Baer found himself tasked with designing the \"world's best television\" for a television company named Loral. Wanting to make the television stand out against the competition, Baer proposed building an electronic game into the television set, but the concept proved too outlandish for his manager to approve.\n\nFortunately for the legions of gamers out there, the story doesn't stop there."}]}
