Her parents were Americans living in London and when she was 7, the family moved to Los Angeles. Her first small part in a movie was in There's One Born Every Minute in 1942 but her first starring role was in National Velvet in 1944. She became as famous for her 8 marriages (to 7 people) as she was for her beauty and films.\n\nIn 1947, when he was only 15 years old, in June, the Marshall Plan was proposed to help European nations recover economically from World War II. It passed the conservative Republican Congress in March of 1948. After World War I, the economic devastation of Germany caused by burdensome reparations payments led to the rise of Hitler. The Allies didn't want this to happen again and the Marshall Plan was devised to make sure that those conditions didn't arise again.\n\nIn 1962, at the age of 30 years old, William was alive when lasting from October 16th - 28th, the Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest that the United States and the Soviet Union came to nuclear war. The Soviet Union had been installing a nuclear missile base in Cuba. The United States established a blockade to stop the base from being completed. Through secret negotiations, war was averted: the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle their weapons in Cuba and the United States agreed to never invade Cuba and to dismantle weapons in Turkey and Italy.\n\nIn 1974, at the age of 42 years old, William was alive when on July 30th, the House Judiciary Committee adopted three articles of impeachment against President Nixon. He was charged with obstruction of justice, failure to uphold laws, and the refusal to produce material subpoenaed by the committee. In order to avoid impeachment, Richard M. Nixon announced that he would resign on August 8th, the first President to do so.\n\nIn 1986, in the year of William Brown's passing, on January 28th, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch. All seven crew members died. The cause of the explosion was later found to be a failed O-ring. The O-ring failure was due to the unusually cold conditions at Cape Canaveral."}, {"url": "https://www.echovita.com/us/obituaries/tx/early/bill-brown-14547979", "page_content": "Bill Brown Obituary\n\nIt is with deep sorrow that we announce the death of Bill Brown (Early, Texas), who passed away on April 19, 2022, at the age of 89, leaving to mourn family and friends.

The underwriters must be idiots.\u201d\n\nBy 1990, they were collectively rewarding Brown with annual salary and dividends of more than \u00a39 million, and a family fortune later estimated at \u00a3100 million.\n\nWilliam John Brown \u2013 Bill to the wider world, Billy to his intimates \u2013 was born in Barking on March 7 1935, the second of four sons (and one daughter) of Harry Brown and his wife Minnie, n\u00e9e Underwood.\n\nEducated at Park Modern secondary school, he did National Service in the Army before joining Walsham Bros, where Harry had started as a clerk before taking over the business from Australian previous owners and eventually passing it on to the next generation. Bill became a member of Lloyd\u2019s in his own right in 1958.\n\nWalsham Bros remained a modest affair until Bill took over the helm from his older brother Henry, with his younger brothers Jim and Ron in support; good relations with one of Lloyd\u2019s most powerful underwriters, Roy Merrett, gave him his first opening in \u201cexcess of loss\u201d. In the aftermath of the LMX crash, the firm reverted to less controversial forms of broking, though Bill remained as hungry for business as ever.\n\nMeanwhile he enjoyed the high life his income afforded. He especially loved racing, entertaining lavishly in boxes at Goodwood, Ascot, Cheltenham and elsewhere and keeping his best horses in training with Nicky Henderson \u2013 including the nine-times winner Fondmort. But he was not a betting man, rarely venturing more than a \u00a320 flutter: if a fellow racegoer asked for a tip, he invariably offered: \u201cKeep your money in your back pocket.\u201d\n\nHe also kept a box at the Hickstead horse show and another next to Alan Sugar\u2019s at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s White Hart Lane stadium. Summer holidays were spent in Monaco and St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.\n\nBut Brown never courted media attention and rarely spoke to journalists \u2013 who instead repeated much-told stories about his indulgences, another of which was luxury cars. When asked which model of Ferrari he was about to order, the reply was \u201ca red one\u201d; when one of his brothers admired a top-of-the-range Mercedes in a showroom window, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll get it for you. You paid for lunch.\u201d\n\nIn similar vein, he supposedly once told a colleague he was popping out to buy jumpers. Would that be from Gieves & Hawkes, the nearby posh outfitters? Nah, came the answer \u2013 showjumpers for his elder daughters Kelly and Emma Jane, both international competitors in that sport.\n\nLess well-publicised was his support for hospice and deaf charities, and boys\u2019 projects in the East End, with which he never lost touch.\n\nBut above all Brown loved the buzz of the insurance market and the bonhomie of favourite watering holes like the City Flogger in Mark Lane \u2013 places that were never quite the same after his career was ended by the onset of dementia.\n\nHe married first, in 1957, Angela Day. The marriage was dissolved and he married secondly, in Barbados in 1989, Tracy Stone. She survives him with their two daughters and a son, and two daughters from his first marriage.\n\nBill Brown, born March 7 1935, died April 25 2020"}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/bill-brown-person_qgelqu", "page_content": "Bill Brown\n\nAmerican composer known for creating music for several video games and films (born 1969) \u2013 Bill Brown was born in San Diego (city in San Diego County, California, United States; second-largest city in California) on January 1st, 1969 and is 54 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Bill Brown? 54 Bill Brown is 54 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nBill Brown\n\nBirthday When was Bill Brown born?

He was also capped 28 times for Scotland.\n\nBorn in Arbroath, he had played forward as a schoolboy, but when he joined the Carnoustie Juveniles club he went into goal and stayed there throughout his career.\n\nIn 1948, he was signed as a \u00a37 a week part-time professional by Dundee, to the displeasure of his dairyman father, who insisted he learn a trade. Brown complied by training as an electrical engineer. His sporting life could have ended prematurely when he broke his nose and jaw and fractured a cheekbone in a trial for the Scotland youth team, but he recovered.\n\nSix-foot-tall Brown established himself as an outstanding goalkeeper with Dundee, giving the lie to the English belief that Scottish keepers were a joke. He was agile, commanding and courageous, never flamboyant. He did his national service in the RAF, and represented it in goal. On demobilisation he became a full time professional at Dundee, much admired by his manager, former Rangers and Scotland centre-forward Willie Thornton. But competition among Scottish goalkeepers was such that Brown was international goalkeeping reserve 25 times.\n\nWith Dundee, he played 215 Scottish League games from 1950 to 1959, winning a League Cup medal in the 1951-52 season. His debut for Scotland could hardly have been more difficult or more impressive. In June 1958, during the World Cup finals in Sweden, he was picked to replace Tommy Younger against France. Scotland lost 2-1, but Brown impressed France's attacking pair, Juste Fontaine and Raymond Kopa. He continued to win caps for Scotland until November 1965.\n\nDundee, needing money for new floodlights, sold him to Tottenham in 1959 for \u00a316,500. He played 222 League games for Spurs, missing just one in their double-winning season. In 1962, he added another FA cup medal when Spurs beat Burnley in the Wembley final.\n\nFinding abundant time on his hands in London, Brown joined the sales staff of a printing company and later opened a printing firm in Soho with a partner. Things at Tottenham began to go wrong, when, early in 1964, at the age of 32, when a keeper might be expected to be in his prime, he was dropped from the team by the manager, Bill Nicholson (obituary, October 25 2004). He never fully regained his place, facing opposition from the young Northern Irishman Pat Jennings.\n\n\"It came as a tremendous shock to us when he was dropped by Spurs,\" said Ian McColl, then team manager of Scotland. \"I regard Brown as the best keeper in Britain.\" Brown angrily announced that he had no intention of playing in Tottenham's reserves. That his form had suffered was proved when he did leave Spurs in 1966 for humble Northampton Town. And there, too, he lost his place, in March 1967.\n\nThe following summer, he flew to Canada to play for the shortlived Toronto Falcons in the \"unofficial\" soccer League which sprang up that year, unsanctioned by FIFA. Because of that he and another British player were banned when he was on the point of joining non-League Hastings United. For Brown this proved a blessing, for he stayed on in Canada, taking a post with the land development section of the Ontario government, from which he retired in 1995.\n\nIn 1988, he had a heart attack which persuaded him to cut out the 40 cigarettes he smoked each day. In 1994 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he survived that, too.\n\nHe leaves his wife Elaine, two daughters and a son.\n\n\u00b7 William (Bill) Dallas Fyfe Brown, footballer, born October 8 1931; died November 30 2004"}, {"url": "https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news-archive-1/bill-brown-remembered/", "page_content": "As Tottenham fans of an older generation will appreciate, Bill Brown was a giant of a goalkeeper for both Spurs and Scotland.\n\nHe was born in Arbroath and joined us from Dundee in June, 1959, becoming a key figure in our ground-breaking \u2018Double\u2019 triumph of 1960-61.\n\nAn incredibly consistent goalkeeper, Brown liked to keep things simple but his distribution was key to Bill Nicholson\u2019s great side while his agility, shot-stopping and positioning were exceptional.\n\nBill, who also won a second FA Cup with us ahead of our historic European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup victory in 1963, was capped 28 times by his country - yet he does not hold a place in Scottish Football\u2019s Hall of Fame.\n\nSpurs fan Keith Harrison is determined to put that right and has already lobbied for Brown\u2019s inclusion.\n\nFellow supporters who agree that Bill should be in there can support his nomination by emailing halloffame@hampdenpark.co.uk or can learn more via www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk - click on the Hall of Fame tab at the top of the page.\n\nBelow - Bill with his skipper and fellow double-winning legend Danny Blanchflower..."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bill_Brown_(footballer,_born_1931)", "page_content": "William Dallas Fyfe Brown (8 October 1931 \u2013 30 November 2004) was a Scottish football goalkeeper.\n\nScottish footballer\n\nQuick facts: Personal information, Full name, Date of birt... \u25bc\n\nBrown played for Dundee between 1949 and 1959, and for Tottenham Hotspur between 1959 and 1966.

(1st December, 2004) Bill had spent many years living in Canada, after he ended his playing days in Toronto. The Spurs and Scotland legend had been unable to travel to England for the Double Reunion dinner in 2001, and also was not well enough to make it to White Hart Lane for the induction of Bill Nicholson and all the Double side into the Spurs Hall of Fame in March this year.\n\nPlayers from both Spurs and Liverpool wore black armbands in last night's Carling Cup quarter-final, but it is unfortunate that the club seems to have set a precedent by not holding a one-minute silence for one of the true Spurs' greats. Bill left the club in 1966, having been superceded by a young Pat Jennings, who was a fitting successor to a great goalie.\n\nHere is an extract from Brian Judson's excellent introduction to the Double series on Spurs Odyssey:-\n\nBill Brown was a very unflashy goalkeeper who just got on with the business of playing football instead of playing to the gallery like some goalkeepers do. Born in 1931, Brown played his first football for junior teams in Scotland before joining Dundee. In 1959, Nicholson signed Brown from Dundee for what seems a paltry sum of money these days but was then an enormous amount. Brown brought confidence to the defence for the first time since the heyday of Ted Ditchburn. Brown was rarely absent from the team until he left for Northampton Town in 1966 but in his last two seasons with Tottenham, he was encouraging the very young Pat Jennings, who had been signed from Watford. Brown only missed two games during 1960-61. After ending his career at Northampton, Brown emigrated to Canada, where he worked in property development for many years.\n\nThus, a third former player enters the \"Great Double Team in the Sky\" along with John White and Danny Blanchflower, where they have been joined recently by the much-loved and much-missed Bill Nicholson, who no doubt will be keeping a fond eye on them all.\n\nFollow @spursodyssey\n\nTop of page | Index to 2004-5 Matches & Reports"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51128915", "page_content": "Bobby Brown managed Scotland for four years\n\nFormer Scotland goalkeeper and manager Bobby Brown has died at the age of 96.\n\nA Rangers Hall of Fame inductee, he made 296 appearances in 10 years at Ibrox, winning eight trophies, including an unprecedented domestic treble.\n\nBrown won five caps before retiring and becoming St Johnstone manager in 1958.\n\nHe was named Scotland's first full-time manager nine years later and famously led the national side to a 3-2 win at Wembley over then-world champions England in his first competitive game.\n\nBrown began his senior career at Queen's Park in 1939 before his stint at the club was disrupted by World War Two, the goalkeeper serving in the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy.\n\nHe joined Rangers in 1946 and, across his near-300 outings, kept 109 clean sheets.

He would have been 92 then and it was astonishing - he looked middle-aged, bronzed, fit-looking, like a man who had been at the gym every day at that astonishing age.\n\nI reflected on when I first saw him. My grandfather used to take me on the bus, all the way across Glasgow from the east end to Hampden to watch Queen's Park and Third Lanark the other week and I saw Bobby Brown then.\n\nIn those days, the Queen's Park goalkeeper wore a black jersey with a white band round the middle and I remember the supporters called him \"Boy Brown\" because he was so young and had come straight from school to play for Queen's Park.\n\nHe had this contrast between the blonde mop and the black jersey and it made him a kind of iconic figure swooping around his goal. I know the term swallow might seem like a cliche, but he exemplified it - immensely athletic, lithe, he was born to be a goalkeeper.\n\nI got to know him better when he became Scotland manager. He was always approachable, always cheery, always intelligent.\n\nThat glorious, rosy day that Jim Baxter dominated - he put on a cabaret show - against England has made many people forget he was manager.\n\nUnfortunately, I was also there when he finished, again at Wembley, because he was plagued, as many Scotland mangers have been, with call-offs, injuries and so on, so it never worked out the way that he and most of us thought it would."}, {"url": "https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/0259-0f8e745098bd-c29e2d32c725-1000--scotland-mourns-former-goalkeeper-and-manager-brown/", "page_content": "Former Scotland goalkeeper and manager Bobby Brown has died at the age of 96.\n\nBrown started his career at Queen's Park before joining Rangers in 1946, where he won three Scottish titles, three Scottish FA Cups and two Scottish League Cups, including a domestic treble in 1948.

As the country\u2019s oldest internationalist, earning his first honours during the war, and as Rangers\u2019 oldest player, he was a link to another era when agents, brightly-coloured football boots and executive boxes were figments of the imagination.\n\nAlthough he will always be associated with the famous 1967 Wembley win over world champions England in his first full international as manager, he had previously enjoyed a highly successful career as goalkeeper for Queen\u2019s Park, Rangers and Scotland, while his achievements in his first managerial post with St. Johnstone led to his Scotland appointment. Had war not intervened he would surely have won more than five full caps (he is pictured here in action against England, in 1952).\n\nWhile with Rangers he won three League titles, three Scottish Cups and two League Cups in the course of some 300 games. He was the last surviving member of their legendary Iron Curtain defence, and the last amateur to represent Scotland when first capped against Belgium in 1946, from Queen\u2019s Park. Later, he was delighted to be inducted into Rangers and Scottish Football\u2019s Halls of Fame.\n\nIn the competitive and sometimes hard world of professional football he was always the complete gentleman of impeccable integrity whose approachability, friendliness and sense of fellowship endeared him to all. Once retired from football, his commercial astuteness and determination to carve out another career led to business success .\n\nRobert Brown was born in Dunipace, Stirlingshire, to James and Georgina, and was the older brother of his sister, Agnes. His father was an engineer at Bonnybridge Power Station and Bobby first attended Dunipace Primary School where a classmate was future fellow internationalist Billy Steel. When he was six the family moved to the small, nearby village of Torwood, where he attended school and began playing football, his interest sparked by his father taking him to Falkirk games at Brockville.\n\nLater, at Larbert Central School, he tasted organised football for the first time, and his first success, winning the local Schools\u2019 Cup. But it was at Falkirk High School that he really gathered momentum, when he came under the inspiring influence of P.E. teacher Hugh Brown, father of Craig, later Scotland manager. Schoolboy representative honours followed as his form began attracting interest and in April 1940, after a Saturday morning school game, Queen\u2019s Park officials invited him to play against Celtic at Parkhead that afternoon, which he did, weeks after his 17th birthday.\n\nA creditable 4-4 draw launched his senior career with the Hampden side and in a busy final year he was also school captain, sports champion and obtained several \u2018highers\u2019. Next he began a P.E. course at Jordanhill College while excelling for the \u2018Spiders\u2019, one report proclaiming,\u201cYoung Brown is coming on like an oil tanker on fire!\u201d\n\nIn November 1942 he joined the Fleet Air Arm at Dartmouth where, after completing pilot training and playing in several forces\u2019 representative matches, for which he earned resounding plaudits, he was transferred to Portsmouth as a P.T.I. and then Plymouth. While there he met his future wife, Ruth Knight, a Wren in the Signals regiment, who brought him his telegram when he was selected for his first Scotland XI in a War Charities game in 1944. He represented Scotland in another five wartime matches, three Victory Internationals and eight League internationals.\n\nOn May 4, 1946, he made his Rangers debut against Airdrie. Under Bill Struth he was part of the first team to win the fabled \u2018Treble\u2019 in 1948/9, the only ever-present throughout and was last man in the near impenetrable Iron Curtain defence behind Young, Shaw, McColl, Woodburn and Cox. Following an upset defeat at Tynecastle in 1952, he was dropped after almost five years\u2019 consecutive games, thereafter featuring occasionally till his final appearance in January 1956. Always part-time as a P.E. teacher, latterly at Alloa Academy, he loved being at Ibrox, where players whom he considered \u2018a band of brothers\u2019 received the best of everything. After two final seasons with Falkirk he later managed St Johnstone, where he twice won the old Second Division before stabilising them in the top tier.\n\nAs Scotland manager, Wembley 1967 was the undoubted highlight, the first defeat England suffered in 20 games and first as world champions. His team selection was spot-on and he deserved special credit for fielding two outstanding debutants, Ronnie Simpson and Jim McCalliog, in a team that knitted well together under his accommodating man-management style.\n\nHe was unfortunate not to lead Scotland to the 1970 World Cup, undone by dreadful refereeing in a crucial tie against West Germany, while player call-offs, unavailability and injuries plagued his final years at the helm, before finishing in 1971. He always regretted only being able to field the 1967 team once.\n\nIn July 1946 he married Ruth in her home town of Plymstock, Devon. They enjoyed 37 happy years together including regular summer holidays in her home county, a favourite location. They had three daughters, Carolyn, Alison and Gillian, and from 1967 onwards lived in Helensburgh. Sadly Ruth died from cancer in 1983.\n\nAfter football Brown became involved in property development, operating a seafront coffee shop and a restaurant before becoming a self-employed agent dealing in quality giftware. His was a full life well-lived, embracing various activities. An outdoors enthusiast, he went on many excursions with his church rambling club, climbed Munros, was a Rotarian involved in charity fundraising, and enjoyed foreign travel with his friend, Katharine Ferguson. As a member of St. Michael\u2019s Episcopal Church, his faith was important to him, while football and Rangers remained a lifelong interest.\n\nAn unfailingly cheerful, smartly-dressed individual who was excellent company and a gentleman to his fingertips, Bobby Brown will be well remembered. He is survived by his sister, daughters and many grand- and great-grandchildren.\n\nJACK DAVIDSON"}, {"url": "https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/rangers/latest-rangers-news/bobby-brown-former-rangers-goalkeeper-and-scotland-manager-dies-1397127", "page_content": "Former Rangers goalkeeper and Scotland manager Bobby Brown has died aged 96, the Ibrox club have announced.\n\nScotland's first manager, Bobby Brown, pictured in London in 1968.
