His book The Flying Circus of Physics was first published 41 years ago and was translated into at least 10 languages. The second edition was published in 2006 and is still being translated into other languages. For 16 years he toured his Flying Circus talk throughout the U.S. and Canada, introducing such physics stunts as the bed-of-nails demonstration and the walking-on-hot-coals demonstration to countless physics teachers, who then proceeded to hurt themselves when they repeated the stunts in their own classrooms. These talks led to his PBS television series Kinetic Karnival that was rerun nationally for years and which landed him a local Emmy, now proudly displayed in his first-floor bathroom. Since then he was on the Canadian radio Quirks and Quarks weekly for 11 years and, later, on the Discovery Channel Canada show Daily Planet numerous times. During his 13 years with Scientific American magazine, he wrote 152 articles for The Amateur Scientist section, which were translated into at least 9 languages world wide and had over 2 million readers each month. His topics ranged from the physics of judo to the physics of b\u00e9arnaise sauce and lemon meringue pies. In 1990, he took over the textbook Fundamentals of Physics from David Halliday and Robert Resnick, the textbook he used in his first year at MIT. Since then he has published eight editions of the book, with 18 translations and selling over one million copies in North America and perhaps three or four million copies world wide (it is the number one book world wide in its market). He has lost count of the number of times he has been on television and radio and interviewed for newspapers and magazines. However, he clearly remembers the 20 minutes he spent performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where he stuck his fingers into molten lead without losing any of them, to the great relief of h is mother who was at home watching the show. About Author :-\n\nThe author David Halliday (1916\u20132010) was an American physicist known for his physics textbooks, Physics and Fundamentals of Physics, which he wrote with Robert Resnick. Both textbooks have been in continuous use since 1960 and are available in more than 47 languages.\n\nHalliday attended the University of Pittsburgh both as an undergraduate student and a graduate student, receiving his Ph.D. in physics in 1941. During World War II, he worked at the MIT Radiation Lab developing radar techniques. In 1946 he returned to Pittsburgh as an assistant professor and spent the rest of his career there. In 1950, he wrote Introductory Nuclear Physics, which became a classic text and was translated into four languages. In 1951 Halliday became the Department Chair, a position he held until 1962.\n\nHis Physics has been used widely and is considered by many to have revolutionized physics education. Now in its tenth edition in a two-volume set revised by Jearl Walker, and under the title Fundamentals of Physics, it is still highly regarded. It is noted for its clear standardized diagrams, very thorough but highly readable pedagogy, outlook into modern physics, and challenging, thought provoking problems. In 2002 the American Physical Society named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.\n\nThe author Robert Resnick (1923\u20132014) was a physics educator and author of physics textbooks.\n\nHe was born in Baltimore, Maryland on January 11, 1923 and graduated from the Baltimore City College high school in 1939. He received his B.A. in 1943 and his Ph.D. in 1949, both in physics from Johns Hopkins University. From 1949 to 1956, he was a member of the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, where he first met David Halliday, with whom he wrote his most widely read textbook. He later became a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and was head of the interdisciplinary science curriculum for fifteen years. During his years at RPI, he authored or co-authored seven textbooks on relativity, quantum physics, and general physics, which have been translated into more than 47 languages. It is estimated that over 10 million students have studied from his books. In 1960, Physics, the first-year textbook he wrote with Prof. Halliday, was published. The book has been used widely and is considered to have revolutionized physics education. Now in its tenth edition in a five-volume set revised by Jearl Walker, and under the title Fundamentals of Physics, it is still highly regarded. It is noted for its clear standardized diagrams, very thorough but highly readable pedagogy, outlook into modern physics, and challenging, thought provoking problems. In 2002 the American Physical Society named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.\n\nHe received the Oersted Medal (1974), the highest award given by the American Association of Physics Teachers, and was president of that society from 1986 to 1990. As well as being a Fulbright Scholar, he was also an honorary research fellow and visiting professor at Harvard University (1964\u201365). Other awards include that of being an Honorary Visiting Professor to the People's Republic of China (in 1981 and 1985), the Exxon Foundation Award for Outstanding Teaching (1954), the RPI Distinguished Faculty Award (1971), Outstanding Educator of the Year (1972), a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi honorary societies.\n\nAll Famous Books of this Author :-\n\nHere is list all books, text books, editions, versions or solution manuals avaliable of this author, We recomended you to download all.\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Physics 1 (5E) by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth Krane\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Physics 1 (Soluton Manual) by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth Krane\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Physics 2 (4E) by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth Krane '\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics (8E) Solution by Jearl Walker, Robert Resnick, David Halliday\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics Extended (8E) by Jearl Walker, Robert Resnick, David Halliday\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics (9E) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics (9E Solution Manual) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics Extended (10E) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Fundamentals of Physics Extended (10E Solution Manual) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF Principles of Physics (10E) by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker '\n\n\u2022 Download PDF The Flying Circus of Physics (2E) by Jearl Walker\n\n\u2022 Download PDF The Flying Circus of Physics (2E): with Answers by Jearl Walker\n\nJoin our new updates, alerts:-\n\nFor new updates and alerts join our WhatsApp Group and Telegram Group (you can also ask any [pdf] book/notes/solutions manual).\n\n\n\nBook Contents :-\n\nPrinciples of Physics Extended (10E) written by David Halliday, Robert Resnick, Jearl Walker cover the following topics.

My usual test for a physics textbook is to see how it handles the definition of \"heat\", which most university professors struggle with. This book's treatment was so-so, beating about the bush, but at least not misleading.\n\n\n\nMy daughter has first been tackling the chapters and problems on electric fields. I feel that some of these problems are constructed merely to keep students busy, rather than provide physical insight or practice of useful skills. Just now she showed me one problem that demanded calculation of a \"uniform\" field inside a \"non-conducting\" material. The solution provided in fact was somewhat different: the calculation of a field with uniform radial component in a vacuum (Gauss' Law for dielectrics had not been covered at this point of the book).\n\n\n\nNo doubt the book has many more such minor conceptual errors in its problem sets. I do not plan to hunt them down and list them. Other books are no different.\n\n\n\nThe book does not make much use of the model of electric flux lines in its treatment of the fields. My daughter has not really grasped the physical idea of the field, as the source of forces that act upon a test charge. I have had to fill in this and a few other gaps.\n\n\n\nIn terms of its quality of production, the book seems adequate.\n\n\n\nI can't claim to have examined the whole book, but from what I have seen the book is at the level you might expect for school kids studying for the AP, or maybe non-physicists taking physics as a service course."}], "Jearl Walker is a physicist and author.": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/118099.Jearl_Walker", "page_content": "Jearl Walker\n\nBorn\n\nJearl Walker (born 1945 in Florida) is a physicist noted for his book Flying Circus of Physics, first published in 1975; the second edition was published in June 2006.

Since then he has published nine editions of the book, with 18 translations and selling over one million copies in North America and perhaps three or four million copies world wide (it is the number one book world wide in its market). He has lost count of the number of times he has been on television and radio and interviewed for newspapers and magazines. However, he clearly remembers the 20 minutes he spent performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where he stuck his fingers into molten lead without losing any of them, to the great relief of his mother who was at home watching the show."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2184658.The_Flying_Circus_of_Physics", "page_content": "Jearl Walker (born 1945 in Florida) is a physicist noted for his book Flying Circus of Physics, first published in 1975; the second edition was published in June 2006. He teaches physics at Cleveland State University.\n\n\n\nWalker has also revised and edited the textbook Fundamentals of Physics with David Halliday and Robert Resnick.\n\n\n\nWalker is a well known popularizer of physics, and appeared several times on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Walker is known for his physics demonstrations, which have included sticking his hand in molten lead, walking barefoot over hot coals, lying on a bed of nails, and pouring freezing-cold liquid nitrogen in his mouth to demonstrate various principles of physics. Such demonstrations are included in his PBS series, Kinetic Karnival, produced by WVIZ in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n\n\nWalker authored The Amateur Scientist column in Scientific American magazine from 1978 to 1988. During the latter part of this period, he had been the Chairman of the Physics Department at Cleveland State University. He appeared regularly around this time on the long-running CBC radio science program Quirks and Quarks.\n\n\n\nHe is the first recipient of the Outstanding Teaching Award from Cleveland State's College of Science. The College's Faculty Affairs Committee selected Walker as the first honoree based on his contributions to science education over the last 30 years. In future years, the award will be named \"The Jearl Walker Outstanding Teaching Award\". The award was presented in a ceremony on April 29, 2005.\n\n\n\nWalker graduated with a degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1973."}, {"url": "https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Fundamentals+of+Physics%2C+Extended%2C+11th+Edition-p-9781119306856", "page_content": "is associated with the University of Pittsburgh as Professor Emeritus. As department chair in 1960, he and Robert Resnick collaborated onand then onis currently in its eighth edition and has since been handed over from Halliday and Resnick to Jearl Walker. Dr. Halliday is retired and resides in Seattle.\n\nRobert Resnick is professor emeritus at Rensselaer and the former Edward P. Hamilton Distinguished Professor of Science Education, 1974-93. Together with his co-author David Halliday, he revolutionized physics education with their now famous textbook on general physics, still one of the most highly regarded texts in the field today.\n\nJearl Walker, professor of physics at Cleveland State University, received his BS in physics from MIT in 1967 and his PhD in physics from University of Maryland in 1973. His book The Flying Circus of Physics was published 30 years ago, has been translated into at least 10 languages, and is still being sold world wide. For 16 years he toured his Flying Circus talk throughout the U.S. and Canada, introducing such physics stunts as the bed-of-nails demonstration and the walking-on-hot-coals demonstration to countless physics teachers, who then proceeded to hurt themselves when they repeated the stunts in their own classrooms. These talks led to his PBS television show Kinetic Karnival which ran nationally for years and which earned an Emmy."}]}
