But with her new album, Meet Me At The River, Landes has suddenly been christened a new darling of country (depending on your current definition of that genre) by certain media outlets, because of her associations as much as her music. Armed with a batch of songs she wanted to give the old-school treatment to, she cajoled Nashville production icon Fred Foster (Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson) out of semi-retirement to help bring her vision of a true country record to reality.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nA Louisville, Kentucky native who has spent much of her career in New York, Landes is articulate and fun to talk to with an easy laugh. She says she isn\u2019t exactly sure of what her sound or style should be called in these genre-bending times. \u201cIt\u2019s such a strange question, \u2018What is country music,\u2019 y\u2019know? I asked Fred that, I asked, \u2018What is country music?\u2019 I like the original country, I like Hank Williams, I like Woody Guthrie, but was Woody country? I like songs. Fred\u2019s answer to that question was, \u2018What country?\u2019 I mean, Fred produced Kris Kristofferson, was he country?\u201d Then she laughs.\n\nFor the 12-track Meet Me At The River, Foster lined up some of Nashville\u2019s top old-school session players to help give the album the country vibe that Landes was after. She says that being polite but persistent on the phone with Foster was the key to getting an audience with him to discuss the project. It wasn\u2019t a slam dunk, though.\n\n\u201cI had a bunch of songs written,\u201d she says, \u201cand I went to his house and played them and he said, \u2018Okay, what else have you got?\u2019 He liked some of them \u2026 he made me go back and look at editing them, he was a really good editor for me.\u201d The recording process was done over a period of six months or so, with Landes writing even more songs and editing them to the point where they met with her approval and Foster\u2019s.\n\nCountry legend Bobby Bare sings with Landes on the album\u2019s duet \u201cI Don\u2019t Dance,\u201d which required yet another nerve-wracking meeting with a legend. \u201cI had to go over to his house and convince him to sing on the song,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was terrified, but I played him the song \u2014 he let me play it on [late songwriter] Shel Silverstein\u2019s guitar! He was there for the tracking of it, which was so fun, and then he came in and did some overdubs. He just added to the cachet of it, he\u2019s so soulful. When we were in the booth, and it was a small booth, he was chewing tobacco and he brought a cup. It was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nLandes says Foster was more than just an editor on that song with Bare, and that he actually got a co-writing credit. \u201cI had originally written that one for a musical I\u2019ve been working on,\u201d she says. \u201cI re-purposed the song to be more about me than about the character in the musical, and Fred helped me write that.\u201d\n\nComparing this new effort to nearly a dozen other albums and EPs she has recorded, Landes says, \u201cI think I was ready to try something different. I know if I had produced this album myself the songs wouldn\u2019t have sounded the same. Working with Fred just added a whole other ingredient, like one of those ingredients that brings a dish all together but you don\u2019t really taste it.\u201d\n\nRelatively few musicians are able to make music their only vocation, but in addition to her success with recordings and live performances, Landes is also an accomplished engineer who has worked with Philip Glass and Ryan Adams, and is a good enough bass player to have landed a spot in Sufjan Stevens\u2019 touring band a couple years ago. And the placement of her songs in numerous television shows (Californication, The Good Wife) and movies (Winter Passing, Savage Grace) has likely provided some extra mailbox money. Landes has also filled the opening slot for an eclectic group of prestigious artists, from Ray LaMontagne to Bryan Ferry. She says that she just pretty much does what she does no matter who she\u2019s opening for, including an icon like Ferry, on a tour she says was pretty much like any other.\n\n\u201cI just sang my songs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just me and another woman playing with me, and that was a pretty stark contrast to Bryan Ferry\u2019s giant band. But I think it worked, the audience seemed to like me. On that tour I had just put out a covers EP, so we played [Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer\u2019s] \u2018Moon River,\u2019 and people would come up to me afterwards with a story about how much \u2018Moon River\u2019 meant to them.

The twang in her voice comes naturally.\n\nLandes calls it a \u201clilt,\u201d but she says, \u201cpeople have always thought I had a twang in my voice, and my parents were always like, where did that come from?\u201d\n\nA native of Indiana, she grew up mostly in Kentucky; Loretta Lynn once actually came to sing at the coal mine where her father worked. After graduating from New York University, Landes stuck around in the city to become part of its folk music scene and to build a career as a producer and sound engineer.\n\n2. She\u2019s attracted to the vintage Nashville \u201ccountrypolitan\u201d sound.\n\nLandes\u2019 musical output \u2013 five albums over the past 13 years \u2013 is an eclectic assortment of indy rock, folk, and pop sounds (including an entire album sung in French). But she\u2019s always been attracted to the lush sounds and legendary artists who came out of country in the 1960s. About four years ago, with more than a little bit of Dolly\u2019s register in her voice, she came in second at an annual competition in Sevierville, Tennessee, that honors Parton\u2019s songwriting.\n\n\u201cI did it on a whim,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friend dared me to enter it.\u201d\n\nTennessee continued to beckon, and after traveling to Nashville for songwriting sessions, Landes decided a couple of years ago that she had to record her own countrypolitan album.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going for, but I didn\u2019t know how to get it myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it would be great to work with someone who was sort of entrenched in the long-ago scene. I went straight to the source.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n3. She talked a country legend out of semi-retirement to produce the album.\n\nDetermined to produce an authentic sound, Landes set her sights on Fred Foster, the Hall of Fame member who was pivotal in the careers of Parton, Roy Orbison and Kris Kristofferson. Now 86, Foster hadn\u2019t produced an album since 2007 \u2013 and that one featured country deities Merle Haggard and Ray Price.\n\nBoldly, Landes cold-called Foster to plead her case. So what made him say yes?\n\n\u201cPart of it was persistence on my end,\u201d she says, but she finally won him over with her songwriting skills.\n\nTogether, they spent hours polishing the songs before she ever entered the studio; Foster then assembled a who\u2019s who list of studio musicians, including Hall of Famer Charlie McCoy. Even Hall of Fame artist Bobby Bare dropped by to serve as a sly foil on a duet.\n\n4. Landes now has a bona fide Loretta Lynn connection.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville last year, Landes answered a Craigslist ad and ended up buying a blue pickup from Lynn\u2019s music director, Bart Hansen. They have since become friends, and Hansen can be seen playing guitar, over Landes\u2019 right shoulder, in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. For that matter, the pickup is in the video, too, as well as a lyrical mention of \u201cLoretta on the radio.\u201d\n\nAt Hansen\u2019s behest, Landes recently home-recorded a video greeting to Lynn, whom Hansen visits weekly while she recuperates from a stroke and a broken hip.\n\n\u201cShe sent me one back,\u201d Landes marvels. \u201cCan you believe that? I have a video of Loretta saying hello to me and \u2018I hope you have a good day.\u2019 I love it so much.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n5. She met her husband at music camp.\n\nOr, more formally, the prestigious Johnny Mercer Writers Colony, where both received grants in 2015 to work on full-length musicals.\n\nHusband Creighton Irons is an accomplished musical composer \u2014 and an incredibly supportive spouse who can be seen on the keyboard in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. He also plans to join Landes on stage for at least a portion of the U.S. and European tour she\u2019ll be on through October to support the album.\n\nWhether their 1-year-old daughter, Callan, will be with them or with her grandparents has yet to be determined, but she\u2019s already well acquainted with Mom\u2019s new album. Not only has she attended recent shows, but Landes was pregnant during all of the recording sessions.\n\n\u201cShe was there the entire time, really,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope she likes it when she\u2019s older. I hope she\u2019s not like, \u2018All those songs!

It\u2019s less common, though, that those childhood dreams manifest. And rarer still are kids like Dawn Landes, who grew up to have a career highlighted by five album and EP releases, multiple U.S. and international tours, a musical soundtrack and so much more.\n\n\u201cEver since I was young, I think from the time I could talk, I was singing,\u201d Dawn says of her Louisville, Kentucky, upbringing. \u201cI was always asking my parents to turn up the radio in the car and leafing through their record collections and memorizing all the liner notes. I was always just really interested in [music].\u201d\n\nShe recalls hearing her high school choir teacher talk about a friend who made music for film and TV as the first time she realized she could turn her passion into a profession. After graduation in 1999, Dawn moved straight to New York City to learn the skills that would enable her to bring her ideas to life.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in high school and making demos, I had to rely largely on men who had the equipment or access to a studio,\u201d she says. \u201cI just found that process a little stifling. It was frustrating to me that I didn\u2019t have the language or know-how to make changes in my own music. So, I just decided to study it and to learn how to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a traveling musician, when I go to a city, I like to find good coffee, a good vintage clothing store and a good bookstore,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cThose are the things that I always seek out.\u201d In Chatham, those favorites are Aromatic Roasters, Screaming for Vintage and McIntyre\u2019s Bookstore.\n\nAfter nearly two decades as a New York-based musician, Dawn and her composer husband, Creighton Irons, decided they wanted to raise a family closer to his native Chapel Hill. The couple moved into their home off of Manns Chapel Road on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2020, where they live with their daughter, Callan, 5, and son, Wright, 1.\n\nDawn is now focused on producing a revue, \u201cDawn Landes and Friends Reimagine The Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook,\u201d which will debut on April 14 in Raleigh. She was inspired by the 20th-century songbook and current state of women\u2019s rights to put together a show that is both educational and uplifts other local female artists. The show will feature guest singers Rissi Palmer, Alice Gerrard, Emily Frantz of Watchhouse (formerly Mandolin Orange) and more. She also plans to personally record and release songs from \u201cThe Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook\u201d as an album sometime next year.\n\n\u201cAs I get older, and especially [after] becoming a mother, I\u2019ve embraced my connection with my female friends and peers and colleagues much more,\u201d she says. \u201cI did so many tours where I was the only woman on the tour, and that was just the way it was. I didn\u2019t get a chance to be around a lot of women in the past, and now I do, and I feel grateful for it.\u201d\n\nDawn isn\u2019t slowing her roll anytime soon. She says she\u2019s motivated by restlessness, knowing there\u2019s always a new story to be told. This summer, she\u2019ll rerelease one of her most popular albums, \u201cBluebird,\u201d and embark on a brief tour to celebrate its 10th anniversary. You can also catch her performing at Durham\u2019s Enofest in July.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a time when I\u2019m not thinking about something or dreaming up something,\u201d she says. \u201cPresenting songs is just another way of connecting with other people.
