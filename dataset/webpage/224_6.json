Since debuting in 1988 with Liberal Animation, they have steered clear of major labels and commercial exposure over their decades-long career, recording an impressive number of full-length albums, including the gold-selling Punk in Drublic (1994) and So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes (1996), plus an assortment of EPs and singles. In 2021, the group issued their 14th studio long-player, Single Album, their ninth consecutive Billboard 200-charting studio release. Double Album arrived in 2022.\n\nThe band started out as a trio comprising vocalist/bassist Fat Mike (Mike Burkett), guitarist Eric Melvin, and drummer Erik Sandin (aka Erik Ghint/Erik Shun). Sandin quit in 1985, and his place was taken by Scott Sellers; that same year, NOFX also recorded two 7\" EPs for the Mystic label, No F-X and So What If We're on Mystic? Sellers quit shortly thereafter and was replaced by Scott Aldahl for only two weeks, at which point Sandin rejoined the band; vocalist Dave Allen also joined in 1986, but his tenure was tragically cut short by a fatal car accident. Dave Casillas joined as a second guitarist later in the year, by which point NOFX's touring schedule had become far-ranging and rigorous. The EP The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This was released on Fat Mike's own Fat Wreck Chords label in 1987. Casillas departed the group in 1989 and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller for NOFX's first full-length album, S&M Airlines, which was released on the legendary punk label Epitaph; the band has remained there ever since, despite the release of several albums -- including 1995's I Heard They Suck Live -- and EPs on Fat Wreck Chords, which gradually grew into a premier stable of punk revival artists.\n\nHaving appeared on 1990's Ribbed and 1991's Liberal Animation (which was actually recorded in 1988), Kidwiller left the band in 1991, and Aaron Abeyta became the permanent second guitarist (as well as trumpeter), adopting the nickname El Hefe. Dragged into the mainstream spotlight by the mid-'90s success of labelmates Bad Religion and the Offspring, NOFX compensated with albums like 1992's White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, that were even closer to the anti-commercial extreme exemplified by White Trash's accompanying single \"Please Play This Song on the Radio,\" which lured un-alert radio programmers with a tight melody, but ends with a stream of obscenities. The El Hefe-anchored lineup continued to blossom with 1994's Punk in Drublic; often regarded as the band's best, the album was eventually certified gold. Releases on Fat Wreck Chords continued throughout the '90s, as did the full-length Epitaph albums, like 1996's grungier, less uptempo Heavy Petting Zoo, 1997's punkier So Long & Thanks for All the Shoes, and 2000's Pump Up the Valuum and Bottles to the Ground; the latter album followed an experimental Fat Wreck Chords EP titled The Decline, which consisted entirely of the 18-minute title track. Next up was the Surfer EP, which showcased select sloppy cuts in spring 2001, with the first 500 copies on colored vinyl.\n\nIn 2002, NOFX sifted through countless tapes and recording sessions, eventually collecting 47 songs for 45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records. \"Pimps and Hookers,\" which was the only new song on the album, was recorded in one day. Later that year, BYO Records got the band to release the NOFX/Rancid split album BYO Split Series, Vol. 3. This particular record had Rancid covering six NOFX tracks while NOFX returned the favor by switching up six Rancid songs. The four-song EP Regaining Unconsciousness came out in March 2003 and served as a teaser for May's The War on Errorism, released on Fat Wreck and littered with political criticisms. Given the band's outspoken and leftist nature, it was not surprising when they launched Punk Voter, a movement of punk bands that sought to politically empower disenfranchised youth and vote George W. Bush out of office. The organization remained in action even after Bush's 2004 reelection.\n\nBack on the music front, NOFX next released the EP Never Trust a Hippy in March 2006, the full-length Wolf in Wolves' Clothing one month later, and the live album They've Actually Gotten Worse Live! the following year. The band's 11th studio album, Coaster, arrived in 2009, paired with a documentary of the band's international 2008 tour in the form of the Fuse network's series Backstage Passport. In 2012, NOFX offered up a more self-aware set of songs on their 12th studio album, Self Entitled. A number of singles followed, and were collected on 2013's Stoke Extinguisher, which featured a new track as well as the B-sides from the previous year's 7\" releases. Fat Mike spent much of 2014 writing songs for a punk rock musical entitled Home Street Home. Along with the rest of NOFX, he collaborated with members of Alkaline Trio, Dance Hall Crashers, the Living End, and even Tony Award-winning vocalist Lena Hall on the soundtrack, which arrived in early 2015 as the final touches were put on the theatrical production.\n\nNOFX released the warts-and-all autobiography The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories in 2016, while also announcing the release of their 13th studio album, First Ditch Effort. Arriving in October, the record was preceded by the harder-edged single \"Six Years on Dope,\" which documented Fat Mike's troubles with substance abuse and his subsequent cleanup. In 2018, after courting controversy for comments made about the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, NOFX were pulled from festival slots and they canceled their U.S. tour. Their third live album, Ribbed: Live in a Dive, arrived that August.\n\nIn March 2020, while in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the group began sharing a series of songs from a forthcoming album they planned on releasing in the fall. These tracks included topical songs like \"Just the Flu,\" \"I Love You More Than I Hate Me,\" and, true to the band's irreverent character, \"Thatcher Fucked the Kids.\" The resulting Single Album was released in January 2021, hitting number 26 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. That September, NOFX revealed their plans to call it quits in 2023, around the time of their 40th anniversary. A year later, they released the track \"Darby Crashing,\" a revamped version of a song initially included on the band's 7-inch of the Month Club series, which served as the lead single off their 2022 full-length Double Album."}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/287567/the-untold-truth-of-nofx/", "page_content": "NOFX formed in 1983, and five years later they had an incredible opportunity when Brett Gurewitz, lead songwriter and guitarist for legendary punk band Bad Religion (and founder of music label Epitaph Records), offered to produce an album for them. As noted in their book, NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories, the band scraped up $675 to record the album, and Gurewitz offered to release it on Epitaph. But the band wanted to launch their own label.\n\nPlus, NOFX themselves admit the album is awful. Lead singer Fat Mike considers the band's second album, 1989's S&M Airlines, to be their real first album and notes that NOFX was \"sounding, performing and behaving like sh*t\" prior to that. In fact, he says that the band had to rebuild their reputation from scratch with their second album because they had such a reputation for being terrible.\n\nIt's not just self-deprecation, either. Ron DePasquale at Allmusic.com says of the album, \"the sound is very raw and loose; the lyrics are slightly humorous at best and sophomoric at worst\" and speculates that the band just wasn't ready for the opportunity. After trying to sell the album on their own and failing miserably, NOFX sold the album to Epitaph after all, but it remains an album for dedicated fans only."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Nofx", "page_content": "About NOFX\n\nTake the melody of The Descendents, some of Bad Religion\u2019s political sense, add a handful of pills and there\u2019s NOFX.\n\nScrewing up since 1983, the Californian group is one of the most influential bands in the history of punk rock.

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia.

NOFX has released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays[3] and a number of 7-inch singles. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album Punk in Drublic (1994), which is their only release to receive gold certification by the RIAA.[4] Their latest studio album, Double Album, was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide,[5] making them one of the most successful independent bands. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on Fuse TV entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport.[6]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 117 116 194 262 19 599 1 284 377 437 250\n\nErik Sandin / NOFX: Seeing Double At The Triple Rock | Remo\n\nArtist Profile | Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin of NOFX\n\nThe Punk Rock Legacy of Erik \"SMELLY\" Sandin (NOFX Drummer) | Back To Your Story Podcast\n\nNOFX's Fat Mike Plays His Favorite Bass Riffs\n\nNOFX: A 5 Minute Drum Chronology - Kye Smith [HD] Transcription\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years (1983\u20131987)\n\nIn 1983, guitarist Eric Melvin met bassist/vocalist Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and started the band under the name NO-FX, after a Boston hardcore punk band called Negative FX.[7] At this time, they were joined by drummer Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin. NOFX's first recording was a demo [8] from 1984, entitled Thalidomide Child, produced by Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell many copies,[citation needed] and Fat Mike once claimed that no copies existed.[citation needed] The demo would be re-released in 2012.[9][10] The group released its self-titled debut extended play NOFX on Mystic Records in 1985; it was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum Rocknroll CD.\n\nThe band's line-up underwent numerous changes prior to 1991. For a year, Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident.[11] In 1986, the band released the extended play So What If We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This, attacking the PMRC's campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of Liberal Animation, a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the NOFX and So What If We're on Mystic! extended plays, and only around 1,000 copies were pressed. The album's cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the NOFX extended play.\n\nFirst four albums and signing to Epitaph (1988\u20131993)\n\nNOFX recorded their debut studio album Liberal Animation in 1988 with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some of the album's lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after writing the Liberal Animation album.[12] The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph Records. Casillas left the band shortly after the recording of Liberal Animation and was replaced by Steve Kidwiler. The band released its second studio album, S&M Airlines, through Epitaph in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, NOFX released its third studio album, Ribbed. Shortly after the album was released, Steve Kidwiler left the band, and Aaron Abeyta (a.k.a. \"El Hefe\") joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play The Longest Line, followed by the studio album White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX's former label Mystic Records released Maximum Rocknroll, which compiles early singles and demo songs and is a reissue of their 1989 long-out-of-print compilation tape E Is for Everything. Despite being referred to as an \"official\" release, Fat Mike has been quoted as saying that he did not know that the album existed until he saw a copy of it \"in a store.\"[13]\n\nRise to popularity (1994\u20131999)\n\nIn the wake of the 1990s punk rock revival revolution (dominated by Green Day, The Offspring, Bad Religion and Rancid), NOFX released their fifth studio album Punk in Drublic in July 1994. It is one of the band's most successful albums, peaking at number 12 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart,[14] and obtaining gold status six years after its release.[4] Although one of the album's singles \"Leave It Alone\" got airplay on active rock radio stations, the most notable being KROQ,[15][16] its music video never received airplay on MTV. Fat Mike has been quoted saying, \"We made the 'Leave It Alone' video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn't want to be a part of that machine, of that 'punk wave.'\"[17]\n\nDue to the success of Punk in Drublic, NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. In 1995, the band released its first live album, I Heard They Suck Live!!. In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating \"We've been doing fine all these years without you so leave us alone!\" Punk in Drublic is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike.\n\nPunk in Drublic was followed by 1996's Heavy Petting Zoo, whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name Eating Lamb. The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a 69 position with the sheep. The Eating Lamb version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the Billboard charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: \"Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium.\"[18]\n\nIn 1997, the band released So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes, a return to faster punk, as exemplified by the frenetic opening track, \"It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite.\"\n\nNOFX released The Decline, an 18-minute single-track extended play, which served as a fiery and cynical social commentary, in 1999. The Decline, clocking in at 18:23, is the second-longest punk song ever recorded (behind Crass' 20-minute song \"Taking Sides\").[19]\n\nMove from Epitaph to Fat Wreck Chords (2000\u20132008)\n\nNOFX released its eighth studio album, Pump Up the Valuum, in 2000. It was the band's final album released through Epitaph, as the band decided to sign to Fat Mike's own label, Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nIn 2002, the band recorded BYO Split Series Volume III, a split album with Rancid, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.\n\nNOFX released its ninth studio album, The War on Errorism, in 2003, an album of political songs. It became the start of its anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush albums, and started a Rock Against Bush U.S. tour. The song \"Separation of Church and Skate\" from the album was featured in the game Tony Hawk's Underground.[20] In 2004, a previously unreleased demo version of their song \"Concerns of a GOP Neo-Phyte\" was contributed to the compilation album Take Action! Vol. 4.\n\nIn February 2005, the band launched the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service, which saw the release of one new extended play almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3,000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the extended plays.\n\n\"The Wall\" in NOFX performing atin Taipei , Taiwan\n\nOn March 14, 2006, the extended play Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the studio album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL 07 was released, featuring \"Wolves in Wolves' Clothing\" on its soundtrack, produced by Bill Stevenson and Fat Mike. NOFX's song \"Kill All the White Man\" was played briefly in the action movie Crank in 2006, and was credited as such in the film's soundtrack.\n\nIn January 2007, the band recorded three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!, released November 20, 2007. The live album is described on the press release as \"their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever ... and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album I Heard They Suck Live.\"[5]\n\nNOFX launched a world tour in September 2007, which was the basis for a documentary, NOFX: Backstage Passport, which aired on Fuse TV about its worldwide tour.[21] The show was entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport.\n\nCoaster, Cokie the Clown and Self-Entitled (2009\u20132014)\n\nIn February 2009, NOFX reunited with former members Steve Kidwiler and Dave Casillas for its 25th-anniversary special performances. They played three sold-out shows, one in San Diego, one in Hollywood, and one in S.F. NOFX released a new album, Coaster,[22] on April 28, 2009.[22][23] The band worked with the same co-producer, Bill Stevenson, who produced its previous album, Wolves in Wolves' Clothing.[24] NOFX was also added to the lineup for the Warped Tour 2009.[25][26] They also toured Australia and New Zealand in late 2009 with Bad Religion.\n\nNOFX released a new extended play on November 24, 2009, titled Cokie the Clown. It was released on one CD or two seven-inch vinyl records, which are called Cokie the Clown and My Orphan Year. The extended play consists of outtakes from the Coaster sessions. NOFX started its spring 2010 \"Fermented and Flailing\" tour on April 21. This was the official tour for its album Coaster.\n\nDuring this time period, Fat Mike would occasionally adopt the Cokie the Clown persona (as seen on the extended play's cover and the \"Cokie the Clown\" music video[27]) during live performances. Fat Mike performed a solo acoustic performance on March 20, 2010, at the SXSW Festival[28] as Cokie, which was described as \"strange, emotional, and intimate.\" At the end of the concert, after debuting a new song called \"Drinking Pee\", a video that was played for the audience suggested that a number of festival participants unknowingly drank Fat Mike's urine.[29] The stunt resulted in Fat Mike getting banned from the Austin, Texas, venue, Emo's.[30] In May 2010, NOFX posted a video online that showed Fat Mike urinating into a bottle of Patr\u00f3n as was previously announced, but then switching the bottle before going on stage to a bottle not containing any urine.[31] Months later in an interview, Mike stated that he had \"always wanted to be banned from somewhere.\"[32]\n\nOn June 21, 2010, NOFX announced that they were going to release a compilation album titled The Longest EP,[33] a compilation of selected songs from its extended plays from 1987 to 2009. It was released on August 17, 2010.[34]\n\nOn November 23, 2010, Fat Wreck Chords released NOFX / The Spits, a split EP with the Seattle, Washington, band The Spits. It contained two new songs from each band.[35][36]\n\nIn a January 2011 interview with The Daily Times, Fat Mike revealed that a new NOFX album was in production, saying \"There are some really good songs on Coaster, but after having written 300 songs, I feel lucky I came up with them. That's why there are songs on there about Iron Maiden and Tegan and Sara. I'm reaching, man. Sometimes I grab stuff just to grab stuff, and I'm going in a lot of different directions.\"[37] In December 2011, Fat Mike revealed to Phoenix New Times that he has begun work on a new NOFX album and a soundtrack to a \"fetish film\" called Rubber Bordello.[38]\n\nIn June 2011, NOFX began their Great White North Tour, which would have them traveling across Canada. The tour kicked off in St. John's, Newfoundland, on June 14. It was the first time the band had been to Newfoundland.\n\nAlong with a self-titled 10\" of 1980s hardcore punk cover songs, the band also planned to re-release their first recordings in the summer of 2011. The 10\" features covers from the Necros and D.O.A. and songs such as \"Police Brutality\" and \"Race Riot.\" The album was released on a vinyl record and has been distributed to independent record companies around the U.S., Great Britain, and elsewhere.\n\nGuitarist and trumpeter El Hefe joined the band in 1991.\n\nOn February 14, 2012, in an article on Rolling Stone's website, Fat Mike said that a new album was on the way. \"We're recording in April, and it should be out in the fall. I've got 12 songs, but I don't have a name for it, and only a few of the songs are finished,\" he says. \"We're demo-ing it right now.\"[39]\n\nA 7\" single, My Stepdad's a Cop and My Stepmom's a Domme, featuring new songs recorded prior to the sessions for Self Entitled, was released in June 2012.[40][41][42]\n\nNOFX released their twelfth studio album, Self Entitled, on September 11, 2012.[43][44] NOFX also released X'mas Has Been X'd on January 15, 2013, and their 30th anniversary LP box set on February 19, 2013.\n\nNOFX toured in Australia starting November 5, 2014. They performed in Sydney, Newcastle, New South Wales, Wollongong, Brisbane, Darwin, Northern Territory, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Geelong, and Gold Coast, Queensland.[45]\n\nFirst Ditch Effort, Single Album, and Double Album (2015\u2013present)\n\nNOFX toured the United States in the summer of 2015 celebrating the 25th anniversary of Fat Wreck Chords. Supporting acts for this tour were Lagwagon, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Strung Out, Propagandhi, Swingin' Utters, Bracket, ToyGuitar, The Flatliners, Masked Intruder and Bad Cop/Bad Cop.[46][47] Guitarist El Hefe said that NOFX was going to work on new music after the Fat Wreck Chords 25th anniversary tour.[48] On their tour to Europe, NOFX stated their new album would be out in September 2016.[49] On July 19, 2016, the band's thirteenth studio album, First Ditch Effort, was announced, to be released on October 7; the lead single \"Six Years on Dope\" was released the same day.[50] On April 17, 2016, they released their autobiography, called NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories. During the tour, named the Hepatitis Bathtub Tour, they did book signings on some dates. On December 16 a special hard-covered edition with a seven-inch four-song vinyl (titled Hepatitis Bathtub) and a bath towel was also released.[51]\n\nIn March 2018, NOFX released a new single \"There's No 'Too Soon' if Time Is Relative\", in tribute to physicist Stephen Hawking, who had died days earlier. The track had been recorded a month prior to its release.[52] Several days later, they announced the first annual \"Camp Punk in Drublic Festival\" in Legend Valley in Thornville, Ohio. The three-day event was to feature NOFX alongside Rancid, Pennywise, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes.[53] In a May 2018 interview, Fat Mike hinted that NOFX was working on new material.[54]\n\nIn February 2019, Fat Mike announced the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a new subscription-based service scheduled for the release of 12 new extended plays almost monthly. As with the previous 2005 installment, the cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries.[55]\n\nOn August 16, 2019, NOFX released a new single, \"Fish in a Gun Barrel\".[56] The song was written in response to mass shootings in America, with proceeds from the single going to anti-gun-violence charity Moms Demand Action.[56]\n\nOn March 23, 2020, NOFX released a video for another new song, \"PRBOD\".[57] A few days later, the band released a video for \"another new song that didn't make it on the new album\" called \"The Oddition\".[58]\n\nOn January 12, 2021, NOFX announced that they would release their first studio album in nearly five years, Single Album, on February 26.[59]\n\nOn September 1, 2022, Fat Mike confirmed in a reply to a comment in an Instagram post that NOFX would be disbanding in 2023, the year of the band's 40th anniversary, and suggested that their final show may take place in their hometown of Los Angeles, California.[60][61]\n\nOn September 27, 2022, NOFX announced their next album, Double Album, would come out on December 2, 2022.[62] They released the single \"Darby Crashing,\" a reworked version of a song from their 2019-2020 \"7 inch of the Month Club,\" on the same day.[63]\n\nNOFX is also planning on releasing three in-progress albums entitled Half Album, Everybody Else Is Insane, and NOFX: A\u2013Z.[64]\n\nMusic style and influences\n\nCritics have labeled NOFX's style as primarily punk rock,[17][64] melodic hardcore,[65][66] skate punk,[67][68] ska punk,[69] and pop-punk.[70] Fat Mike in a 2021 Spin interview identified NOFX as a melodic hardcore band, rejecting critics' labeling of the band's style as pop-punk.[65]\n\nThe band cites its influences as Bad Religion, Rich Kids on LSD, D.I., SNFU, Operation Ivy, The Dickies, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Dead Milkmen, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Adrenalin O.D., Minor Threat, Germs, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, The Adolescents, Misfits, and Subhumans.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\nControversy\n\nIn 2018, the band attracted significant controversy after statements by Fat Mike and rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin during a concert in Las Vegas on May 30, 2018.[76][77][78] Referencing the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Melvin stated \"I guess you only get shot in Vegas if you're in a country band,\" and Mike replied with \u201cYou know, that [massacre] sucked, but least they were country fans and not punk rock fans.\"[79][80] The lead sponsor of the Punk in Drublic festival, Stone Brewing Co., pulled support from the festival as well as from NOFX's line of craft beer.[81] NOFX and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were subsequently removed from the festival's lineup.\n\nThe band later apologized, stating, \"What we said in Vegas was shitty and insensitive and we are all embarrassed by our remarks.\"[82][83] In June 2018 the band stated that all of their U.S. concerts had been canceled and they had been \"effectively banned\" from playing in the United States due to the comments.[84][85] However, Fat Mike later clarified otherwise, stating that \"Our promoter canceled \u2014 my partner [not the venues].\"[86]\n\nBand members\n\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/23956", "page_content": "NOFX (pronounced \"no-ef-ex\") is an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California (later relocating to San Francisco).[5] The band was formed in 1983 by vocalist/bassist Fat Mike and guitarist Eric Melvin.[5] Drummer Erik Sandin joined NOFX shortly after. In 1991 El Hefe joined to play lead guitar and trumpet, rounding out the current line-up. The band rose to popularity with its album Punk in Drublic (1994), which was certified gold, and is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike. NOFX's mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands Pennywise, Rancid, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring and Sublime. Unlike some of those bands, however, NOFX has never been signed to a major label.\n\nNOFX has released eleven studio albums, fifteen extended plays[6] and a number of seven-inch singles. The group has sold over 6 million records worldwide,[7] making it one of the most successful independent bands of all time. The band also broadcasted its own show on Fuse TV entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport.[8]\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years (1983\u20131990)\n\nIn 1985, guitarist Eric Melvin met bassist/vocalist Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and started the band under the name NO-FX, after a Boston hardcore punk band called Negative FX.[9] At this time, they were joined by drummer Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin. NOFX's first recording was a demo from 1985, produced by Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell many copies, but is now an incredibly rare collector's item. Many have been uploaded online, but barely any are valid. Fat Mike claims no copies exist anymore, though it is unclear whether he or any other members of the band still possess the item. The group released its self-titled debut extended play NOFX on Mystic Records in 1985, which was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum Rocknroll CD. Mystic's Mark Wilkins, who handled promotion on their first national tour with Dr. Know told Wild Times \"I knew those guys had something special. In the middle of the tour Dr. Know's van broke down forcing them to quit the tour but NOFX kept on going and actually completed the tour. That was very rare and in my mind an example of the kind of discipline it takes to be successful.\"\n\nThe band's line-up had undergone a number of changes; however, the original three members had reunited. For a year, Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released the extended play So What If We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This, attacking the PMRC's campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of Liberal Animation, a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the NOFX and So What If We're on Mystic! extended plays. The album is quite rare and only printed around 1,000 copies. The price of the album ranges from $80\u2013300. The album's cover was a remastered version of the cover from the NOFX extended play.\n\nNOFX recorded Liberal Animation in 1988 with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some of the album's lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after writing the Liberal Animation album.[10] The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph Records. Casillas left the band shortly after the recording of Liberal Animation and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller (a.k.a. \"Steve the Caucasian\"). The band released its second studio album S&M Airlines through Epitaph in 1989.\n\nEpitaph years (1991\u20132002)\n\nIn 1991, NOFX released its third studio album, Ribbed. Shortly after the album was released, Steve Kidwiller left the band, and Aaron Abeyta (a.k.a. \"El Hefe\") joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play The Longest Line, followed by the studio album White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX's former label Mystic Records released Maximum Rocknroll, which compiles early singles and demo songs and is actually a reissue of their 1989 long-out of print compilation tape E Is for Everything. Although the band claims that Maximum Rocknroll was not released with their consent, it's listed on the discography of their website.[11]\n\nIn 1994, punk rock entered the mainstream with the success of The Offspring's Smash, Bad Religion's Stranger than Fiction, Rancid's Let's Go and Green Day's Dookie, and NOFX had a commercial breakthrough with the release of its fifth studio album Punk in Drublic, their best-selling album to date. The album was certified gold with support from Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ, which played the song \"Leave It Alone\". A music video was made for the song but did not receive airplay on MTV. Due to the success of Punk in Drublic, NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. The following year, the band released its first live album I Heard They Suck Live!!. In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating \"We've been doing fine all these years without you so leave us alone!\" Punk in Drublic is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike.\n\nPunk in Drublic was followed by Heavy Petting Zoo (1996). The album did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the Billboard charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: \"Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium.\"[12]\n\nIn 1997, the band released So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes, a return to faster punk, as exemplified by the frenetic opening track, \"It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite\".\n\nNOFX released The Decline, an 18-minute single-track extended play which served as a fiery and cynical social commentary in 1999. The Decline, clocking in at 18:23, is the second-longest punk song ever recorded (after Crass' 20-minute song \"Yes Sir, I Will\").[13]\n\nNOFX released its eighth studio album Pump Up the Valuum in 2000. It was the band's final album released through Epitaph, as the band decided to sign to Fat Mike's own label Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nIn 2002, the band recorded BYO Split Series Volume III, a split album with Rancid, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.\n\nMove to Fat Wreck Chords (2003\u20132008)\n\nNOFX released its ninth studio album The War on Errorism in 2003, an album of political songs. It became the start of its anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush albums, and started a Rock Against Bush U.S. tour. The song \"Separation of the Church and Skate\" from the album was featured in the game Tony Hawk's Underground.\n\nIn February 2005, the band launched the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service which saw the release of one new extended play almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3,000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the extended plays.\n\n\"The Wall\" in Taiwan. NOFX performing atin Taipei\n\nOn March 14, 2006, the extended play Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the studio album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL 07 was released, featuring \"Wolves in Wolves' Clothing\" on its soundtrack, produced by Bill Stevenson and Fat Mike. NOFX's song \"Kill All the White Man\" was played briefly in the action movie Crank in 2006, and was credited as such in the film's soundtrack.\n\nIn January 2007, the band recorded three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for a live album entitled They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!, released November 20, 2007. The live album is described on the press release as \"their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever \u2026 and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album I Heard They Suck Live.\"[7]\n\nNOFX launched a world tour in September 2007, which included concerts in Israel (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa). During its final performances in Israel (7 September in Haifa), vocalist Fat Mike inadvertently struck guitarist Eric Melvin with his bass guitar during the performance of \"Bottles to the Ground\", breaking the guitar's neck, and leaving a bloody gash on Melvin's forehead. The broken bass guitar was replaced with one from Useless ID for the rest of the concert. The band completed its scheduled set amidst the audience's cheers for Melvin's good humor and perseverance. This tour was the basis of the band's recent television show, NOFX: Backstage Passport.\n\nDuring the same tour, NOFX played four concerts in South Africa, the band's first performances on the African continent. The tour of South Africa followed successful tours by the bands Lagwagon, Frenzal Rhomb, and Mad Caddies, all of which are signed to Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nCoaster and Cokie the Clown (2009\u2013present)\n\nIn February 2009, NOFX reunited with former members Steve Kidwiller and Dave Casillas for its 25th anniversary special performances. NOFX released a new album, Coaster,[14] on April 28, 2009.[14][15] The band worked with the same co-producer, Bill Stevenson, who produced its previous album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing.[16] NOFX was also added to the lineup for the Warped Tour 2009.[17][18] They also toured Australia and New Zealand in late 2009 with Bad Religion.\n\nNOFX released a new extended play on November 24, 2009 titled Cokie the Clown. It was released on one CD or two seven-inch vinyl records, which are called Cokie the Clown and My Orphan Year. The extended play consists of outtakes from the Coaster sessions. NOFX started its spring 2010 \"Fermented and Flailing\" tour on April 21. This was the official tour for its album Coaster.\n\nDuring this time period, Fat Mike would occasionally adopt the Cokie the Clown persona (as seen on the extended play's cover and the \"Cokie the Clown\" music video[19]) during live performances. Fat Mike performed a solo acoustic performamce at the 2010 SXSW Festival as Cokie that was described as \"strange, emotional, and intimate.\" At the end of the concert, after debuting a new song called \"Drinking Pee\", a video that was played for the audience suggested that a number of festival participants unknowingly drank Fat Mike's urine.[20] The stunt resulted in Fat Mike getting banned from the Austin, Texas venue.[21] In May 2010, NOFX posted a video online that showed Fat Mike urinating into a bottle of Patr\u00f3n as was previously announced, but then switched the bottle before going on stage to a bottle not containing any urine.[22] Months later in an interview, Mike stated that he had \"always wanted to be banned from somewhere.\"[23]\n\nOn June 21, 2010, NOFX announced that they were going to release a compilation album entitled The Longest EP.[24] A compilation of select songs from its extended play's from 1987 to 2009. It was released on August 17, 2010.[25]\n\nIt was recently announced by Fat Wreck Chords that NOFX will release a new split album with the Seattle, Washington band The Spits. It will be released on November 23, 2010 and it will contain 2 new songs from each band.[26]\n\nAccording to a January 2011 interview with The Daily Times, a new NOFX album is in production. Fat Mike revealed information about it, saying \"There are some really good songs on Coaster, but after having written 300 songs, I feel lucky I came up with them. That's why there are songs on there about Iron Maiden and Tegan and Sara. I'm reaching, man. Sometimes I grab stuff just to grab stuff, and I'm going in a lot of different directions.\"[27]\n\nIn June 2011, NOFX began their Great White North Tour, which will have them traveling across Canada. The tour kicked off in St. John's, Newfoundland on June 14. It was the first time the band had been to Newfoundland.\n\nAlong with a 10\" of 80s hardcore punk cover songs, the band also plans to re-release their first recordings in Summer 2011. Of course, the title of the album is not \"Untitled\" as some call it. It's labeled \"Nofx.\" This was not, however, the first Album dubbed \"Nofx.\" It features covers from The Necros, D.O.A, and songs such as \"Police Brutality,\" or \"Race Riot.\"\n\nMusic style and influences\n\nThe band's sound is diverse, utilizing elements of punk rock, skate punk, melodic hardcore, ska punk, and other music genres. Its more recent songs often focus on issues such as politics, society, racism, sexism, homophobia, class inequalities, drug use, the music industry, and religion. The band has released songs that range in length from under a minute, with songs such as \"I Gotta Pee\" (0:32) and \"Murder the Government\" (0:45), to its longest song, \"The Decline\", which is over eighteen minutes long. NOFX frequently poke fun (in friendly manner) at other bands. Its song \"Whoa on the Whoas\" parodied The Offspring's frequent use of the word \"whoa\" in their songs. A split album between NOFX and fellow punk band Rancid featured each group covering 6 songs from the other band's catalog.\n\nThe band cites its influences as Adrenalin O.D., Rich Kids on LSD, D.I., SNFU, Operation Ivy, The Dickies, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Dead Milkmen, Sex Pistols, Bad Religion, Minor Threat, The Germs, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, The Adolescents, The Misfits and Subhumans.[28]\n\nRelationship with the media\n\nFor years the band has consented to very few interviews and have only made a few music videos, citing the fact that it does not need any more exposure and that people were exploiting the group.[29] In recent years, Fat Mike has consented to more interviews, including five different interviews with Nardwuar between 2002 and 2009.[30] The band has also refused permission for its music videos to be broadcasted on MTV, VH1, and similar music channels, although its music has been played on Canada's Much Music.[31] NOFX made a live appearance on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2004.[32] Its appearance on the show was controversial, as its message was anti-Bush (playing the song \"Franco Un-American\"), the lyrics were modified from the original to include an anti-Bush statement:\n\nWe all know George Bush is an imbecile\n\nHe loves Dick Cheney but he hates homosexuals\n\nWe're sick and tired of the embarrassment\n\nThe whole world wants us to get a better president\n\nThe band briefly pursued an \"anti-Conan\" riff, although the intent was likely jocular. The credits on the album Heavy Petting Zoo call on MTV, along with major labels, to \"Leave us the fuck alone.\"\n\nFat Mike has also repeatedly conducted friendly interviews with the Australian Broadcasting Corporations' alternative radio station Triple J on its breakfast show with Jay (Jason Whalley) and the Doctor (Lindsay McDougall). Jay and the Doctor are both members of Frenzal Rhomb, an Australian punk rock band that has played many tours and festivals with NOFX, and has its music distribution outside Australia handled by Mike's Fat Wreck Chords label.[33]\n\nIn 2008, NOFX aired a documentary series on Fuse TV about its worldwide tour.[34] The show was entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport.\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\nSteve Kidwiller \u2013 guitar (1989\u20131991)\n\nDave Casillas \u2013 guitar (1986\u20131989)\n\nScott Sellers - drums (1985\u20131986)\n\nScott Aldahl - drums (1985\u20131986)\n\nDave Allen - lead vocals (1985\u20131986) (deceased)\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums Maximum RockNRoll"}, {"url": "https://www.epitaph.com/artists/nofx/bio", "page_content": "2000 is (not) the year of NOFX! But don't listen to the hype; listen to the record. Pump Up The Valuum is more clever, more irreverent and more crude than NOFX has ever been: and hot on the heels of the unprecedented The Decline, an amazing 18 minute punk-a-thon, NOFX come slamming back with 14 instant classics (in about 32 minutes).\n\nPump Up The Valuum combines some of NOFX's most outrageous (and curiously thought provoking) lyrics like in \"Louise,\" \"Herojuana\" and \"My Vagina\" (a first-person account of becoming a transsexual), as well as some of their most poignant lyrics like in \"Total Bummer.\" This, their eighth album for Epitaph contains some of the most barefaced drug references and sexual in-your-endos (innuendoes is the wrong word because that means that sexual acts are only \"implied\").\n\nFrom day one, NOFX has been all about having a good time, regardless to whose expense it came. In the liner notes of 1996's Heavy Petting Zoo, NOFX blasted the music industry circle including major labels, print media, radio, and especially MTV. This time, NOFX bring their despise of major labels into the songwriting with \"Dinosaurs Will Die.\" Lyrics like \"Parasitic music industry\" and \"Music created from devotion / not ambition / not for fame / zero people are exploited / there are no tricks up our sleeves\" refers to the death of the 5 remaining majors, and being glad they are independent.\n\nNOFX are in incredibly intelligent band. The way Fat Mike and crew have set themselves up is unique in this business. They don't need to cater to anyone, and their ethics are simple: if it's not fun, don't do it; and if it is fun, do it again! To NOFX, music is for one group of people: the fans. Here's how they got to where they are : they toured their asses off for the first ten years of their career. Constantly on the road, eventually they got pretty good at playing their instruments, which meant that people might actually want to come see them play. Then, they put out killer records, year after year. On paper, that seems like a relatively easy thing to do. But if you take a look at their former Epitaph brethren Bad Religion, it is obvious that this is not such an easy task (although BR did pretty damn well for awhile there!).\n\nMaximum respect goes out to NOFX. 1994's Punk In Drublic is officially gold in the US, and worldwide, NOFX continue to sell CD's like they are going out of style (CD's, not NOFX). In 2000, they claim two of the biggest punk rock releases of the year, the headline spot on the Warped Tour (for the third time), a kick-ass tour of Australia and New Zealand, and will do the same in Europe, guaranteed.\n\nSo don't be a schmuck.

NOFX has released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays[3] and a number of 7-inch singles. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album Punk in Drublic (1994), which is their only release to receive gold certification by the RIAA.[4] Their latest studio album, Double Album, was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide,[5] making them one of the most successful independent bands. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on Fuse TV entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport.[6]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nEarly years (1983\u20131987) [ edit ]\n\nIn 1983, guitarist Eric Melvin met bassist/vocalist Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and started the band under the name NO-FX, after a Boston hardcore punk band called Negative FX.[7] At this time, they were joined by drummer Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin. NOFX's first recording was a demo [8] from 1984, entitled Thalidomide Child, produced by Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell many copies,[citation needed] and Fat Mike once claimed that no copies existed.[citation needed] The demo would be re-released in 2012.[9][10] The group released its self-titled debut extended play NOFX on Mystic Records in 1985; it was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum Rocknroll CD.\n\nThe band's line-up underwent numerous changes prior to 1991. For a year, Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident.[11] In 1986, the band released the extended play So What If We're on Mystic!. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This, attacking the PMRC's campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited S&M photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Prior to the release of Liberal Animation, a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on Mystic Records. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the NOFX and So What If We're on Mystic! extended plays, and only around 1,000 copies were pressed. The album's cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the NOFX extended play.\n\nFirst four albums and signing to Epitaph (1988\u20131993) [ edit ]\n\nNOFX recorded their debut studio album Liberal Animation in 1988 with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some of the album's lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after writing the Liberal Animation album.[12] The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label Epitaph Records. Casillas left the band shortly after the recording of Liberal Animation and was replaced by Steve Kidwiler. The band released its second studio album, S&M Airlines, through Epitaph in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, NOFX released its third studio album, Ribbed. Shortly after the album was released, Steve Kidwiler left the band, and Aaron Abeyta (a.k.a. \"El Hefe\") joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play The Longest Line, followed by the studio album White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean, released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX's former label Mystic Records released Maximum Rocknroll, which compiles early singles and demo songs and is a reissue of their 1989 long-out-of-print compilation tape E Is for Everything. Despite being referred to as an \"official\" release, Fat Mike has been quoted as saying that he did not know that the album existed until he saw a copy of it \"in a store.\"[13]\n\nRise to popularity (1994\u20131999) [ edit ]\n\nIn the wake of the 1990s punk rock revival revolution (dominated by Green Day, The Offspring, Bad Religion and Rancid), NOFX released their fifth studio album Punk in Drublic in July 1994. It is one of the band's most successful albums, peaking at number 12 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart,[14] and obtaining gold status six years after its release.[4] Although one of the album's singles \"Leave It Alone\" got airplay on active rock radio stations, the most notable being KROQ,[15][16] its music video never received airplay on MTV. Fat Mike has been quoted saying, \"We made the 'Leave It Alone' video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn't want to be a part of that machine, of that 'punk wave.'\"[17]\n\nDue to the success of Punk in Drublic, NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. In 1995, the band released its first live album, I Heard They Suck Live!!. In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating \"We've been doing fine all these years without you so leave us alone!\" Punk in Drublic is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike.\n\nPunk in Drublic was followed by 1996's Heavy Petting Zoo, whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name Eating Lamb. The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a 69 position with the sheep. The Eating Lamb version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the Billboard charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: \"Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium.\"[18]\n\nIn 1997, the band released So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes, a return to faster punk, as exemplified by the frenetic opening track, \"It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite.\"\n\nNOFX released The Decline, an 18-minute single-track extended play, which served as a fiery and cynical social commentary, in 1999. The Decline, clocking in at 18:23, is the second-longest punk song ever recorded (behind Crass' 20-minute song \"Taking Sides\").[19]\n\nMove from Epitaph to Fat Wreck Chords (2000\u20132008) [ edit ]\n\nNOFX released its eighth studio album, Pump Up the Valuum, in 2000. It was the band's final album released through Epitaph, as the band decided to sign to Fat Mike's own label, Fat Wreck Chords.\n\nIn 2002, the band recorded BYO Split Series Volume III, a split album with Rancid, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.\n\nNOFX released its ninth studio album, The War on Errorism, in 2003, an album of political songs. It became the start of its anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush albums, and started a Rock Against Bush U.S. tour. The song \"Separation of Church and Skate\" from the album was featured in the game Tony Hawk's Underground.[20] In 2004, a previously unreleased demo version of their song \"Concerns of a GOP Neo-Phyte\" was contributed to the compilation album Take Action! Vol. 4.\n\nIn February 2005, the band launched the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a subscription-based service, which saw the release of one new extended play almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3,000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the extended plays.\n\n\"The Wall\" in NOFX performing atin Taipei , Taiwan\n\nOn March 14, 2006, the extended play Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the studio album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing. On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL 07 was released, featuring \"Wolves in Wolves' Clothing\" on its soundtrack, produced by Bill Stevenson and Fat Mike. NOFX's song \"Kill All the White Man\" was played briefly in the action movie Crank in 2006, and was credited as such in the film's soundtrack.\n\nIn January 2007, the band recorded three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!, released November 20, 2007. The live album is described on the press release as \"their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever ... and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album I Heard They Suck Live.\"[5]\n\nNOFX launched a world tour in September 2007, which was the basis for a documentary, NOFX: Backstage Passport, which aired on Fuse TV about its worldwide tour.[21] The show was entitled NOFX: Backstage Passport.\n\nCoaster, Cokie the Clown and Self-Entitled (2009\u20132014) [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2009, NOFX reunited with former members Steve Kidwiler and Dave Casillas for its 25th-anniversary special performances. They played three sold-out shows, one in San Diego, one in Hollywood, and one in S.F. NOFX released a new album, Coaster,[22] on April 28, 2009.[22][23] The band worked with the same co-producer, Bill Stevenson, who produced its previous album, Wolves in Wolves' Clothing.[24] NOFX was also added to the lineup for the Warped Tour 2009.[25][26] They also toured Australia and New Zealand in late 2009 with Bad Religion.\n\nNOFX released a new extended play on November 24, 2009, titled Cokie the Clown. It was released on one CD or two seven-inch vinyl records, which are called Cokie the Clown and My Orphan Year. The extended play consists of outtakes from the Coaster sessions. NOFX started its spring 2010 \"Fermented and Flailing\" tour on April 21. This was the official tour for its album Coaster.\n\nDuring this time period, Fat Mike would occasionally adopt the Cokie the Clown persona (as seen on the extended play's cover and the \"Cokie the Clown\" music video[27]) during live performances. Fat Mike performed a solo acoustic performance on March 20, 2010, at the SXSW Festival[28] as Cokie, which was described as \"strange, emotional, and intimate.\" At the end of the concert, after debuting a new song called \"Drinking Pee\", a video that was played for the audience suggested that a number of festival participants unknowingly drank Fat Mike's urine.[29] The stunt resulted in Fat Mike getting banned from the Austin, Texas, venue, Emo's.[30] In May 2010, NOFX posted a video online that showed Fat Mike urinating into a bottle of Patr\u00f3n as was previously announced, but then switching the bottle before going on stage to a bottle not containing any urine.[31] Months later in an interview, Mike stated that he had \"always wanted to be banned from somewhere.\"[32]\n\nOn June 21, 2010, NOFX announced that they were going to release a compilation album titled The Longest EP,[33] a compilation of selected songs from its extended plays from 1987 to 2009. It was released on August 17, 2010.[34]\n\nOn November 23, 2010, Fat Wreck Chords released NOFX / The Spits, a split EP with the Seattle, Washington, band The Spits. It contained two new songs from each band.[35][36]\n\nIn a January 2011 interview with The Daily Times, Fat Mike revealed that a new NOFX album was in production, saying \"There are some really good songs on Coaster, but after having written 300 songs, I feel lucky I came up with them. That's why there are songs on there about Iron Maiden and Tegan and Sara. I'm reaching, man. Sometimes I grab stuff just to grab stuff, and I'm going in a lot of different directions.\"[37] In December 2011, Fat Mike revealed to Phoenix New Times that he has begun work on a new NOFX album and a soundtrack to a \"fetish film\" called Rubber Bordello.[38]\n\nIn June 2011, NOFX began their Great White North Tour, which would have them traveling across Canada. The tour kicked off in St. John's, Newfoundland, on June 14. It was the first time the band had been to Newfoundland.\n\nAlong with a self-titled 10\" of 1980s hardcore punk cover songs, the band also planned to re-release their first recordings in the summer of 2011. The 10\" features covers from the Necros and D.O.A. and songs such as \"Police Brutality\" and \"Race Riot.\" The album was released on a vinyl record and has been distributed to independent record companies around the U.S., Great Britain, and elsewhere.\n\nGuitarist and trumpeter El Hefe joined the band in 1991.\n\nOn February 14, 2012, in an article on Rolling Stone's website, Fat Mike said that a new album was on the way. \"We're recording in April, and it should be out in the fall. I've got 12 songs, but I don't have a name for it, and only a few of the songs are finished,\" he says. \"We're demo-ing it right now.\"[39]\n\nA 7\" single, My Stepdad's a Cop and My Stepmom's a Domme, featuring new songs recorded prior to the sessions for Self Entitled, was released in June 2012.[40][41][42]\n\nNOFX released their twelfth studio album, Self Entitled, on September 11, 2012.[43][44] NOFX also released X'mas Has Been X'd on January 15, 2013, and their 30th anniversary LP box set on February 19, 2013.\n\nNOFX toured in Australia starting November 5, 2014. They performed in Sydney, Newcastle, New South Wales, Wollongong, Brisbane, Darwin, Northern Territory, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Geelong, and Gold Coast, Queensland.[45]\n\nFirst Ditch Effort, Single Album, and Double Album (2015\u2013present) [ edit ]\n\nNOFX toured the United States in the summer of 2015 celebrating the 25th anniversary of Fat Wreck Chords. Supporting acts for this tour were Lagwagon, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Strung Out, Propagandhi, Swingin' Utters, Bracket, ToyGuitar, The Flatliners, Masked Intruder and Bad Cop/Bad Cop.[46][47] Guitarist El Hefe said that NOFX was going to work on new music after the Fat Wreck Chords 25th anniversary tour.[48] On their tour to Europe, NOFX stated their new album would be out in September 2016.[49] On July 19, 2016, the band's thirteenth studio album, First Ditch Effort, was announced, to be released on October 7; the lead single \"Six Years on Dope\" was released the same day.[50] On April 17, 2016, they released their autobiography, called NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories. During the tour, named the Hepatitis Bathtub Tour, they did book signings on some dates. On December 16 a special hard-covered edition with a seven-inch four-song vinyl (titled Hepatitis Bathtub) and a bath towel was also released.[51]\n\nIn March 2018, NOFX released a new single \"There's No 'Too Soon' if Time Is Relative\", in tribute to physicist Stephen Hawking, who had died days earlier. The track had been recorded a month prior to its release.[52] Several days later, they announced the first annual \"Camp Punk in Drublic Festival\" in Legend Valley in Thornville, Ohio. The three-day event was to feature NOFX alongside Rancid, Pennywise, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes.[53] In a May 2018 interview, Fat Mike hinted that NOFX was working on new material.[54]\n\nIn February 2019, Fat Mike announced the NOFX 7\" of the Month Club, a new subscription-based service scheduled for the release of 12 new extended plays almost monthly. As with the previous 2005 installment, the cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries.[55]\n\nOn August 16, 2019, NOFX released a new single, \"Fish in a Gun Barrel\".[56] The song was written in response to mass shootings in America, with proceeds from the single going to anti-gun-violence charity Moms Demand Action.[56]\n\nOn March 23, 2020, NOFX released a video for another new song, \"PRBOD\".[57] A few days later, the band released a video for \"another new song that didn't make it on the new album\" called \"The Oddition\".[58]\n\nOn January 12, 2021, NOFX announced that they would release their first studio album in nearly five years, Single Album, on February 26.[59]\n\nOn September 1, 2022, Fat Mike confirmed in a reply to a comment in an Instagram post that NOFX would be disbanding in 2023, the year of the band's 40th anniversary, and suggested that their final show may take place in their hometown of Los Angeles, California.[60][61]\n\nOn September 27, 2022, NOFX announced their next album, Double Album, would come out on December 2, 2022.[62] They released the single \"Darby Crashing,\" a reworked version of a song from their 2019-2020 \"7 inch of the Month Club,\" on the same day.[63]\n\nNOFX is also planning on releasing three in-progress albums entitled Half Album, Everybody Else Is Insane, and NOFX: A\u2013Z.[64]\n\nMusic style and influences [ edit ]\n\nCritics have labeled NOFX's style as primarily punk rock,[17][64] melodic hardcore,[65][66] skate punk,[67][68] ska punk,[69] and pop-punk.[70] Fat Mike in a 2021 Spin interview identified NOFX as a melodic hardcore band, rejecting critics' labeling of the band's style as pop-punk.[65]\n\nThe band cites its influences as Bad Religion, Rich Kids on LSD, D.I., SNFU, Operation Ivy, The Dickies, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Dead Milkmen, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Adrenalin O.D., Minor Threat, Germs, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, The Adolescents, Misfits, and Subhumans.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\nControversy [ edit ]\n\nIn 2018, the band attracted significant controversy after statements by Fat Mike and rhythm guitarist Eric Melvin during a concert in Las Vegas on May 30, 2018.[76][77][78] Referencing the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Melvin stated \"I guess you only get shot in Vegas if you're in a country band,\" and Mike replied with \u201cYou know, that [massacre] sucked, but least they were country fans and not punk rock fans.\"[79][80] The lead sponsor of the Punk in Drublic festival, Stone Brewing Co., pulled support from the festival as well as from NOFX's line of craft beer.[81] NOFX and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were subsequently removed from the festival's lineup.\n\nThe band later apologized, stating, \"What we said in Vegas was shitty and insensitive and we are all embarrassed by our remarks.\"[82][83] In June 2018 the band stated that all of their U.S. concerts had been canceled and they had been \"effectively banned\" from playing in the United States due to the comments.[84][85] However, Fat Mike later clarified otherwise, stating that \"Our promoter canceled \u2014 my partner [not the venues].\"[86]\n\nBand members [ edit ]\n\nTimeline [ edit ]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums\n\nBibliography [ edit ]"}]}
