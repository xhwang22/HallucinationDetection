For the optical data, we calculated the medoid71 and the standard deviation for the six bands (Table 3). Following the successful application of numerous features extracted from original satellite image bands, this study also added the medoid of the 20th and 80th percentile57 of the six bands into the seasonal composites to detect the seasonal changes in the biophysical environment.\n\nThe ratios between spectral bands were calculated; they are blue/green, red/blue, red/green, red/nir and nir/(red*swir 1). Besides, a great number of spectral indices were also measured from Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI, and Sentinel MSI images (Eqs. (1\u201317); Table 4). In addition, we calculated the seasonal mean of VH, VV, and the normalized difference between VH and VV polarizations from the Sentinel SAR GRD images. Finally, we generated seasonal composite collections of covariates.\n\nTable 4 Spectral indices derived from Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI, and Sentinel MSI satellite images to enhance the accurate performance of Vietnam-wide annual LULC mapping from 1990 to 2020. Full size table\n\nAncillary data sets\n\nExtensive research has shown that ancillary information can improve the accurate performance of LULC classification20,82,83. In this study, we first added terrain indices including slope, aspect and elevation. These indices were computed from ALOS Global Digital Surface Model or \u201cALOS World 3D-30 m (AW2D30)\u201d84. Also, distance to rivers, coastlines, transport systems and buildings, and soil types were included in the covariate collections. The buildings and transport systems were generated from the OpenStreetMap, while soil types and river networks were extracted from the OpenDevelopmentMekong86.\n\nReference data\n\nReference data of 18 LULC categories (Supplementary Table S1) was created from field surveys, provincial LULC statistics, and visual interpretations. We conducted nationwide comprehensive surveys in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 to collect 3078, 2659, 10,550, 41,986 and 32,853 reference samples, respectively. Along with these ground-observed data, previous outdated LULC maps19,20,87, provincial LULC statistics and high-resolution satellite images available in the Google Earth were also considered. Herein, we generated approximately 9360 polygons of single homogeneous LULC types (Fig. 11) throughout the country for each year from 2015 to 2020. From these polygons, we extracted up to 120,000 reference pixels (points) for each of the years. Meanwhile, due to the non-availability of ground-truth data, reference data from 1990 to 2014 were collected using provincial LULC statistics, the natural-color images of Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI, Sentinel MSI, and high-resolution satellite images available in the Google Earth. For each year, we randomly extracted 1050 points per LULC category for validating the classification models and the others were used for training the classification model.\n\nThe reference data of the year 2020 were utilized not only for creating and validating the LULC map of the year 2020 but also for implementing the automatic training migration model from this reference year to any target years. The migration model is described in more detail in the following section.\n\nAutomatic training migration model\n\nTraining data is tremendously essential in mapping LULC; however, collecting sufficiently accurate training samples is challenging, especially for large-scale areas, long-term history analyses, and data-scarce environments such as Vietnam73. If training data are not collected consistently, it can result in misclassification or low accuracies74. Thus, it is paramount to propose a practical approach for training data collections.\n\nIn this study\u2060, we utilized an automatic model to migrate from the reference data of a reference year to target years. The method had three essential steps. First, we created a set of training data from a reference year (2020). Then, for each pixel, we computed its surface reflectance values from its corresponding Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI images of the reference year and target years. The surface reflectance values of six bands (Table 3) were utilized for the measurement of Euclidean distance (ED)75 and spectral angle distance (SAD)76. Finally, with the ED (Eq. 18) and SAD (Eq. 19), we distinguished changed pixels and unchanged pixels by running a trial and error model to determine thresholds. Although the thresholds can be estimated by analysts, the experimented thresholds of ED and SAD in this study was 0.05 and 0.95, respectively. These thresholds were successfully applied to migrate the training data of the year 2020 to target years. The unchanged pixels were preserved and utilized as training data for the target years.\n\n$$ED = \\sqrt {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left( {X_{i} - Y_{i} } \\right)^{2} }$$ (18)\n\n$$SAD = arccos\\left( {\\frac{{\\mathop \\sum\n\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} X_{i} Y_{i} }}{{\\sqrt {\\mathop \\sum\n\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left( {X_{i} } \\right)^{2} \\mathop \\sum\n\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left( {Y_{i} } \\right)^{2} } }}} \\right)$$ (19)\n\nwhere X is spectral signature vector of an image pixel in the reference year; Y is spectral signature vector of an image pixel in the target year; N is the number of image bands (N = 6).\n\nMachine learning modelling\n\nAfter completing the data preprocessing task, we generated covariate collections, including (1) optical-image-based covariates in dry seasons and (2) in wet seasons, and (3) SAR-based covariates in dry seasons and (4) in wet seasons. The ancillary information was also added to these covariate collections. It is worth noting that some of these covariates or features may not significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification performance while overabundant features can affect the performance speed or run out of computing capacity of the classification model. Hence, random forest algorithm77 was employed to estimate important features. We removed some less important features and kept essential features which were represented in Supplementary Table S2.\n\nFor classification, we applied a random forest algorithm for several reasons. First, it has previously been observed that the random forest algorithm can handle principal drawbacks that a single-tree-based method may face such as an over-fitting and non-optimal solution78. Also, the random forest shows the outperformance of its rivals such as fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Mahalanobis distance (MD), and spectral angle mapper (SAM)39.\n\nA new random-forest-based approach was developed in this study. Unlike the common use of single-time classification, for each pixel, we independently estimated prior probability values belonging to each of the specified land covers for each of the covariate collections. These prior probability values were then joined to create a set of posterior probability values. The largest value of the posterior probabilities corresponding to a specific land cover was utilized to label the predicted land cover. However, the predicted prior probability of a pixel, for example, p(C k ), might reach almost zero or zero because of \u2018No data\u2019 of that pixel at that covariate collection. If this occurs, the posterior probability of that pixel will be nearly zero or zero. That is, although the prior probability of most other collections equals 100% voting for a specified land cover, the probability product of this pixel might be almost zero, causing misclassification. Hence, the prior probability of a pixel corresponding to a particular land cover must not be extremely tiny. To this end, Eq. (20) was developed to adjust the prior probability values while posterior probability values were calculated as Eq. (21).\n\n$$p^{,} \\left( {C_{k} } \\right) = c*p\\left( {C_{k} } \\right) + \\frac{1 - c}{N}$$ (20)\n\n$$p_{c} \\left( {C_{k} } \\right) = \\mathop \\prod \\limits_{i = 1}^{I} p_{i}^{,} \\left( {C_{k} } \\right)$$ (21)\n\nwhere p\u2019(C k ) is the adjustment of prior probability value of a land cover C k ; c is a constant value (c = 0.7) which was evaluated by trial and error experiments in this study; N is the number of land cover categories (N = 18); p c (C k ) is the posterior probability value of category C k ; and I is the number of covariate collections (I = 4).\n\nThe random-forest-based model was performed using Scikit-Learn 0.22 and Python 3.8.5. Since the input data of multi-sensor image bands and covariates dramatically varied over the 30-year period, we could not optimize all the parameters of the random forest algorithm. The number of trees (n_estimators) in the forest and the size of the random subsets of features (max_features), however, are highly recommended to be adjusted77. Using RandomizedSearchCV in the Scikit-Learn, we found that n_estimators = 200 (trees) and max_features = 8 were optimal in this work. The other parameters were set as the default values.\n\nAccuracy assessment\n\nFollowing the wide-ranging recommendations of instruction manuals88,89, a statistic-based testing data set (Reference data section) was independently generated to estimate the accuracy of final LULC products. We utilized a stratified sampling (1050 points/LULC category) method and a confusion matrix to assess Vietnam-wide annual LULC products from 1990 to 2020. The matrix produced profound accuracy metrics, namely overall accuracy (OA), user accuracy (UA), standard error (SE), and kappa coefficient (KC). The uncertainty of accuracy was measured with a 95% confidence interval. These metrics are fully described in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nChange analysis\n\nThe analysis of changes in LULC is to measure the differences including spatio-temporal dynamic patterns, the magnitude, and rate of variations observed over the study period. First, we estimated the diversity of LULC within each 30-m pixel width by counting the number of times that LULC changes over 30 years (Fig. 1c). We then estimated the area of each LULC within a five-year interval from 1990 to 2020 to observe the trend of LULC change (Fig. 5). We also computed the percentage of net change (Eq. 22) and then rescaled the percentage to a rank between 0 and 100% to monitor the most dynamic LULC (Fig. 6). Finally, we employed a Sankey diagram to emphasize the major transfers of LULC90.\n\n$$p = \\left( {\\frac{{A_{t2} - A_{t1} }}{{A_{t1} *\\left( {t_{2} - t_{1} } \\right)}}} \\right)*100$$ (22)"}, {"url": "https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/zxxx_662805/202301/t20230105_11001064.html", "page_content": "5 January 2023, Beijing\n\n1.

Agroforestry encompasses a wide range of approaches and technologies for restoring degraded lands, thereby contributing to landscape restoration.\n\nSome agroforestry systems suitable for rehabilitating or restoring degraded landscapes affected by soil erosion, salinization, physical degradation, loss of nutrients and/or soil organic matter (SOM), waterlogging and mining are briefly discussed in the following sections.\n\n5.1 Agroforestry for Reduced Soil Erosion\n\nIn India, the sloping lands are planted with alley crops, such as Gliricidia sepium , Leucaena leucocephala , Cassia siamea , Morus alba , Pithecellobium dulce and Cajanus cajan , and fodder grasses as intercrops (Dagar 1995; Dagar et al. 2014a, b). Sajjapongse et al. (2002) developed a sustainable alley cropping model on sloping lands in China by planting day lily (Hemerocallis sp.), pears (Pyrus spp.) and Chinese prickly ash (Zanthoxylum spp.) as hedgerow crops and corn and soybean and sweet potato as alley crops in interspaces, whereas K application was emphasized in the balanced fertilizer treatments. They obtained 115% higher corn yield as compared to farmers\u2019 practice, and soil loss was greatly reduced by alley cropping, ranging from 60 to 80%. In North China, Ziziphus jujuba is intercropped with agricultural crops (Yin et al. 2008) and is an important pattern of agroforestry, which is distributed widely (Chang et al. 2017; Qiao et al. 2019). Agroforestry is the most effective way to restore the degraded lands on the Loess Plateau and to develop the poor local economy (Peng et al. 2009; Gao et al. 2013).\n\nSoil erosion due to deforestation and high rainfall is a serious problem in many parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in the hilly and mountainous landscapes. For most of the uplands in Southeast Asia susceptible to soil erosion, agroforestry practices, based on contour hedgerow intercropping, have been advocated as biological means to control soil erosion (Catacutan et al. 2017). In these systems, hedgerows of leguminous tree or shrub species are planted in single or double rows along contour lines of sloping fields. In Indonesia, Gliricidia sepium , Flemingia congesta , Erythrina spp., Senna spectabilis , and Calliandra calothyrsus are planted in hedgerows, whereas annual crops are planted between hedgerows. In the Philippines, Sloping Agricultural Land Technologies (SALT) is a diversified farming system, which can be considered as agroforestry since rows of permanent shrubs like coffee, cacao, citrus and other fruit trees are dispersed throughout the farm plot; the strips, not occupied by permanent crops, however, are planted alternately to cereals (e.g. corn, upland rice and sorghum) or other crops (e.g. sweet potato, melon, pineapple and castor bean) and legumes (e.g. soybean, green gram and peanut) (ECHO 2012). To control soil erosion, hedgerow intercropping agroforestry systems are composed of Leucaena leucocephala , Gliricidia sepium , and F. congesta planted as hedgerows, whereas agricultural crops are planted in between (Catacutan et al. 2017).\n\nIn the Morni Hills, north-east Haryana, the foothills of Siwaliks in northern India, some indigenous trees like Acacia catechu , Cassia fistula, Emblica officinalis , Ziziphus mauritiana , Lannea coromandelica and Terminalia chebula are retained as scattered trees and along the bunds in the terraced cropping systems (Fig. 2.7) to control soil erosion as well as to provide non-timber forest produce to the local community (Gupta and Kumar 2014).\n\nFig. 2.7 A view of the terraced crop fields with significant tree components to control soil erosion in Morni Hills, foot hills of Siwaliks in northern India (Photo courtesy of SR Gupta) Full size image\n\nIn arid and semi-arid regions, all along the rivers and their tributaries, the soil is mostly alluvial and prone to soil erosion, and a net of gullies and deep ravines is formed. The phenomenon is more common along Indian rivers where about four million ha fall under ravines. Rehabilitation of ravine lands involves treatment of table and marginal lands (contributing runoff to the gullies) on watershed basis. It requires an integrated approach of using gullies according to land capability classes, soil and water conservation measures and putting land under permanent vegetation cover involving afforestation or agroforestry, horticulture, pasture and energy plantations (Chaturvedi et al. 2014; Dagar 2018a, b). Protection from grazing and afforestation with suitable species are the most effective measures for checking soil erosion and consequently ravine formation.\n\nDagar and Singh (2018) have recently compiled research carried out globally on greening of eroded habitats for livelihood and environmental security. In this compilation, Rodrigues (2018) reported the results of long-term experimentation in Brazil using low-cost vegetative, edaphic and mechanical techniques for gully rehabilitation after protecting the site from biotic interferences. The use of palisades to contain sediment exit was found effective which retained much of the sediment produced on the gully wall. Planting of shrub and herbaceous species also helped in generating cover; however, the ecological succession was underway. Guerra et al. (2018) gave an illustrated account of gully erosion and land degradation in five regions of Brazil, which affect socio-economic infrastructure of both urban and rural areas. Lal (2018) emphasized that medium and shallow ravines can be bulldozed for agricultural forestry land use and carbon sequestration in soil and biomass, with a technical potential of carbon sequestration of 2.6\u20135.3 TgC year\u22121, as well as generating another income stream for farmers (US$300\u2013640 million year\u22121) and promoting the adoption of best management practices for both preventive and control measures. Dagar (2018a, b) while explaining formation, extent, ecology, biodiversity and control measures for ravine lands concluded that rehabilitation of these lands requires an integrated approach of using appropriate site-specific soil and water conservation measures and putting land under vegetation cover through afforestation, horticulture (mainly fruit trees), pasture and energy plantations depending upon the suitability class following watershed approach. Silvopastoral and fruit-based agroforestry systems involving species (including medicinal plants) of dry areas are the most appropriate options for rehabilitation of ravine lands.\n\n5.2 Agroforestry for Degraded Drylands\n\nGLASSOD database indicates that at world level, 349.6 million ha of land in arid zone are affected by light to moderate degree of soil degradation and 42.8 million ha by strong to extreme. Sand dunes are dominant land formation of principal hot arid zone (Africa accounts for 46.1% followed by Asia 35.5% and the rest 19.4% spread over in Australia and North America). The hot Indian arid zone (Thar Desert) is spread in 31.7 million ha. More than 34% (11 million ha) of the total area of Indian hot arid region is covered by drifting or semi-stabilized sand dunes, sometimes up to 100 m in height; however, their intensity varies from place to place. The most important measures for sand dune stabilization are covering the area under trees and providing a surface cover of grasses followed by their protection against biotic interference.\n\nBesides fixing the sand dunes, it is important to check the movement of loose sand by applying windbreaks and mulch. Locally available brushwoods like Leptadenia pyrotechnica , Calligonum polygonoides (now rare due to over-exploitation), Ziziphus nummularia and Aerva tomentosa and grasses like Cenchrus ciliaris , C. setigerus , Lasiurus sindicus , Panicum turgidum and Saccharum munja are being used frequently. In arid regions, Prosopis cineraria-based silvopastoral system has been found most suitable for sand dune stabilization in Thar Desert of Indian subcontinent. Acacia tortilis , A. senegal , A. nilotica , Capparis decidua , Tecomella undulata, Colophospermum mopane , Calligonum polygonoides , Salvadora oleoides , Ziziphus nummularia , Carissa carandas and Haloxylon salicornicum among woody species and Cenchrus ciliaris ; C. biflorus ; C. setigerus ; Lasiurus sindicus ; Dactyloctenium sindicum ; species of Aristida, Sporobolus, Eragrostis and Panicum and many others among grasses are found useful for these habitats. Soni et al. (2016) have designated the silvopastoral systems in arid regions as lifeline for the poor stakeholders of the region. The vegetation for sand dune stabilization is highly drought tolerant with deep root system capable of extracting moisture from lower soil depths.\n\nMany dry regions in India have shallow soil, particularly in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Rajasthan and Kutchh area of Gujarat. These areas have soil depth of 30\u201345 cm, and below this depth, there lies a calcareous kankar pan, which needs to be broken for tree plantations. A few tree species suitable for plantation include Acacia senegal , A. salicina, A. jacquemontii , P. juliflora, Hardwickia pinnata , Capparis decidua , Grewia tenax, Ziziphus nummularia , Holoptelea integrifolia and Dichrostachys nutans . Tewari et al. (2014) gave an illustrative account for livelihood improvement and climate change adaptations through agroforestry in hot arid environments of India.\n\nTrees-based traditional cropping systems with Prosopis cineraria , Ziziphus nummularia , Z. mauritiana , Tecomella undulata, Cassia siamea , Acacia tortilis and A. nilotica play an important role in production system in hot arid regions of India (Dagar and Tewari 2017). These tree species act as shelterbelt for associated crops and also improve soil health. Prosopis cineraria (as is Faidherbia albida in Africa) is well-known for its role in improving crop productivity as well as conservation and amelioration of soil. Tewari et al. (2014) observed increase in available nutrients in association with trees proving that trees improve the soil health in arid ecologies.\n\nTewari et al. (2016) studied the traditional agroforestry systems in cold desert of Leh-Ladakh and observed that the land-based economy of these cold arid tracts comprised a crops-trees/shrubs-livestock-human continuum. A general view (Fig. 2.8) of cold desert of Leh region in India shows the land-use pattern of the area. The traditional agroforestry system of this region has been classified as among the possible \u201cGlobally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)\u201d by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2008).\n\nFig. 2.8 General view of the cold desert and the agricultural landscape of Leh region in India (Photo courtesy of Pulkit Dagar) Full size image\n\nThe agricultural soils have been created artificially and maintained over centuries by repeated additions of manure, part of a continuous (re)cycling process of all agricultural products. This practice compensates the loss of organic matter due to erosion and the uptake of mineral nutrients by plants. Both private and community land support systems were fairly rich in the density of trees/shrubs and provide ample amount of wood for fuel and timber as well as tree leaves/tender twigs for livestock fodder. The maximum area was under potato followed by a fodder crop alfalfa. Wheat and barley, major staple crops, are sown only in one-fourth of total cultivable land. In all crops of the village, manure was the major input. Most of the trees and shrubs are found growing as boundary plantations, and Populus balsamifera , P. ciliata, Salix alba , S. daphnoides, S. sclerophylla , Hippophae rhamnoides , Rosa eglanteria or Rosa rubiginosa and R. webbiana are prominent species. Among fruit trees, Malus pumila and Prunus armeniaca are prominent. Both private and community land support systems are providing a large amount of energy in terms of fuel and leaf fodder supply, which indicates good health of these two components of the traditional agroforestry system in the cold desert of this region.\n\nAgroforestry practices are major features of the land-use systems in the drylands of Eastern and Central Africa (Jama and Zeila 2005). Trees are used for a variety of purposes in both cropped lands and in livestock grazing systems. There are several traditional agroforestry systems in Tanzania that have been in practice for hundreds of years (Kitalyi et al. 2010). These traditional systems include the Chagga homegardens, the related Mara region homegardens known as Obohochere and the traditional Wasukuma silvopastoral system called Ngitili. These traditional systems make use of multilayered systems with a mixture of annual and perennial plants, which imitate natural ecosystems. The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF ) in collaboration with national research institutions and other agencies has developed several technologies, which now benefit thousands of farmers in Shinyanga and Tabora regions of Tanzania (Kitalyi et al. 2010). Proven technologies include fertilizer trees and biomass transfer for soil fertility improvement, rotational woodlots, indigenous and exotic trees for food and health security, trees for livestock feed and trees for reclamation and enrichment of traditional land-use systems. In Tanzania, since the mid-1980s, local villages have restored 500,000 ha of woodlands within a five million ha landscape in the Shinyanga District, protecting the land and providing valuable non-timber forest products to local communities (www.wri.org/restorationdiagnostic, accessed on 11-06-2019). In the Hararghe highlands of eastern Ethiopia and other areas across SSA, F. albida is traditionally grown as a permanent tree crop with cereals, vegetables and coffee as under crops (Poschen 1986; Teketay and Tegineh 1991a, b; Mokgolodi et al. 2011).\n\nFor smallholder farmers in the East African region, Wekesa and J\u00f6nsson (2014) discussed common agroforestry practices, such as alley cropping, trees with perennial crops, windbreaks or shelter, contour trees, homegardens, shade trees and improved fallows. Silvopasture combines trees and livestock, which could involve planting of fodder trees, tree-based understory fodder production, hay making and/or grazing and cover crops for orchard floor management. Trees with a mix of crops and livestock constitute the agrisilvopastoral systems. Aquasilviculture is an agroforestry system that involves planting and/or maintaining belts of trees and shrubs in areas bordering lakes, streams, rivers and wetlands containing fish (Wekesa and J\u00f6nsson 2014).\n\nFaidherbia albida trees are unique characteristics of the Sudano-Sahelian region of SSA, forming \u201cparklands\u201d (Bayala et al. 2014). In \u201cparklands,\u201d scattered mature trees constitute an integral component of crop and livestock production landscapes. Parklands play an important role in providing soil cover that reduces erosion and buffers the impacts of climate change. Rural communities in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Senegal value more than 115 indigenous tree species for the livelihood benefits of their products and services (Faye et al. 2011). The parklands are the most common and improved agroforestry practices in these countries and combine crops, grasses, trees and livestock. Farmers maintain several indigenous tree species in parklands for food (e.g. Adansonia digitata , Parkia biglobosa , Vitellaria paradoxa , Ziziphus mauritiana ); dry season fodder (e.g. Balanites roxburghii , F. albida , Pterocarpus erinaceus ); wood for fuel, construction, household and farm implements (e.g. B. roxburghii , Combretum glutinosum , Guiera senegalensis , Prosopis africana ); medicines; and environmental services such as shade, soil fertility improvement and soil/water conservation (Leakey 2012). The sale of these products contributes 25\u201375% of annual household revenue in Mali (Faye et al. 2011), with some having international market.\n\nAccording to a study from the Sahel, the parklands buffer climate risk and sustain agricultural production (Bayala et al. 2014), indicating their importance under expected future climate change (Kassie et al. 2014). The parklands deliver multiple benefits, including various provisioning services and regulating ecosystem services, like soil nutrient replenishment, moisture conservation, carbon sequestration and soil erosion control (Sinare and Gordon 2015; Sida et al. 2018). In the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia, scattered F. albida trees have been reported to improve wheat productivity significantly by buffering the crop against extreme temperature and facilitating increased water use efficiency (Sida et al. 2018).\n\nProsopis cineraria (as is Faidherbia albida in Africa) is well-known for its role in improving crop productivity as well as conservation and amelioration of soil. The Tree Growers\u2019 Co-operatives (Gujarat, India) promoted agroforestry on farmlands and wastelands by using fast-growing trees and tree-based oilseed crops. Tree-based traditional cropping systems are characterized with Prosopis cineraria , Acacia leucophloea , Acacia nilotica and Acacia senegal in semi-arid regions of District Mahendragarh, southern Haryana, India (Fig. 2.9); Prosopis cineraria with pearl millet is a common traditional agrosilviculture system of southern Haryana, India (Fig. 2.10a and b) and prevalent in the arid region Rajasthan.\n\nFig. 2.9 Tree-based traditional cropping systems with scattered trees of Prosopis cineraria , Acacia leucophloea , Acacia nilotica and Acacia senegal in a semi-arid region of District Mahendragarh, southern Haryana, India (Photo courtesy of Dr. Vikram Singh) Full size image\n\nFig. 2.10 (a) Tree-based traditional system of Prosopis cineraria with pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides at growing stage) in a semi-arid region of southern Haryana, India (Photo courtesy of Dr. Vikram Singh). (b) Tree-based traditional system of Prosopis cineraria with pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides at maturity) in a semi-arid region of southern Haryana, India (Photo courtesy of Dr. Vikram Singh) Full size image\n\n5.3 Agroforestry Systems for Acid Soils\n\nAcid soils occupy approximately 30% of the world\u2019s total land area (Zheng 2010), and it has been estimated that over 50% of the world\u2019s potential arable lands are acidic (von Uexkull and Mutert 1995). Aluminium (Al) in these soils is solubilized into ionic forms, especially when the soil pH falls to lower than 5. These ionic forms of Al have been shown to be very toxic to plants, initially causing inhibition of root elongation by destroying the cell structure. On the other hand, phosphorus (P) is easily fixed by clay minerals that are rich in acid soils, including various iron oxides and kaolinite, and hence rendering it unavailable for root uptake. Thus, increased solubility and toxicity of Al, Mn and Fe; deficiency of Ca and Mg; reduced availability of P and Mo; and reduced microbial activity with decreasing pH are the characteristic features and constraints for crop production in these soils. In India, acid soils cover an area of about 90 million ha (Sharma and Sarkar 2005), out of which about 7% are strongly acidic (pH < 4.5); about 28% are moderately acidic (pH 4.5\u20135.5), and rest 65% are slightly acidic (pH 5.5\u20136.5).\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, a large part of land consists of tropical forests with acid, infertile soils that are classified as oxisols and ultisols; a majority of these acid soils experience shifting cultivation or extensive grazing by beef cattle (Benites 1990). For well-drained acid soils of the humid tropics, some successful agroforestry option could be tree plantations, fruit tree-based production systems with intercropping, alley cropping and improved fallows (Benites 1990).\n\nThe majority of the soils in the humid tropics are acid and infertile (Szott et al. 1991). Agroforestry systems are the most appropriate forms of sustainable, productive management of soils in the humid tropics because perennial woody vegetation can recycle nutrients, maintain soil organic matter and protect the soil from surface erosion and runoff (Nair 1984). Based on investigations at Yurimaguas, Peru, Szott et al. (1991) indicated that alley cropping, managed fallows and fruit crop systems are potentially useful agroforestry systems for acid, infertile soils in the humid tropics as alternatives to or improvements of shifting cultivation. Several acid-tolerant, fast-growing, coppicing hedgerow species have been identified: Inga edulis , Erythrina sp., Cassia reticulata and Gliricidia sepium . Fruit crop production systems established with a low-input upland rice-cowpea rotation and followed by a legume cover crop seem highly promising for the region and as a way to move from shifting cultivation to settled farming.\n\nIn India about, 6.5 Mha land area is covered by strongly acid soils (pH < 5.5), mostly in states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The acid soils suffer due to lack of calcium and magnesium and in some cases due to aluminium and iron toxicity. In north-eastern states of India, more than 90% of the land is affected by soil acidity of varying degrees which have restricted the crop choice in more than 70% of gross cropped area to cereals mainly the rice (Jehangir et al. 2013). In north-eastern Himalaya regions, alder (Alnus nepalensis )-based agroforestry systems involving arable and high-value crops like cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) , large cardamom (Amomum subulatum) , pineapple (Ananas sativum ), many fruit trees and tuber crops like turmeric, ginger, Colocasia and taros make successful and sustainable agroforestry systems, which besides providing good economic yields also ameliorate soil by fixing nitrogen and organic matter.\n\n5.4 Agroforestry for Salt-Affected and Waterlogged Soils\n\nSalinity-afflicted landscapes, which now occupy nearly a billion ha globally (about 7% of land area) (Wicke et al. 2011), originated as a result of either natural geological phenomena or anthropogenic factors (secondary salinization). The excessive irrigation in agriculture has, mainly, contributed to the increasing problems of secondary salinization, alkalization and waterlogging (Szabolcs 1994; Rengasamy 2006; Qadir et al. 2007; Dagar and Minhas 2016). During the past two decades, interesting research and development work has been carried out on reclamation forestry on salt-affected landscapes. Technologies of tree plantation have been evolved, and many salt-tolerant species have been evaluated and identified, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and Australia. Prominent agroforestry systems for rehabilitating salt-affected lands in India, Central Asia and Western Australia include agrisilvicultural, silvopastoral and fruit-based agroforestry systems, trees for bio-drainage, energy plantations, halophytic plants to remediate soil and agroforestry for dryland salinity (Wicke et al. 2013; Gupta and Dagar 2016a, b; Dagar and Minhas 2016). To address the interest of arid and semi-arid regions to improve bio-saline agriculture, scientists have contributed towards developing technologies of growing halophytes in saline habitats and with use of saline water for irrigation (Dagar and Minhas 2016). This has been achieved through domestication and sustainable use of halophytic plants for food, fodder, medicine and reclamation purposes.\n\n5.5 Revegetation and Rehabilitation of Mine Spoils\n\nThe major purposes of revegetating a mining site are to control sediment erosion and transport, enhance habitat and provide viable habitats for species that are in decline. The mining for various purposes leads to deterioration of the site to the extent that no biomass can be produced at the mined site. The process of vegetation development on these sites begins naturally through colonization by the species found in surrounding areas. Artificial seeding of fast-growing native grasses may accelerate development of vegetation, improve soil fertility and moisture retaining capacity, stabilize the slopes and encourage natural invasion of native tree and shrub saplings. Plantation of mixed stress-tolerant tree species may be undertaken after 2\u20133 years of growing grasses. Tree plantations can play an important role in restoring productivity, ecosystem stability and biological diversity of degraded areas due to mining (Singh et al. 2002). On mine spoils of the Singrauli coal field in Madhya Pradesh, India, Albizia lebbeck and A. procera have shown good restoration potential (Singh et al. 2004).\n\nIn Amarkantak region of India, successful attempts were made to rehabilitate bauxite mined area by planting Eucalyptus camaldulensis , Grevillea pteridifolia , Pinus caribaea and Acacia auriculiformis . Dhyani et al. (2007) reviewed some case studies of afforestation of mine wastelands in India, while Chaturvedi et al. (2014) reported different plant species suitable for revegetation of different types of mine spoils. The studies on mine spoils show that ground seeding of the mine spoils with suitable tree and grass species in combination with NPK fertilization can promote plant growth and increase biomass production (Chaturvedi and Singh 2017).\n\nDuring the last two decades, considerable progress has been made on post-mining landscape restoration in Africa using physical, chemical and biological techniques (Festin et al. 2019). The various biological methods have shown encouraging results identifying plant species suitable for phytoremediation, using organic amendments to promote passive restoration of mine wastelands and studying growth response of planted species. Festin et al. (2019) have indicated some successful cases of large-scale post-mining restoration practices in Africa, which include restoration of limestone quarries in Kenya, sand mining tailings in South Africa and gold mine wasteland in Ghana (Siachoono 2010; Cooke and Johnson 2002; Tetteh et al. 2015a, b). In Kenya, large-scale ecosystem restoration on exhausted quarries at Haller Park, Bamburi, was started in 1971 by planting 26 tree species on 2 km2 areas of open quarries (Siachoono 2010). By applying the topsoil application method to facilitate natural succession and establishment of indigenous dune forest, over 400 ha non-toxic sand tailings have been reclaimed since 1978 in South Africa (Cooke and Johnson 2002). A combination of physical, chemical and biological methods has been carried out to restore gold mine wasteland by AngloGold Ashanti at the Iduapriem mine at Tarkwa, Ghana (Tetteh et al. 2015a, b).\n\n5.6 Silvopastoral Systems on Degraded Lands\n\nSilvopastoral systems (SPS) are agroforestry arrangements that purposely combine fodder plants, such as grasses and leguminous herbs, with shrubs and trees for animal nutrition and complementary uses (Murgueitio et al. 2011). Silvopastoral systems are part of traditional farming systems throughout Latin America and the Caribbean for the various ecological benefits, including sustainability.\n\nThe main SPS comprises (1) scattered trees in pasturelands; (2) timber plantations with livestock grazing areas; (3) pastures between tree alleys, windbreaks, live fences and fodder banks with shrubs; and (4) intensive silvopastoral systems (Murgueitio et al. 2011; Char\u00e1 et al. 2018). Agroforestry can diversify and increase agricultural production while also providing land users with other economic, social and environmental benefits. Char\u00e1 et al. (2018) have discussed the main characteristics and advantages of silvopastoral systems regarding production and benefits for the environment and climate and their contribution to the SDGs on the basis of ten case studies in diverse contexts in Colombia, Mexico and Argentina, with a focus on land productivity, meat and milk production and economic performance at the farm level.\n\nVarsha et al. (2019) have studied different fodder production systems in a warm humid climate of southern India. The systems were composed of 2-year-old silvopastoral systems and monoculture plots of fodder grass, tree and herbaceous legume and one control plot with natural grass vegetation for 2 years. These researchers reported that carbon stocks were significantly higher for mulberry (Morus alba) monoculture (174.84 Mg ha\u22121), followed by tier two hybrid Napier (Pennisetum typhoides \u00d7 P. purpureum) + mulberry (147.67 Mg C ha\u22121), which accumulated 11\u201313% more carbon than tier three silvopasture and hybrid Napier monoculture systems (Varsha et al. 2019)."}, {"url": "https://www.bia.gov/bia", "page_content": "Mission Statement\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 mission is to enhance the quality of life, to promote economic opportunity, and to carry out the responsibility to protect and improve the trust assets of American Indians, Indian tribes and Alaska Natives.\n\nHistory of BIA\n\nSince its inception in 1824, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been both a witness to and a principal player in the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. The BIA has changed dramatically over the past 185 years, evolving as Federal policies designed to subjugate and assimilate American Indians and Alaska Natives have changed to policies that promote Indian self-determination.\n\nFor almost 200 years, dating back to the role it played in negotiating treaty agreements between the United States and tribes in the late 18th and 19th centuries, the BIA has embodied the trust and government-to-government relationships between the U.S. and the Federally recognized tribes. Over the years, the BIA has been involved in the implementation of Federal laws that have directly affected all Americans. The General Allotment Act of 1887 opened tribal lands west of the Mississippi to non-Indian settlers, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted American Indians and Alaska Natives U.S. citizenship and the right to vote, and the New Deal and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 established modern tribal governments. The World War II period of relocation and the post-War termination era of the 1950s led to the activism of the 1960s and 1970s that saw the takeover of the BIA\u2019s headquarters and resulted in the creation of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994 along with the Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act have fundamentally changed how the Federal Government and the tribes conduct business with each other.\n\nIn the early years of the United States, Indian affairs were governed by the Continental Congress, which in 1775 created a Committee on Indian Affairs headed by Benjamin Franklin. Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution describes Congress's powers over Indian affairs: \"To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.\" The BIA, one of the oldest bureaus in the Federal government, was administratively established by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun on March 11, 1824, to oversee and carry out the Federal government's trade and treaty relations with the tribes. Congress gave the BIA statutory authority by the act of July 9, 1832 (4 Stat. 564, chap. 174). In 1849, the BIA was transferred to the newly created U.S. Department of the Interior. For years thereafter, the Bureau was known variously as the Indian office, the Indian bureau, the Indian department, and the Indian Service. The Interior Department formally adopted the name \u201cBureau of Indian Affairs\u201d for the agency on September 17, 1947.\n\nSince 1824, there have been 45 Commissioners of Indian Affairs, of whom six have been American Indian or Alaska Native: Ely S. Parker, Seneca (1869-1871); Robert L. Bennett, Oneida (1966-1969); Louis R. Bruce, Mohawk-Oglala Sioux (1969-1973); Morris Thompson, Athabascan (1973-1976); Benjamin Reifel, Sioux (1976-1977); and William E. Hallett, Red Lake Chippewa (1979-1981). From 1981 to 2003, the title \"Deputy Commissioner\" was used to denote the head of the BIA. In 2003, after a major reorganization of the BIA, the title was administratively changed to \"Director,\" which is still in use today. The first BIA Director was Terrance Virden, followed by Brian Pogue and Patrick Ragsdale (2005-2007). Then Jerold L. \"Jerry\" Gidner, Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa served from (2007-2010). Michael Black, Oglala Lakota Sioux, served as Director from 2010 to November, 2016. Bruce Loudermilk, a citizen of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, served as Director from November 2016 to September 2017. Director Bryan Rice, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma was appointed in October of 2017. On April 28, 2019, the position was then filled by Darryl LaCounte, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota.\n\nWilliam Hallett was the last to serve as BIA Commissioner following the establishment of the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs position within the Interior Department in 1977. Since then, 12 individuals, all American Indians, have been confirmed by the United States Senate for the post: Forrest J. Gerard, Blackfeet (1977-1980); Thomas W. Fredericks, Mandan-Hidatsa (1981); Kenneth L. Smith, Wasco (1981-1984); Ross O. Swimmer, Cherokee Nation (1985-1989); Dr. Eddie F. Brown, Tohono O\u2019odham-Yaqui (1989-1993); Ada E. Deer, Menominee (1993-1997); Kevin Gover, Pawnee (1997-2001); Neal A. McCaleb, Chickasaw Nation (2001-2002); David W. Anderson, Lac Courte Oreilles Chippewa-Choctaw (2004-2005); and Carl J. Artman, Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin (2007-2008); Larry Echo Hawk, Pawnee (2009-2012); Kevin K. Washburn, Chickasaw Nation (2012-2016).Tara Katuk Mac Lean Sweeney, Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government/I\u00f1upiat Community of the Arctic Slope (2018-2021). Bryan Newland, Bay Mills Indian Community (2021-Current).\n\nThe past thirty years have also seen the largest increase in the number of American Indian and Alaska Native people working for the BIA. Currently, most of its employees are American Indian or Alaska Native, representing a number larger than at any time in its history. In keeping with the authorities and responsibilities granted under the Snyder Act of 1921 and other Federal laws, regulations, and treaties, BIA employees across the country work with tribal governments in the administration of law enforcement and justice; agricultural and economic development; tribal governance; and natural resources management programs in order to enhance the quality of life in tribal communities.\n\nThe BIA carries out its core mission to serve 574 Federally recognized tribes through four offices. The Office of Indian Services operates the BIA's general assistance, disaster relief, Indian child welfare, tribal government, Indian Self-Determination, and reservation roads programs. The Office of Justice Services directly operates or funds law enforcement, tribal courts, and detention facilities on Federal Indian lands. The Office of Trust Services works with tribes and individual American Indians and Alaska Natives in the management of their trust lands, assets, and resources. Finally, the Office of Field Operations oversees 12 regional offices and 83 agencies which carry out the mission of the Bureau at the tribal level.\n\nThe BIA's responsibilities once included providing health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. In 1954, that function was legislatively transferred to the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now known as the Department of Health and Human Services, where it has remained to this day as the Indian Health Service (IHS). For information about the U.S. Indian Health Service, visit www.ihs.gov.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs is a rarity among Federal agencies. With roots reaching back to the Continental Congress, the BIA is almost as old as the United States itself. As Federal policy has changed from notions of subjugating and assimilating American Indians and Alaska Natives, so the BIA\u2019s mission has changed as well. Its role now is as a partner with tribes to help them achieve their goals for self-determination while also maintaining its responsibilities under the Federal-Tribal trust and government-to-government relationships."}, {"url": "https://www.nsw.gov.au/nsw-government/ministers", "page_content": "Special Minister of State\n\nMinister for Roads\n\nMinister for the Arts\n\nMinister for Music and the Night-time Economy\n\nMinister for Jobs and Tourism\n\nDeputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/john-diefenbaker", "page_content": "Education and Early Career\n\nIn 1903, Diefenbaker and his family moved to the Fort Carlton region of what is now Saskatchewan. He attended schools in several Prairie communities before his family moved to Saskatoon in 1910. He attended the University of Saskatchewan. After serving in the army during the First World War, he completed his law degree and articles. He was called to the Saskatchewan Bar in 1919. His first law office was in Wakaw, Saskatchewan. He moved to the larger northern centre of Prince Albert in 1924.\n\nA Growing Reputation\n\nDiefenbaker\u2019s path to the prime minister\u2019s office was long. He ran federally for Prince Albert in 1925 and 1926; provincially in 1929 and 1938; and for mayor of Prince Albert in 1933. He lost each time. He built a growing reputation as an able defence lawyer and was named King's Counsel in 1929. But he held firmly to the belief that his future lay in politics. In 1936, he became leader of the Saskatchewan Conservative Party, only to preside over the party's defeat in the 1938 election when they won no seats. He continued to preach his own brand of Conservative politics. He visited many Saskatchewan communities with his wife, Edna Mae Brower. He built the party\u2019s organization and encouraged his colleagues to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d\n\nFederal Politics\n\nIn June 1939, Diefenbaker was nominated for the federal riding of Lake Centre. In March 1940, he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament. The skills he had refined during his legal career served him well on the Opposition backbenches. He gained a wide reputation as an astute questioner of government actions. He was re-elected for Lake Centre in 1945 and 1949. However, he suffered a great personal loss in 1951 when his wife died of acute leukemia.\n\nNot long before his wife\u2019s death, Diefenbaker was approached by the father of Jack Atherton; a railway telegrapher accused of causing a crash at Canoe River, British Columbia. In 1950, two trains had collided head-on. Four locomotive crew members and 17 soldiers bound for Korea were killed. Upon his sick wife\u2019s urging, Diefenbaker agreed to represent the defendant, who had grown up in his riding. In R. v. Atherton (known as the Canoe River case), Diefenbaker successfully defended Atherton, who was found not guilty of manslaughter. The case was followed nationwide and the acquittal celebrated in the press. In Rogue Tory: The Life and Legend of John G. Diefenbaker, biographer Denis Smith referred to the case as \u201cone of his major political assets.\u201d\n\nDiefenbaker was nominated as the Progressive Conservative candidate for Prince Albert in the 1953 election. His campaign and its slogan \u2014 \u201cNot a partisan cry, but a national need\u201d \u2014 captured the imagination of Prince Albert voters. Diefenbaker was elected. That same year, he married Olive Freeman Palmer. She gave up her own highly successful career in the Ontario Department of Education. Olive Diefenbaker was closely associated with her husband\u2019s political career for the rest of her life.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nIn 1956, Diefenbaker was chosen to succeed George Drew, who had resigned as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. The following year, Diefenbaker led his party to an upset victory over the Liberals and Louis Saint-Laurent. They formed a minority government; the first Conservative government since that of R.B. Bennett. Diefenbaker was backed by a cabinet that included Davie Fulton, Donald Fleming, George Hees, G.R. Pearkes, Douglas Harkness, Ellen Fairclough, L\u00e9on Balcer and Gordon Churchill. Diefenbaker consolidated his position in March 1958 when the electorate returned his government with a huge majority of 208 seats; the highest number held by a single party in Canada to that time. (See Elections of 1957 and 1958.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Diefenbaker Vision\n\nThe Diefenbaker era featured the personality and the style of the \u201cman from Prince Albert.\u201d Several things that are now taken for granted were initiated during his administration. Wheat sales to China and agricultural reform revitalized western agriculture.\n\nDiefenbaker\u2019s determination to guarantee civil rights for all led in 1960 to the Canadian Bill of Rights and to extending the federal vote to First Nations peoples in Canada. (Prior to that point, the Indian Act generally required First Nations peoples to give up their treaty rights in order to be \u201cenfranchised.\u201d) Diefenbaker also nominated James Gladstone, a member of the Blood nation in Alberta, to become the first Indigenous member of the Senate. He also appointed Canada\u2019s first female cabinet minister, Ellen Fairclough.\n\nThe Diefenbaker government worked under the philosophical umbrella of \u201csocial justice.\u201d It restructured programs to provide aid to those in need. In addition to the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Development Act (1961), his government also established a Royal Commission on Health Services (1961); as well as the National Productivity Council (1963) \u2014 later named the Economic Council of Canada. The \u201cnorthern vision\u201d that figured so prominently in the rhetoric of the 1957 and 1958 elections increased public awareness of the Far North. It also led to some economic development in that region.\n\nA tour of the Commonwealth in 1958 reinforced Diefenbaker\u2019s belief in the value of that organization and other international bodies. It also helped to define his role as a supporter of the non-White Commonwealth. Diefenbaker played a key role in the 1961 anti-apartheid statement that contributed to South Africa\u2019s withdrawal from the Commonwealth.\n\nAn Indecisive Image\n\nDuring the 1962 election, the Liberals exploited the economic crisis (the Canadian dollar had dropped to 92.5 cents US); the controversial 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow; and the debate over nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, including charges against Diefenbaker of anti-Americanism. ( See Bomarc Missile Crisis.) The Diefenbaker government was reduced to a minority.\n\nIn the fall of 1962, Diefenbaker\u2019s popularity was severely hampered by his response to the Cuban missile crisis. His hesitant response to the crisis reflected his desire to preserve the independence of Canada\u2019s foreign policy. The delay, however, was widely criticized in Canada. It led to a growing perception that the Diefenbaker government was indecisive. Diefenbaker\u2019s response worsened already tense relations with the Kennedy administration. It also fuelled controversy and confusion in Canada over the country\u2019s policy on nuclear weapons. In the wake of the crisis, the US accused the Diefenbaker government of lying and avoiding its military duties.\n\nDiefenbaker\u2019s Progressive Conservatives lost to Lester B. Pearson and the Liberal Party in the election on 5 February 1963. Diefenbaker, travelling the country by train, almost won the election in what was possibly the most spectacular one-man political campaign in Canadian history.\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nAs leader of the Opposition, Diefenbaker delighted in questioning Prime Minister Lester Pearson\u2019s government to such an extent that the House\u2019s business slowed considerably. He also argued vigorously (if unsuccessfully) against Pearson\u2019s proposal for a new Canadian flag. (See The Great Flag Debate.) Diefenbaker also led the attack on the Liberals during the scandals of 1965. In turn, the Liberals criticized Diefenbaker for his role in the Munsinger Affair.\n\nLate Career and Legacy\n\nDespite the electoral setbacks and a party deeply split over the question of his continuing leadership, Diefenbaker refused to resign. He put up a spirited defence at the 1967 leadership convention, where Robert Stanfield was chosen as the new leader. Diefenbaker remained in politics under Stanfield and later Joe Clark. In May 1979, he won a seat for the 13th time but died only a few months later. Thousands of mourners paid their respects during the elaborate funeral (all planned by Diefenbaker himself); it included a state funeral in Ottawa, a final train journey across Canada, and burial in Saskatoon beside the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker Centre at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nSee also Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War Museum.\n\n\n\n"}], "John Les served as Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General from 2005 to 2009.": [{"url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/john-les-a-timeline-1.286361", "page_content": "Two Chilliwack properties, two numbered companies, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and one former solicitor-general.\n\nJohn Les, former mayor of Chilliwack, resigned on Friday after it was revealed he was under investigation in connection to land deals in Chilliwack.\n\nHere's a timeline of some of those land deals so you can see how it all ties together."}, {"url": "https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/legacy/web/mla/38thparl/les.htm", "page_content": "38th Parliament Members\n\nat dissolution on April 14, 2009\n\nMLA: John Les Chilliwack-Sumas Elected: 2001, 2005 BRITISH COLUMBIA LIBERAL PARTY\n\nJohn Les was first elected to represent the riding of Chilliwack-Sumas in 2001 and re-elected in 2005.

It is built on a vision of all British Columbians working together to make our province the safest place to live in Canada and guided by innovative planning, leading-edge technology and effective service delivery.\n\nWe've developed and launched a number of successful initiatives over the past years. Many, like B.C.'s fight against crystal meth, are leading the country in terms of innovation and research-led practice. In the coming years, we will continue to draw on research and partner agencies to study methods of combating marijuana grow ops, auto theft and impaired driving.\n\nThe effective use of technology is also at the heart of programs on which the Ministry is focused. British Columbia is the first province to use Automatic Licence Plate Recognition to target traffic violators, prohibited drivers and car thieves. And a state-of-the-art online data sharing system among police \u2014 PRIME \u2014 is continuing to enhance public and officer safety across the province. Together with extra officers on the street and more community-based public safety programs, these initiatives are helping us keep pace with the changing face of crime.\n\nWe know there are challenges ahead. Organized crime is increasingly crossing community, provincial and national boundaries and manifesting in criminal activity like human trafficking, illegal gaming, identity theft, Internet fraud and luring. Large-scale investigations are growing and the criminal justice system continues to deal with a disproportionate number of individuals affected by serious mental illness or developmental disability. In response, the Ministry is focusing on integration of police services and partnerships with other ministries to advance an understanding of the root causes of criminal behaviour.\n\nIntegration is also fundamental to our disaster response approach. With the creation of Emergency Management British Columbia, we will better coordinate prevention, preparedness, response and recovery among all levels of government and throughout British Columbia.\n\nWe also remain committed to enhancing our strong and effective legislative and regulatory response to protecting children and consumers, keeping our roads safe and managing liquor and gaming in a fair and equitable way that protects the public interest.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General 2007/08 \u2013 2009/10 Service Plan was prepared under my direction in accordance with the Budget Transparency and Accountability Act.
