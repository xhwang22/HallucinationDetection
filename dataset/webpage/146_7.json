One of the country\u2019s most gossiped-about actresses, she was an unmistakable metaphor of the real Spain of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAfter the success of El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 she began to star in a series of musical melodramas \u2013 and to name her price: \u201cA million dollars a movie.\u201d She also chose all her own songs, costumes and even her timetable: \u201cBecause I refused to get up early again. In Mexico and the US I had to get up at 5.30 and six in the morning. Never again!\u201d\n\nMontiel was born Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez in 1928 in Campo de Criptana, Ciudad Real province, a humble agricultural town. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, she moved with her family to Orihuela in Alicante and attended a convent school where Sister Leocadia taught her to sing.\n\nThey love me a lot everywhere Spain. I\u2019m on stage for two hours and they leave delighted\"\n\nShe made her film debut in Empez\u00f3 en boda in 1944, alongside the great Fernando Fern\u00e1n-G\u00f3mez: \u201cHe was the first man who kissed me. I was 16 years old and I didn\u2019t know how. And he explained to me how they did it in the movies. I thought it was done how it looked: from start to finish.\u201d\n\nHer stage name came from illustrator Enrique Herreros who thought she needed a \u201cforceful surname,\u201d like Montiel. The first part she chose herself, after her great-grandmother.\n\nFeeling her career wasn\u2019t taking off in Spain, she moved to Mexico to make Furia roja for the Hispamex production company in 1950, on the recommendation of the playwright Miguel Mihura - \u201cmy first love.\u201d \u201cAh, what a country Mexico was,\u201d she remembered. \u201cA very professional film industry, in the middle of its golden age. And people could get divorced. A reality that contrasted with the crummy one we had in Spain. [\u2026] And I became Mexican, of course. I still have my nationality card in the safe. When I married Tony Mann, in Los Angeles, I got married with my other passport, the Mexican one.\u201d\n\nIn total she married four times and is survived by her two adopted children.\n\nShe died suddenly in her home in the Salamanca neighborhood of Madrid, having celebrated her 85th birthday barely three weeks before. Although Montiel retired from films in 1974, she never thought about giving up performing and continued to give concerts. \u201cLast year I did six galas. They love me a lot everywhere Spain. I\u2019m on stage for two hours and they all leave delighted.

The artist, who started acting at age 16, appeared in about fifty films and recorded nearly 500 songs.\n\n\"Sara was a woman who did what she wanted. Nobody could with beat her: neither Mexico, nor the United States nor the Franco regime [in Spain],\" says Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada, a Spanish professor at Drexel University and a friend of Montiel during her last years of life.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada refers to the indomitable character of the Iberian superstar. To fully understand and value Montiel\u2019s legacy,he says, her career must be viewed in terms of its four key stages.\n\nThe first was as a novice actress in the Spain of the 1940s, an impoverished country that had taken a step back in women\u2019s civil rights under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.\n\nAccording to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, Montiel was ahead of her time, a post-war woman who had to fight to be a protagonist in a society that had relegated her to play the role the Catholic Church commanded: a good mother, a good wife, a good housewife.\n\nMontiel managed to make 14 films in Spain before age 21, barely knowing how to read and write. To professor Rol\u00f3n-Barada, \"the lack of academic training can explain why Sara didn\u2019t have an automatic success during that first phase. She was very young and very weak facing seasoned actresses like Imperio Argentina or Amparo Rivelles.\u201d\n\nThe second moment of her career began in 1950, when the actress and her mother moved to Mexico in search of better opportunities. Mexico was the mecca of the Latin American film industry and was in the middle of its golden age.\n\nThere, Montiel got in touch with a circle of exiled Spanish intellectuals and improved her literacy skills with the help of poet Le\u00f3n Felipe.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada affirms that it is in Mexico where Sara's innate talent fused with her good luck \u2014 \u201can incredible luck because there she gets to work directly with Pedro Infante, who is at the peak of his career, and with Agust\u00edn Lara, the number one composer of Latin American music.\"\n\nNext to Infante, Montiel starred in films like Necesito Dinero, Ah\u00ed viene Mart\u00edn Corona (Little Love of my Life), and El Enamorado (all in 1952). \"She represented a challenge \u2014 she was the woman who broke the molds of that time and challenged her husband, a challenge to the Mexican \u201cmacho\u201d and the Hispanic male,\" says the professor.\n\nIn Mexico, she learned and evolved until she starred in Piel Canela (1953), a role that was made for her and film made to fit her and that leveraged Sara towards what would be, according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, the third stage of her career: Hollywood.\n\n\"She does not go to Hollywood to look for a job or to knock on doors, but Hollywood comes to her to offer her contracts,\" he affirmed.\n\nMontiel debuted without knowing English in American film industry in 1954, playing the role of Nina in Vera Cruz, a western starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. The film was followed by blockbusters such as Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nIt was in the mecca of American film industry \u2013and consolidated as a world star\u2013 when Montiel's career began to stagnate.\n\n\"She fell into the same problem that many others experienced: she had two possibilities, she was being offered roles as Mexican or as American Indian,\" says Rol\u00f3n-Barada. \u201cBecause that stereotype existed, once they labeled her that way, they continued to see her as only that.\"\n\nSeven years after having left her mother country, Montiel returned to Spain and it was at that time \u2014the fourth stage in her career \u2014that the artist established herself as one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain.\n\nThere, she starred in El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 (The Last Torch Song, 1957), a film that according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada \"changed her life because[with it] she achieves total success with a minimal budget and [also] brings back the musical, a genre from the 1920s.\u201d\n\nEl \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 was followed by blockbusters like La Violetera (1958), Mi \u00daltimo Tango (1960), La Bella Lola (1962), White House Nights (1963) and La Mujer Perdida (1966).\n\nA life to discover\n\nSara Montiel died in Madrid on April 8, 2013, at 85 years of age and with a public life known A to Z by her followers and the media.\n\nHowever, three years ago a biography that promises to \"reveal the hardest and difficult aspects of life that she had to face in order to become Sara Montiel,\" began to be \u201ccooked over a slow fire\u201d in Philadelphia, where Dr. Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada lives and teaches. Rol\u00f3n-Barada was an admirer of Sara during his adolescence, a friend of the superstar during her last years of life, and has now become her biographer.\n\nThe goal of the book, with a preliminary title of \"The Cost of Being Sara Montiel,\u201d is in the author\u2019s words \"to explain her real life trajectory: we all know how beautiful she was, the immense volume of her cinematographic and musical legacy, but we don\u2019t know the difficulties and very hard things that this woman had to go through to achieve her goal of being a professional actress.\"\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada recalls that his interest in Sara began very early in his life during his teenage years in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, every day after school, he went with almost religious discipline to the daily appointment he had with Hispanic cinema at his house.\n\nThe TV show was called \u201cCine de la tarde con Pilar Arenas,\u201d broadcasted on Channel 2.\n\n\"We used to watch the movies and then the next day we commented and sang the songs. That's how my admiration for Sara Montiel began,\" Rol\u00f3n-Barada remembers.\n\nIn 2001, while doing a Ph.D. in M\u00e1laga, Spain, he met her in person during a presentation and signing of her autobiography, Memorias, Vivir es un Placer.\n\nIn 2011, the Modern Language Association of America organized its annual conference in Seattle, which included- a panel called \u201cFrom Conchita Piquer to Isabel Pantoja: Divas and the Spanish Cultural Imaginary.\u201d\n\nBefore the panel, Rol\u00f3n-Barada managed a two-day interview with Sara Montiel on the island of Tabarca, a situation that, according to the professor, amused the diva because it came only 48 hours after their first talk on the phone, after which Rol\u00f3n-Barada flew from Philadelphia to Spain to meet her in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada says that this biography differs from others that have come out about Montiel because his approach to documenting her life is as an academic and cultural historian, resulting in a tone and content distinct from the commercial or sensationalist elements of other publications.\n\nFor now, the professor needs to work on a couple of details and conduct a few additional interviews in Mexico and Spain before finishing his version of Montiel's life, which he expects to publish at the beginning of next spring."}, {"url": "https://deadorkicking.com/sara-montiel-dead-or-alive/", "page_content": "Sara Montiel Death\n\nSara passed away on April 8, 2013 at the age of 85 in Madrid, Madrid Spain.

She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics.
