{"Michael Savage is a radio host.": [{"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/michael-savage-trump-coronavirus.html", "page_content": "These kinds of provocations will be familiar to fans and critics of Mr. Savage, who was once was barred from entering Britain after making inflammatory comments about Islam, including calling the Quran a \u201cbook of hate.\u201d\n\nIn a series of interviews over the phone and on Skype as he recorded his radio show from a home studio overlooking San Francisco Bay, Mr. Savage, who is 78, echoed his conservative colleagues on some aspects of the virus. He has sharply attacked the federal government\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, dismissing him as \u201ca grandstander\u201d and \u201ca showman.\u201d He criticized sweeping quarantine measures and lockdowns as a threat to individual liberty, and called for them to be eased in places with lower infection rates, siding with the protesters who have gathered in state capitals across the country in recent days in a show of opposition.\n\nHe said he had pressed this point personally over email with Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, whom he knows socially through his son, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, Russell Weiner. Mr. Savage has also made his case on selectively lifting quarantine orders directly to the White House, which announced last month that it would nominate him to the board of the Presidio Trust, the oversight body for San Francisco\u2019s famed national park. (The announcement was easy to overlook because it listed Mr. Savage by his legal name, Michael A. Weiner.)\n\nMr. Savage\u2019s coronavirus crusade is partly a reflection of his training as a scientist. He has a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine, a field that examines how various cultures and ethnicities use natural products for health purposes. As part of his training, he studied epidemiology. He is a germaphobe and has a survivalist streak. One of the houses he owns in Marin County has its own reservoir.\n\nBut his persistence on the issue is also a reaction to his own recent death scare. The heart attack he had in December made the life-and-death nature of a pandemic personal. \u201cI would like to believe that God has kept me here for this reason,\u201d he said, calling this \u201cthe defining moment of our lives.\u201d\n\nAt one point he turned to his producer, Jim Verdi, and asked, \u201cWhen was I this wound up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d Mr. Verdi replied.\n\nMr. Savage\u2019s wife, Janet Weiner, said in an interview that she had noticed more compassion in her husband since his heart attack. And she sees him taking on responsibility for waking people up to what parts of American conservatism, especially in the media, have become. \u201cThis culty hero worship of the uneducated, it\u2019s very depressing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me ashamed to be a conservative,\u201d she added, before stopping herself. \u201cI don\u2019t want to identify with the conservative movement anymore.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/22/michael-savage-abandons-talk-radio-for-a-national-/", "page_content": "He has been on the national airwaves for over a quarter of a century.

He is the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States. Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List.\n\nSavage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as \"fostering extremism.\" He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.\n\nSince 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for \"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred.\"\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSavage was born Michael Alan Weiner in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner, Jewish emigrants from Russia. He described his childhood as difficult. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970, and his mother died in 2003.\n\nAfter graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate at Millbrook NY, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself. Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972. He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.\n\nShift in political opinions\n\nSavage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a \"calling card.\" Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\" Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.\n\nAcquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\" Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \"political opposition\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit.\n\nRadio\n\nThe rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal aliens and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro. At the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.\n\nIn mid 2006, Savage had 8\u201310 million listeners per week, which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He has described his show's production as one with a \"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\" Mark de la Vi\u00f1a of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: \"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\"\n\nBy 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time. Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled \"Party of One\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed \"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\" According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \"rattle\" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010. He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \"real writer\" who had understood his subject.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.\n\nMSNBC television show\n\nSavage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, \"Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?\" Sorenson, at the time, called Savage \"brash, passionate and smart,\" and promised that he would provide \"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\"\n\nFour months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a \"sodomite\", to which the caller answered, \"Yes, I am.\" Savage then said to the caller,\n\nOh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.\n\nThe day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.\n\nPolitical views\n\nMichael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\" He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence. Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.\n\nIn 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\" In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush. Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.\n\nRegarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had \"great ideas\" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee. On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich \"1 million dollars\" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a \"quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist\" and a possible foreign usurper, in the 2012 election.\n\nSavage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.\n\nActivism\n\nLegal defense contributions\n\nSavage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton. Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund. The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.\n\nIn November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.\n\nLieutenant Michael Behenna\n\nOn his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.\n\nMichael Savage Scholarship\n\nIn July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question \"What Does It Mean to Be an American?\" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.\n\nAwards and criticism\n\nAwards\n\nOn June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.\n\nNational Radio Hall of Fame\n\nIn 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]\n\nCriticism\n\nIn July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that \"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\" David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation \"is an act, a put-on.\" Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.\n\nOn April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, \"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?\" This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.\n\nIn the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \"aggressive act\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - \"you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem\" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.\n\nCatholic Church and Immigration\n\nIn March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \"pastoral support\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology.\"\n\nOn March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California\n\nC-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award\n\nWhen Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Michael Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage stated that C-SPAN's decision was \"censorship\" and he told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.\n\nDispute with CAIR\n\nIn early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \"need deportation\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \"take your religion and shove it up your behind\" because \"I'm sick of you.\" On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.\n\nSavage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate\". CAIR called the suit \"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to \"comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations.\" The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.\n\nAutism\n\nIn July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \"a racket\" designed to get disability payments for \"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\" He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:\n\nNow, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, \"Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot.\"\n\nIn July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children. WOR issued a statement saying, \"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\" Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising, and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show. Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \"ripped out of context\" by \"far left Stalinists\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits. On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.\n\nSavage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.\n\nBanned from entering the United Kingdom\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\". During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \"lunatic\".\n\nDuring a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\" When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.\n\nOf the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: \"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\" In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: \"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\" While Sam Leith wrote: \"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.\n\nVeteran PTSD\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \"weakness\". According to Savage, \"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhile in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji. That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.\n\nSavage and his second wife Janet have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink. Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009. Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher. In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii. Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley. In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year. In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: \"... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"\n\nLiterary works\n\nIn total, Savage has written 36 works, twenty-one under his real name of Michael Weiner, and fifteen under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include a #1 New York Times bestseller and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list. Two of his books as Michael Weiner, Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's and Healing Children Naturally have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.\n\nHis earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.\n\nHis more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.\n\nIn 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books. In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action \"reverse discrimination\", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.\n\nIn January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at \"liberal media bias\", the \"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\", gay activists, and liberals.\n\nIn January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.\n\nIn April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the \"Political Zoo\", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.\n\nIn October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\"\n\nIn November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on \"My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know\", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \"the Hand of Allah\". The publisher has described the novel by saying, \"will make 9/11 look like child's play\".\n\nIn October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments \"[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country.\" It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List for six weeks.\n\nSavage's latest political book is entitled Government Zero - a critique of the Obama Administration's foreign and domestic policies including Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State."}, {"url": "https://gazettereview.com/2018/04/what-happened-to-michael-savage/", "page_content": "A popular radio host, Michael Savage rose to fame for his nationally syndicated talk show, The Savage Nation which has aired across the U.S. for over two decades. With an audience of over 20 million, it is one of the most listened-to radio shows in the United States. Is he still hosting the show today? Where is he now in 2018?\n\nWhat is Michael Savage Doing Now in 2018?\n\nFirst and foremost, he still hosts the syndicated talk show to this day. Since 2012, The Savage Nation has been airing on KSFO, where it\u2019s heard by over 10 million listeners a week. Based out of San Francisco, California, the program is known for entering around Savage\u2019s bold perspective on American ideals and culture. As such, he has been named as one of the most influential and most listened-to talk show hosts by Talk Stream Live.\n\nFor those who\u2019d like to tune into some of his past programs, you can visit his official YouTube channel here. Since its launch in 2016, he has been regularly uploading his syndicated show to the site, for his fans to enjoy.\n\nAside from his radio program, he has been involved with numerous other ventures. For instance, he has written a handful of books over the past few years including Stop the Coming Civil War, Government Zero, Scorched Earth, and Trump\u2019s War: His Battle for America. His most recent release God, Faith, and Reason, a non-political title in which he discusses his lifelong quest for spiritual truth, was published in November 2017.\n\nA strong supporter of Donald Trump, he had supported his campaign in 2016. Considering the fact that the president himself is a fan and listener of Savage\u2019s show, it\u2019s not surprising to know that the radio host and his family were invited to meet President Trump several times during the holiday season in 2017.\n\nAs far as other things go, he was also invited onto the television show, PoliticKING with Larry King alongside Peter Kauffmann and Amy Holmes last year. Previously, he had also been featured in the show in 2015 and 2016.\n\nLast year, he had also made the headlines after getting into a confrontation with a man at a Tiburon restaurant in Marin County. According to reports, the conservative talk show host had come into physical contact with each other after a brief verbal exchange. Fortunately, neither parties had any visible signs of injury. A few days afterward, it was announced that no criminal charges would be laid.\n\nAbout Michael Savage\n\nBorn on March 31, 1942, in New York, Michael Savage has described his childhood as difficult. After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958, he went to Queens College, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s in biology. From there, he taught high school for several years before earning a master\u2019s degree in botany from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1970. Two years later, he earned a second masters in anthropology.\n\nFast forward to the early 90\u2019s, and he had landed himself a position with the San Francisco radio station, KGO. After a year of filing in for Ray Taliaferro, he was given his own show on the sister station, KSFO. A local hit, he eventually reached number one in Arbitron ratings. By 2006, he was attracting eight to ten million listeners per week. With that, his show became one of the most widely broadcasted in the U.S. at the time.\n\nAs of 2018, he has hosted his radio show for over two decades. In fact, he recently celebrated 24 years on the radio earlier this year. Hailed as one of the most creative talk show hosts ever to have been on the air, he has dominated the airwaves with more than 20 million weekly listeners across the globe. In 2016, his efforts led him to be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nAside from his radio career, Savage is also known for having written more than 25 books, many of which were best-sellers. Some of these include Earth Medicine, The Art of Feeding Children Well, Dr. Savage\u2019s High Fiber Counter, The People\u2019s Herbal, and The Complete Book of Homeopathy. Most recently, he published the fictional title Xenon on February 5th, 2018.\n\nDid you know that he\u2019s also appeared on television? That\u2019s right, he once hosted his own television show on MSNBC. A few months after its premiere, however, he was fired after he made certain remarks to a caller, who was later identified as a prank caller.\n\nMichael Savage\u2019s Plans for the Future\n\nIf his recent activities are of any indication, the talk show host will not be retiring from his position anytime soon. In fact, it was announced that he had renewed a long-term contract for The Savage Nation with the media company, Westwood One."}, {"url": "https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2022/03/31/michael-savage-interview-80/", "page_content": "In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on his 80th birthday, conservative radio talk show legend and #1 New York Times best-selling author Michael Savage reflects on his over two-decade media career and opens up about what it\u2019s like to have achieved the American dream\u2014from being the son of a Russian immigrant to becoming one of America\u2019s most influential political voices, to being the proud father of a top food and beverage business mogul.\n\nJOSH CAPLAN: You began your career over two decades ago as a local radio host at San Francisco\u2019s KGO and climbed the ranks to become not only one of the most powerful voices in the conservative media, but one of the most powerful in all of American politics. You channeled that power to even help elect Donald Trump to the White House in 2016. Reflecting on your incredible career, how do you feel about your accomplishments?\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE: I don\u2019t think about it, and you may not believe it, but I don\u2019t receive the amount of feedback that you\u2019d think. In 1994, I started in radio and I held a compassionate conservative event at the Marin Center with thousands of people. I went on to create the Paul Revere Society, and I had to think about what we stand for. I said we stand for a stronger nation, which is defined by borders, language, and culture. That has become my legacy issue.\n\nI also wrote a book called Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder and the thesis of the book is true. How do liberals not know what a woman is? Do they not know what a border is for America, but they\u2019re willing to risk a world war for the borders, language, and culture for Ukraine? Everything they do is the mark of someone on medication who is crazy. And they declare us to be the enemy.\n\nBut my career is not all political. My work with plants is another side of me that is unknown to the general public. I wrote a book years ago entitled Secrets of Fijian Medicine. The book is based on tons of research about the Fijian islands. I spent time there picking medicinal plants and working with folk healers. It sounds dry and boring, but these could be the source of future medicines for mankind. I\u2019m going to reissue this book for my birthday on Kindle.\n\nAnother aspect of my legacy is the book I wrote called God, Faith, and Reason. I mention it because I struggle all the time with mortality since I\u2019m a little kid. I\u2019ve long asked the questions: who are we, what are we doing here, and what happens when we\u2019re not here anymore? I\u2019ve also long wondered what is the meaning of religion and if God exists or not. As I said in the book, I\u2019ve never seen a complete picture of God, but I\u2019ve seen snapshots. What do I mean by that? I\u2019ve seen snapshots like my dog dying in my arms or a child being born.\n\nRemember Job 3:3? \u201cLet the day of my birth be erased, and the night I was conceived. Let that day be turned to darkness.\u201d Why would he say that? Many of us are hurting right now and faith is an important part of who I am. There were times where I\u2019d be alone in the island and I would pray. I never found ten Jews for a minyan in Fiji, but Fijians took me into their circle to pray. We sat many nights in bures without electricity and drinking kava kava, which is a mild narcotic. The Fijians considered me a part of them and our souls were close.\n\nCAPLAN: Let\u2019s switch to politics for a moment. President Joe Biden appears over his head as he\u2019s engulfed by multiple crises like inflation and Ukraine. How would you rate this presidency?\n\nSAVAGE: He\u2019s a very sad person to watch, and has put this nation and world in great danger. None of this would have happened under Donald Trump. We had a much more stable world when Trump was in power. Today, we\u2019re living in hell with runaway inflation and a war that could turn into something much worse. It\u2019s the most insane and incompetent administration in history. Biden was always a second- or third-tier individual and was groomed to be a sub-character for more powerful individuals. He became the accidental president because of the media, which threw the election for him.\n\nThis is an F presidency. If we lived in a sane country, he would have been thrown out. But what waits in the wings? That cackler Kamala Harris is so much worse that I actually go to bed every night and pray for Biden\u2019s health. Harris is a stooge of Nancy Pelosi and that whole machine. They put Harris in there from day one. Harris being president would be like a bust-out from The Sopranos.\n\nMoving on to Ukraine: where are the peacemakers? All I hear is people fomenting more war. Biden should have [gone] to go meet Putin, not these left-wing fanatics who are going to start an arms race. And look at the media. Many retired generals and other former military men are on places like Fox News pushing war, and they have contracts and conflicts of interest with contractors.\n\nCAPLAN: Switching back to the personal: your son Russell Weiner sold his company, Rockstar Energy, for $3.85 billion to PepsiCo in March 2020. As a father, how does it make you feel to see your son capture this level of success and what would your father, an immigrant to America, think of his grandson\u2019s success? Could he fathom such an amazing achievement?\n\nSAVAGE: No, he wouldn\u2019t be able to. This could only happen in America. I remember one summer Russ sent up his boat to the Hudson River so I could hold a party for my publisher and some radio people. During my speech, I pointed out that the party was not far from where I grew up. Look, I\u2019m a very competitive guy and I taught Russ to be very competitive. As my son was building his business, I used to tell him that I was astounded at what he was able to do and I would tell him that I admired him. He\u2019d say back, \u201cYou made me, you created me.\u201d Russ would list all the ways that I had an impact on him. \u201cYou took me to all the trade shows, you took me to Fiji to collect plants when I was a little kid and I learned about herbs from you,\u201d Russ would tell me.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget how I took Russ to Japan together. I was there to collect an award from the Japan Creativity Society, and that\u2019s something few people know about. I\u2019ll never forget we took a non-stop flight from New York City to Narita airport and Russ was 13 or 14 years old. We went to a banquet, and one of these guys came up to him and said, \u201cyou bombed me, you bombed me in World War II. You blew up my house.\u201d Russ was eating sushi as he was being blamed for the bombing of 1945.\n\nNo one knows this bit about the flight. We were only two of four people in first class and I kid you not, Russ ate his way all the way to Japan. The flight attendants wheeled out a cart with a side of roast beef on it. My son ended up having not one, but four big slices of roast beef with potatoes. He ate until the flight attendant was visibly upset. This happened over 35 years ago. Boy, does time fly. You bring these stories out of me, it\u2019s great.\n\nCAPLAN: So we touched on how you feel about your son\u2019s success, now what about your father? Could he have dreamed of such a thing?\n\nSAVAGE: No. My father died when he was young of a heart attack. He never met my son. I never met my grandfather because he also died of a heart attack. I never thought I\u2019d live past 40 years old because of my family\u2019s history. Through luck, my mother\u2019s side, and vitamins, I\u2019m still here.\n\nCould my father, who owned a little store in the Lower East Side and worked there seven days per week with no vacation, fathom such success? No. He worked hard so my mother didn\u2019t have to work and he bought a used Cadillac. He used to say people who bought cars on credit were cheating. So for a man who could only afford to buy a used \u201ccreampuff\u201d Cadillac to have a son of such prominence and a grandson of such wealth \u2014 what would he do with that? What would he say to me? What would he advise me? I actually believe he would ask me what to think. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s outside of his forte.\n\nCAPLAN: You\u2019ve been hosting a highly successful podcast for over a year. What are your thoughts on the program, and are you going to continue it for the foreseeable future?\n\nSAVAGE: It took me close to two years to get the hang of podcasting and the show is now in the top 0.5 percent in terms of downloads, according to my advertising agency. So the show is a success, but how long will I do it? I don\u2019t know. Now that I\u2019m turning 80 years old, I think there\u2019s no point to this. Certainly during this war, I feel like I have to keep going. I\u2019m only one small voice amidst this madness in the world. But if I could influence a few influential people, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nI like looking at who listens to the show. I have people that listen from all around the world, and the podcast got 20 million downloads last year, which is pretty good for me. Most of my episodes are downloaded from Apple. And you can\u2019t say what you want when your show is on Apple. They can take it down if they want; they have all the power. No person is totally free in the media. None.\n\nSome days I ask myself how many years I have left, and I ask how many years I want to keep doing this. Even if I was retired, I\u2019d still be reading stories like I do on Breitbart or Drudge, so I have to talk about what\u2019s going on. Now I go on Newsmax three days per week, and I pack my segments with powerful information. I told myself that when the day comes that I can\u2019t do that anymore and sound like Joe Biden, I\u2019ll disappear and you\u2019ll never hear from me again.\n\nCAPLAN: Final questions for you: It\u2019s looking like there could be a red wave in the 2022 midterms. What are your predictions? And what is your prediction for 2024? Will Trump run? Will Biden?\n\nSAVAGE: First of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shoo-in for the midterms for the Republicans. Everyone is saying it\u2019s a guaranteed wave, and I say it\u2019s not because of possible voting irregularities, and the election is still a long ways away. This raging war has also not played itself out. In my opinion, Biden and his team want to drag it out as long as they can without actually having a World War. We\u2019re also entering a more totalitarian world with what goes on with social media and the media. Because of the left\u2019s control, the mess in America is not clear-cut. I\u2019m not so sure there\u2019s going to be a red wave.\n\nOn the 2024 election, it looks like Trump will run, but he is getting older and not younger. He looks great at his weekly rallies and I hope he does run, but when is he going to run out of steam? I like him and I like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis enormously. Trump is not the only conservative Republican who can win the presidency. I would vote for Trump or DeSantis if they run. Biden will not run in a million years, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make it through this term. It should be a Republican victory in 2024, but given the descent of the media, and social media censorship, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what might happen.\n\nThis interview was edited and condensed for clarity."}, {"url": "https://www.mediamatters.org/michael-savage/bigoted-radio-host-michael-savage-who-said-trump-made-him-more-proud-be-american-has", "page_content": "Sarah Wasko / Media Matters\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing and unprecedented presidential war on the mainstream press, President Donald Trump has relied heavily on a handful of sycophantic fringe media outlets to unquestioningly push his message and offer him unconditional praise. One of Trump\u2019s favorite radio shows for this purpose was Michael Savage\u2019s The Savage Nation -- until now.\n\nOn his September 7 show, host Savage delivered a several-minute monologue disparaging the president for working with Democrat leadership. Savage declared that Trump had adhered to \u201cthe exact opposite points of everything we voted for\u201d and acknowledged that his opposition to the president would \u201ccost [him] personally.\u201d\n\nSavage heavily supported Trump \u201cfrom the get-go,\u201d coupling overwhelming praise for Trump with vitriolic hate rhetoric on a daily basis and sometimes taking credit for inspiring Trump\u2019s campaign messaging. Savage and Trump were often partners in broadcasting an alternate reality -- where the world is a scary place that can be saved only by a heroic and charming Trump -- to 10 million listeners each day.\n\nSavage is a bigoted conspiracy theorist known for his extreme positions, including his recent call for \u201cWorld War II-style internment camps\u201d following the London terror attack. He has previously called for \u201ckill[ing] 100 million\u201d Muslims, was one of the first right-wing media figures to openly and repeatedly question then-President Barack Obama's birthplace and religion, and has a history of promoting bizarre conspiracy theories about murder and diseases. Savage hosted a weekend show on MSNBC in 2003, when he was fired after he referred to an on-air caller as a \u201csodomite\u201d and told the caller to \u201cget AIDS and die.\u201d\n\nTrump made his first appearance on Savage's radio show in 2011 to discuss whether he would ever run for president. Since Trump formally declared his presidential candidacy in June 2015, he\u2019s appeared on The Savage Nation at least 16 times, including on Election Day, to participate in acts of performative mutual admiration with the host. Members of the Trump administration have also appeared on the show several times this year to push conservative talking points about health care, the Paris climate agreement, and foreign policy matters.\n\nTrump repeatedly called sycophant Savage during his presidential candidacy and was heaped with unfettered praise\n\nJune 19, 2015: Three days after declaring his candidacy for president, Trump called in to The Savage Nation and received unbridled praise. In the summer of 2015, three days after Donald Trump announced that he would run for president, he called in to The Savage Nation to talk to Savage, who said he supported him \u201cfrom the get-go.\u201d \u201cYou know that the best and the brightest generally don\u2019t go into politics, you being the exception,\u201d Savage said to Trump. Trump spent a large chunk of the 16-minute interview -- which aired just two days after a white supremacist killed nine black parishioners in Charleston, SC -- talking about topics like his charitable donations, business net worth, ratings of his reality TV show The Apprentice, time at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania, and feelings about right-wing pundits like George Will. From the June 19, 2015, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Donald, when you announced this week, I watched the little people -- the Lilliputians -- attack you. You know what I called them? I said they\u2019re toe dust compared to him. I saw these little men and little women trying to rip you apart and I said they are toe dust. That\u2019s all they are. They\u2019re jealous of this man. And there\u2019s a lot of jealousy for successful people, as you well know, Donald. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 6/19/15, 6/19/15]\n\nJuly 29, 2015: Trump joined Savage on his radio show to vent about \u201cdisgraceful\u201d criticism of his early presidential campaign, fundraise. Trump called in to The Savage Nation at the end of July 2015 to talk with Savage about the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d criticism he\u2019d already received as a presidential candidate and to compare \u201cembarrassing\u201d foreign policy decisions by the Obama administration to dealmaking in his book Art of the Deal. Here\u2019s the beginning of the segment, from the July 29, 2015, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I am not a journalist. I\u2019m a talk show host. I have opinions. I\u2019m biased. Period, end of story. The rest of them all are biased. They don\u2019t tell you that, though. I\u2019m for Trump. Point-bank. Best choice we have. Donald Trump joins us right now on The Savage Nation. Donald, thank you for being with us. What\u2019s on your mind today? DONALD TRUMP: An honor. That\u2019s an amazing honor for you to say that -- is tremendous. I appreciate it, Michael. SAVAGE: But Donald, why should I hide it? I mean, people make believe that they\u2019re not biased. You know and I know the media\u2019s biased one way or the other. They all pretend that they\u2019re scientists in a laboratory with a pipette in their mouth. They\u2019re all biased; they all have an axe to grind. Look what they\u2019re doing to you: smearing you every day with lies. Garbage, pure garbage. Where they let Obama get away with virtual murder, give the bomb to Iran. Why is the media not saying one word about what Obama is doing to wreck this nation, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well he is doing a terrible job. He\u2019s been a terrible president. The person that likes him most, I always say, is Jimmy Carter because Jimmy\u2019s now number two. And it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s absolutely incredible. And you know, I see -- Michael, it\u2019s been for a long time I\u2019ve heard you cannot be a very successful person and run for office, especially for president, and I really see it now. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 7/29/15, 7/29/15]\n\nSeptember 2, 2015: \u201cHow the heck do you maintain your stamina, Donald?\u201d In a September phone interview on The Savage Nation, Savage and Trump doted on one another and, at the end of the interview, discussed Trump\u2019s campaigning \u201cstamina\u201d and Savage\u2019s hopes to head the National Institutes of Health in a Trump administration. From the September 2, 2015, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): People are saying Trump\u2019s running hot right now, but it\u2019s a long race. It\u2019s over a year to go. But you\u2019re engaged in this campaign every second, every day. No one knows how you get the energy for it, god bless you, but they\u2019re saying that you\u2019re going to peak, you\u2019re going to drop out. How the heck do you maintain your stamina, Donald? Is there a secret? DONALD TRUMP: Well, maybe it\u2019s good genes. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is. I\u2019m energized and I\u2019ve been that way for my life. And it\u2019s mostly because I enjoy what I do and I see a lot of progress. You know, maybe if I were number 17 in the polls or number 15 in the polls, or you know some of these guys have actually zero. That means out of thousands of people that are polled, they have nobody who said, you know, they\u2019d vote for them. And at some point they\u2019re going to start dropping out. And maybe if I were number 15 I wouldn\u2019t feel so much stamina. But it\u2019s nice to be number one and, really, number one by a lot. So we\u2019ll see-- SAVAGE: You are, by a huge margin. You\u2019ve struck a cord. People are trying to explain it, the very people who attacked you in the beginning are now suddenly coming around saying, \u2018Well, maybe he\u2019s not so bad,\u2019 because they\u2019re hedging their bets that you just might win. I feel you will win if you sustain it. And the only thing I ask out of the support for you is simple: I only want to run the NIH and I want to clean up the science and medical establishments in America, which are as corrupt as you can imagine. They\u2019re doing no basic science. Medicine has been corrupted by politics. Instead of producing scientific reports everything has to have something to do with global warming in it or gender identity. TRUMP: True. SAVAGE: We have a problem -- at every level of this country has a problem and it wasn\u2019t started by Obama but I hope it\u2019s ended by Donald Trump. TRUMP: Well, you\u2019re going to see a lot of things happen. If I win, you\u2019re going to see a lot of things happen. And you know, my theme is \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, Michael. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 9/2/15]\n\nOctober 6, 2015: \u201cYou already make me more proud to be an American \u2026 I feel proud for what I\u2019ve achieved because of you, Donald.\u201d In an October phone interview on The Savage Nation, Trump told Savage he had met Vladimir Putin \u201cone time\u201d a \u201clong time ago\u201d and that he \u201cgot along with him great,\u201d a statement he later contradicted multiple times. Trump and Savage then paused their talk about foreign policy to trade a series of over-the-top compliments. Savage said that Trump made him \u201cmore proud to be an American\u201d and \u201cproud for what I\u2019ve achieved,\u201d and Trump responded that Savage has \u201cdone an amazing job\u201d and has \u201cbeen really nice to me.\u201d Savage again asked if Trump would consider appointing him to head the National Institute of Health (NIH), to which Trump responded, \u201cI think that\u2019s great,\u201d and that \u201cyou\u2019d get common sense if that were the case.\u201d The interview ended with Savage telling Trump he hoped to see him at Mar-a-Lago. From the October 6, 2015, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nDONALD TRUMP: You would be so happy. If I win this thing, you will be so proud of this country, Michael. I\u2019ll tell you what. MICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Well you know, I\u2019ve got to tell you, Donald: On a personal level, you already make me hopeful. You already make me more proud to be an American. And you\u2019ve given me something personal that you don\u2019t even know. I\u2019ve worked very hard as an immigrant\u2019s son to achieve what I have. And as you know, my family has worked very hard. They\u2019ve achieved a lot. But we\u2019ve had to hide it under the Democrat-Socialist machine. We\u2019ve almost had to apologize for having succeeded, for working so hard. I feel proud for what I\u2019ve achieved because of you, Donald. Because you\u2019re willing to stand up and say you\u2019re proud of what you\u2019ve achieved, you make me willing to stand up and say that. Do you know that you\u2019ve had a positive effect already? TRUMP: Well, that\u2019s very nice for you to say that. And you\u2019ve done an amazing job, and I look at your ratings and I look at you, just you, and you\u2019ve been a special guy. You\u2019ve been amazing. And you\u2019ve been really nice to me and I appreciate it. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 10/6/15]\n\nNovember 18, 2015: Trump and Savage made up after Savage briefly criticized Trump: \u201cYour show has always been good. You\u2019ve always been good to me.\u201d Trump called in to The Savage Nation in November 2015 after Savage had criticized Trump for comparing Ben Carson, then a competitor in the GOP primary, to a \u201cchild molester.\u201d The two men quickly buried the hatchet, with Savage praising Trump for coming back on the show (\u201ca bigger man than I am\u201d) and both of them laughing and teasing one another about the attacks they\u2019ve launched on others. Savage also asked Trump how he gets the \u201cenergy\u201d to campaign: \u201cHow do you do this? Is it the meatloaf?\u201d From the November 18, 2015, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I thought that after I criticized you on-air -- and I did it as delicately as I could -- that I wouldn\u2019t be eating lettuce at Mar-a-Lago ever again. But I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re a bigger man than I am, and you came back on the show because you can take criticism. And, by the way, that\u2019s more than what most politicians are willing to do, Donald. You know and I know that most politicians are so thin-skinned that if you dare say one word about them that they don\u2019t agree with, they excommunicate you. And you did not do that with me, I\u2019ve got to tell you that. DONALD TRUMP: No. Look, I understand that you weren\u2019t happy about that but, your show has always been good. You\u2019ve always been good to me, other than the last couple of weeks -- you didn\u2019t like what I said. But at some point -- why, are you a noncompetitive person? You wouldn\u2019t do it? You would\u2019ve done it five times worse than I did it, OK? SAVAGE: [laughter] If I were in your place and I had a chance to knock Carson? I think that what gets you about Carson is that he acts like such a nice -- I think what was getting your goat, looking back, knowing kind of a little bit more about you as you have evolved on the campaign trail, is that you didn\u2019t like him getting away with that he\u2019s such a nice guy, and so sort of unaggressive when under the surface you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a monster lurking under the surface. Is that sort of what it was? TRUMP: He\u2019s got some deficiencies and they\u2019re pretty big and I wanted to let him know. And you understand that. You would\u2019ve been worse than me, I\u2019m telling you, OK? I know you too well, Michael. You know, you\u2019re trying to be this nice guy, don\u2019t hit -- since when don\u2019t you hit people hard? SAVAGE: [laughter] TRUMP: By the way, if you didn\u2019t hit people hard, your show wouldn\u2019t be the success it is either. So, always good to do your show, you know that. [...] SAVAGE: How do you -- where do you get the energy from? How do you do this? Over the years that I\u2019ve been in the radio, people have said, \u201cRun for office.\u201d I don\u2019t have the energy for it. I can do the show. How do you do this? Is it the meatloaf? What is it? [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 11/18/15]\n\nJanuary 11, 2016: Savage told Trump he believed \u201cHispanics are going to vote\u201d for him because \u201cHispanic culture is a macho culture\u201d and \u201cmen don\u2019t like reporting to a woman.\u201d Trump joined Savage in January 2016 to discuss his appeal to African American and Hispanic voters, as well as his supposed popularity with women. Savage remarked to Trump that \u201cthe reason Hispanics are going to vote for you -- and I'll say it, I'm not going to ask you -- is because, to be honest, and it's very clear, the Hispanic culture is a macho culture. Men don't like reporting to a woman. It's just the way the culture is. And they'd rather have a man than a woman as president.\u201d The interview ended, again, with Savage and Trump talking about seeing each other at Mar-a-Lago soon and thanking one another for support. From the January 11, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Donald, I won\u2019t take up any more of your time. I want to thank you for being on The Savage Nation. I hope to see you back here as soon as possible. Good luck in every one of your campaigns. I hope to share some Cobb salad with you, and meatloaf, at Mar-a-Lago. DONALD TRUMP: I love that idea, and we\u2019ll see you soon. We\u2019ll talk to you soon, Michael. I appreciate your support. You\u2019ve been so amazing. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 1/11/16]\n\nJanuary 26, 2016: \u201cYou have been an original backer from a long time ago and I appreciate it, Michael, and I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d Weeks after his last appearance on The Savage Nation, Trump called in to the show again to talk with Savage about Megyn Kelly and primary debates. Savage also recommended that Trump appoint Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) as his defense secretary, saying he\u2019ll recommend him again after Trump wins and Savage becomes part of his \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d of advisers. Savage ended the interview, again, by reminding Trump he\u2019d supported him \u201cfrom the day you started\u201d and saying he admired Trump because \u201cyou never forget your friends.\u201d From the January 26, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation (emphasis added):\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Donald, before you go -- I\u2019ve been backing you from the day you started. We have nothing in common, meaning we don\u2019t have business together. We don\u2019t do business together. There is no deals (sic) between us. I just want the best for America. I want a winner. I want someone who can take on ISIS, I want someone who can defeat China in negotiations, I want Mexico to stop flooding us with immigrants. Now we have the Zita (sic) virus coming in from South America. This is insanity, Donald. You\u2019re the only candidate who can do this. And I know women -- smart women, business women who are very wealthy, built their own business, Donald -- every one of them, some of them are even liberals, are backing you. Do you know that? DONALD TRUMP: I think it\u2019s so great. I think we\u2019re going to do even better than the poll numbers are showing. I hope. You know a lot of people are saying that, where the polls are so great but we may do better. But who knows? We have to see. Hey look, I\u2019m working hard and a lot of people are working hard and we have such great support, but we still have to get there and I don\u2019t want to take anything for granted. I always like to say there\u2019s a long way to go. But I will say this, just to finish off: If I get there, you will be very proud. And you have been an original backer from a long time ago and I appreciate it, Michael, and I\u2019ll never forget it. SAVAGE: I know you don\u2019t. That\u2019s something people don\u2019t understand about you and they don\u2019t understand about the winning personality -- is that you never forget your friends and you never forget those who put knives in your back. Donald Trump, all I can say is my audience is 98 percent behind you. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s that low, but I\u2019ll work on the other two percent over the coming weeks. TRUMP: That\u2019s great. Well, you are a great guy and I really appreciate it. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 1/26/16]\n\nFebruary 1, 2016: Trump called in to The Savage Nation on Iowa caucus day: \u201cYou\u2019ve been so incredible to me and I really appreciate it.\u201d On the day of the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Trump called in to The Savage Nation to get some signature praise \u201c9.2 minutes\u201d before he was set to give a speech. From the February 1, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Doctor Trump, you\u2019re the doctor that we need to heal America. DONALD TRUMP: Amazing, Michael. It\u2019s been an amazing period of time. And I mean, I\u2019m in Iowa right now. In fact, I\u2019m going to make a speech in about 9.2 minutes but I said I have to take Michael before I get up. I mean, I have to speak to you. You\u2019ve been so supportive and I want to thank you, Michael. SAVAGE: Well, I wish I could say the same about my fellow, let us say, travelers in the conservative universe. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re the only hope we have. Everyone I know who is worth anything in the world -- and doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re rich or poor, worth something in terms of brains -- is going to vote for you, loves you. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 2/1/16]\n\nFebruary 8, 2016: Ahead of New Hampshire primary, Trump \u201cturned down big, big, big interviews in order to talk to my man, to Michael.\u201d Trump called in to The Savage Nation the following week, ahead of the New Hampshire primary race. During the interview, he told Savage that he had \u201cturned down big, big, big interviews in order to talk to my man, to Michael.\u201d Savage, in turn, listed a series of real estate accomplishments he attributed to Trump, naming various parts of midtown Manhattan he believes are better because of Trump\u2019s influence and commenting, \u201cI don\u2019t care if people say I\u2019m being too nice to you.\u201d Savage ended the interview by advising Trump not to \u201cgo soft\u201d and remarking that \u201cthe people need a strong, alpha male leader.\u201d From the beginning of the February 8, 2016, segment on The Savage Nation:\n\nDONALD TRUMP: One thing about you, Michael: You\u2019re a very consistent person, like me. MICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s why people don\u2019t like us. In a world of malleable, changeable positions, we are like mountains, Donald. And they don\u2019t like mountains. They want to grind us down into sand. TRUMP: True. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 2/8/16]\n\nFebruary 15, 2016: Trump joined Savage to lament the unfair \u201cset-up\u201d Trump faced during a GOP primary debate and discuss Scalia death conspiracy theories. The following week, Trump appeared on The Savage Nation again, and he seemed to entertain Savage\u2019s conspiracy theories about the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump himself commented about a \u201cpretty unusual\u201d detail reported about the justice\u2019s death. Trump and Savage also took some time to complain about a GOP primary debate they thought was a \u201cset-up\u201d to make Trump look bad. From the February 15, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nDONALD TRUMP: It\u2019s amazing, actually, Michael. I\u2019ve always dealt with people that -- I\u2019ve had some real bad ones in my life -- but I haven\u2019t seen people like this that would lie to this extent and then you also see the way that room was set up the other night where everybody in the room -- and I heard I won the debate and everybody tells me I won -- but the room was such a set-up. It was ridiculous. All the -- MICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Every time you said a word you got booed. What, were they all [Sen. Ted] Cruz [(R-TX)] supporters? [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 2/15/16; Media Matters, 2/16/16]\n\nMarch 1, 2016: Trump, \u201cthe most important candidate in modern American history,\u201d called in to The Savage Nation on Super Tuesday to explain why he is \u201cthe least racist person of all the candidates.\u201d Trump appeared on The Savage Nation for \u201ca super interview\u201d on Super Tuesday, kicking off the interview by attempting to distance himself from his move not to immediately disavow David Duke\u2019s endorsement in a CNN interview that aired the previous day. Savage immediately explained that he already knew that Trump was \u201cthe least racist person of all the candidates.\u201d Savage also said that the public ought to compare Trump\u2019s wife and Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s (R-FL) wife to understand which candidate had larger hands, prompting Trump to chuckle. The interview ended with Savage saying he will see Trump \u201ctonight at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d From the March 1, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): The most important candidate in modern American history, Donald Trump, live right now on The Savage Nation. Mr. Trump, thanks so much for taking the time on Super Tuesday to give us a super interview with you on The Savage Nation. DONALD TRUMP: Right. Thanks, Michael. SAVAGE: Donald, I want to put something to rest. I know that you\u2019re the least racist person of all of the candidates. I know it from your employees, I know it from your history. But you\u2019ve also been smeared continuously with this KKK garbage. And I know you\u2019ve denounced it. Can you clearly say that you denounce this endorsement on The Savage Nation? TRUMP: Yeah. Totally denounce. And I disavowed it. And I\u2019ve disavowed it numerous times. And I\u2019ve disavowed it on Twitter and on Facebook, and all over the place. But people refuse to accept it, Michael, because -- SAVAGE: Donald, I accept it because I know your history. It\u2019s a disgrace that [Sen. Marco] Rubio would fall to this level. But it tells us more about him than it does about anyone else. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 3/1/16]\n\nMarch 7, 2016: \u201cDonald, how do you take such abuse?\u201d A week later, Trump joined Savage on air to complain about \u201cliars\u201d in media attacking his business ventures. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand business,\u201d Savage said. \u201cI made billions and billions of dollars,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI started off with very, very little.\u201d Savage concluded the interview by saying, \u201cI hope you can come back to The Savage Nation and you don\u2019t forget me when you become president.\u201d Trump responded that he would \u201cnever forget\u201d Savage. From the March 7, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Before you go, Donald. You\u2019re a businessman. People don\u2019t understand business. Socialists like Bernie Sanders who never ran a corned beef stand don\u2019t understand that business means some businesses succeed and some fail. So what they do, like the creeps at the [New York] Daily News, they come up with some of your ventures that didn\u2019t work, they try to make it look like you\u2019re a crook or a bad businessman. What they don\u2019t understand is that business is a gamble. Some businesses work, some fail. Isn\u2019t that true? DONALD TRUMP: But my businesses really worked. And the ones-- they have these little things, number one they\u2019re still in business. I don\u2019t even know what they mean. They talk about a water company, they talk about these different things, I still have them. But my businesses work. I never even saw the thing in the Daily News. I mean the good news, I guess not a lot of people read the Daily News but my businesses worked. Hey Michael, I made billions and billions and billions of dollars. I started off with very, very little. And I made billions and billions of dollars -- SAVAGE: And that\u2019s something that the college class of spoiled, inheritance cases don\u2019t understand. Guys who say you inherited the money from your father. I happen to know from having read everything I could about you and your great father was he didn\u2019t give you a lot of money. He have you an initial seed loan, which you paid back. Your father was a great man, yet they even smeared him. Here\u2019s a man who built apartment houses all over middle-class Brooklyn and Queens, and they made him into a bad guy for doing it. So what more can you expect from these people? They\u2019ve never built a thing in their life, Donald. TRUMP: No, they\u2019re bad people, Michael. And they\u2019re liars. They\u2019re real liars. And it\u2019s a shame, it\u2019s a shame they can get away with it. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 3/7/16]\n\nMarch 22, 2016: Savage and Trump discussed Brussels airport bombings: \u201cYou are a hundred percent right.\u201d Shortly after two ISIS-perpetrated deadly explosions in an airport and metro station in Brussels, Belgium, killed at least 31 people and injured hundreds more, Trump joined Savage on air to talk about how he was \u201c100 percent right\u201d to call for a Muslim ban in the U.S. Savage also asked Trump if he would consider closing mosques in the U.S. as president. From the beginning of the March 22, 2016, interview on The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Donald, we're only interested in one question, and I heard some of your Today interview today, and that is the Islamo-fascist attack in Belgium. I know that you are shown to be 100 percent right by this attack when you said that you wouldn't admit anymore Muslims into the United States until we \u201cfigure this thing out.\u201d You were 100 percent right. But here's the question, Donald. What would you do about the radical mosques in America? Would you agree right now on The Savage Nation that you will consider closing the radical mosques in America? Because even liberal France has been doing this since the Paris terror attacks. I have to repeat this: Liberal, socialist France, even they have closed about 20 radical mosques because they decided that they want to live. Mr. Trump, what do you think should be done? DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have to have tremendous surveillance, and that includes the mosques whether we like it or don't like it. We have to be intelligent people. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 3/22/16]\n\nMarch 28, 2016: \u201cAmerica sees you as the greatest chance to protect us.\u201d Days before the Wisconsin primary, Trump called Savage to deny allegations that his campaign had planted false stories about Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in the National Enquirer. Savage opened the segment by congratulating Trump on the birth of his grandchild, then said that Trump\u2019s role as a grandfather makes Americans see him \u201cas the greatest chance to protect us.\u201d Here is the beginning of the March 28, 2016, interview on The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Here he is, the great man himself, Donald Trump. Welcome to The Savage Nation. Donald, thanks so much for being with us and, by the way, congratulations on the birth of your newest grandchild. DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely, that\u2019s great. Really happy about it. SAVAGE: Donald, I know what it feels like to be a grandparent. I know how protective it makes the grandfather, and I suppose that\u2019s why your popularity has swelled. Personally, I think because America sees you as the greatest chance to protect us, in plain English. You know, for the big issue, Donald, I know you\u2019ve disavowed any connection to these allegations against Ted Cruz and his alleged affairs. But let\u2019s be clear. You\u2019ve had more mud thrown at you than all of the other candidates put together. You\u2019ve been smeared like I\u2019ve never seen anyone smeared before. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 3/28/16]\n\nApril 4, 2016: Trump took to The Savage Nation to complain about media treating him \u201chorribly,\u201d and Savage implored Trump to \u201clisten to The Savage Nation, not to the campaign.\u201d Trump joined Savage again the day before the Wisconsin primary to complain about media treating him \u201chorribly\u201d and \u201cunfairly.\u201d In several lengthy responses, Trump talked about the poor treatment he believed he\u2019d received from the media and specifically The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and Megyn \u201cMad Dog\u201d Kelly. Savage also asked Trump not to let advisers on his campaign \u201cmoderate\u201d his extreme positions on immigration and the Muslim community, and said, \u201cI\u2019m almost imploring you to listen to The Savage Nation, not to the campaign advisers.\u201d From the April 4, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Everyone\u2019s saying you don\u2019t have specific plans, but the fact of the matter is I\u2019ve asked you specific questions over the last three months. I\u2019ve gotten specific answers. They don\u2019t want to hear it when you give specific answers. They make believe you\u2019re not giving them. So, what\u2019s the point of answering them if they make believe you\u2019re not answering them? I know where you\u2019re coming from. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 4/4/16, 4/4/16]\n\nApril 18, 2016: On the eve of the New York primary, Savage and Trump playfully argued about which of them is more important. Trump appeared on The Savage Nation on the eve of the New York primary to criticize Trump's political opponents in Republican primaries (and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton). Savage also repeatedly attempted to imply Trump\u2019s positions were influenced by Savage\u2019s books -- to lukewarm response. Savage also asked Trump, \u201cIn the face of all the insults and all those who are trying to tear you down, including those inside the Republican Party themselves, what do you use to maintain your inner strength?\u201d Trump seemed to answer that poll numbers and anticipated votes help. This is how Savage began the April 18, 2016, interview on The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Without further adieu, the man of the hour, Donald Trump. Welcome to the program, Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Michael, and you have been amazing. But wouldn\u2019t you maybe be the most important man, above me? Perhaps? Powerful voice -- SAVAGE: [laughs] Now I know that they\u2019ve tempered you, Donald. Somebody behind the scenes is starting to temper you a little bit. You\u2019re giving me a compliment -- that\u2019s a good sign. TRUMP: It\u2019s been amazing. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 4/18/16]\n\nApril 29, 2016: Trump called Savage to hear a sympathetic voice after his appearance at a state GOP event was heavily protested. Immediately after protesters forced Trump to use a rear entrance to arrive at a state GOP event where he spoke, Trump called The Savage Nation for a sympathetic ear. After Savage welcomed Trump to the show by congratulating him for surviving \u201cthe assault today\u201d (protests), the two launched into a series of attacks on Trump\u2019s opponents in the primaries. Savage then praised Trump for his dog-whistling \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech and allowed Trump to pivot to a series of talking points defending his foreign policy stance and describing his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we got along with Russia? You know, Putin said very nice things about me. It has zero influence -- he actually called me a genius, but that\u2019s OK -- has zero influence on me, Michael. Zero.\u201d This is how Savage began the April 29, 2016, conversation with Trump:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Mr. Trump, welcome. You survived the assault today. DONALD TRUMP: How are you? SAVAGE: Donald, how do you put up with this? How do you feel having to sneak into an event in the United States of America when illegitimate noncitizens try to block you? What does that do to you? [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 4/29/16]\n\nJune 1, 2016: Savage regaled Trump with a story about how he defended Trump in a conversation with a \u201cmajor-league guy\u201d who claimed to be Trump\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d Trump appeared on The Savage Nation again on June 1, 2016, to talk with Savage about the \u201cdishonest\u201d press and China. At one point, Savage told Trump that he had recently appeared on a TV show in which a person who apparently said he was Trump\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d criticized Trump in front of Savage, but Savage defended Trump. Savage wouldn\u2019t reveal the name of the person on air, but he told Trump he would email Trump communications staffer Hope Hicks with the information. The two then discussed the \u201cdishonest\u201d media\u2019s efforts to vet Trump\u2019s assertions that he had raised millions of dollars for veterans\u2019 groups. Trump ended the interview by telling Savage that he met a \u201ctremendously successful\u201d businesswoman who apparently told Trump she loved The Savage Nation. From the June 1, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I was on a TV show last week and a guy said to me, \u201cWhy do you support Donald Trump? He wants to make America great again. What does he want to do, take us back to slavery and the Great Depression?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat, are you crazy? What does that have to do with today?\u201d And you know, that\u2019s how crazy they are in the press. This was a major-league guy who said he was your friend, Donald, I swear to God. He said, \u201cWhat, does Donald want to take us back to slavery?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat, are you nuts?\u201d This is what we\u2019re dealing with. DONALD TRUMP: So somebody that said he was my friend? That\u2019s interesting. Am I allowed to know who it was? That\u2019s amazing. SAVAGE: I\u2019ll tell you what. I will email Hope Hicks the interview and the name. He said, \u201cI like Donald. He\u2019s my friend. But where does he want to take us? Back to slavery? The Great Depression, where women can\u2019t vote?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat, are you nuts? How could you bring him up -- how could you say he\u2019s saying that?\u201d This is the kind of absurd argument that we\u2019re getting from people who really have it in for this country, Donald. I faced it for 20 years. You\u2019re facing it now for a year. It\u2019s sickening, frankly. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 6/1/16]\n\nJuly 14, 2016: Trump called in to Savage Nation the day before he announced his vice presidential pick and told Savage he listens to the show. The day before announcing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate, Trump appeared on The Savage Nation to reassure Savage he was dedicated to his \u201cbase\u201d at the program. Trump and Savage discussed the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile (but did not use either man\u2019s name) and Trump said that he was familiar with what Savage thought about the \u201cevents\u201d because he listened to Savage\u2019s show. Savage then asked Trump if he would consider inducting Savage into the National Radio Hall of Fame in November, and Trump dodged the question. Savage again offered to head the NIH \u201cfor a dollar a year\u201d in the Trump administration, before ending the interview by advocating for Trump to pick Pence as his running mate. From the July 14, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Everyone is so thrilled that you came back to the show, and I\u2019m an honest guy in the media. I kind of say it like I feel. I don\u2019t think as carefully as I should somehow. But the fact is people were saying, \u201cHey, where\u2019s Donald Trump? Now that he\u2019s so popular, he won\u2019t come back. He\u2019s moved to the center.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, no, no. Just wait. He\u2019ll be back. He\u2019s true to his core.\u201d So, again, I have to say that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying now all over my Facebook. \u201cThank God Trump is back.\u201d And, yesterday you said you were going to build the wall. You confirmed that again, correct? DONALD TRUMP: Oh, a hundred percent. And it is so very popular, we put it in the platform. It\u2019s in the Republican platform, I don\u2019t know if you saw that, but that was sort of one of the things that I\u2019m very proud of. We did something else for the Evangelicals which is going to be fantastic. We\u2019re going to get rid of this Johnson change that was made years ago where it takes the power away from Evangelicals and others of religion. And you\u2019ll see some things happening there that are going to be very good. We have some very good things put in the platform. One of the things put in, though, is the wall. And as far as being back here, you\u2019ve been so amazing to me, Michael. Of course I would be back. I never heard anything, otherwise I would have called you five different times already. SAVAGE: You know what it is, Donald? Look, your campaign has gotten so big. You\u2019ve got so many layers of people. I don\u2019t have the desire to trouble you with calls. But the fact of the matter is I know that you\u2019re loyal to this audience. We are your base. We\u2019ll always be there for you. And the times right now are so troubled. We are in such troubled times, such dangerous water. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 7/14/16, 7/14/16]\n\nAugust 17, 2016: Savage told Trump, \u201cI have not gone everywhere. I\u2019ve been in your corner even when I couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d Last August, Trump called in to The Savage Nation again to talk with his \u201cold friend\u201d Savage. Savage assured Trump that, even though they didn\u2019t always stay in touch because Trump was busy campaigning, Savage was always in Trump\u2019s \u201ccorner\u201d and \u201cloved\u201d his recent speech about an \u201cideology test, an extreme vetting process\u201d for Muslims trying to immigrate to the U.S. From the August 17, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Mr. Trump? DONALD TRUMP: Yes? SAVAGE: How are you? I\u2019m your old friend -- remember me, Michael Savage? TRUMP: Oh, absolutely, Michael. How is Michael? SAVAGE: I have not gone anywhere. I\u2019ve been in your corner even when I couldn\u2019t reach you. I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re surging in the polls. [...] SAVAGE: I loved your speech the other day about foreign policy. I loved your idea of an ideology test, an extreme vetting process. I love stopping the nation building. This is what I think the people want -- I mean, they\u2019re thirsting for this kind of leadership. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 8/17/16, 8/17/16]\n\nSeptember 19, 2016: \u201cYou're the only man who could save us from this insanity. We need you, Donald. You\u2019ve got to become president.\u201d In September, Trump called in to The Savage Nation again to hear praise from Savage and discuss his plans to use \u201cprofiling\u201d of Muslims. Savage also repeatedly offered to say things he felt Trump could no longer say freely because \u201cthe rats in the media could use [it] against\u201d him and assured Trump that \u201cthe American people hate the people in the media.\u201d From the September 19, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Look, Donald, I don\u2019t want you to say anything that any of the rats in the media could use against you. They\u2019re the most vicious people I have ever seen. But in addition to being vicious, I have never seen attacks against the candidate of the type I am seeing against you. But want to hear the good news? The American people hate the people in the media. Their ratings are the lowest in history because they know they\u2019re liars, Donald. So all we can say is, don\u2019t let them intimidate you. Not that I think you would be intimidated by the likes of those people, but they are trying to smear you simply for stating the obvious and the truth. DONALD TRUMP: Well thank you, Michael, for that. And I\u2019ll tell you they are horrible, horrible people, many of them. They\u2019re liars and they\u2019re horrible people. The media is among the dishonest -- the most dishonest group of people I\u2019ve ever met, and I don\u2019t mean all of them but I mean a lot of them. And it\u2019s unbelievable what they do, how they can take things that are perfect and just twist them around. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 9/19/16]\n\nOctober 17, 2016: \u201cIt\u2019s life under Trump and death under Clinton.\u201d Trump joined Savage in October to talk about his perception that the presidential election would be \u201crigged\u201d and to criticize Clinton. Trump and Savage also discussed Trump\u2019s views on Russia, and Trump said he would meet with Putin before his inauguration if he were elected. Savage told Trump he was \u201cthe only thing we have left between us and pure anarchy,\u201d and he opened and closed the segment by reiterating that he believed \u201cit\u2019s life under Trump and death under Clinton.\u201d and From the October 17, 2016, edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I say it\u2019s life under Trump and death under Clinton. And I mean the death of our First and Second Amendments, for sure. Mr. Trump, you are the only thing we have left between us and pure anarchy. DONALD TRUMP: Well, it\u2019s going very well. I guess polls just came out from CNN an hour ago and they have us up by four in Ohio and doing really well everywhere, and this despite the press that\u2019s horrible, phony. They print lies; they want to put lies on all the time. And you see it better than anybody. They have stories that are fabricated and they put them on the front page. Total lies that they\u2019re willing to print on the front page of newspapers. And despite -- SAVAGE: Donald, where do they get all of these tarts from? Where do these tarts come from? TRUMP: Michael, there\u2019s a backlash like I\u2019ve never seen before. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 10/17/16]\n\nNovember 8, 2016: Trump called Savage on Election Day for a \u201cbeautiful interchange,\u201d and Savage thanked him for his \u201cloyalty.\u201d On Election Day, Trump called in to The Savage Nation and spoke about his \u201cmessage\u201d to Americans and his \u201cmovement.\u201d The two men thanked each other for their \u201cloyalty,\u201d and Savage also asked Trump, yet again, if they would be seeing each other at Mar-a-Lago. Savage also said that, if Trump won, he would \u201cknow in my own heart I had something to do with it.\u201d Savage concluded the interview by calling Trump \u201cthe greatest warrior I have seen fighting for the American people.\u201d From the November 8, 2016, interview on The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): Donald, we\u2019re getting calls on the show today in this first hour, with people I asked them what they would like to say to you. And overwhelmingly they\u2019re saying win, lose, or draw you\u2019ve already done the country a great service. You have changed the national conversation, Donald. You know that, don\u2019t you? DONALD TRUMP: Well, I really appreciate. I\u2019ve had thank yous from so many people. You know, it\u2019s a vicious business. I used to think real estate was vicious. Real estate people are like soft people compared to these [unintelligible] for the last year and a half. SAVAGE: [laughter] I can just imagine. I can just imagine. So after this election -- first of all, Donald, I want to thank you personally for showing your loyalty to me personally. I know that you\u2019re not doing a lot of national radio shows today. I know you wanted to come onto The Savage Nation because, in many ways, we had you on before anyone else did on a regular basis, and I know your loyalty is very important to you. I told the people that you\u2019re the most loyal politician I\u2019ve ever encountered in this business. So again, I want to thank you for that. Period. TRUMP: Well thank you, Michael. And you\u2019ve been loyal also, and I did want to do your show. And I have done very, very little today because I\u2019m sort of sitting back and seeing what happens. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 11/8/16]\n\nTrump administration officials have been using Savage\u2019s show for pushing talking points\n\nJanuary 6, 2017: Then-Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn called in to The Savage Nation to talk about the inauguration, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a big fan.\u201d Weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Boris Epshteyn, then an adviser to Trump\u2019s transition team, came on the show to talk with Savage about logistics for the event. At the start of the interview, Epshteyn told Savage he was a \u201cbig fan.\u201d Savage spent the majority of the short interview asking Epshteyn pointed questions about why he hadn\u2019t been invited to cover the inauguration as a member of the media, and pressing Epshteyn for more details about the setup for media coverage of the Inauguration. From the January 6 edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): With us is a really special guest, and his name is Boris Epshteyn. \u2026 He is a fabulous political strategist and he lives in New York City and he has a political view that you can summarize in six words: small government, low taxes, and national security. OK. Mr. Epshteyn, welcome to The Savage Nation. Thanks for being with us. BORIS EPSHTEYN: Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. It\u2019s great to be on. I\u2019m a big fan. SAVAGE: [laughter] Oh, I\u2019m glad to hear you even know who I am, because -- who compiled the guest list for the inauguration? EPSHTEYN: Well, it\u2019s a long process but there are a lot of -- so many Americans reaching out, wanting to take part, and we\u2019re inviting anybody and everybody from all over this beautiful country to come and celebrate with us, be with us, be united with us, and celebrate this peaceful transfer of power with us. [...] SAVAGE: On another point, who in the media is given the VIP treatment at the -- if media people can go, right, they can be sent by NBC, CBS, Fox News, they have their own place, right? EPSHTEYN: Well, there\u2019s a credentialing process. And that process is undertaken by a part of my team, actually, here in the communications department. And we are giving every network, every broadcast, every outlet equal opportunity. So we\u2019re not playing favorites here. SAVAGE: So what if I wanted to go? Michael Savage, who -- I did a lot to help Mr. Trump all those months and no one believed in him, how would I get on that list? EPSHTEYN: You\u2019d send me an email. And -- SAVAGE: [laughter] I\u2019m sending you an email? I don\u2019t know, look, I don\u2019t want to put you on the spot, but I have not been invited, Mr. Epshteyn, and I didn\u2019t push either. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 1/6/17]\n\nMarch 1, 2017: Vice President Pence called in to The Savage Nation after Trump\u2019s address to Congress, telling Savage that Trump \u201cappreciates and respects and admires\u201d him. Vice President Mike Pence joined Savage the day after Trump\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress. Savage told Pence he was \u201ctotally moved\u201d by Trump\u2019s speech. Pence pushed the administration\u2019s stance on health care and \u201ccriminal illegal immigrants.\u201d Savage then told Pence about his conversation with Trump at Mar-a-Lago over ice cream, and Pence responded that he knew how much Trump \u201cappreciated and respects and admires\u201d Savage. From the March 1 edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I had the great honor of being at Mar-a-Lago 10 days ago on a Saturday night when the president appeared. I was hoping he'd be there. I didn't think I'd get so much as a handshake or a hello. But I was lucky enough to be invited to have dessert with the President Trump and he sat with me for over 60 minutes. I thought it was a few minutes. My wife said, \u201cYou know you were there over 60 minutes with Donald eating dessert,\u201d and I said, \u201cI know. I don't eat dessert but I did for him because I couldn't say no to vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup even though I haven't had it since I'm a child.\u201d He is exactly what he sounds like. He doesn't change privately or publicly as you said. He's a very honest man. He is what he looks like and he believes every word he says. MIKE PENCE: That's such a great comment. And I know how much he appreciates and respects and admires you and your voice in the national debate. But I love you reflecting on that. I got asked on a couple of TV shows this morning about a difference and the different in tone of the speech and I told people that the president who spoke at the podium last night is the president that I serve with every day. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 3/1/17]\n\nJune 1, 2017: EPA head Scott Pruitt joined Savage to talk about \u201cfake science\u201d on climate change as the Trump administration pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, and Savage said, \u201cPlease tell the president that we all applaud what he has done today.\u201d As the Trump administration faced significant criticism for announcing that the U.S. was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt called in to The Savage Nation and entertained Savage\u2019s conspiracy theories about \u201cfake science\u201d on climate change. Savage ended the interview by thanking Pruitt and telling him to \u201ctell the president we all applaud what he has done today.\u201d From the June 1 edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): It\u2019s a great day for America because, look, if the science supported the idea that man was harming the planet by increasing the carbon dioxide as a result of his activities, I would say so. But the fact of the matter is much of the science today that is being quoted is based upon fake science. You\u2019ve heard about fake news. I have studied the science or I wouldn\u2019t be talking like this. The Democrats don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re talking about. If you asked [Sen.] Sheldon Whitehouse [(D-RI)], who just attacked Trump for saying he\u2019s betraying the country in the service of the Koch brothers, I would say to Sheldon Whitehouse, \u201cCan you sit down with a pen and show me what carbon looks like as a molecule? Please show it to me. And please explain to me how come ancient core samples from the Antarctic show that there was climate change going on hundreds and thousands of years before man industrialized.\u201d He would not have an answer for us, Mr. Pruitt. The science is fake science that they\u2019ve been foisting upon a gullible public. SCOTT PRUITT: You know what\u2019s interesting, Michael? There was a great article in The Wall Street Journal to your point by Steven Koonin, a scientist at NYU, called \u201cRed Team, Blue Team.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you saw it or not. But he proposed that we should have a red team, blue team approach with respect to CO2. We should have red team scientists and blue team scientists in an open setting, debate, discuss, and have an open discussion about what do we know, what don\u2019t we know, and the American people deserve truth -- [...] SAVAGE: All I can say for my audience, to the EPA head Scott Pruitt, who you\u2019ve been listening to on this very important day in American history, is thank you very much for driving this discussion in the right direction and please tell the president that we all applaud what he has done today. It took great courage to stand up to the entire world, and America will no longer be a doormat. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 6/1/17]\n\nJune 2, 2017: Pence did damage control over exiting the Paris climate agreement the very next day on The Savage Nation. The day after Pruitt appeared on The Savage Nation to talk about the U.S. pulling out of the climate agreement, Pence called Savage for a second round of positive messaging. The segment was filled with some signature Savage pseudoscience. Pence and Savage also defended Trump\u2019s invocation of the nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d phrase. From the June 2 edition of The Savage Nation:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I was just telling the audience that I\u2019m the only person in the media -- and it\u2019s true -- that has an actual Ph.D. from a great university in a science. And all the evidence indicates to me that this whole global warming business is hyperbole. But putting that aside, vice president, leaving the Paris accords was good for the country as a whole. Can you please tell us why? PENCE: [laughter] Well, number one, just thank you for your strong support. Look, what the world saw yesterday, frankly, what the world saw last week when the president was traveling from the Middle East to Europe, is an American president putting America first. You know the -- SAVAGE: And it\u2019s -- what\u2019s amazing to me is that the loser, Hillary Clinton, is calling that hatred. In other words, she\u2019s saying anyone who supports America and puts America first is a hater. This is how upside-down the world is, Vice President Pence. [Westwood One, The Savage Nation, 6/2/17]\n\nPresident Trump and Savage had dessert \u201calone\u201d at Mar-a-Lago in February\n\nFebruary 18, 2017: Savage and Trump reportedly spent \u201cover an hour\u201d alone talking at Mar-a-Lago, and Savage said Trump told him he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be president\u201d without Savage's support. On the February 17 edition of The Savage Nation, Savage told his listeners he would be seeing Trump the following day, but he said he would probably not be interviewing the president. Afterward, Savage said that he spent \u201cover an hour\u201d alone with Trump on February 18 at Mar-a-Lago, eating dessert together and reportedly discussing Savage\u2019s views on climate change. According to Savage, Trump told the radio host that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be president\u201d without Savage, and Reince Priebus apparently told Savage he was a longtime fan of the show and gave Savage his cell number to text \u201canytime.\u201d From the February 22 edition of The Savage Nation, in which Savage reflected warmly on the visit:\n\nMICHAEL SAVAGE (HOST): I was invited to a dinner by my friend from Newsmax, Chris Ruddy. And he had told me that Laura Ingraham would be at the table, my family would be at the table, and several other individuals who will remain anonymous would be at the table. And of course there was no guarantee that I would meet the president. I went there on a chance that I\u2019d have a minute with him or five seconds with him. But I will tell you this: It was longer than five seconds. I sat with the president for well over an hour, alone, in front of the entire club. We had dessert together. [...] Do you know what [Trump] did? The president of the United States, who the vermin in the media try to turn into a man who does not exist inside his skin -- the low-lifes, the Lilliputians -- do you know what he did? He put his arm around me and he looked at my son and he said, \u201cWe need another 25 years out of this man. Keep him well.\u201d That\u2019s Donald Trump. That\u2019s the real man.

Joseph McCarthy \u201ca true American hero,\u201d and advocated for the Trump administration to seize control of the media because CNN and MSNBC were \u201cpracticing a silent form of jihad against America.\u201d [Media Matters, 6/14/17, 6/13/17]\n\nIn June, Savage called for \u201cWorld War II-style internment camps\u201d following the London terror attacks. On his June 5 radio show, Savage reiterated that he \u201chad a big hand in helping Donald Trump ... get his message across and, therefore, getting him elected,\u201d and he advocated for \u201cWorld War II-style internment camps\u201d as \u201cthe answer\u201d to recent terror attacks. Despite acknowledging that \u201cit is true that most [people interred in WWII] were innocent,\u201d Savage later asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you intern\u201d the \u201c1,000\u201d people on the DHS watchlist, adding, \u201cHow do we know that the internment in World War II didn\u2019t help us win the war?\u201d [Media Matters, 6/5/17]\n\nSavage said Muslim immigrants traveled to the U.S. to \u201cstab people in the street.\u201d In December 2016, Savage mocked American Muslims worried about Trump\u2019s election, suggested Muslim immigrants came here \u201cto stab people in the street, and jump the curb with a car and run them over,\u201d and argued that if you \u201cinterpret\u201d the Quran \u201cliterally, you'll wind up cutting everyone's throat, blowing things up, and killing children.\u201d [Media Matters, 2/21/17]\n\nSavage theorized liberals like Sen.

One of the most egregious of those appointments was radio host Michael Savage, whom Trump put on the board of the Presidio Trust. My former colleague Dave Gilson got hold via FOIA of a trove of emails from Savage\u2019s time on the board of the trust, which runs a 1,200-acre park near the Golden Gate Bridge. The emails detail how the shock jock, sputtering and bombastic as always, used his position to try to downplay the park\u2019s role in the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, and to push other right-wing causes. As Dave put it, \u201cSavage\u2019s first months as a Presidio Trust board member were marked by prickly outbursts, culminating in a sudden push to inject his toxic politics into park business.\u201d\n\nBut a year into his appointment Savage may be out of a job. On Thursday afternoon, Newsmax reported that Savage had received a letter that morning informing him that President Joe Biden was requesting his resignation; if Savage did not resign, he would be fired by the end of the work day. (Breitbart also reported it had seen the letter. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment from Mother Jones.)\n\nAccording to Newsmax, the letter to Savage (real name Michael Weiner) came from Catherine Russell, the director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel Director, and read: \u201cDear Mr. Weiner, On behalf of President Biden, I am writing to request your resignation as a Member of the Presidio Trust, Board of Directors. Please submit your resignation to me by the close of business today. Should we not receive your resignation, your position with the Board will be terminated effective 6:00PM today. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a purge by the Biden team,\u201d Savage told the conservative news outlet, also stating, \u201cI will not be forced to resign!\u201d He later appeared on Newsmax TV claiming that the board is \u201cthe equivalent, in a way, of the Supreme Court, a president can appoint us but a president cannot fire us.\u201d Savage claimed his lawyer disputed the president\u2019s authority to fire him, and that he planned to file a lawsuit if Biden follows through. When asked why Biden might want to kick him off, Savage mused that the president wanted to turn it into \u201cWoodstock West\u201d and erase the park\u2019s military history. \u201cThey\u2019ll turn it into a Black Lives Matter plaza,\u201d the Newsmax host quipped in response. \u201cOh don\u2019t say that,\u201d Savage responded. Savage ended the segment by holding up a copy of Mao\u2019s Little Red Book. \u201cThis is starting to look more and more like the purges of China under Mao Zedong.\u201d\n\nRadio legend and podcaster Michael Savage blasts the Biden Administration's push to 'cancel' him. @ASavageNation. https://t.co/VlT7z8drtO pic.twitter.com/2Ypvc7Vm76 \u2014 Newsmax (@newsmax) May 21, 2021\n\nAs of Friday, it\u2019s unclear if the Biden administration had followed through on terminating Savage\u2019s position. But as Dave\u2019s story from last month revealed, they\u2019d have plenty of reason to object to him remaining on the job. Savage made his career as a conservative commentator willing to spew racist and homophobic hate, and styled himself the \u201cGodfather of Trumpmania.\u201d He claims Trump personally called him to offer the spot on the Presidio Board, a job that often goes to connected political donors of each party. Those board members must have \u201cextensive knowledge and experience in one or more of the fields of city planning, finance, real estate development, and resource conservation.\u201d Savage presumably got there based on that last category, albeit with somewhat dubious qualifications. The FOIAs from Savage\u2019s early days on the board didn\u2019t paint a pretty picture:\n\nPrompted for details on what he would like to do with his new role, Savage, who has no military experience, emailed back that he hoped to see \u201ca new inclusion of the Presidio\u2019s proud military heritage\u201d and wanted to use his botanical knowledge to create \u201ca native American medicinal plant garden.\u201d Asked for examples of his personal ties to the park to include in a press release, he suggested quoting his 2012 action novel Abuse of Power, in which the former base is a backdrop for a high-speed chase along roads named \u201cfor military commanders who knew how to defeat the enemy, not placate the media and foreign lobbyists.\u201d\n\nHe said it was \u201coffensive\u201d that he had to undergo an ethics review required of all board members, and when asked to fill out a mandatory, non-public financial disclosure form he threatened the Presidio\u2019s staff that he was \u201cin touch with the White House about this intrusive inquisition.\u201d When he attended his first public forum over Zoom last July, one resident of the Presidio questioned him about the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s claim that he \u201csubscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory.\u201d Afterward Savage erupted in private emails to fellow board members and Presidio staff, writing, \u201cWHO PERMITTED THE LAST SPEAKER TO ATTACK ME? HOW DID SHE GET ON THE LIST OF \u2018APPROVED SPEAKERS\u2019?\u201d When the trust\u2019s CEO reminded Savage that as a government entity they could not restrict the speech of citizens at meetings thanks to the First Amendment, Savage wrote back, \u201c\u201cYes, I am aware of the \u2018law\u2019. Do not appreciate your lecture. Not what I asked. How did this hateful person get to be chosen?\u201d\n\nOutside of internal office culture, Savage\u2019s most noteworthy contribution during his time on the board has been his effort to whitewash the Presidio\u2019s role in internment. \u201cYou would think that the military heritage museum would show us the greatness of the US Army at the Presidio, but it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he complained on his radio show last December. \u201cInstead, it shows us big things about the Japanese internment.\u201d He\u2019d already been pushing a similar argument in emails behind-the-scenes. \u201cNow that we are looking more closely at the Heritage exhibit, I want to discuss the INCLUSION OF THE DEFEAT OF HITLER! There is far too much emphasis on the JAPANESE INTERNMENT,\u201d he wrote. (Given its location, the museum has traditionally focused on the Pacific aspects of the war, rather than Europe.) \u201cWe must insist this exhibit display the DEFEAT OF HITLER\u2019S \u2018SUPERMEN\u2019 by AMERICA\u2019S EVERYMAN. And, while we are at it, we must emphasize that it was Franklin Roosevelt, a far left LIBERAL, who interred the Japanese. We must insist on HISTORICAL truths.\u201d\n\nThe act that established the Presidio Trust in the 1990s spells out how a president can appoint a board member, but makes no mention of removing an officer, so it\u2019s unclear if Savage\u2019s legal interpretation that he can\u2019t be fired is correct. When reached for comment on Thursday, the Presidio did not respond to questions about Savage\u2019s status on the board. It did offer a largely boilerplate comment that hints that the trust believes a president can remove board members, saying, in part, \u201cOur Board members serve at the pleasure of the President.\u201d\n\nRead the full investigation into Savage\u2019s role at the Presidio here.\n\nDave Gilson contributed reporting to this story."}, {"url": "https://gazettereview.com/2018/04/what-happened-to-michael-savage/", "page_content": "A popular radio host, Michael Savage rose to fame for his nationally syndicated talk show, The Savage Nation which has aired across the U.S. for over two decades.

Based out of San Francisco, California, the program is known for entering around Savage\u2019s bold perspective on American ideals and culture.

His most recent release God, Faith, and Reason, a non-political title in which he discusses his lifelong quest for spiritual truth, was published in November 2017.\n\nA strong supporter of Donald Trump, he had supported his campaign in 2016. Considering the fact that the president himself is a fan and listener of Savage\u2019s show, it\u2019s not surprising to know that the radio host and his family were invited to meet President Trump several times during the holiday season in 2017.\n\nAs far as other things go, he was also invited onto the television show, PoliticKING with Larry King alongside Peter Kauffmann and Amy Holmes last year. Previously, he had also been featured in the show in 2015 and 2016.\n\nLast year, he had also made the headlines after getting into a confrontation with a man at a Tiburon restaurant in Marin County.

Two years later, he earned a second masters in anthropology.\n\nFast forward to the early 90\u2019s, and he had landed himself a position with the San Francisco radio station, KGO. After a year of filing in for Ray Taliaferro, he was given his own show on the sister station, KSFO. A local hit, he eventually reached number one in Arbitron ratings. By 2006, he was attracting eight to ten million listeners per week. With that, his show became one of the most widely broadcasted in the U.S. at the time.\n\nAs of 2018, he has hosted his radio show for over two decades. In fact, he recently celebrated 24 years on the radio earlier this year. Hailed as one of the most creative talk show hosts ever to have been on the air, he has dominated the airwaves with more than 20 million weekly listeners across the globe. In 2016, his efforts led him to be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nAside from his radio career, Savage is also known for having written more than 25 books, many of which were best-sellers. Some of these include Earth Medicine, The Art of Feeding Children Well, Dr. Savage\u2019s High Fiber Counter, The People\u2019s Herbal, and The Complete Book of Homeopathy. Most recently, he published the fictional title Xenon on February 5th, 2018.\n\nDid you know that he\u2019s also appeared on television? That\u2019s right, he once hosted his own television show on MSNBC. A few months after its premiere, however, he was fired after he made certain remarks to a caller, who was later identified as a prank caller.\n\nMichael Savage\u2019s Plans for the Future\n\nIf his recent activities are of any indication, the talk show host will not be retiring from his position anytime soon.

Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List.\n\nSavage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as \"fostering extremism.\" He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.\n\nSince 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for \"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred.\"\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSavage was born Michael Alan Weiner in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner, Jewish emigrants from Russia. He described his childhood as difficult. His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak. Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970, and his mother died in 2003.\n\nAfter graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself. Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972. He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.\n\nShift in political opinions\n\nSavage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a \"calling card.\" Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\" Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.\n\nAcquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\" Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \"political opposition\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit.\n\nRadio\n\nThe rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.\n\nIn mid 2006, Savage had 8\u201310 million listeners per week, which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He has described his show's production as one with a \"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\" Mark de la Vi\u00f1a of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: \"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\"\n\nBy 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time. Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled \"Party of One\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed \"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\" According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \"rattle\" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010. He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \"real writer\" who had understood his subject.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.\n\nMSNBC television show\n\nSavage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, \"Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?\" Sorenson, at the time, called Savage \"brash, passionate and smart,\" and promised that he would provide \"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\"\n\nFour months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a \"sodomite\", to which the caller answered, \"Yes, I am.\" Savage then said to the caller,\n\nOh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.\n\nThe day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.\n\nPolitical views\n\nMichael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\" He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence. Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.\n\nIn 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\" In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush. Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.\n\nRegarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had \"great ideas\" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee. On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich \"1 million dollars\" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a \"quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist\" and a possible foreign usurper, in the 2012 election.\n\nSavage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.\n\nLegal defense contributions\n\nSavage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton. Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund. The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.\n\nIn November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.\n\nLieutenant Michael Behenna\n\nOn his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.\n\nMichael Savage Scholarship\n\nIn July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question \"What Does It Mean to Be an American?\" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.\n\nAwards\n\nOn June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.\n\nNational Radio Hall of Fame\n\nIn 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]\n\nCriticism\n\nIn July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that \"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\" David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation \"is an act, a put-on.\" Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.\n\nOn April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, \"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?\" This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.\n\nIn the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \"aggressive act\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - \"you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem\" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.\n\nCatholic Church and Immigration\n\nIn March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \"pastoral support\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology.\"\n\nOn March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California.\n\nC-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award\n\nWhen Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.\n\nDispute with CAIR\n\nIn early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \"need deportation\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \"take your religion and shove it up your behind\" because \"I'm sick of you.\" On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.\n\nSavage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate\". CAIR called the suit \"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to \"comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations.\" The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.\n\nAutism\n\nIn July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \"a racket\" designed to get disability payments for \"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\" He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:\n\nNow, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, \"Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot.\"\n\nIn July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children. WOR issued a statement saying, \"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\" Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising, and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show. Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \"ripped out of context\" by \"far left Stalinists\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits. On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.\n\nSavage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.\n\nBanned from entering the United Kingdom\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\". During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \"lunatic\".\n\nDuring a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\" When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.\n\nOf the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: \"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\" In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: \"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\" While Sam Leith wrote: \"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.\n\nVeteran PTSD\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \"weakness\". According to Savage, \"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhile in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji. That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage, likely combined with the inappropriateness of \"Weiner Nation\" as a good show title.\n\nSavage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink. Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009. Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher. In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii. Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley. In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year. In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: \"... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"\n\nBooks\n\nIn total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times bestsellers and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list. have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.\n\nHis earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.\n\nHis more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.\n\nIn 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books. In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action \"reverse discrimination\", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.\n\nIn January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at \"liberal media bias\", the \"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\", gay activists, and liberals.\n\nIn January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.\n\nIn April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the \"Political Zoo\", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.\n\nIn October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\"\n\nIn November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on \"My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know\", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \"the Hand of Allah\". The publisher has described the novel by saying, \"will make 9/11 look like child's play\".\n\nIn October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments \"[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country.\" It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List for six weeks.\n\nIn March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller List."}, {"url": "https://salaryandnetworth.com/michael-savage/", "page_content": "Michael Alan Weiner, known professionally as Michael Savage is a renowned American radio host and conservative political commentator.

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nThe Savage Nation (also called The Michael Savage Show) was an American conservative talk radio show hosted by Michael Savage. The program was heard by approximately 11 million listeners a week, which made it the 7th most listened to radio show in the country.[1]\n\nThe show was based in San Francisco, California, and was syndicated through Cumulus Media and Westwood One.[2]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 1 Views: 7 165\n\nSavage Nation Podcast August 23, 2019 Transcription\n\nProgram summary\n\n1994\u20131998\n\nIn 1994, Michael Savage (then publishing under his birth name Michael Weiner) submitted for publication a manuscript called Immigrants and Epidemics. The proposed book, which was about the influx of foreign diseases due to the wave of illegal immigrants, was promptly rejected for what Savage contends was its politically incorrect subject matter. This, along with the suggestions of friends and acquaintances, inspired Savage to record a radio demo about the very subject of his manuscript. He mailed the tape to 250 radio stations, and on March 21, 1994, The Savage Nation was born on KGO in San Francisco.\n\nSavage's radio career began modestly enough as a fill-in host for Ray Taliaferro. On January 2, 1995, Savage began hosting The Savage Nation on KGO's new sister station KSFO, which at the time changed its lineup to be completely conservative.[3]\n\n1999\u20132003\n\nIn 1999, Savage began hosting separate local and national parts of The Savage Nation.[4] On September 21, 2000, Savage made the entire Savage Nation show nationally syndicated through Talk Radio Network.[5] After one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in more than 200 markets.[citation needed] Savage's fill-in guest hosts include former U.S. congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan, Rick Roberts, Mancow, and Peter Weisbach. Talk radio host Lars Larson is also a former guest host, although his show now directly competes with The Savage Nation.\n\n2003\u20132012\n\nIn June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO, which refused to renegotiate his contract, and KSFO dropped his show on June 2.[6] In July 2003, he began his show on rival station KNEW.[7]\n\nAs of 2009, Savage had 8-10 million listeners per week, making his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States.[8]\n\nThe Savage Nation was removed from KNEW's schedule on September 10, 2009, as the station had \"decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction [sic].\" It was later picked up by sports station KTRB, but that agreement ended when Comerica Bank foreclosed on the station. Savage advised listeners that the show can be heard in the Bay Area via Sacramento-area KSTE.[9]\n\nSavage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract, which, though it expired at the end of 2010, contained clauses that granted Talk Radio Network the right to match any offer in perpetuity.[10] Savage won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, leading to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but also was required to agree to a four-week non-compete clause, which prevented The Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.[11]\n\nThe Savage Nation was revived on Cumulus Media on October 23, 2012, the day the non-compete clause expired. It aired in a new time slot, 9:00 PM to 12:00 midnight ET, replacing the weeknight edition of John Batchelor's news magazine.[citation needed]\n\n2013\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Savage announced during his show that effective January 2014, he would air during the afternoon drive hours of 3 p.m to 6 p.m, ET, replacing Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks.[citation needed]\n\nFeud with Sean Hannity\n\nSavage has been involved in a personal dispute with talk show host Sean Hannity, whose slot on Cumulus he replaced at the beginning of 2014. Savage said about Hannity: \"My competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat\u2013Republican talking points. That's all he's ever done. That's all he can do. He has no education. I'm just going to lay it on the line, I'm not going to mince words.\"[12]\n\n2016 United States presidential election\n\nSavage was widely credited with helping Donald Trump become President of the United States and is known as the \"Godfather of Trumpamania\".[13][14]\n\nEnd of terrestrial syndication\n\nIn January 2019, The Savage Nation was cut to two hours, only one of which is carried on terrestrial radio; the second hour is carried exclusively as a podcast. On September 30, 2020, Savage announced that Cumulus Media and Westwood One withdrew the terrestrial radio show from syndication on January 1, 2021, leaving only the podcast; he also stated he was under a gag order as to why the change was being made.[15]\n\nFormat\n\nEach hour of the daily three-hour broadcast usually begins with a monologue by Savage. Being a political commentator by trade, he often discusses issues in American politics and society in general. Many times, this leads to a passionate diatribe by Savage, a staple of The Savage Nation. Savage often takes calls in the second segment to comment on what was discussed in the previous segment.\n\nGuests have traditionally been a rare occurrence, but they have become more frequent since 2007. From 2009 until the end of the TRN run, the entire third hour of most shows was devoted to pre-taped interviews with guests.\n\nIntroduction and music\n\nMusic is an integral part of The Savage Nation. Savage often extends the role of music beyond bumper music to be as much the content of the show as what he's talking about. (For instance, there was a period of several days in 2006 when Savage played \"Living on a Thin Line\" by The Kinks concurrent with his discussions of America's internal vulnerabilities.)\n\nHe also played \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols and \"Living on a Thin Line\", and agreed that \"there's no England now\" after being banned from the U.K. by British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.\n\nThe signature musical introduction to The Savage Nation is the beginning of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\", followed by an announcer saying, \"Warning: The Michael Savage Show contains adult language, adult content, psychological nudity. Listener discretion is advised.\" For years, this was followed by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Looks That Kill\" and Metallica's \"The Shortest Straw\" to conclude the introduction; following the move from TRN to Cumulus in 2012, the opening was revamped, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Live Wire\" replaced the latter two songs.\n\nFor bumper music, Savage has used \"Motorbreath\", \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\", \"Holier Than Thou\", \"Jump in the Fire\", \"To Live Is to Die\", \"Battery\", \"Blackened\", \"Sad but True\", \"Ain't My Bitch\", \"Fuel\", \"The Shortest Straw\", and \"Don't Tread on Me\" by Metallica, as well as \"Du Hast\" and \"Tier\" by Rammstein, Nirvana, \"Big Gun\" by AC/DC, and \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine. As of 2015, Judas Priest's \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" has generally played at the 30-minute break.\n\nWhile Savage has previously criticized pop culture on his program, he is a self-proclaimed rock music fan. On his July 19, 2006 show, Savage said he is a huge fan of the German group Rammstein, and that he often drives around at night blasting their music.

The conservative host maintains a large audience of listeners across the country and ranks third among talk shows currently. Savage, whose real name is Michael Alan Weiner, airs his show on stations in the U.S.\n\nSavage can list a number of degrees to his credit, including two master\u2019s degrees, one in medical anthropology and the other medical botany. He also holds a Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine from the University of California, Berkeley. He has authored a number of books on the subject of homeopathy and herbal medicine in addition to writing four New York Times bestsellers as well. In total, Savage has authored 29 books and has written eight books under his pseudonym.\n\nSome critics have responded to Savage\u2019s outspoken views as fostering hate and extremism. In fact, the radio personality is not allowed to enter the UK because of his political philosophy. While his radio program certainly sparks controversy, Savage can also turn the theme around and direct his show toward topics that include health, medicine, literature, theology, music, sports, and esoteric content. Regardless of the format, listeners continue to tune in to listen to Savage\u2019s highly opinionated thoughts and right-wing discourse.\n\nAs Savage\u2019s show is the third-most listened talk show in the nation, you will find that advertising on his program may well be worth your while.

At its peak in 2009, the program was heard by 8\u201310 million listeners a week and syndicated across the U.S. in over 300 markets, making it among the most listened to radio shows in the country.[1]\n\nAs of 2014, Talkers Magazine estimates Savage's audience at 5 million listeners, in sixth place among talk radio programs.[2] However,in both the March and April 2013 \"Talkers Heavy Hundred\" Savage ranked at number five, between Glenn Beck #4, and Ed Schultz #6, as \"most important\" talk personality in U.S. radio.[3][4]\n\nThe show is based out of San Francisco, California and is syndicated through Westwood One.[5]\n\nProgram summary\n\n1994\u20131998\n\nIn 1994, Michael Savage (then publishing under his birth name Michael Weiner) submitted for publication a manuscript called Immigrants and Epidemics. The proposed book, which was about the influx of foreign diseases due to the wave of illegal immigrants, was promptly rejected for what Savage contends was its politically incorrect subject matter. This, along with the suggestions of friends and acquaintances, inspired Savage to record a radio demo about the very subject of his manuscript. He mailed the tape to 250 radio stations, and on March 21, 1994, The Savage Nation was born on KGO in San Francisco.\n\nSavage's radio career began modestly enough as a fill-in host for Ray Taliaferro. On January 2, 1995, Savage began hosting his own program, The Savage Nation, on KGO sister station KSFO, which at the time changed its lineup to be completely conservative.[6]\n\nAt the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage soared to #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time slot in Northern California.[7]\n\n1999\u20132003\n\nIn 1999, he came to the attention of the Talk Radio Network.\n\nOn January 17, 2000, he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. His national experiment was a success, and, on September 21, 2000, he stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour national show The Savage Nation. After one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in more than 200 markets.[citation needed] Savage's fill-in guest hosts include former U.S. congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan, Rick Roberts, Mancow, and Peter Weisbach. Talk radio host Lars Larson is also a former guest host, although his show now directly competes with The Savage Nation.\n\n2003\u20132012\n\nIn June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO, which refused to renegotiate his contract, and KSFO dropped his show on June 2.[8] On July 1, 2003 he began his show on a different station: KNEW in San Francisco.\n\nAs of 2009, Savage had 8-10 million listeners per week, making his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States.[9] Savage calls his listeners \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He says that he tries to make a show that has a \"...hard edge combined with humor and education... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\"[7]\n\nSavage was named the 2007 recipient of Talkers Magazine\u2019s Freedom of Speech Award. According to Talkers Magazine, Savage was honored \"for being the first major conservative radio talk show host to criticize President George W. Bush on his policies and encourage hosts of all political ideologies to remain independent of partisan loyalties.\"[10] Previous recipients of the Freedom of Speech Award include Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe Savage Nation was removed from KNEW's schedule on September 10, 2009 as the station had \"decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction [sic].\" It was later picked up by sports station KTRB, but that agreement ended when Comerica Bank foreclosed on the station. Savage advised listeners that the show can be heard in the Bay Area via Sacramento-area KSTE.[11]\n\nSavage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract, which, though it expired at the end of 2010, contained clauses that granted Talk Radio Network the right to match any offer in perpetuity.[12] Savage won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, leading to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but also was required to agree to a four-week non-compete clause, which will prevent The Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.[13]\n\nThe Savage Nation was revived on Cumulus Media Networks on October 23, 2012, the day the non-compete clause expired. It airs in a new time slot, 9:00 PM to 12:00 midnight ET, replacing the weeknight edition of John Batchelor's news magazine.[14]\n\n2013-\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Savage announced during his show that starting January 2014, he will move to the afternoon drive hours of 3 p.m to 6 p.m ET. He replaces Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks.[15]\n\nFeud with Sean Hannity\n\nSavage has been involved in a personal dispute with talk-show host Sean Hannity, whose slot on Cumulus he replaced at the beginning of 2014. Savage said about Hannity: \"My competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat-Republican talking points. That's all he's ever done. That's all he can do. He has no education. I'm just going to lay it on the line, I'm not going to mince words.\"[16] Hannity said of Savage, \"The poor guy is just an angry, depressed, and jealous human being who has been hanging around the backwaters of broadcasting for too many years. Now in his 70's, it\u2019s sad to see that he is so angry, envious, and obsessed with fellow broadcasters. Perhaps his anger and conflict comes from his skinny dipping days in Fiji with his liberal poet friend Allen Ginsberg, or from having to admit his support of Jerry Brown.\" [17]\n\nFormat\n\nEach hour of the daily three-hour broadcast usually begins with a monologue by Savage. Being a political commentator by trade, he often discusses issues in American politics and society in general. Many times, this leads to a passionate diatribe by Savage, a staple of The Savage Nation. Savage often takes calls in the second segment to comment on what was discussed in the previous segment.\n\nGuests have traditionally been a rare occurrence, but they have become more frequent since 2007. From 2009 until the end of the TRN run, the entire third hour of most shows was devoted to pre-taped interviews with guests.\n\nIntroduction and music\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nMusic is an integral part of The Savage Nation. Savage often extends the role of music beyond bumper music to be as much the content of the show as what he's talking about. (For instance, there was a period of several days in 2006 when Savage played \"Living on a Thin Line\" by The Kinks concurrent with his discussions of America's internal vulnerabilities.)\n\nSavage often closes the show by saying, \"With God's will and your listenership, I shall return\", or some variation thereof.\n\nHe also played \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols and \"Living on a Thin Line\" and agreeing that \"there's no England now\" after being banned from the U.K. by British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.\n\nThe signature musical introduction to The Savage Nation is the beginning of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" followed by an announcer saying, \"Warning: The Michael Savage Show contains adult language, adult content, psychological nudity. Listener discretion is advised.\" For years, this was followed by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Looks That Kill\" and Metallica's \"The Shortest Straw\" to conclude the introduction; following the move from TRN to Cumulus in 2012, the opening was revamped and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Live Wire\" replaced the latter two songs.\n\nFor bumper music, Savage has used \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\", \"Holier Than Thou\", \"Jump in the Fire\", \"To Live Is to Die\", \"Battery\", \"Blackened\", \"Sad But True\", \"Ain't My Bitch\", \"Fuel\", \"The Shortest Straw\", and \"Don't Tread on Me\" by Metallica, as well as \"Du Hast\" and \"Tier\" by Rammstein, Nirvana, \"Big Gun\" by AC/DC, and \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine. As of 2015, Judas Priest's \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" has generally played at the 30-minute break.\n\nWhile Savage has previously criticized pop culture on his program, he says that he is a rock music fan. On his July 19, 2006 show, Savage said that he is a huge fan of the German group Rammstein and that he often drives around at night blasting their music. When challenged by a caller to explain why he likes Rammstein, Savage said that they are \"the only true form of poetry and music that reflect the real world nowadays.\" Savage played their music at length during that specific broadcast. Savage is also a fan of 1950s rock 'n' roll and doo-wop music such as The Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and The Flamingos which is played on his \"Rock and Roll Friday\". On January 25, 2007, he started playing \"I'm Broken\" by Pantera on his show, stating that this is the type of music that U.S. troops should be listening to in Iraq.\n\nOn Mondays, he frequently opens the program by playing \"Blue Monday\" by Fats Domino.\n\nCriticism\n\nLiberal advocacy groups and media watchdogs such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, bigotry, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[18][19][20]\n\nOn his September 21, 1999 broadcast, Savage said that the motivation for female students who come from a Marin County private school to feed and provide services to the homeless is so they \"can go in and get raped by them, because they seem to like the excitement of it...\"[21][22]\n\nIn 2007, Supertalk Mississippi removed The Savage Nation from its programming due to negative reaction by listeners.[23][24]\n\nSavage characterized Israel as:\n\nA little country surrounded by racist, fascist bigots who don't want anyone but themselves living in that hell hole called the Middle East.[25]\n\nAlleged Islamophobia\n\nOn April 17, 2006, he commented of Muslims,\n\nThey say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?[26]\n\nAs a result of his comments allegedly soliciting to murder and incitement to racial hatred (both criminal offences in the United Kingdom), on May 5, 2009 it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence.\"[27][28][29]\n\nSavage called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\"[30]"}, {"url": "https://www.radiohalloffame.com/michael-savage", "page_content": "Since 1994, Michael Savage has been one of radio\u2019s most blunt political voices.

Clearly an individual who can not be pigeonholed, Savage continues to surprise and engage audiences of all ages and backgrounds with his cultured ideology and unique prospective on topics. Recently we sat down with Dr. Savage to discuss his love for Rock and Roll music, his unexpected appreciation for Heavy Metal, the effects of music, and much more.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 You have achieved an extremely long list of accomplishments in your life including degrees in Medical Botany and Medical Anthropology, PhD in Epidemiology and Nutritional Sciences. You have also authored countless political and science books and host the nationally syndicated radio show The Savage Nation, among many other things. On The Savage Nation you have adopted Rock and Roll Friday. First, tell us, where did the idea of Rock and Roll Friday come from?\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 It came from Rock and Roll itself. I love Rock and roll, I have since I was a boy. Who didn\u2019t love the music of the 1950s and 1960s? So on my Friday shows I play old Rock and Roll; mainly 1950s and 1960s as part of Rock and Roll Friday. Everyone loves it because I open Monday with \u201cBlue Monday\u201d by Fats Domino and Friday they look forward to Rock and Roll Friday. It is just part of America\u2019s past, its glorious past, and it is also a part of my past. I think it makes for very interesting entertainment.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 Completely agreed. It is a great to interject the music into the show and adds diversity. Growing up in the 1950s and 1960s you had the opportunity to experience the golden age of Rock and Roll. Many people, no matter their age, grew up listening to 1950s and 1960s Rock and Roll thankfully because they were introduced to it by their mother or father. That in mind, every time you hear the music you experience an overwhelming feeling of a happier and more simple time. What was it like growing up experiencing this music as it happened?\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 You know, it is easy to think the past was always better. In fact it was not a happier and easier time because we lived under the cloud of a nuclear holocaust. Remember, when I went to grade school in the 1950s we had to jump underneath desks for air raid drills in New York City public schools. Duck and Cover occurred very frequently, we were all expecting an imminent nuclear war to break out between Russia and the U.S. We lived in this constant fear of this existence of being annihilated. If you were younger things seem more care free right?\n\nI would say any young kid today, if they have parents who love them and are not drug addicts, and they don\u2019t put them on some mind bending drug such as Adderall or some other soul killing medication that some crackpot with a stethoscope prescribes because the kids too bright or too fidgety to sit in the class room, I think that kid still enjoys themselves. I see kids running around the neighborhood on skateboards, jumping around enjoying themselves. Kids are still kids, so for them it is still forever childhood. Childhood is childhood I think, you have kids in Africa playing in mud puddles who are enjoying themselves. Children have the magical capacity, if they are not starving or being threatened by something, to enjoy themselves.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 Absolutely, there is something special about being a child. There is just something very enduring about the music of the 1950s and 1960s. Many of these songs are still heard in popular culture today in films and on television. Tell me, what do you think makes these tracks still extremely relevant in modern culture?\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 It is interesting, The Sopranos for example, one of my favorite shows of all time which I love to watch re-runs of, continuously plays stuff from the 1950s and 1960s as a background. Why does it have relevance? Because not only the music, but the lyrics were about love, idealizing woman, boy and girl. How much better does it get. There was no ambivalence, there was no propaganda in the music; it was real, it was about basics. Now every song has to go through a filter of will it be bought and played by those psychopaths that control everything.\n\nCrypticRock .com \u2013 That is very true.\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 It is about the universals that world still knows to be true; boy loves girl, girl is goddess, girl is on a pedestal, boy wants girl, or they break-up, girl pines for boy. How much more basic does it get. It goes on around the world, despite what the psychos tell us.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 You are absolutely right. Now with that said you are a man with a wide range of tastes in many different things. On The Savage Nation, you play Heavy Metal music ranging from \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d by Metallica to songs from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Rammstein. What turned you on to Metal music?\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 I had a teenage son twenty years ago, who is now a grown man. I remember when I found Metallica music in his draw I said, \u201cHow dare you play this garbage in my house, it will turn you into a drug addict\u201d (laughs). As he moved out and I went through his stuff I found it, played it, and actually loved it. He laughs to this day. I got it from my son in many ways because he grew up through that period. It is incredible music.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 That is a funny story, and you are right, it really is incredible music. As we spoke of, the music was more basic back in the 1950s and 1960s. Do you feel Heavy Metal music is more reflective of the times we live in now?\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 Well, yes, the disparate tones and disparate currents. The shock and awe of the music, to take the narcotized pedestrian and electrify him or her; yes like sleepwalkers needed to be awakened. That music seems to touch that chord.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 That is a very good point. When you prepare for your daily show, if you do listen to music prior, what do you usually listen to?\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 I have to tell you, what I listen to in my home about an hour before I go on the air, if I am doing a show from home, is the Blue Note Collector\u2019s Edition (2010). There is something to be said about the greats in Jazz; Thelonious Monk, Kenny Burrell, and the obvious Cannonball Adderley. I can name all of them. Jazz is certainly not popular anymore. I don\u2019t think it reaches the people; it\u2019s from a different time. A lot of this has to do about what drugs were being used by musicians in their time. I think that reflects in the music, don\u2019t you?\n\nCrypticRock .com \u2013 It does reflect absolutely. You look at the late 1960s for example with the psychedelic drugs being used and the music that was produced by the artists of the time.\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 Yes, and the Jazz artists were largely on heroine and the music reflects a different tempo and somberness. It is much slower in some ways. Heavy Metal would reflect not marijuana, but let\u2019s say cocaine or one of the speed like drugs. I would think maybe an amphetamine like compound. I don\u2019t know what the heck they were on, but it certainly was not something that slowed them down.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 That is a very interesting observation. It does seem someone would have to be on a speed drug to play something that fast and aggressive.\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 I think so, the music acts like drugs on our brain. That is why it is so popular. We need to keep going in this society, we have to push ourselves to survive. The music in a way is a surrogate drug.\n\nCrypticRock.com \u2013 It is very true that we are living in an extremely fast-paced society in which heavy, fast, and more aggressive music does act as a surrogate drug to keep us moving. You have been hosting The Savage Nation program for nineteen years now. You have always provided a different type of radio talk show that goes beyond politics and touches on broad spectrum of topics.\n\nMichael Savage \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can typecast where I am going to go on any topic. Maybe you can on some, but not on all. Especially since you are coming at me from a music point. Who would expect Mr. Conservative to be playing Rock and Roll, Jazz, and Heavy Metal. You would not expect that. Why? Because I am a man of many tastes. In the old days they would call a person like me a Renaissance man, no one even knows what that means anymore. They would say he is crazy because he does not have any strict guidelines of what you expect from him. That is a full person, why should you be able to predict what a person is like or what a person is.\n\nAs of January 2014 The Savage Nation can be heard 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time and Noon to 3 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nAn up-to-date list of radio stations broadcasting The Savage Nation can be found here .\n\nLearn more about Michael Savage & The Savage Nation at www.michaelsavage.wnd.com\n\n\n\nRelated posts: No related posts."}, {"url": "https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Michael_Savage", "page_content": "Michael Savage, whose real name is Michael Alan Weiner, has a nationally syndicated right wing AM radio talk show called Savage Nation. He is a climate change denier who has claimed that the greatest fraud in American history is the concept of man-made climate change.[1]\n\nEducation\n\nMichael Savage has a Ph.D. is in the field of Nutritional Ethnomedicine.[1]\n\nSavage Nation\n\nSavage broadcasts denialism\n\nSavage is best known for his sydicated radio show, which began in 1994 on San Francisco's KSFO, and moved to KNEW in 2003. The show is syndicated by Talk Radio Network.\n\nDavid Gilson wrote in a Salon article published March 3, 2003,[2] that using his talk-show as a vehicle, Savage had\n\nlaunched a one-man mission to save America from its enemies at home and abroad, which on any given day includes liberals, gays, academics, the homeless, the Clintons, immigrants, feminists, CNN, the American Civil Liberties Union, Muslims and other minorities. Broadcasting three hours a day, five afternoons a week, from a studio inside his home in the affluent San Francisco suburb of Larkspur, he gives voice to the right wing's darkest fantasies.\n\nOn May 18, 2004 a website that Savage had sued and lost, michaelsavagesucks.com, wrote an open letter to Savage, challenging his claims of radio popularity: \"Michael, let us verify your 350 stations and Arbitron data proving you have 10.5 million listeners, and we will shut down this website.\" They never received a reply.\n\nSavage has also written columns for NewsMax.com and WorldNetDaily.\n\nLawsuits Against Websites\n\nOne of Savage's favorite targets after politicians and illegal immigrants, is often attorneys, and not just the ACLU either. Just the same, Savage has shown himself to be litigious if he chooses.\n\nIn 1996, Savage filed a lawsuit against the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, claiming that he had been discriminated against when he had applied for the position of Dean. What Savage's qualifications were to be Dean of a journalism school remain a mystery. At that time, he was a celebrated author in the niche field of botany and herbal lore, and had a total of one year as a talk-show host under his belt. The candidate chosen over Savage was a recognized journalist and China scholar named Orville Schell, whose awards had included a Page One Award, and a best article from the Overseas Press Club. Schell had also been awarded writing fellowships from several organizations, and had been published in many respected periodicals. Weiner claimed he had been overlooked because he is white, even though Schell is also white. David Horowitz came to the aid of Savage [3] but the lawsuit was later dropped.\n\nAs his popularity was at its apex and MSNBC had him under contract, many websites appeared criticizing him, and they joined in with an initiative started by The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to boycott all sponsors of his MSNBC TV show, Savage Nation.\n\nSavage took offense and sued, not GLAAD, but the owners of three small non-commercial websites in the federal court, and the two websites that used \"Savage\" in ICANN for their use of his name. savagestupidity.com and michaelsavagesucks.com In his filing, one Savage claim was that his fans could be confused if they visited these sites, and believe that they were visiting his site instead, immediately spawning sarcastic remarks regarding his fans' IQ upon the juvenile anti-Savage boards. Because of documented comments Savage had made on the airwaves towards the owner of michaelsavagesucks.com, he was allowed to use a shield of anonymity throughout the lawsuit. Both defendants won against Savage's suit, and the Federal lawsuit was dropped shortly after.\n\nSavaging Television\n\nMSNBC, as mentioned earlier, contracted a show with Savage, and broadcasted the debut of The Savage Nation on TV in March, 2003. The boycott effort gained steam and an aggressive letter writing campaign to sponsors was begun, causing many major corporations to remove their advertising on the show, but with very mixed results regarding smaller companies. Despite poor ratings, MSNBC kept the Savage Nation on until Saturday, July 5, 2003, when MSNBC broadcast its last Savage Nation show. On it Savage took a call from a prankster who claimed he was gay, to which Savage responded in part:\n\n\"Oh, you're one of the sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig. How's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You have got nothing to do today, go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Okay, do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse, who's angry at me today? Get http://www.sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_index.asp?id=65727me another one. Put another sodomite on.\"\n\n. He regularily comments on popular culture such as his love of the movies. He will also provide analysis of television shows such as The Sopranos, as well as daily news stories covered (or not covered at all} in the media.\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors sought to pass a resolution condemning Savage for comments he made on his show on July 5, 2007 regarding illegal immigrants. A group of students were protesting in the manner of a fast and Savage remarked, \"...let them fast until they starve to death.\" [4]\n\nAuthor\n\nMichael Savage is the author of at least 25 books, most of which were under the name of Michael Weiner and on botany and nutrition.

[5] As of December 2009, Savage remained on the list and as a result, Texas Rep.

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nThe Savage Nation (also called The Michael Savage Show) was an American conservative talk radio show hosted by Michael Savage. The program was heard by approximately 11 million listeners a week, which made it the 7th most listened to radio show in the country.[1]\n\nThe show was based in San Francisco, California, and was syndicated through Cumulus Media and Westwood One.[2]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 1 Views: 7 165\n\nSavage Nation Podcast August 23, 2019 Transcription\n\nProgram summary\n\n1994\u20131998\n\nIn 1994, Michael Savage (then publishing under his birth name Michael Weiner) submitted for publication a manuscript called Immigrants and Epidemics. The proposed book, which was about the influx of foreign diseases due to the wave of illegal immigrants, was promptly rejected for what Savage contends was its politically incorrect subject matter. This, along with the suggestions of friends and acquaintances, inspired Savage to record a radio demo about the very subject of his manuscript. He mailed the tape to 250 radio stations, and on March 21, 1994, The Savage Nation was born on KGO in San Francisco.\n\nSavage's radio career began modestly enough as a fill-in host for Ray Taliaferro. On January 2, 1995, Savage began hosting The Savage Nation on KGO's new sister station KSFO, which at the time changed its lineup to be completely conservative.[3]\n\n1999\u20132003\n\nIn 1999, Savage began hosting separate local and national parts of The Savage Nation.[4] On September 21, 2000, Savage made the entire Savage Nation show nationally syndicated through Talk Radio Network.[5] After one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in more than 200 markets.[citation needed] Savage's fill-in guest hosts include former U.S. congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan, Rick Roberts, Mancow, and Peter Weisbach. Talk radio host Lars Larson is also a former guest host, although his show now directly competes with The Savage Nation.\n\n2003\u20132012\n\nIn June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO, which refused to renegotiate his contract, and KSFO dropped his show on June 2.[6] In July 2003, he began his show on rival station KNEW.[7]\n\nAs of 2009, Savage had 8-10 million listeners per week, making his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States.[8]\n\nThe Savage Nation was removed from KNEW's schedule on September 10, 2009, as the station had \"decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction [sic].\" It was later picked up by sports station KTRB, but that agreement ended when Comerica Bank foreclosed on the station. Savage advised listeners that the show can be heard in the Bay Area via Sacramento-area KSTE.[9]\n\nSavage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract, which, though it expired at the end of 2010, contained clauses that granted Talk Radio Network the right to match any offer in perpetuity.[10] Savage won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, leading to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but also was required to agree to a four-week non-compete clause, which prevented The Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.[11]\n\nThe Savage Nation was revived on Cumulus Media on October 23, 2012, the day the non-compete clause expired. It aired in a new time slot, 9:00 PM to 12:00 midnight ET, replacing the weeknight edition of John Batchelor's news magazine.[citation needed]\n\n2013\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Savage announced during his show that effective January 2014, he would air during the afternoon drive hours of 3 p.m to 6 p.m, ET, replacing Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks.[citation needed]\n\nFeud with Sean Hannity\n\nSavage has been involved in a personal dispute with talk show host Sean Hannity, whose slot on Cumulus he replaced at the beginning of 2014. Savage said about Hannity: \"My competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat\u2013Republican talking points. That's all he's ever done. That's all he can do. He has no education. I'm just going to lay it on the line, I'm not going to mince words.\"[12]\n\n2016 United States presidential election\n\nSavage was widely credited with helping Donald Trump become President of the United States and is known as the \"Godfather of Trumpamania\".[13][14]\n\nEnd of terrestrial syndication\n\nIn January 2019, The Savage Nation was cut to two hours, only one of which is carried on terrestrial radio; the second hour is carried exclusively as a podcast. On September 30, 2020, Savage announced that Cumulus Media and Westwood One withdrew the terrestrial radio show from syndication on January 1, 2021, leaving only the podcast; he also stated he was under a gag order as to why the change was being made.[15]\n\nFormat\n\nEach hour of the daily three-hour broadcast usually begins with a monologue by Savage. Being a political commentator by trade, he often discusses issues in American politics and society in general. Many times, this leads to a passionate diatribe by Savage, a staple of The Savage Nation. Savage often takes calls in the second segment to comment on what was discussed in the previous segment.\n\nGuests have traditionally been a rare occurrence, but they have become more frequent since 2007. From 2009 until the end of the TRN run, the entire third hour of most shows was devoted to pre-taped interviews with guests.\n\nIntroduction and music\n\nMusic is an integral part of The Savage Nation. Savage often extends the role of music beyond bumper music to be as much the content of the show as what he's talking about. (For instance, there was a period of several days in 2006 when Savage played \"Living on a Thin Line\" by The Kinks concurrent with his discussions of America's internal vulnerabilities.)\n\nHe also played \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols and \"Living on a Thin Line\", and agreed that \"there's no England now\" after being banned from the U.K. by British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.\n\nThe signature musical introduction to The Savage Nation is the beginning of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\", followed by an announcer saying, \"Warning: The Michael Savage Show contains adult language, adult content, psychological nudity. Listener discretion is advised.\" For years, this was followed by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Looks That Kill\" and Metallica's \"The Shortest Straw\" to conclude the introduction; following the move from TRN to Cumulus in 2012, the opening was revamped, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Live Wire\" replaced the latter two songs.\n\nFor bumper music, Savage has used \"Motorbreath\", \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\", \"Holier Than Thou\", \"Jump in the Fire\", \"To Live Is to Die\", \"Battery\", \"Blackened\", \"Sad but True\", \"Ain't My Bitch\", \"Fuel\", \"The Shortest Straw\", and \"Don't Tread on Me\" by Metallica, as well as \"Du Hast\" and \"Tier\" by Rammstein, Nirvana, \"Big Gun\" by AC/DC, and \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine. As of 2015, Judas Priest's \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" has generally played at the 30-minute break.\n\nWhile Savage has previously criticized pop culture on his program, he is a self-proclaimed rock music fan. On his July 19, 2006 show, Savage said he is a huge fan of the German group Rammstein, and that he often drives around at night blasting their music. When challenged by a caller to explain why he likes Rammstein, Savage said they are \"the only true form of poetry and music that reflect the real world nowadays.\" Savage played their music at length during that specific broadcast.\n\nHe is also a fan of 1950s rock 'n' roll and doo-wop music such as The Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and The Flamingos, which is played on his \"Rock and Roll Friday\". On January 25, 2007, he started playing \"I'm Broken\" by Pantera on his show, stating that this is the type of music that U.S. troops should be listening to in Iraq.\n\nOn Mondays, he frequently opens the program by playing \"Blue Monday\" by Fats Domino.\n\nClosing\n\nSavage often closes the show by saying, \"With God's will and your listenership, I shall return\", or some variation thereof.\n\nCriticism and controversies\n\nLiberal advocacy groups and media watchdogs such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, bigotry, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[16][17][18]\n\nOn his September 21, 1999 broadcast, Savage said that the motivation for female students who come from a Marin County private school to feed and provide services to the homeless is so they \"can go in and get raped by them, because they seem to like the excitement of it...\"[19][20]\n\nIn 2007, Supertalk Mississippi removed The Savage Nation from its programming due to negative reaction by listeners.[21][22]\n\nIn November 2016, Savage commented on why he avoided paranormal topics: \"You say \u2018UFOs,\u2019 you wind up in the Philippines with a 10-year-old hooker and you are off the radio after a number of years.\" The in-joke was a reference to Art Bell, who was known for his frequent disappearances from radio during his lifetime and, at age 60 and almost immediately after the death of his previous wife, married a then-22-year old Filipino woman named Airyn Ruiz in 2006;[23] Bell and Ruiz sued Savage and Westwood One shortly thereafter for defamation, with Ruiz insisting she was not a prostitute nor a child bride.

With an audience of over 20 million, it is one of the most listened-to radio shows in the United States. Is he still hosting the show today? Where is he now in 2018?\n\nWhat is Michael Savage Doing Now in 2018?\n\nFirst and foremost, he still hosts the syndicated talk show to this day. Since 2012, The Savage Nation has been airing on KSFO, where it\u2019s heard by over 10 million listeners a week. Based out of San Francisco, California, the program is known for entering around Savage\u2019s bold perspective on American ideals and culture. As such, he has been named as one of the most influential and most listened-to talk show hosts by Talk Stream Live.\n\nFor those who\u2019d like to tune into some of his past programs, you can visit his official YouTube channel here. Since its launch in 2016, he has been regularly uploading his syndicated show to the site, for his fans to enjoy.\n\nAside from his radio program, he has been involved with numerous other ventures. For instance, he has written a handful of books over the past few years including Stop the Coming Civil War, Government Zero, Scorched Earth, and Trump\u2019s War: His Battle for America. His most recent release God, Faith, and Reason, a non-political title in which he discusses his lifelong quest for spiritual truth, was published in November 2017.\n\nA strong supporter of Donald Trump, he had supported his campaign in 2016. Considering the fact that the president himself is a fan and listener of Savage\u2019s show, it\u2019s not surprising to know that the radio host and his family were invited to meet President Trump several times during the holiday season in 2017.\n\nAs far as other things go, he was also invited onto the television show, PoliticKING with Larry King alongside Peter Kauffmann and Amy Holmes last year. Previously, he had also been featured in the show in 2015 and 2016.\n\nLast year, he had also made the headlines after getting into a confrontation with a man at a Tiburon restaurant in Marin County. According to reports, the conservative talk show host had come into physical contact with each other after a brief verbal exchange. Fortunately, neither parties had any visible signs of injury. A few days afterward, it was announced that no criminal charges would be laid.\n\nAbout Michael Savage\n\nBorn on March 31, 1942, in New York, Michael Savage has described his childhood as difficult. After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958, he went to Queens College, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s in biology. From there, he taught high school for several years before earning a master\u2019s degree in botany from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1970. Two years later, he earned a second masters in anthropology.\n\nFast forward to the early 90\u2019s, and he had landed himself a position with the San Francisco radio station, KGO. After a year of filing in for Ray Taliaferro, he was given his own show on the sister station, KSFO. A local hit, he eventually reached number one in Arbitron ratings. By 2006, he was attracting eight to ten million listeners per week. With that, his show became one of the most widely broadcasted in the U.S. at the time.\n\nAs of 2018, he has hosted his radio show for over two decades. In fact, he recently celebrated 24 years on the radio earlier this year. Hailed as one of the most creative talk show hosts ever to have been on the air, he has dominated the airwaves with more than 20 million weekly listeners across the globe. In 2016, his efforts led him to be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nAside from his radio career, Savage is also known for having written more than 25 books, many of which were best-sellers. Some of these include Earth Medicine, The Art of Feeding Children Well, Dr. Savage\u2019s High Fiber Counter, The People\u2019s Herbal, and The Complete Book of Homeopathy. Most recently, he published the fictional title Xenon on February 5th, 2018.\n\nDid you know that he\u2019s also appeared on television? That\u2019s right, he once hosted his own television show on MSNBC. A few months after its premiere, however, he was fired after he made certain remarks to a caller, who was later identified as a prank caller.\n\nMichael Savage\u2019s Plans for the Future\n\nIf his recent activities are of any indication, the talk show host will not be retiring from his position anytime soon. In fact, it was announced that he had renewed a long-term contract for The Savage Nation with the media company, Westwood One."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/entertainment/2012/10/michael_savage_the_savage_nati_1.html", "page_content": "GRAND RAPIDS, MI \u2013 Michael Savage and\n\n\u201cThe Savage Nation\u201d\n\nis back in Grand Rapids.\n\nHurricane Sandy's effects marred satellite transmission, but Cumulus Media-owned WJRW-AM 1340 in Grand Rapids yesterday began airing the conservative talk show host's syndicated show, which airs 9 p.m. to 12 midnight, weekdays.\n\nThough anticipated it was a sudden development.\n\nSavage on Tuesday aired his thoughts on recreational boating, party planning, and passed on new research suggesting older fathers are more likely to pass on genetic mutations to their off spring.\n\nIn the final hour of his show, he took just a few shots at President Obama.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s not a Democrat.

At its peak in 2009, the program was heard by 8\u201310 million listeners a week and syndicated across the U.S. in over 300 markets, making it among the most listened to radio shows in the country.[1]\n\nAs of 2014, Talkers Magazine estimates Savage's audience at 5 million listeners, in sixth place among talk radio programs.[2] However,in both the March and April 2013 \"Talkers Heavy Hundred\" Savage ranked at number five, between Glenn Beck #4, and Ed Schultz #6, as \"most important\" talk personality in U.S. radio.[3][4]\n\nThe show is based out of San Francisco, California and is syndicated through Westwood One.[5]\n\nProgram summary\n\n1994\u20131998\n\nIn 1994, Michael Savage (then publishing under his birth name Michael Weiner) submitted for publication a manuscript called Immigrants and Epidemics. The proposed book, which was about the influx of foreign diseases due to the wave of illegal immigrants, was promptly rejected for what Savage contends was its politically incorrect subject matter. This, along with the suggestions of friends and acquaintances, inspired Savage to record a radio demo about the very subject of his manuscript. He mailed the tape to 250 radio stations, and on March 21, 1994, The Savage Nation was born on KGO in San Francisco.\n\nSavage's radio career began modestly enough as a fill-in host for Ray Taliaferro. On January 2, 1995, Savage began hosting his own program, The Savage Nation, on KGO sister station KSFO, which at the time changed its lineup to be completely conservative.[6]\n\nAt the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage soared to #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time slot in Northern California.[7]\n\n1999\u20132003\n\nIn 1999, he came to the attention of the Talk Radio Network.\n\nOn January 17, 2000, he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. His national experiment was a success, and, on September 21, 2000, he stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour national show The Savage Nation. After one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in more than 200 markets.[citation needed] Savage's fill-in guest hosts include former U.S. congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan, Rick Roberts, Mancow, and Peter Weisbach. Talk radio host Lars Larson is also a former guest host, although his show now directly competes with The Savage Nation.\n\n2003\u20132012\n\nIn June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO, which refused to renegotiate his contract, and KSFO dropped his show on June 2.[8] On July 1, 2003 he began his show on a different station: KNEW in San Francisco.\n\nAs of 2009, Savage had 8-10 million listeners per week, making his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States.[9] Savage calls his listeners \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He says that he tries to make a show that has a \"...hard edge combined with humor and education... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\"[7]\n\nSavage was named the 2007 recipient of Talkers Magazine\u2019s Freedom of Speech Award. According to Talkers Magazine, Savage was honored \"for being the first major conservative radio talk show host to criticize President George W. Bush on his policies and encourage hosts of all political ideologies to remain independent of partisan loyalties.\"[10] Previous recipients of the Freedom of Speech Award include Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe Savage Nation was removed from KNEW's schedule on September 10, 2009 as the station had \"decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction [sic].\" It was later picked up by sports station KTRB, but that agreement ended when Comerica Bank foreclosed on the station. Savage advised listeners that the show can be heard in the Bay Area via Sacramento-area KSTE.[11]\n\nSavage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract, which, though it expired at the end of 2010, contained clauses that granted Talk Radio Network the right to match any offer in perpetuity.[12] Savage won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, leading to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but also was required to agree to a four-week non-compete clause, which will prevent The Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.[13]\n\nThe Savage Nation was revived on Cumulus Media Networks on October 23, 2012, the day the non-compete clause expired. It airs in a new time slot, 9:00 PM to 12:00 midnight ET, replacing the weeknight edition of John Batchelor's news magazine.[14]\n\n2013-\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Savage announced during his show that starting January 2014, he will move to the afternoon drive hours of 3 p.m to 6 p.m ET. He replaces Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks.[15]\n\nFeud with Sean Hannity\n\nSavage has been involved in a personal dispute with talk-show host Sean Hannity, whose slot on Cumulus he replaced at the beginning of 2014. Savage said about Hannity: \"My competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat-Republican talking points. That's all he's ever done. That's all he can do. He has no education. I'm just going to lay it on the line, I'm not going to mince words.\"[16] Hannity said of Savage, \"The poor guy is just an angry, depressed, and jealous human being who has been hanging around the backwaters of broadcasting for too many years. Now in his 70's, it\u2019s sad to see that he is so angry, envious, and obsessed with fellow broadcasters. Perhaps his anger and conflict comes from his skinny dipping days in Fiji with his liberal poet friend Allen Ginsberg, or from having to admit his support of Jerry Brown.\" [17]\n\nFormat\n\nEach hour of the daily three-hour broadcast usually begins with a monologue by Savage. Being a political commentator by trade, he often discusses issues in American politics and society in general. Many times, this leads to a passionate diatribe by Savage, a staple of The Savage Nation. Savage often takes calls in the second segment to comment on what was discussed in the previous segment.\n\nGuests have traditionally been a rare occurrence, but they have become more frequent since 2007. From 2009 until the end of the TRN run, the entire third hour of most shows was devoted to pre-taped interviews with guests.\n\nIntroduction and music\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nMusic is an integral part of The Savage Nation. Savage often extends the role of music beyond bumper music to be as much the content of the show as what he's talking about. (For instance, there was a period of several days in 2006 when Savage played \"Living on a Thin Line\" by The Kinks concurrent with his discussions of America's internal vulnerabilities.)\n\nSavage often closes the show by saying, \"With God's will and your listenership, I shall return\", or some variation thereof.\n\nHe also played \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols and \"Living on a Thin Line\" and agreeing that \"there's no England now\" after being banned from the U.K. by British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.\n\nThe signature musical introduction to The Savage Nation is the beginning of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" followed by an announcer saying, \"Warning: The Michael Savage Show contains adult language, adult content, psychological nudity. Listener discretion is advised.\" For years, this was followed by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Looks That Kill\" and Metallica's \"The Shortest Straw\" to conclude the introduction; following the move from TRN to Cumulus in 2012, the opening was revamped and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Live Wire\" replaced the latter two songs.\n\nFor bumper music, Savage has used \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\", \"Holier Than Thou\", \"Jump in the Fire\", \"To Live Is to Die\", \"Battery\", \"Blackened\", \"Sad But True\", \"Ain't My Bitch\", \"Fuel\", \"The Shortest Straw\", and \"Don't Tread on Me\" by Metallica, as well as \"Du Hast\" and \"Tier\" by Rammstein, Nirvana, \"Big Gun\" by AC/DC, and \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine. As of 2015, Judas Priest's \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" has generally played at the 30-minute break.\n\nWhile Savage has previously criticized pop culture on his program, he says that he is a rock music fan. On his July 19, 2006 show, Savage said that he is a huge fan of the German group Rammstein and that he often drives around at night blasting their music. When challenged by a caller to explain why he likes Rammstein, Savage said that they are \"the only true form of poetry and music that reflect the real world nowadays.\" Savage played their music at length during that specific broadcast. Savage is also a fan of 1950s rock 'n' roll and doo-wop music such as The Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and The Flamingos which is played on his \"Rock and Roll Friday\". On January 25, 2007, he started playing \"I'm Broken\" by Pantera on his show, stating that this is the type of music that U.S. troops should be listening to in Iraq.\n\nOn Mondays, he frequently opens the program by playing \"Blue Monday\" by Fats Domino.\n\nCriticism\n\nLiberal advocacy groups and media watchdogs such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, bigotry, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[18][19][20]\n\nOn his September 21, 1999 broadcast, Savage said that the motivation for female students who come from a Marin County private school to feed and provide services to the homeless is so they \"can go in and get raped by them, because they seem to like the excitement of it...\"[21][22]\n\nIn 2007, Supertalk Mississippi removed The Savage Nation from its programming due to negative reaction by listeners.[23][24]\n\nSavage characterized Israel as:\n\nA little country surrounded by racist, fascist bigots who don't want anyone but themselves living in that hell hole called the Middle East.[25]\n\nAlleged Islamophobia\n\nOn April 17, 2006, he commented of Muslims,\n\nThey say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.'

The program was heard by approximately 11 million listeners a week, which made it the 7th most listened to radio show in the country.[1]\n\nThe show was based in San Francisco, California, and was syndicated through Cumulus Media and Westwood One.[2]\n\nProgram summary [ edit ]\n\nIn 1994, Michael Savage (then publishing under his birth name Michael Weiner) submitted for publication a manuscript called Immigrants and Epidemics. The proposed book, which was about the influx of foreign diseases due to the wave of illegal immigrants, was promptly rejected for what Savage contends was its politically incorrect subject matter. This, along with the suggestions of friends and acquaintances, inspired Savage to record a radio demo about the very subject of his manuscript. He mailed the tape to 250 radio stations, and on March 21, 1994, The Savage Nation was born on KGO in San Francisco.\n\nSavage's radio career began modestly enough as a fill-in host for Ray Taliaferro. On January 2, 1995, Savage began hosting The Savage Nation on KGO's new sister station KSFO, which at the time changed its lineup to be completely conservative.[3]\n\nIn 1999, Savage began hosting separate local and national parts of The Savage Nation.[4] On September 21, 2000, Savage made the entire Savage Nation show nationally syndicated through Talk Radio Network.[5] After one year, he was in 150 markets. By 2003, he was in more than 200 markets.[citation needed] Savage's fill-in guest hosts include former U.S. congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan, Rick Roberts, Mancow, and Peter Weisbach. Talk radio host Lars Larson is also a former guest host, although his show now directly competes with The Savage Nation.\n\nIn June 2003, he had a salary dispute with his flagship station KSFO, which refused to renegotiate his contract, and KSFO dropped his show on June 2.[6] In July 2003, he began his show on rival station KNEW.[7]\n\nAs of 2009, Savage had 8-10 million listeners per week, making his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States.[8]\n\nThe Savage Nation was removed from KNEW's schedule on September 10, 2009, as the station had \"decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction [sic].\" It was later picked up by sports station KTRB, but that agreement ended when Comerica Bank foreclosed on the station. Savage advised listeners that the show can be heard in the Bay Area via Sacramento-area KSTE.[9]\n\nSavage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract, which, though it expired at the end of 2010, contained clauses that granted Talk Radio Network the right to match any offer in perpetuity.[10] Savage won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, leading to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but also was required to agree to a four-week non-compete clause, which prevented The Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.[11]\n\nThe Savage Nation was revived on Cumulus Media on October 23, 2012, the day the non-compete clause expired. It aired in a new time slot, 9:00 PM to 12:00 midnight ET, replacing the weeknight edition of John Batchelor's news magazine.[citation needed]\n\n2013 [ edit ]\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Savage announced during his show that effective January 2014, he would air during the afternoon drive hours of 3 p.m to 6 p.m, ET, replacing Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks.[citation needed]\n\nFeud with Sean Hannity [ edit ]\n\nSavage has been involved in a personal dispute with talk show host Sean Hannity, whose slot on Cumulus he replaced at the beginning of 2014. Savage said about Hannity: \"My competitor doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go beyond the Democrat\u2013Republican talking points. That's all he's ever done. That's all he can do. He has no education. I'm just going to lay it on the line, I'm not going to mince words.\"[12]\n\n2016 United States presidential election [ edit ]\n\nSavage was widely credited with helping Donald Trump become President of the United States and is known as the \"Godfather of Trumpamania\".[13][14]\n\nEnd of terrestrial syndication [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2019, The Savage Nation was cut to two hours, only one of which is carried on terrestrial radio; the second hour is carried exclusively as a podcast. On September 30, 2020, Savage announced that Cumulus Media and Westwood One withdrew the terrestrial radio show from syndication on January 1, 2021, leaving only the podcast; he also stated he was under a gag order as to why the change was being made.[15]\n\nFormat [ edit ]\n\nEach hour of the daily three-hour broadcast usually begins with a monologue by Savage. Being a political commentator by trade, he often discusses issues in American politics and society in general. Many times, this leads to a passionate diatribe by Savage, a staple of The Savage Nation. Savage often takes calls in the second segment to comment on what was discussed in the previous segment.\n\nGuests have traditionally been a rare occurrence, but they have become more frequent since 2007. From 2009 until the end of the TRN run, the entire third hour of most shows was devoted to pre-taped interviews with guests.\n\nIntroduction and music [ edit ]\n\nMusic is an integral part of The Savage Nation. Savage often extends the role of music beyond bumper music to be as much the content of the show as what he's talking about. (For instance, there was a period of several days in 2006 when Savage played \"Living on a Thin Line\" by The Kinks concurrent with his discussions of America's internal vulnerabilities.)\n\nHe also played \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols and \"Living on a Thin Line\", and agreed that \"there's no England now\" after being banned from the U.K. by British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.\n\nThe signature musical introduction to The Savage Nation is the beginning of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\", followed by an announcer saying, \"Warning: The Michael Savage Show contains adult language, adult content, psychological nudity. Listener discretion is advised.\" For years, this was followed by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Looks That Kill\" and Metallica's \"The Shortest Straw\" to conclude the introduction; following the move from TRN to Cumulus in 2012, the opening was revamped, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Live Wire\" replaced the latter two songs.\n\nFor bumper music, Savage has used \"Motorbreath\", \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\", \"Holier Than Thou\", \"Jump in the Fire\", \"To Live Is to Die\", \"Battery\", \"Blackened\", \"Sad but True\", \"Ain't My Bitch\", \"Fuel\", \"The Shortest Straw\", and \"Don't Tread on Me\" by Metallica, as well as \"Du Hast\" and \"Tier\" by Rammstein, Nirvana, \"Big Gun\" by AC/DC, and \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine. As of 2015, Judas Priest's \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" has generally played at the 30-minute break.\n\nWhile Savage has previously criticized pop culture on his program, he is a self-proclaimed rock music fan. On his July 19, 2006 show, Savage said he is a huge fan of the German group Rammstein, and that he often drives around at night blasting their music. When challenged by a caller to explain why he likes Rammstein, Savage said they are \"the only true form of poetry and music that reflect the real world nowadays.\" Savage played their music at length during that specific broadcast.\n\nHe is also a fan of 1950s rock 'n' roll and doo-wop music such as The Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and The Flamingos, which is played on his \"Rock and Roll Friday\". On January 25, 2007, he started playing \"I'm Broken\" by Pantera on his show, stating that this is the type of music that U.S. troops should be listening to in Iraq.\n\nOn Mondays, he frequently opens the program by playing \"Blue Monday\" by Fats Domino.\n\nClosing [ edit ]\n\nSavage often closes the show by saying, \"With God's will and your listenership, I shall return\", or some variation thereof.\n\nCriticism and controversies [ edit ]\n\nLiberal advocacy groups and media watchdogs such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, bigotry, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[16][17][18]\n\nOn his September 21, 1999 broadcast, Savage said that the motivation for female students who come from a Marin County private school to feed and provide services to the homeless is so they \"can go in and get raped by them, because they seem to like the excitement of it...\"[19][20]\n\nIn 2007, Supertalk Mississippi removed The Savage Nation from its programming due to negative reaction by listeners.[21][22]\n\nIn November 2016, Savage commented on why he avoided paranormal topics: \"You say \u2018UFOs,\u2019 you wind up in the Philippines with a 10-year-old hooker and you are off the radio after a number of years.\" The in-joke was a reference to Art Bell, who was known for his frequent disappearances from radio during his lifetime and, at age 60 and almost immediately after the death of his previous wife, married a then-22-year old Filipino woman named Airyn Ruiz in 2006;[23] Bell and Ruiz sued Savage and Westwood One shortly thereafter for defamation, with Ruiz insisting she was not a prostitute nor a child bride. The lawsuit was settled on February 27, 2017.[24]\n\nAlleged Islamophobia [ edit ]\n\nOn April 17, 2006, he commented about Muslims,\n\nThey say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die\u2014would you rather us die than them?[25]\n\nSavage's comments were seriously criticized worldwide and following controversy over such comments allegedly soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred (both criminal offences in the United Kingdom), on May 5, 2009, then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence.\"[26][27][28]\n\nSavage called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain, as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\"[29]"}], "The Savage Nation had an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States in 2009.": [{"url": "https://factsbuddy.com/michael-savage/", "page_content": "Michael Savage Bio | Wiki\n\nMichael Savage (Full name: Michael Alan Weiner) is an American conservative author, conspiracy theorist, political commentator, activist, and former radio host.

His most recent release God, Faith, and Reason, a non-political title in which he discusses his lifelong quest for spiritual truth, was published in November 2017.\n\nA strong supporter of Donald Trump, he had supported his campaign in 2016. Considering the fact that the president himself is a fan and listener of Savage\u2019s show, it\u2019s not surprising to know that the radio host and his family were invited to meet President Trump several times during the holiday season in 2017.\n\nAs far as other things go, he was also invited onto the television show, PoliticKING with Larry King alongside Peter Kauffmann and Amy Holmes last year.

From there, he taught high school for several years before earning a master\u2019s degree in botany from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1970. Two years later, he earned a second masters in anthropology.\n\nFast forward to the early 90\u2019s, and he had landed himself a position with the San Francisco radio station, KGO. After a year of filing in for Ray Taliaferro, he was given his own show on the sister station, KSFO. A local hit, he eventually reached number one in Arbitron ratings. By 2006, he was attracting eight to ten million listeners per week. With that, his show became one of the most widely broadcasted in the U.S. at the time.\n\nAs of 2018, he has hosted his radio show for over two decades. In fact, he recently celebrated 24 years on the radio earlier this year. Hailed as one of the most creative talk show hosts ever to have been on the air, he has dominated the airwaves with more than 20 million weekly listeners across the globe. In 2016, his efforts led him to be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nAside from his radio career, Savage is also known for having written more than 25 books, many of which were best-sellers. Some of these include Earth Medicine, The Art of Feeding Children Well, Dr. Savage\u2019s High Fiber Counter, The People\u2019s Herbal, and The Complete Book of Homeopathy. Most recently, he published the fictional title Xenon on February 5th, 2018.\n\nDid you know that he\u2019s also appeared on television?

D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine and master's degrees in medical botany and medical anthropology from the University of Hawaii.\n\nRadio Career\n\nIn 1994, Savage's manuscript about illegal immigration was rejected by publishers.

By 2009, the show was being played on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened to radio talk show in the nation.\n\nIn September 2009, Savage's home market of San Francisco announced it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM in Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an email that the station was headed \"\u2026 in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\" However, Savage filed a lawsuit in an attempt to break from his contract and won the lawsuit the morning of September 27, 2012, which led to the immediate cancellation of the show and forcing Talk Radio Network to hire a replacement in short order. Savage also won the rights to his entire archive but was required to agree to a four-week non compete clause, which prevented Savage Nation from being picked up by another network in that time frame.\n\nThe show was revived on Cumulus Media Networks on October 23, 2012. It aired a new time slot, 9:00 P.M. to Midnight ET. The following year, Savage changed back to afternoon drive hours, replacing Sean Hannity for Cumulus Media Networks, thus inciting a feud between the two talk show hosts.

In 2014, Savage aroused even further controversy by setting his sights on sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder, calling sufferers of that condition \"weak\" and drawing parallels between their plight and the Obama administration. As of 2020, Savage vehemently opposes wearing masks in public to slow the spread of COVID-19 in both indoor and outdoor settings. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Savage subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory, a white national belief.
