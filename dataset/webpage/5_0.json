Some accused his family of using political clout to achieve his sudden elevation. It would not have been the first time, after all. Others alleged money had passed hands - a favour in exchange for funds for an ailing board. Others still supposed it was a mistake, or an oversight. Why would an 18-year-old unknown, who has never played for Sri Lanka at Under-19 level, let alone any first-class or List A cricket, be picked for the national side? As is often the case, the truth was perhaps more far-fetched, and certainly more charming, than fiction.\n\nDananjaya is the son of a carpenter from Panadura, just south of Colombo. He had been playing tier-three school cricket for the little-known Mahanama Vidyalaya when he was invited to a Sri Lanka practice session ahead of Pakistan's tour in June. Coach Graham Ford and Mahela Jayawardene had been searching for a bowler who could mimic Saeed Ajmal, and his doosra in particular. What they got in Dananjaya was more than just a competent impostor.\n\nIn his first professional match, for Wayamba United in the SLPL, Dananjaya showcased the tools with which he had so impressed Jayawardene and Ford that they requested he be fast-tracked to the tips of the national team. He began with several stock offspinners, flighted, dipping, and ripping out of the Premadasa clay. Then the googly was introduced. More subtle than most at the point of delivery, but then so was the turn - not that that was any mercy to the three batsmen who have fallen to it in the tournament so far. The doosra followed, his first ball to cut away from the right-hander. The legbreak next, flighted again and with a slight snap of overspin. And the carrom ball last - maybe a tad too short to be truly effective, giving the batsman time to read it off the pitch.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive aspects of his game were not his variations, but the cunning with which he used them. In each of his spells throughout the SLPL, Dananjaya has resisted trotting out his deliveries for the circus. Each ball has been deliberate, each length has attempted to draw the batsman into a false stroke, though he does occasionally miss his target and overpitch. His focus on his own game has been encouraging too. Instead of allowing nerves to frighten him into a defensive approach, he has seemed in complete control, at home even, in the limelight. \"What's been really good to see is his temperament, for a guy who hasn't played at this level before,\" Wayamba United and former Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss said. \"The control with which he bowls his various deliveries is impressive, but he's also shown a lot of poise at the big moments, and a tendency to ignore what's going on around him and do what he does.\"\n\nA drive to excel has also been apparent. In the last over of his second match, he gave one ball a touch too much air and was tonked back over his head for six. The blow had only bumped his figures down from outstanding to excellent - he still claimed 2 for 20 from his four overs - but it was enough to spark visible frustration. That he abhors to serve up poor deliveries is plain from his economy rate. In 16 overs in the SLPL so far, he has conceded only 4.81 an over.\n\nLike Ajantha Mendis eventually discovered at Test level, perhaps Dananjaya's mystery will dim with the help of time and reels of videotape. \"The challenge for him will come when batsmen get a better look at him and begin to work him out,\" Bayliss said. \"But he has the basics there to make him a good bowler regardless, and maybe in future his focus might be on the more orthodox aspects of spin bowling.\""}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Akila_Dananjaya", "page_content": "Mahamarakkala Kurukulasooriya Patabendige Akila Dananjaya Perera (Sinhala: \u0d85\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbd \u0db0\u0db1\u0d82\u0da2\u0dba; born 4 October 1993), popularly as Akila Dananjaya, is a professional Sri Lankan cricketer, who played all forms of the game for the national team.

Dananjaya is the latest one in that list. Having not played a first class game, Dananjaya was picked for the 2012 T20 WC. Mahela Jayawardene was so impressed by the youngsters control of the googly, carrom ball, leg-break, doosra and off-spinner, that he convinced the selectors to fast track him to the national side. Dananjaya did not disappoint as he played 4 games and picked up 7 wickets at an average of 13 and an economy under 7.\n\n\n\nHowever, he only played one more game before being dropped. He was also overlooked for the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. With the success in the T20 World Cup, Dananjaya was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings during the 2013 edition for $20,000.\n\n\n\nRevolving doors of Sri Lankan cricket meant that Dhananjaya could never settle himself in the national team. Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans. It wasn't an one-off achievement, two days after his marriage, he claimed six for 54 against India, thereby cementing his place for the immediate future."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/akila-dananjaya", "page_content": "Akila Dananjaya: A Brief Biography\n\nAkila Dananjaya Biography\n\n\n\n\n\nAkila Dananjaya is a Sri Lankan cricketer, who plays the limited overs format in the national team.

He performed phenomenally in the second match itself as he took 3/18 against Nagenahira Nagas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sri Lankan made his international debut in the year 2012 and was selected in the Sri Lanka squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 18-year old played his first game in front of his home crowd in Kandy, when he played against the Kiwis. He picked up two wickets in the match.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe made to the ODI squad later that year against the same opponents in the year 2012. However, the match was washed out due to rain and he could not bowl a single delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\nDananjaya played his first ODI match only in June 2017 against Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter coming back to the Lankan set up in 2017, Dananjaya was among the few bright spots in an otherwise dreadful year for Sri Lankan cricket. His performance against India at Pallekele, when he took six wickets to wipe out the Indian middle-order was noteworthy, despite Sri Lanka not being able to close out the game in their favor.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Point\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Dananjaya\u2019s debut performance in the T20 cricket, he met with an injury which was a dreadful phase of his life. New Zealand\u2019s batsman, Rob Nicol hit the ball towards the bowler, the ball slipped from Dananjaya\u2019s hands and fractured his cheekbone which led him to miss rest of the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nClub Career\n\n\n\n\n\nAkila Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of $20,000 in the 2013 IPL season."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/akila-dananjaya", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nAkila Dananjaya was born on 4 October, 1993 in Panadura, Sri Lanka, is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

Dananjaya is the latest one in that list. Having not played a first class game, Dananjaya was picked for the 2012 T20 WC. Mahela Jayawardene was so impressed by the youngsters control of the googly, carrom ball, leg-break, doosra and off-spinner, that he convinced the selectors to fast track him to the national side. Dananjaya did not disappoint as he played 4 games and picked up 7 wickets at an average of 13 and an economy under 7.\n\n\n\nHowever, he only played one more game before being dropped. He was also overlooked for the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. With the success in the T20 World Cup, Dananjaya was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings during the 2013 edition for $20,000.\n\n\n\nRevolving doors of Sri Lankan cricket meant that Dhananjaya could never settle himself in the national team. Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans. It wasn't an one-off achievement, two days after his marriage, he claimed six for 54 against India, thereby cementing his place for the immediate future."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/akila-dananjaya", "page_content": "Akila Dananjaya: A Brief Biography\n\nAkila Dananjaya Biography\n\n\n\n\n\nAkila Dananjaya is a Sri Lankan cricketer, who plays the limited overs format in the national team.

Dananjaya is the latest one in that list. Having not played a first class game, Dananjaya was picked for the 2012 T20 WC. Mahela Jayawardene was so impressed by the youngsters control of the googly, carrom ball, leg-break, doosra and off-spinner, that he convinced the selectors to fast track him to the national side. Dananjaya did not disappoint as he played 4 games and picked up 7 wickets at an average of 13 and an economy under 7.\n\n\n\nHowever, he only played one more game before being dropped. He was also overlooked for the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. With the success in the T20 World Cup, Dananjaya was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings during the 2013 edition for $20,000.\n\n\n\nRevolving doors of Sri Lankan cricket meant that Dhananjaya could never settle himself in the national team. Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans. It wasn't an one-off achievement, two days after his marriage, he claimed six for 54 against India, thereby cementing his place for the immediate future."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/akila-dananjaya", "page_content": "Akila Dananjaya: A Brief Biography\n\nAkila Dananjaya Biography\n\n\n\n\n\nAkila Dananjaya is a Sri Lankan cricketer, who plays the limited overs format in the national team. He was born on 4 October 1993 in the Panadura region of Sri Lanka. The 5 feet 7 inches tall bowls right-arm off the break and is considered as a bowling all-rounder.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nDananjaya talents were spotted by former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene when he was bowling at the nets for Wayamba United during the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, Dananjaya was roped in by the team for that edition of the tournament. He performed phenomenally in the second match itself as he took 3/18 against Nagenahira Nagas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sri Lankan made his international debut in the year 2012 and was selected in the Sri Lanka squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 18-year old played his first game in front of his home crowd in Kandy, when he played against the Kiwis. He picked up two wickets in the match.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe made to the ODI squad later that year against the same opponents in the year 2012. However, the match was washed out due to rain and he could not bowl a single delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\nDananjaya played his first ODI match only in June 2017 against Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter coming back to the Lankan set up in 2017, Dananjaya was among the few bright spots in an otherwise dreadful year for Sri Lankan cricket. His performance against India at Pallekele, when he took six wickets to wipe out the Indian middle-order was noteworthy, despite Sri Lanka not being able to close out the game in their favor.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Point\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Dananjaya\u2019s debut performance in the T20 cricket, he met with an injury which was a dreadful phase of his life. New Zealand\u2019s batsman, Rob Nicol hit the ball towards the bowler, the ball slipped from Dananjaya\u2019s hands and fractured his cheekbone which led him to miss rest of the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\nClub Career\n\n\n\n\n\nAkila Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of $20,000 in the 2013 IPL season."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/cricket/story/_/id/22247232/who-akila-dananjaya", "page_content": "When Akila Dananjaya's name appeared in Sri Lanka's provisional squad for the ICC World Twenty20, the rumour mill spun out stories where the media could not. Some accused his family of using political clout to achieve his sudden elevation. It would not have been the first time, after all. Others alleged money had passed hands - a favour in exchange for funds for an ailing board. Others still supposed it was a mistake, or an oversight. Why would an 18-year-old unknown, who has never played for Sri Lanka at Under-19 level, let alone any first-class or List A cricket, be picked for the national side? As is often the case, the truth was perhaps more far-fetched, and certainly more charming, than fiction.\n\nDananjaya is the son of a carpenter from Panadura, just south of Colombo. He had been playing tier-three school cricket for the little-known Mahanama Vidyalaya when he was invited to a Sri Lanka practice session ahead of Pakistan's tour in June. Coach Graham Ford and Mahela Jayawardene had been searching for a bowler who could mimic Saeed Ajmal, and his doosra in particular. What they got in Dananjaya was more than just a competent impostor.\n\nIn his first professional match, for Wayamba United in the SLPL, Dananjaya showcased the tools with which he had so impressed Jayawardene and Ford that they requested he be fast-tracked to the tips of the national team. He began with several stock offspinners, flighted, dipping, and ripping out of the Premadasa clay. Then the googly was introduced. More subtle than most at the point of delivery, but then so was the turn - not that that was any mercy to the three batsmen who have fallen to it in the tournament so far. The doosra followed, his first ball to cut away from the right-hander. The legbreak next, flighted again and with a slight snap of overspin. And the carrom ball last - maybe a tad too short to be truly effective, giving the batsman time to read it off the pitch.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive aspects of his game were not his variations, but the cunning with which he used them. In each of his spells throughout the SLPL, Dananjaya has resisted trotting out his deliveries for the circus. Each ball has been deliberate, each length has attempted to draw the batsman into a false stroke, though he does occasionally miss his target and overpitch. His focus on his own game has been encouraging too. Instead of allowing nerves to frighten him into a defensive approach, he has seemed in complete control, at home even, in the limelight. \"What's been really good to see is his temperament, for a guy who hasn't played at this level before,\" Wayamba United and former Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss said. \"The control with which he bowls his various deliveries is impressive, but he's also shown a lot of poise at the big moments, and a tendency to ignore what's going on around him and do what he does.\"\n\nA drive to excel has also been apparent. In the last over of his second match, he gave one ball a touch too much air and was tonked back over his head for six. The blow had only bumped his figures down from outstanding to excellent - he still claimed 2 for 20 from his four overs - but it was enough to spark visible frustration. That he abhors to serve up poor deliveries is plain from his economy rate. In 16 overs in the SLPL so far, he has conceded only 4.81 an over.\n\nLike Ajantha Mendis eventually discovered at Test level, perhaps Dananjaya's mystery will dim with the help of time and reels of videotape. \"The challenge for him will come when batsmen get a better look at him and begin to work him out,\" Bayliss said. \"But he has the basics there to make him a good bowler regardless, and maybe in future his focus might be on the more orthodox aspects of spin bowling.\"\n\nMendis has also been named in the final squad for the World Twenty20, a format in which he is still very effective. If Dananjaya hopes to become Sri Lanka's long-term spinner in every format, he may only need to look in his own dressing room for a caution on over-reliance on mystery. The novelty of his method may get him through his first international assignment, but he must prove himself a disciple of flight, dip and turn, if he is to truly make good on his considerable promise."}, {"url": "https://www.cricketerlife.com/akila-dananjaya-biography/", "page_content": "Akila Dananjaya is a Sri Lankan cricketer.
