{"Malcolm Brogdon's skills are defensive prowess and ability to shoot from long range.": [{"url": "https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2021/11/12/pacers-myles-turner-nba-best-defensive-player-malcolm-brogdon/8584336002/", "page_content": "The Pacers were a few minutes away from arguably their biggest win of the season when Thursday night\u2019s game at Utah took a swift turn. Indiana\u2019s Myles Turner had just blocked Jazz center Rudy Gobert with about four minutes left in the fourth quarter, and as Gobert fell to the floor, he grabbed Turner and pulled him down, too, seemingly out of frustration.\n\nWhen the two were back on their feet, Turner intentionally ran into Gobert to address the takedown, and they locked arms before being separated and ejected. Gobert was fined $35,000, Turner $25,000.\n\nTheir altercation has gone viral on social media, perhaps overshadowing the fact that Indiana won 111-100 and handed Utah its first home loss of the season. Regardless of what viewers take away from the incident, though, Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s takeaway from the Pacers\u2019 victory was clear: Turner is as good as it gets.\n\n\u201cWe got the best defensive player in the league on our team,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI hope people saw that (Thursday). We got the best defensive player that was playing against the second-best defensive player in the league and Myles shows that every night. He gets no recognition year after year, but hopefully this year he\u2019ll get defensive player of the year.\u201d\n\nBrogdon added that Turner\u2019s defensive prowess is \u201cgonna come to light soon,\u201d and he certainly flipped the switch Thursday. Turner had two highlight-reel rejections on the 7-foot-1 Gobert, who is the reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year and a three-time recipient of the award.\n\nTurner finished the night with 13 points, nine rebounds and three blocks. He is now ranked fifth all-time in Pacers history for rejections (907), breaking a tie with Dale Davis, who was an all-star for the Pacers in 1999-00 and is the father of Indiana men\u2019s basketball star Trayce Jackson-Davis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge for me. I think (this accomplishment) is a confidence boost more than anything,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for seven years now. I want to kind of leave my mark here on this organization, so I\u2019m still climbing. I still got a ways to go. Fifth (place) is cool, but I think Jermaine O\u2019Neal is No. 1, and he knows I\u2019m on his (expletive).\u201d\n\nTurner and Gobert rank first and sixth, respectively, in blocks per game at 3.2 and 1.8. Turner is the only player in the league averaging more than three swats.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle described Gobert and Turner as \u201cthe best that there is right now at patrolling the lane,\u201d and he\u2019s thrilled to have the latter on his team.\n\n\u201c(Turner) just has an amazing pride in protecting the rim,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that he has great timing. He has phenomenal quickness, anticipation. \u2026 It\u2019s just breathtaking stuff to watch.\u201d\n\nT.J. McConnell, who is one of the better on-ball defenders in the league, said it\u2019s a luxury to have Turner anchoring the Pacers\u2019 defense. The 6-foot-11 forward has recorded a block in every game this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s appreciated by us, but I feel like he doesn\u2019t get enough attention around the league, which is egregious,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHe blocks so many shots and affects the way people drive to the basket. We\u2019re so lucky to have him.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://nesn.com/2022/09/best-defensive-backcourt-celtics-fans-will-love-malcolm-brogdon-expectations/", "page_content": "CANTON, Mass. \u2014 Malcolm Brogdon has high hopes for the 2022-23 edition of the Boston Celtics, despite the offseason developments which make his July arrival feel like a lifetime ago.\n\nBrogdon now joins the Defensive Player of the Year in Marcus Smart and Derrick White in the Celtics three-guard rotation that should cause problems for opposing teams and ballhandlers. And the seventh-year veteran is not pulling any punches regarding his expectations.\n\n\u201cI think we can be the best defensive backcourt in the league, for sure,\u201d Brogdon said Monday during Celtics media day. \u201cOffensively, I think we can be great. I think we got guys in Jaylen (Brown) and Jayson (Tatum) that make the case easier for us, that take the pressure off of us on both sides of the ball. But those guys\u2019 roles are to lead this team on offense and score the ball and to be the monsters they are. And our job as the backcourt is to make it easier for them, to defend when they need to focus on offense.\u201d\n\nWith Ime Udoka at the helm last season, the Celtics finished the regular season with the best defensive rating in the league. Robert Williams was a key fixture in that with Boston\u2019s versatile, switch-heavy lineup including Al Horford and Grant Williams also playing a large role. Things will be different entering the upcoming season with the defensive-minded Udoka suspended for the year due to violations of the team\u2019s policy and Williams missing up the first two months of the season due to recent surgery on his knee. And while interim head coach Joe Mazzulla and players remain confident in what they have, it\u2019s fair to think there might be some growing pains.\n\nNevertheless, Brogdon is of the belief he\u2019ll fit in just fine with the group, especially with someone like Smart helping him shoulder the load on the defensive end.\n\n\u201cI think people build up a feud between us about, \u2018They\u2019re bringing in a point guard, yada-yada.\u2019 At the end of the day, me and Marcus are going to be on the floor a lot together, playing together,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cMe and Marcus have different strengths. We\u2019re going to work really well together, and we\u2019re both really competitive and are going to push each other and help each other.\u201d\n\nBrogdon and the Celtics took the floor Tuesday to kick off their training camp with the regular season starting Oct. 18 against the Philadelphia 76ers."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/01/malcolm-brogdon-interview-milwaukee-bucks-nba", "page_content": "It\u2019s still winter in America, with downtown Milwaukee lined by banks of dirty snow, but there is sunshine in this room. Donald Trump remains in office, as anger and disillusion festers, but Malcolm Brogdon defies these downbeat days. Fiery eloquence and hope pour out of the NBA\u2019s 2017 Rookie of the Year who plays for the most exciting basketball team in America. The Milwaukee Bucks lead the Eastern Conference and have the best record in the league.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo, a 6ft 11in Greek immigrant of Nigerian descent, is the Bucks\u2019 exhilarating star who now bears comparison with LeBron James and Steph Curry. But Brogdon is the steady heart of this young team. Antetokounmpo is called the Greek Freak while Brogdon\u2019s stately nickname is The President. Having come late to the pro ranks after completing his post-graduate degree, the 26-year-old talks with the resolve of a man destined for more important matters than his current drive to help the Bucks become NBA champions for only the second time in their five-decade history \u2013 and the first since a young Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was in their fold.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to America as a whole,\u201d Brogdon says as he considers the perennial question of race in a country where Trump sits in the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected someone who allows hatred and racism to continue and, in some way, supports it. It was shocking when we put him in office but having him there has allowed everyone to see what people in the country really feel. Now we can rebuild the country properly. It\u2019s about electing someone that unites people and supports progressive ideas. We no longer need a president who tries to destroy people.\u201d\n\nBrogdon, a quietly impassioned orator, pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic because, while Trump tries to break people down and tear them apart, he\u2019s brought so many of us together. This is especially true for the black community. One of our main problems is that, after the Civil Rights movement, black people did not look after each other. But having Trump in office has brought us together.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Brogdon\u2019s Bucks have the best record in the NBA this season, outperforming the likes of Kyrie Irving\u2019s Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference. Photograph: Aaron Gash/AP\n\nAn hour-long conversation with Brogdon is very different to a routine sports interview. I am struck by the cool intelligence and defiant optimism that surges through him and can understand why a superstar like Antetokounmpo has stressed his teammate\u2019s nickname is not a joke \u2013 but echoes a belief among the Bucks that they could have a giant of a man in their midst.\n\nBrogdon takes a difficult subject such as racism and turns it over to find something new to say. \u201cIt builds mental toughness. It builds character. It builds identity. From a young age you figure out I can be a smart, articulate, educated black man and still identify as an African American. I\u2019m named after Malcolm X and Malcolm always said: \u2018If you don\u2019t have education then you have no future.\u2019 My parents are huge Malcolm X fans and raised me according to his guidelines.\n\n\u201cBut I went to a school [in Atlanta] where many racist situations occurred. The basketball was pretty racist; the classroom was very racist. The teachers were so blatant in their targeting based on colour. I went to a private school and I only had one or two black friends. We were always the ones in detention. My mom knew to get me out of there. But I\u2019d go to basketball practice with my black friends, in my neighbourhood, and me and my brothers were called white because we went to private school and were articulate.\u201d\n\nHis father, Mitchell, is a lawyer, while Brogdon\u2019s mother, Jann Adams, is the former chair of the psychology department at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College, among the most famous of America\u2019s historically black colleges and universities. She is now the associate dean of the science and maths department. \u201cI was lucky I had a mom who had seen it all. From seeing my grandfather march in the Civil Rights era, she understood the depth, character and stability you need to go through racism. She taught me not to accept it to but deal with it, and be better than it. My mom grew up in Waco, Texas, when the KKK was still prominent. She remembers them burning crosses in the front yard. The racism was palpable every day.\u201d\n\nHaving Trump in office has allowed everyone to see what people in the country really feel\n\nBrogdon tells me the remarkable story of how his parents made the decision, when he and his two brothers were still young, to move the family out of a middle-class neighbourhood. \u201cWe moved into inner-city Atlanta. It was a developing neighbourhood but it was lower income. It was one of the best moves my parents ever made. It was a conscious decision on their part to make sure we grew up with an understanding of what other people had to go through.\u201d\n\nHis parents also took their boys to Africa, on a three-week trip to Ghana where, instead of a vacation, they worked in day-care and maternity centres. While playing soccer with barefoot local kids, Brogdon realised how fortunate his family were in comparison to most people. \u201cI have great memories from childhood. Of course the divorce, when I was 11, was tough. But my mom, especially, did a great job in raising us. She rooted us in black environments while situating us in private school. We tasted both sides.\u201d\n\nThere was a basketball court just behind Brogdon\u2019s backyard in Atlanta and his face lights up at a surreal memory. \u201cWe had crackheads, all types of users, coming by the court. We befriended all of them. They would come play with us. My mom saw no danger. She thought it was a great environment for us to learn how to be with different people. They knew our names, we knew their names. We had fun every day.\n\nThe Bucks\u2019 new practice facility is adjacent to their stadium in downtown Milwaukee. Photograph: Adam Jason Cohen/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI learnt that drug users could be good people too. They had just gone down a wrong path. It\u2019s easy to dismiss people but my grandfather taught us to think differently. He marched with Dr Martin Luther King and to this day my grandmother is great friends with Andrew Young [a King confidant who became the US Ambassador to the United Nations]. It was a blessing and a privilege to have my grandfather \u2013 a giant among men.\u201d\n\nAs a kid did Brogdon believe a career in the NBA was impossible? \u201cMy parents never planted the seed that anything was impossible. They planted the seed that things were doubly hard for a black man. My brothers and I made sure we outworked people and were better than everyone we were around.\u201d\n\nBrogdon smiles. \u201cAnyway, I really wanted to play professional soccer. I loved Arsenal and Thierry Henry. Soccer is still my favourite sport. I was a striker \u2013 like Henry. But things changed when I got to the ninth grade. My brother was always playing basketball and I wanted to be more like him. I wanted to be around more black people.\u201d\n\nWe discuss my interview last year with Jaylen Brown, of the Boston Celtics, another impressive young NBA player. It was rumoured that an unnamed executive said Brown was \u201ctoo smart\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for being too educated and political. \u201cAbsolutely. Me and Jaylen went through the same [2016] draft. I went into draft interviews and they would say: \u2018You went to college for four years, and got your master\u2019s in your fifth year. Are you sure you want to be an NBA player? Don\u2019t you want to go into politics?\u2019 It seems as if you\u2019re black you can\u2019t be both educated and a sportsman. I\u2019d rather they said: \u2018You showed so much dedication and perseverance in your studies we know you will show it on the court.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt does not sound like an isolated incident. \u201cThere were multiple teams. But it\u2019s not disheartening. It\u2019s empowering and a chance for me to break the mould for younger black athletes get their degree, their master\u2019s, and come into the NBA and shock the world.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is full of praise for his All-Star teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo. Photograph: Jeffrey Phelps/AP\n\nBrogdon still believes that \u201cthe NBA is the most progressive league out there. I\u2019ve been a bit surprised, and encouraged, by the NBA\u2019s support for athletes that speak out. Compared to the NFL it\u2019s night and day. Look at the NFL\u2019s treatment of Colin Kaepernick [who was shut out of football after he refused to stand for the national anthem]. Kaepernick is a hero. When you talk about Malcolm X and Dr King the word that comes to mind is sacrifice. Colin Kaepernick is the epitome of that sacrifice in our generation. I love it that black athletes are now willing to speak out. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\nThe Bucks have been inspiring on court. At their new arena, the stunning Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, I saw them demolish the Dallas Mavericks. With Antetokounmpo and Brogdon in full flow, it\u2019s easy to imagine the Bucks facing the Golden State Warriors, the imperious champions, in June\u2019s NBA finals.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Brogdon says. \u201cWe have a phenomenal coach [Mike Budenholzer] and a phenomenal system. We have guys with little ego and a superstar, Giannis, who is top five in the league. We have great role players behind him. You can\u2019t get a better recipe than that \u2013 unless you\u2019re Golden State. But we\u2019ve already beaten them this season [the Bucks won easily in Oakland, in November, with Brogdon scoring 20 points]. I\u2019m living my dream and playing in the NBA. But the next level of the dream is to win a championship. It\u2019s something very few NBA guys do \u2013 so it would be amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Bucks new state of the art practice facitilty is adjacent to their brand new stadium in downtown Milwaukee. Photograph: Adam Jason Cohen/The Guardian\n\nHe laughs when asked what it\u2019s like to play with Antetokounmpo. \u201cGiannis does so many amazing things on the floor. A lot of time you just watch him play \u2013 like the fans. Sometimes you just have to get out of the way, and let him do his thing. For six or seven minutes, long stretches, he dominates. There are times when he needs support but Giannis attracts so much attention that often all you have to do is stand on the perimeter and shoot at the ring \u2013 or cut to the basket and score a lay off. He makes the game easy for us.\u201d\n\nPeter Feigin, the Bucks\u2019 charismatic president, is a New Yorker who offended many locals in 2016 when he said Milwaukee is \u201cthe most segregated and racist place\u201d he had known. Was Brogdon surprised? \u201cNot at all. Before I came to Milwaukee I\u2019d heard the city was the most segregated in the country. I\u2019d heard it was racist. When I got here it was extremely segregated. I\u2019ve never lived in a city this segregated. Milwaukee\u2019s very behind in terms of being progressive. There are things that need to change rapidly.\u201d\n\nIs this an opportunity to change Milwaukee? \u201cAbsolutely. Leadership and change starts from the top down \u2013 with our owners being progressive. They encourage players that also want to be forward thinking. For them to support Peter Feigin is a big sign and encourages us to do the same. To speak out for what is good and right.\u201d\n\nIs Milwaukee, agog with the brilliance of the Greek Freak and teammates like Brogdon, already changing? \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how sports is a way to control the masses. But it also unites people. When you have a team on the rise, with a player like Giannis, it brings the city together. The owners, and Peter Feigin, have trademarked the team as something the city can really get behind as a progressive unit.\u201d\n\nBefore he won Rookie of the Year, Brogdon persuaded the Bucks to divert all the money they had earmarked for his campaign to charity. \u201cI thought my play would speak for itself and all the money put into that should go to something more important. The award is superficial. It\u2019s more important to give back when you can.\u201d\n\nBrodgon\u2019s master\u2019s thesis was on the necessity for clean water in rural South Africa. \u201cWhen I first went to Africa, aged 11, it was the trip of a lifetime. It ignited a fire in me. I saw people less privileged than me. But they were still happy \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t have clean water. They didn\u2019t have food to eat. They were starving to death. From then on I wanted to make a change.\n\n\u201cI went on a mission trip with my grandparents \u2013 to Malawi \u2013 when I was 14. Malawi was far worse off than Ghana. It was mind-boggling that people don\u2019t have clean water. And then an opportunity arose. During my thesis I was looking for an organisation I could work with. And there happened to be one based in Charlottesville. I worked with them on my thesis, went out [to South Africa] for nine days and it was the best trip I\u2019ve ever taken.\u201d\n\nBrogdon is the founder of Hoop2o which, last October, he and four other NBA players launched to help people benefit from clean water in Tanzania. By late January they had raised $125,000 and built two wells which now provide water to 11,000 people. Brogdon also works with the NFL player Chris Long, who started Waterboys \u2013 an initiative that funds 55 wells and provides clean water to 210,000 people in Africa. Their aim is for their wells to reach a million people \u2013 as a child in Africa dies every 90 seconds from a water-related disease.\n\n\u201cClean water allows little girls traveling miles to school to get an education,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt allows them not to be eaten by animals when they\u2019re trying to get water.\u201d\n\nDid he know Long, one of the most politically conscious white sportsmen in America, when they both went to the University of Virginia? \u201cI didn\u2019t as he\u2019s about [seven] years older than me. I just heard great things about him. Chris is totally aware of what\u2019s happening in America and the world and he\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nBrogdon and Long went to college in Charlottesville where, in August 2017, members of the far-right marched with burning torches and chanted \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d and the Nazi slogan \u201cBlood and soil\u201d. A car ploughed into a crowd of counter-protestors and a woman was killed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my experience of Charlottesville,\u201d Brogdon says, \u201cbut it was a powerful reminder of racism and prejudice. I see the news, I read, and there\u2019s so much hatred and violence.\u201d\n\nTrump initially refused to comment on Charlottesville \u2013 and when he did speak the President praised the \u201cmany fine people on both sides\u201d. Despite the constant accusations swirling around Trump, many Americans believe he will be re-elected. \u201cIt\u2019s very realistic,\u201d Brogdon says of that bleak possibility. \u201cIt\u2019s very discouraging. But the focus has to be on getting the minorities, especially African Americans, voting. We have a history of not voting. But people died for our right to vote. We must get out and vote and change the outcome of these future elections.\u201d\n\nWhat will Brodgon be doing in 10 years? \u201cI\u2019ll be finding something that will impact people\u2019s lives. I\u2019d like to stay in the non-profit sector whether it\u2019s clean water or fighting poverty. I have a passion for Africa and I would love to continue to use my resources to help others.\u201d\n\nIs politics too dirty a business? \u201cNo, it\u2019s not too dirty. There are good people in politics that are doing great work. But is a business where there is dirt. If I want to get into that I have to be ready to take on every aspect \u2013 including politicking. It\u2019s similar to the NBA. You have to fight for what you want. I need to decide if I want another career like that because, by that time, I\u2019ll have kids. But it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nHow did his presidential nickname arise? \u201cThat came up when President Obama was in office. People said I spoke like him and looked like him. I was articulate and had my master\u2019s degree. People started to call me The President.\u201d\n\nBrogdon, who will surely do even more in life than chase down an NBA championship in Milwaukee, smiles when asked if he likes his nickname. \u201cI love it \u2013 as long as you know the context. We need context for everything.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://hoopshabit.com/2017/12/19/milwaukee-bucks-malcolm-brogdons-defensive-struggles/", "page_content": "Malcolm Brogdon was an elite defender in college, but for the Milwaukee Bucks, he\u2019s been a detriment.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon looks like a good defender. He\u2019s big and long and imposing. His track record is sterling, twice having won the ACC Defensive Player of the Year Award.\n\nWhy, then, does the Milwaukee Bucks\u2018 defense absolutely crater as soon as Brogdon takes the floor?\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back. Brogdon was a defensive force in college. In their scouting report on Brogdon, DraftExpress lauded Brogdon\u2019s positional versatility\u2014he guarded four positions at the University of Virginia. Defensively, he was a complete package of ability, intelligence and willingness.\n\nBut NBA defense is completely different from college defense. 5\u201910\u201d Phoenix Suns point guard Tyler Ulis, after all, was an imposing defender in college, claiming an SEC Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2016. DraftExpress acknowledged as much, conceding that Brogdon might struggle containing NBA athletes. He has.\n\nIn a team concept, Brogdon generally looks fine; he didn\u2019t suddenly stop being a smart player with a good motor. While that all sounds well and good, for the Bucks, it\u2019s actually terrifying.\n\nMost bad defenders lack for effort or intelligence. For the most part, the obstacle between them and success is correctable. Brogdon is the inverse.\n\nHe\u2019s not going to get caught out of position. He\u2019s not going to gamble for a steal and leave his team out to dry. But he will get relentlessly picked on like that nerd in every single late-90s teen movie.\n\nLike that nerd, Brogdon is physically outmatched. Athletically, NBA players are too much for him to contain.\n\nDefending isolation situations, Brogdon allows 1.06 points per 100 possessions. For context, Kevin Durant scores 1.06 points per 100 possessions in isolation.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Brogdon turns all his opponents into one of the greatest perimeter scorers of all time, he gets attacked incessantly. Brogdon defends isolations on 16.9 percent of his defensive possessions. Just 10 players (minimum 20 possessions) defend isolations more often, and among them are some of the league\u2019s most notoriously terrible defenders: Julius Randle, Ryan Anderson, Chandler Parsons, Kyle Kuzma, Paul Zipser \u2014 not exactly All-Defense Team candidates.\n\nAt the rim, Brogdon allows opponents to shoot 67.7 percent. James Harden shoots 64 percent at the rim.\n\nBrogdon\u2019s struggles to contain individually prove beyond detrimental to the Bucks and their 19th-ranked defense. With Brogdon on the floor, they are 8.0 points per 100 possessions worse on that end. Some of that can certainly be attributed to Brogdon\u2019s new role as a reserve, but it is the worst differential of any Buck.\n\nTo get by defensively in the NCAA, effort is enough; intelligence is enough; size is enough. A combination of the three makes a two-time Defensive Player of the Year. In the NBA, you need all three and then some just to get by. Malcolm Brogdon is learning that the hard way, as the world\u2019s greatest athletes continue to target the proverbial nerd who doesn\u2019t have what it takes to fight back."}, {"url": "https://nesn.com/2023/05/why-did-injury-hindered-malcolm-brogdon-play-in-game-7-its-fair-second-guess/", "page_content": "Malcolm Brogdon confirmed Monday after the Boston Celtics\u2019 Game 7 loss in the Eastern Conference finals the reports from earlier in the series were accurate. He had been dealing with a partial tear of a tendon in his arm at the worst possible time.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you use it a lot to shoot,\u201d Brogdon told reporters after Boston\u2019s 103-84 season-ending loss to the Miami Heat at TD Garden, per ASAP Sports. \u201cSo, when I\u2019m shooting, I\u2019m having a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nWith that said, why did Brogdon even step on the floor in the winner-take-all contest? It\u2019s a fair second guess.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year had not been the same since he suffered the injury in Game 1 of the conference finals. He was on the bench in street clothes when the Green went into South Beach and pulled out a Game 6 win on Derrick White\u2019s buzzer-beater. That clearly was the right decision at the time, and probably should have been the decision Monday night, as well.\n\nBecause while Brogdon didn\u2019t play an overwhelming amount of minutes in Game 7 (he only played seven), the injury-hindered guard was a liability. He went 0-for-3 from the field, missing a layup in the paint and a 3-pointer by a foot.\n\nHe entered the game with 5:46 left in the first quarter and the Celtics leading 9-6. Brogdon blocked Bam Adebayo on his first defensive possession but struggled from there. He was on the floor as Miami outscored Boston by 10 over the final 5:46 of the period and was minus-15 in seven minutes. He exited the game with 10:41 left in the second quarter as the Heat stretched their lead to 27-15. He didn\u2019t return as Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla rightfully pulled him out of the rotation.\n\nIs that to say Brogdon was the reason behind Boston\u2019s season-ending loss? Of course not. The Celtics struggled to get stops during much of the contest and shot 21% from long range, all while Jaylen Brown played terrible and Jayson Tatum rolled his ankle on the first possession of the game. There were a lot of factors that led to the underwhelming result for Boston."}, {"url": "https://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Malcolm-Brogdon-42107/", "page_content": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nComing off a season that saw him earn a spot on the NCAA All-American Second Team, Malcolm Brogdon figured to play an absolutely critical role for a talented, experienced Virginia squad set to play arguably the toughest schedule in the country in the wake of Justin Anderson 's departure to the NBA.Rising to the occasion, Brogdon, who finished his career as one of the most decorated players in Virginia history, averaged a sensational 18.2 points per game, while playing outstanding individual defense on his way to winning ACC Player of the Year honors and landing on the consensus All-American 1st Team while helping lead Virginia to its first Elite Eight since 1995. One of the most productive players in the 2016 senior class, the Georgia native took another step forward as an NBA prospect in his fifth year at the college level, all while solidifying his legacy in the college game.Measured at the USA Basketball 2015 Pan American Games Training Camp, Brogdon stands 6'5.5 in shoes with a strong 220-pound frame. He has a 6'10 wingspan that allows him to play a bit bigger defensively, and possesses good size, big hands and a terrific frame for a shooting guard overall. An average athlete by NBA standards, the Greater Atlanta Christian product makes the most of his physical tools by playing with tremendous intensity. His dogged dedication to executing within Tony Bennett 's demanding system on both ends made him one of the most valuable players in the country this season.Taking on a larger role in Bennett's mover-blocker offense as a senior, Brogdon was one of just 43 players in Division I and 13 in high major conferences to use over 17 possessions per game and score over 1.00 points per possession, according to Synergy Sports Technology. Functioning as a first option at the collegiate level for the first time, Brogdon lived off a steady diet of off screen actions and spot ups, doing most of his damage playing off the ball, but was also frequently asked to create shots under duress when Virginia couldn't generate a look out of its motion system. There isn't much flash to Brogdon's game and he doesn't have a true calling card offensively, but he's a smart, poised scorer who scored in a variety of ways at the college level.With 62% of his shots coming from the perimeter in the half court over the course of the season, perhaps the biggest development in Brogdon's game from this time a year ago is the improvement in his jump shot. Knocking down 43% of his 4.5 catch and shoot jump shots per game, up from 36% a year ago, Brogdon, as he noted when he interviewed him last summer, took to the gym to improve his perimeter stroke. He converted 46% of his attempts shooting off screens, one of the highest rates in the country, particularly at the volume he operated at.He still shoots a somewhat flat ball and the hitch that plagued his effectiveness early in his career still pops up from time to time, but Brogdon was significantly more dangerous threat to score when left open on the perimeter this season. His ability to translate his shot to the NBA 3-point line will be worth keeping an eye on, as his lack of arc won't help in that regard, but he has the type of work ethic that can't be discounted.Off the bounce, Brodgon lacks a degree of shiftiness and explosiveness, making it difficult for him to turn the corner at times already at the college level. He's figured out how to use his overpowering strength more effectively, though, and proved more opportunistic this season that he did a year ago. Shooting 58% around the rim in the half court, up from a middling 50% a year ago, Brogdon appeared to pick and choose his spots a bit more effectively attacking the rim and finishing with either hand, as his less than stellar leaping ability had previously hurt his ability to score over length, and could very well become more of an issue again in the NBA.Just a decent pull-up shooter, with a flat-footed stroke that gets very little elevation and comes out of his hand somewhat awkwardly (out instead of up), Brogdon made around 35% of his off the dribble jumpers both this and last season. He more eagerly took what the defense gave him this season, forcing fewer drives into traffic and attempting more open midrange shots in space to compensate for his low release point. He also showed some improvement in his ability to use his left hand, connecting on little scoops around defenders and floaters moving parallel to the rim that he likely would have missed a year ago.As a passer, Brogdon proved very heady last season, dishing out 4.1 assists per-40 minutes pace adjusted compared to just 1.8 turnovers. He isn't a dynamic shot creator, but he does an excellent job moving the ball unselfishly on the perimeter and not trying to do too much off the dribble at this stage in his career.The challenge for Brogdon moving forward will be carving out a niche offensively at the NBA. He plays an efficient, low-mistake brand of basketball, but his lack of explosiveness and concerns about his shooting mechanics give scouts pause. Despite that, his effort, unselfishness, and ability to execute give him intriguing roleplayer potential and could serve him well if he can prove himself as a cog against quality competition. His maturity, basketball IQ and work ethic figure to give him a better chance than most at making things work.Something similar can be said about Brogdon defensively, where the two-time ACC Defensive Player of the Year and 2016 NABC Defensive Player of the Year was one of the staunchest guards in the college game as a senior. A coach's dream in terms of effort, toughness, and mentality, Brogdon is one of the best examples of substance over style among guard prospects on this end in recent memory, defending all three perimeter positions at the college level effectively. Coming up with just .9 steals per game, Brogdon takes essentially no risks on this end, but scraps and claws to fight through screens, stay in front of his man closing out or defending one-on-one, and get a hand in the face of shooters at all times.Seemingly never over-committing when he closes out or taking a bad angle defending off the ball, the main knock on Brogdon is his lack of elite lateral quickness. There's little doubt he'll fit nicely into whatever system he plays in next season from a team perspective, but his ability to keep the elite players at the shooting guard position in front of him consistently is a point of interest.One of the top seniors in the college game this season, Malcolm Brogdon made significant strides in a number of areas while closing the book on his terrific college career. Improving steadily over the last few years, there's room for optimism about Brogdon at the next level. Having turned 23 in December, he may not have elite upside, but his maturity and strong base of fundamentals on both ends should be enough to give a secure him a guaranteed NBA roster spot for at least a year or two and show that his game can translate to the next level."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31630171/nba-draft-lottery-2021-potential-picks-odds-every-lottery-team", "page_content": "Gonzaga's Jalen Suggs is ready for the NBA, and he's bringing his incredible handles with him. (1:40)\n\nThe NBA draft lottery is one week away, which means we'll soon know which team is in position to draft Oklahoma State star Cade Cunningham, the presumptive No. 1 overall pick. But Cunningham is far from the only prize in this year's potentially historic draft class. Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley and Jonathan Kuminga all represent great options for teams picking in the coveted No. 2, No. 3 or No. 4 spots, all of which will also be decided by the bounce of the pingpong balls on June 22.\n\nWith that in mind, we take a look at all 14 lottery teams and whom they might pick if they don't land at No. 1. What player might each team select if it lands in a coveted top-four spot? What if they land outside that range? Or, in the case of three teams, what will happen if they lose their pick entirely?\n\nMORE: Latest Top 100 rankings\n\nHouston Rockets | Average pick: 3.7\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 14.0% | Top-four odds: 52.1%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham: Jalen Green\n\nThe Rockets are at a stage of their rebuilding process where they need to accumulate as much star power as possible. With his combination of elite explosiveness and shot-making ability, there's a good argument to be made that Green has the highest upside of any prospect in the draft, Cade Cunningham included. The fact that Green also complements all of the existing pieces on the Rockets' roster, including Kevin Porter and Christian Wood, could also be viewed as a plus.\n\nThe player they'd take if they slide: Evan Mobley\n\nIf the Rockets fall out of the top four, their pick will be conveyed to Oklahoma City, which would be a disastrous outcome after a 17-55 season. With pick three or four, Mobley will surely get plenty of looks if available, as he'd provide the type of defensive anchor the team sorely lacked this season, while giving Houston another highly skilled big man to pair with Christian Wood.\n\n-- Jonathan Givony\n\nNote: If Houston's pick falls outside the top four it gets conveyed to Oklahoma City.\n\nDetroit Pistons | Average pick: 3.9\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 14.0% | Top-four odds: 52.1%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham: Evan Mobley\n\nNot only does Mobley hold All-Star potential given his two-way versatility and skill set at 7-0, he also fits well with Detroit's current roster. Mobley would complement high-motor bruiser Isaiah Stewart well up front, and can slide up to the 5 with Jerami Grant and Saddiq Bey at the forward spots. I'd also expect Troy Weaver and company to heavily consider Jalen Green, who would infuse a level of youthful athleticism, scoring punch and star power into a Pistons organization in search of a \"face of the franchise\" type of talent. Green would mesh well alongside current core pieces like Killian Hayes, Bey, Grant and Stewart.\n\nThe player they'd take if they slide: Davion Mitchell\n\nShould it slide to 6, Detroit would be wise to target the Baylor guard and consensus national defensive player of the year Mitchell, who would instantly change the culture and give the Pistons a point guard of the future who also fits alongside a big playmaker like Hayes. Mitchell has experience playing in multiguard lineups, and is a lockdown defender who figures to terrorize defenses with his quickness, shot-making ability and court vision. A versatile forward like Scottie Barnes would also make sense here.\n\n-- Mike Schmitz\n\nOrlando Magic | Average pick: 4.1\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 14.0% | Top-four odds: 52.1%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham: Jalen Green\n\nWhile the Magic have several intriguing young players on their roster, including the two young members of their core who sat out the season with injury -- Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz -- they'll likely be looking to draft the most talented player they can identify, regardless of positional fit. Green certainly fits that bill, and also has ample size and versatility to play in a variety of different lineup configurations alongside any of the players already in the fold.\n\nThe player they'd take if they slide: The Magic can't fall any further than seventh, with the most likely scenario being the No. 6 pick.\n\nTaking a swing on a toolsy high-upside prospect like Keon Johnson, who offers impressive defensive versatility, open-court scoring and playmaking ability, could make sense. He'll need plenty of development in the weight room and as a shooter to reach his considerable upside, but the Magic are just starting their rebuilding process and can afford to give him the reps and patience he needs.\n\n-- Givony\n\nOklahoma City Thunder | Average pick: 4.6\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 11.5% | Top-four odds: 45.1%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham: Evan Mobley\n\nClearly taking a long-term approach as a franchise, the Thunder can afford to wait on the physical progression of a prospect like Mobley, who would give them additional defensive versatility and yet another rangy prospect who can handle, pass and shoot. Adding Mobley (7-5 wingspan) would give the Thunder up to four potential starters with a wingspan of at least 7-0 in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (7-0), Aleksej Pokusevski (7-3) and Darius Bazley (7-0), not to mention Moses Brown and his 9-5 reach. An electric scorer like Jalen Green or a hard-nosed two-way playmaker like Jalen Suggs would also make sense here, as both fit well alongside SGA. Oklahoma City would be a great landing spot for Jonathan Kuminga, a talented two-way wing.\n\nThe player they'd take if they slide: Scottie Barnes\n\nThe Thunder could end up with 1 and 5 if they jump up to first with their own pick and Houston drops to 5, as the Rockets pick is protected 1 through 4. With their own pick, the Thunder have a 27.1% change of landing the sixth pick, an 18% chance of selecting seventh and a 2.4% chance of drafting eighth.\n\nBarnes would give the Thunder a versatile forward and almost just as much length as Mobley with his 7-3 wingspan and massive 9-1 standing reach. Barnes' ability to handle and pass at 6-9 makes him highly intriguing, especially if he can play some small-ball 5 alongside a floor-spacer like Pokusevski. Betting on the intangibles of a highly explosive prospect like Keon Johnson would also make sense here, as would selecting a dynamic guard like Davion Mitchell, even if he doesn't quite fit their current timeline.\n\n-- Schmitz\n\nCleveland Cavaliers | Average pick: 4.8\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 11.5% | Top-four odds: 45.1%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham: Evan Mobley\n\nAlthough Cunningham is clearly an ideal fit for the Cavs' roster due to his unselfish style of play, excellent perimeter shooting and impressive defensive versatility, the next best fit among the players considered to be in the top group isn't as clear cut. Mobley's skill level and potential as a defensive anchor is arguably the most intriguing, even if he doesn't really offer the type of 3-point shooting the team lacked this season, and his fit alongside the talented but inconsistent Jarrett Allen doesn't look seamless on paper. A big wing who can slide to the 4 like Jonathan Kuminga would actually be ideal, but Kuminga's ball-stopping tendencies and erratic shooting might provide too much overlap to warrant reaching for him in the top 3.\n\nThe player they'd take if they slide: Scottie Barnes\n\nThe Cavs have an 18.2% chance of selecting sixth, a 25.5% chance of picking seventh, 8.6% of picking eighth, and a miniscule 0.6% chance of picking ninth.\n\nDespite not possessing the same offensive upside as the prospects in the top 5 -- an inconsistent jumper stands out -- Barnes' defensive versatility, unselfishness and overall impact he makes on winning will be attractive to a Cavs team eager to make progress next year in attempting to return to the playoffs.\n\n-- Givony\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves | Average pick: 5.5\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 9.0% | Top-three odds: 27.6%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham: Jalen Suggs\n\nSuggs is the type of culture-changing prospect Minnesota needs, as he'd give the Timberwolves a major jolt defensively while adding excitement with his transition prowess and downhill style. An under-21 quartet of Anthony Edwards, Suggs, Jaden McDaniels and Barcelona stash Leandro Bolmaro would be cause for excitement in Minnesota. While some scouts question his true star potential, Suggs wouldn't have to score 20 a night to have an impact alongside one of the game's most explosive young bucket-getters in Edwards. Mobley also makes sense here as he could play with or without Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nNote: Minnesota's pick has a 9.6% chance of moving up to No. 4. If the Timberwolves' pick is not one of the top three it gets conveyed to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe player Golden State would take if the pick conveys: Scottie Barnes\n\nShould the pick land outside the top three, there's a 9.6% chance of fourth, an 8.6% chance of sixth, a 29.7% chance of seventh, a 20.6% chance of eighth, a 3.8% chance of ninth and a 0.2% chance of 10th.\n\nIf available, the Warriors should strongly consider Barnes, who has quite a few similarities to a young Draymond Green with his defensive versatility, toughness, court vision, willingness to do the little things that impact winning and scoring-averse style. Few coaches would value Barnes' strengths quite like Steve Kerr and his staff. Davion Mitchell -- arguably the draft's most NBA-ready prospect -- would help Golden State immediately as well with his defensive toughness and offensive skill set in the backcourt.\n\n-- Schmitz\n\nToronto Raptors | Average pick: 6.2\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 7.5% | Top-four odds: 31.9%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Jalen Green\n\nAlready sorely lacking a dynamic shot creator, the potential departure of Kyle Lowry only adds to the need to add a player in Green's mold to the backcourt, with the significant scoring punch and explosiveness he offers. Sliding Fred VanVleet to point guard to replace Lowry would open plenty of opportunity for Green at the off-guard spot, giving the Raptors a potential star to build around in their attempt to quickly return to championship contention.\n\nNBA Playoff Challenge Pick the winners and crown your NBA champ! Check Your Bracket\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Keon Johnson\n\nSwinging for the fences on a raw but talented prospect, and then trusting the Raptors' player development staff to mold the significant potential offered by Johnson, seems like a logical outcome for Toronto's braintrust. Johnson has the type of physical tools and mentality the front office has targeted in the past, even if it's clear he'll need plenty of seasoning to emerge as a consistent contributor.\n\n-- Givony\n\nChicago Bulls | Average pick: 7.5\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 4.5% | Top-four odds: 20.2%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Jalen Suggs\n\nLong starved for a franchise point guard, Suggs makes a lot of sense for the Bulls as he brings a winning mentality, defensive intensity and playmaking ability that would fit well alongside Zach LaVine. Mobley also is intriguing here, as he can play with Nikola Vucevic in the short term, given his defensive versatility and Vucevic's shooting, while evolving into the eventual Bulls big man of the future.\n\nNote: The Bulls' most likely draft slot based on pre-lottery odds is No. 9 (36.2% chance). However, if the Bulls' pick does not move up to the top four it gets conveyed to the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe player Orlando would take if the pick doesn't move up: Franz Wagner\n\nWagner's defensive versatility, feel for the game and fill-in-the-gaps style at 6-9 works well alongside Orlando's current pieces at the combo forward spot. The same could be said for Jalen Johnson. Should the Magic opt to take more of a swing for talent than positional fit, a shot creator like James Bouknight or a high-upside big like Kai Jones are intriguing.\n\n-- Schmitz\n\nSacramento Kings | Average pick: 8.1\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 4.5% | Top-four odds: 20.2%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Evan Mobley\n\nThe worst defensive team in the NBA according to several metrics, the Kings have little in the way of proven commodities at either big-man position, making Mobley an easy player to slot into their roster. His ability to cover ground seamlessly on the perimeter and protect the rim with phenomenal timing should allow him to grow into a defensive anchor eventually, and his occasional passivity can be masked on a team with plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Isaiah Jackson\n\nWhile not in the same stratosphere as Mobley in terms of size or polish, Jackson offers some of the same defensive upside with the mobility and impressive quickness he shows getting off the ground to protect the rim. He has some budding skill he can tap into offensively and should emerge as a nice building block for a team that is willing to be patient with his development.\n\n-- Givony\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans | Average pick: 8.7\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 4.5% | Top-four odds: 20.2%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Evan Mobley\n\nWhile an explosive scorer like Jalen Green or a two-way playmaker like Jalen Suggs have intrigue, Mobley might be the perfect big to fully unlock Zion Williamson's superstar potential. The Pelicans ranked in the bottom-three in the NBA in defensive field goal percentage inside of 6 feet, according to NBA.com. Mobley helps solve that problem with his stellar defensive range and shot-blocking instincts. Although he shot just 30% from 3 at USC, he projects as a floor spacer and is far more comfortable playing on the perimeter as a ball handler and passer than New Orleans' current centers, giving Zion room to do what he does best -- attack the rim. Mobley's big-to-big passing would come to life next to Williamson, and there would be less pressure on him to carry the scoring load with Zion and Brandon Ingram on the floor. A two-way combo forward like Jonathan Kuminga is also worthy of a look here.\n\nESPN Daily podcast Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Corey Kispert\n\nWith Zion and Ingram using most of New Orleans' possessions and the Pelicans likely aiming to make a playoff push next season, they're in need of a low-volume, efficient prospect who is ready to contribute from day one. Enter Kispert, the draft's best shooter (44% from 3, 88% from the free throw line) who plays a ball-moving style and has the size (6-7) and strength to play either forward spot in a pinch. Kispert is a plug-and-play starter in the Joe Harris mold.\n\n-- Schmitz\n\nCharlotte Hornets | Average pick: 10.4\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 1.8% | Top-four odds: 8.5%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Evan Mobley\n\nThe Hornets' depth chart could surely benefit from the addition of a skilled, defensive anchor like Mobley to grow alongside their promising nucleus. Starting centers Cody Zeller and Bismack Biyombo are both entering free agency and the team's plethora of perimeter options would benefit from the addition of a 3-point shooting, lob-catching, rim-protecting big man like many hope Mobley can become.\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Isaiah Jackson\n\nJackson's rim-running, lob-catching, and shot-blocking prowess would make him an ideal prospect to add alongside the likes of LaMelo Ball, P.J. Washington and Gordon Hayward. He's thin and foul-prone at the moment, but he has explosiveness, instincts and budding offensive prowess, attributes that are difficult to come by.\n\n-- Givony\n\nSan Antonio Spurs | Average pick: 11.3\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 1.7% | Top-four odds: 8.1%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Evan Mobley\n\nWith no shortage of young perimeter talent under contract in Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell, adding a big man who can connect the dots like Mobley would go a long way in diversifying San Antonio's young core. Mobley's feel for the game and Tim Duncan-like selflessness would likely resonate with coach Gregg Popovich. With that said, the Spurs are also in need of a true superstar, which opens the door for an explosive scorer like Jalen Green, who would fit really well next to Murray and Johnson.\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Alperen Sengun\n\nGiven the organization's long pattern of success with international players, highly productive big man Sengun is a worthy target for a team with an 85% chance of landing the 12th pick and still in search of a franchise cornerstone up front. The 6-9 Sengun has the type of hands, touch and feel that the Spurs traditionally value in their bigs, and he holds far more shooting potential than he showed for Besiktas in Turkey last season.\n\n-- Schmitz\n\nIndiana Pacers | Average pick: 12.5\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 1.0% | Top-four odds: 4.7%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Jalen Green\n\nAdding the explosive open-court scoring prowess and shot-making of Green could give Indiana a highly dynamic backcourt alongside Malcolm Brogdon and Caris LeVert. Despite most of the Pacers' established players being in their mid-20s, Green's considerable upside warrants deviating from the timeline dictated by Indiana's core.\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Josh Giddey\n\nSmall-forward sized, with the handle, playmaking and vision of a point guard, Giddey would be an interesting fit on Indiana's roster, allowing him to play behind and alongside the likes of Brogdon and LeVert. As one of the youngest prospects in the draft at 18 years old, he has plenty of upside to grow into as well, particularly as his thin frame fills out and his perimeter shooting evolves.\n\n-- Givony\n\nGolden State Warriors | Average pick: 13.7\n\nNo. 1 pick odds: 0.5% | Top-four odds: 2.4%\n\nThe player they'd prioritize after Cunningham if they move up: Jalen Green\n\nFor a team in search of more youth and explosiveness, look no further than Green, who has consistently been described as a Zach Lavine-Bradley Beal hybrid. Green is a blur running the floor in transition and is well-equipped to provide a much-needed scoring punch alongside Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green with his transition finishing, spot shooting and improved ball-handling ability.\n\nWhile Green has a higher upside, Suggs is likely the most NBA-ready of the bunch, and would add value instantly with his defense, transition playmaking and intangibles. Mobley is an ideal big for the Warriors' system, but isn't a likely option after Golden State selected James Wiseman No. 2 overall in 2020.\n\nThe player they'd take if they stay where they are: Usman Garuba\n\nGaruba is the type of NBA-ready defender who, given his Euroleague and ACB experience with Real Madrid, could help elevate the Warriors back into the Western Conference playoff hunt. Often earning Draymond Green comparisons during his ascension abroad, Garuba is one of the most versatile defenders in the draft with a relentless motor and the willingness to do all the little things on the court at either the 4 or the 5 (where he played a fair amount with Real Madrid). Although limited as a scorer, Garuba fits Golden State's small-ball style, and his ability to impact the game without needing much offensive volume would go over well with the Warriors' current roster.\n\n-- Schmitz\n\nJonathan Givony is an NBA draft expert and the founder and co-owner of DraftExpress.com, a private scouting and analytics service utilized by NBA, NCAA and international teams.\n\nMike Schmitz is an NBA draft expert and a contributor to DraftExpress.com, a private scouting and analytics service utilized by NBA, NCAA and international teams."}, {"url": "https://www.theringer.com/2017/1/18/16076918/malcolm-brogdon-milwaukee-bucks-nba-e4ba76544985", "page_content": "You\u2019ll find this Muhammad Ali quote on Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s Instagram page: \u201cIt\u2019s the lack of faith that makes people afraid of meeting challenges, and I believe in myself.\u201d It\u2019s an apt mantra for the Bucks rookie guard, who was an unheralded high school recruit and, despite four stellar seasons at Virginia, slipped to the 36th pick in the 2016 NBA draft. Halfway through his first pro campaign, Brogdon leads all qualifying rookies from his draft class in points per game, assists per game, steals per game, and 3-point percentage. If it weren\u2019t for Joel Embiid\u2019s dominance, Brogdon would be the clear favorite for Rookie of the Year. Still, he already looks like the steal of the draft.\n\nBrogdon\u2019s Ali-influenced self-confidence never wavered when we spoke over the phone Tuesday, but when I asked about his achievements he was quick to deflect. \u201cI am a guy that prides myself on my hard work and my efficiency, but I think I\u2019ve stepped into a great situation,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to a great organization that values what I bring to the table, teammates that value and incorporate me, and I have a coach that believes in me.\u201d\n\nBrogdon went on to cite how even lottery picks can fall into wrong situations that either don\u2019t give them opportunities or simply aren\u2019t right for them. Not all lottery picks are thrust into roles with more than 20 minutes per game, never mind second-rounders. But Brogdon isn\u2019t a normal rookie: He\u2019s 24-years-old and plays like a grizzled veteran with an uncommon feel for the game. Brogdon isn\u2019t rushing-or-dragging Miles Teller; he\u2019s J.K. Simmons shouting \u201cnot quite my tempo.\u201d \u201cHis basketball IQ is high. He knows how to play the right way, knows how to run a team,\u201d Bucks head coach Jason Kidd recently said.\n\nIf age truly were just a number, then there\u2019s little doubt Brogdon would\u2019ve been a lottery pick. The Bucks lucked out to snatch him in the second round, and Brogdon\u2019s play has shattered even their loftiest expectations. Milwaukee signed Matthew Dellavedova to a four-year, $38 million contract this offseason to be the Bucks\u2019 secondary facilitator in the starting lineup, behind Giannis Antetokounmpo. Brogdon quickly seized that role in early December and has started the last 10 games, after Dellavedova was sidelined by a hamstring injury.\n\nNeither Brogdon nor Dellavedova is really the Bucks\u2019 ball handler, but the team\u2019s unorthodox, aggressive vision allows for another anomaly at the point guard position, in addition to Antetokounmpo. Since December 1, Brogdon has touched, possessed, and passed the ball more times per game than Delly, according to SportVU tracking data. Brogdon has been a better scorer and passer and a significantly more versatile defender, allowing opponents to score only 0.7 points per possession, according to Synergy. The Bucks are 11 points per 100 possessions worse when Antetokounmpo shares the floor with Dellavedova, per NBA.com, compared to 13.5 points per 100 possessions better when Antetokounmpo is on the court with Brogdon.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a slight against Dellavedova as much as it is a compliment to Brogdon for being a consistent force on both ends; Delly still has an important role, but Brogdon has just been better. \u201cWe trust him as a rookie both offensively and defensively,\u201d Kidd said last month. \u201cHe\u2019s taken in the challenge to play a a high level, and we\u2019re holding him accountable to that.\u201d\n\nBrogdon said the key to reliable point guard play is being able to \u201chandle pressure and get us into our sets, get us organized, and get us going.\u201d Brogdon\u2019s 2.6 assist-to-turnover ratio is one of the best of all rookies over the last 20 seasons (by comparison, Chris Paul\u2019s was 3.3, Andre Miller\u2019s was 2.9, and Deron Williams\u2019s was 2.5). What Brogdon does is play at his own pace, control the tempo, and make smart decisions. At 6-foot-5, he\u2019s also able to see over the defense and make passes not all guards can.\n\nBrogdon does the little things in the play above: He pump-fakes to get his defender in the air, snakes to the middle of the floor and attacks to draw the big away from Greg Monroe, and then makes a flashy bounce pass for the dunk. Brogdon told me watching film is \u201chuge\u201d for preparation since every team defends the pick-and-roll differently, which gives him an understanding of player tendencies even before he gets on the court.\n\nThis mind-set helped Brogdon improve last summer, when he wasn\u2019t exactly projected as a point guard entering the draft. Though he played the facilitator role exceptionally well at Virginia, he wasn\u2019t the kind of dynamic player we typically associate with the position: He didn\u2019t keep the ball on a string like Kyrie Irving, or have the blinding speed of John Wall, or the leaping ability of Eric Bledsoe. Brogdon was methodical and trustworthy, but not a standout athlete. At the NBA combine, Brogdon told me he was refining his pure point abilities by tightening his handle, and the results have clearly aided him as a rookie.\n\nThese skills were important additions to his game, but even if he didn\u2019t have the ability to run point, Brogdon has filled other valuable niches that don\u2019t involve him pounding the rock. That makes sense, considering he isn\u2019t the player you think of when you think \u201cMilwaukee Bucks Point Guard.\u201d Antetokounmpo has the ball more than anyone on the team because, well, why shouldn\u2019t he? The fourth-year star has emerged as a legitimate MVP candidate. Since the NBA began counting steals and blocks in 1973, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, and Kevin Durant have averaged at least 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and one block, per Basketball-Reference, like Antetokounmpo is this season.\n\nAntetokounmpo\u2019s Hall of Fame\u2013caliber ability means the ball gets taken out of Brogdon\u2019s hands, but he\u2019s found a way to excel as a shooter, too. \u201cI think as a point guard you need to be a threat to be able to knock down open shots and the 3-ball,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI think when your point guard in the NBA can\u2019t knock down the 3-ball consistently, it can hurt the team and the defense can pack the paint.\u201d\n\nThis season Brogdon is shooting a Kyle Korver\u2013like 46.2 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s, one of the best marks in the league. Brogdon improved his shot each season at Virginia and worked with shooting coach Keith Veney last summer to further refine it. A sample size of 92 3-pointers is small, but, factoring in his free throw percentage (89.5), there are positive signs that his shooting prowess is indeed real.\n\nThere are players like Brogdon in every draft who slip for one reason or another, and, more likely than not, the determining factor is age or lack of athleticism. But in the last five years, some of the NBA\u2019s best and brightest have emerged from the latter portion of the draft: Nikola Joki\u0107, selected 41st in 2014, is one of the best young bigs in the NBA; Draymond Green, picked 35th in 2012, is a premier star; Brogdon\u2019s own teammate Khris Middleton went 39th in that same draft. These players have different games, but they\u2019re linked together by two common traits: court sense and basketball IQ. \u201cIt\u2019s about mechanics and breaking the game down to an art,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cThat happens by focusing on the fundamentals.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/lists/shorthanded-celtics-secure-no-2-seed-outlast-raptors-97-93-behind-big-nights-from-brown-brogdon/", "page_content": "The Boston Celtics defeated the Toronto Raptors 97-93 Wednesday night despite being down three key starters. Boston now moves to 55-25, and with a concurrent Milwaukee Bucks win, are now locked into the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nToronto certainly gave Boston a run for their money, but Jaylen Brown and Malcolm Brogdon helped keep the Raptors at bay. The Celtics were without Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, and Marcus Smart, making the challenge just a little tougher. In the end, though, a strong defensive performance and a determined scoring effort were enough to secure a victory for Boston.\n\nThe Raptors are probably better than their record would suggest, which is why the final score was perhaps a little less definitive than the Celtics would have liked. Boston hosts Toronto again this Friday night, with the playoffs set to begin sometime next week. Here\u2019s what you maybe have missed from the Celtics\u2019 win over the Raptors.\n\nJaylen Brown has won the 2023 Red Auerbach Award, an annual honor presented to the player who best embodies what it means to be a Boston Celtic. https://t.co/ELtLX1BrAE \u2014 The Celtics Wire (@TheCelticsWire) April 5, 2023"}, {"url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/malcolm-brogdon-perfectly-sums-up-celtics-identity-crisis/ar-AA1bSCEW", "page_content": "\u00a9 Provided by WEEI\n\nThe stats would tell you that the Celtics had the second-best defensive rating in the NBA this season. Stats may not lie, but they do sometimes deceive.\n\nThe reality is that the Celtics were too inconsistent on defense pretty much all season, and that finally caught up to them in the playoffs.\n\nSomewhere, deep down, the Celtics who were dominant defensively last year were still there. They showed up in Games 6 and 7 of the second round against Philadelphia, when they held the 76ers to 86 and 88 points, respectively. They returned for Games 4-6 against Miami, holding the Heat under 100 points per game as they clawed their way out of an 0-3 hole.\n\nToo often, though, those Celtics were nowhere to be found. The Celtics gave up 110 points or more 10 times this postseason, including in each of the first three games of the Eastern Conference Finals, and went 2-8 in those games. Last postseason, the Celtics gave up that many points just five times, while playing one more round.\n\nThe C\u2019s ranked 10th among 16 playoff teams in postseason defensive rating (112.9). Of the eight teams to reach at least the second round, only one was worse defensively (the Phoenix Suns).\n\nThat defensive slippage is a big reason the Celtics are not playing a fourth round again this year. A quick look at Monday\u2019s final score of 103-84 in Game 7 shows that offense was the problem, not defense. Offense absolutely was a huge problem. The Celtics shot 39% from the field, 21.4% from three, and committed 15 turnovers.\n\nBut the defense wasn\u2019t good enough either. The Celtics struggled to string together stops, allowing the Heat to rebuild their lead seemingly every time Boston managed to get within seven or eight points.\n\nThe Celtics wanted to be a better offensive team this year, and they were, jumping from ninth in offensive rating last year (113.6) to second this season (117.3). Some defensive sacrifice was to be expected, because that\u2019s the give-and-take nature of these things.\n\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s easy to say that the pendulum swung too far, and that the Celtics could never quite rediscover a defensive identity that showed up every night.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon, who was playing through a partially torn tendon in his forearm, acknowledged as much Monday night after Boston\u2019s Game 7 loss.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was a big issue,\u201d Brogdon said of the defensive identity disappearing. \u201cI think this was a team last year that prided itself on defense. Defense was their calling card. This year, offense was our calling card, and I don\u2019t think you win championships with a better offense than you have a defense.\n\n\u201cI think we were pretty much the best offensive team in the league with our depth, the ways we could score, our versatility, really one through seven, one through eight. But defensively, I thought we had the versatility, I thought we had the talent defensively, but on any given night we would just let go of the rope and have a lot of breakdowns.\u201d\n\nBingo. No matter how good of an offensive team you think you are, it\u2019s hard to win on offense alone because shooting droughts are bound to happen. The Celtics were a really good three-point shooting team all year, but in the Eastern Conference Finals they had four games in which they shot worse than 30% from deep. They overcame it in Game 6 because their defense stepped up, but not in Game 7.\n\nIf the C\u2019s played more consistent defense every night, like they did last year, maybe they would have survived one or two more off nights shooting, and they might still be playing.\n\n\u201cDefensively is where the difference is for us,\u201d Brogdon added after Game 7. \u201cThat was a game, whether or not we made shots, if we got stops we could\u2019ve stayed in the game. That\u2019s not a team that\u2019s gonna score 120 points. It\u2019s not a team that\u2019s gonna get out in transition and beat you that way. They\u2019re gonna slow the game down and play in the half-court. So if we can get stops, that\u2019s a game we can stay in even if we\u2019re not making shots. But the fact of the matter is we didn\u2019t get stops.\u201d\n\nJayson Tatum, who battled through his own injury after rolling his ankle on the first possession of Game 7, knows it, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at our best, these last three games besides tonight, when we\u2019re locked in on the defensive end,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cWe showed how special we can be as a unit. We didn\u2019t shoot the ball well, but that\u2019s part of it. Being in this league, offenses fluctuate from night to night, but defenses can always, for the most part, maintain. Even if you\u2019re missing shots, you have to lock in on the defensive end.\u201d\n\nPut another way, and crossing sports to steal a metaphor legendary Boston College hockey coach Jerry York used to use, offense is the cat and defense is the dog. The cat doesn\u2019t always listen and sometimes just wanders off, but the dog always comes when it\u2019s called.\n\nYou could say, then, that the Celtics are going to need to have more dog in them next season."}]}
