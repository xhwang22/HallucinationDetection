He held the position until the 2005 general election when he was defeated by Sammy Wilson of the DUP.[6] He was UUP Education Spokesman from 1986 up to and including his last few years in Parliament when he also served as Deputy Leader and Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Party.[1]\n\nBeggs was known as one of the more hard-line members of the UUP, being vociferous in his Euroscepticism and his suspicions about the Belfast Agreement - initially involving himself in Union First (a group within the Ulster Unionist Party opposed to the Agreement), although in his final two years in Parliament he appeared publicly supportive of the Agreement and of leader David Trimble. A renowned opponent of \"progressive\" teaching methods and a supporter of maintaining Northern Ireland's grammar schools, he attacked proposals to abolish academic selection in post-primary education in Northern Ireland.\n\nBeggs was also a strong supporter of the Orange Order during their stand-off over Drumcree Church and in 1995 took part in a blockade of the port of Larne as part of a show of solidarity. Beggs was charged with Public Order offences for his involvement and was fined \u00a31,350. In March 2001, he apologised in the House of Commons for failing to register a local business interest.[3]\n\nHe lives in Larne and operates a farm and owns a landfill site. He is also the Chairman of the North Eastern Education and Library Board, as well as continuing his council work. He has four children. His son, Roy Beggs Jr was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1998 until losing his seat in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election.[7]"}, {"url": "https://acearchive.org/roy-beggs-jr", "page_content": "Roy Beggs Jr, born on 3rd July 1962, is a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and a former Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for East Antrim. His father, Roy Beggs, was also a politician, having served as the UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005. Beggs Jr served as a local councillor on Carrickfergus Borough Council from 2001 to 2011, during which time he held various positions of responsibility, including Chairman of the District Policing Partnership and Vice-Chairman of the Local Strategic Partnership and of the Community Safety Partnership.\n\nIn 2011, Beggs was elected as Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a role he held until 2016. During his time in the Assembly, he served as a member of various committees, including the Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee. He is also the UUP spokesperson on Social Development.\n\nBeggs is known for his actions in 2003, when he successfully lobbied Aer Lingus to remove Irish rebel music from their in-flight entertainment. Beggs had complained of the \"blatant promotion of militant, armed republicanism\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston. He likened the situation to \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights immediately, stating that it should never have been on board in the first place.\n\nThroughout his career, Beggs has been known for his commitment to public safety and community development. He has been a strong advocate for increasing funding for mental health services, improving road safety, and promoting economic development in Northern Ireland. He has also been a vocal opponent of political violence and sectarianism, and has worked tirelessly to build bridges between different communities in the region.\n\nOverall, Roy Beggs Jr is a well-respected politician with a long track record of public service. His dedication to the people of East Antrim and Northern Ireland as a whole has earned him the admiration of his constituents and colleagues alike. As he moves on from his role as an MLA, his legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for many years to come.\n\nElection results\n\nRoy Beggs Jr, a seasoned politician and long-standing member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suffered a shock defeat in the 2022 election at the hands of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This brought to an end his uninterrupted run of electoral successes since 1998.\n\nBeggs Jr had been a force to be reckoned with in the political landscape, having won the popular vote in two separate elections, and had been a key player in the Unionist cause for decades. However, his failure to secure re-election in 2022 has left many wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nDespite starting strong with a 16.1% share of the vote in 1998, Beggs Jr's popularity dwindled over time, with just 10.2% of the vote in 2007. While he had always been a prominent figure in Unionist politics, it seems that his appeal may have waned in recent years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a notoriously volatile arena, with the political landscape shifting rapidly over time. Beggs Jr may have fallen foul of this instability, finding himself out of step with the changing attitudes of the electorate.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply a case of the Alliance Party capitalizing on a moment of weakness, seizing the opportunity to make their mark on the political landscape. Whatever the case, Beggs Jr's defeat is a timely reminder that no one can take electoral success for granted.\n\nIn the cutthroat world of politics, it's important to remain vigilant and adaptable, constantly reassessing one's position and staying on top of the latest trends and developments. Beggs Jr's defeat may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it serves as a valuable lesson for politicians everywhere.\n\nAs for the Alliance Party, they can take heart in their triumph, but they must not rest on their laurels. The political landscape is ever-changing, and they will need to remain vigilant if they hope to maintain their newfound dominance. One thing is certain, the Northern Ireland Assembly will remain a hotly contested arena for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/05/16/news/uup-stalwart-roy-beggs-will-see-what-direction-i-want-to-take-after-losing-assembly-seat-2711710/", "page_content": "UUP stalwart Roy Beggs has told of how he will \"see what direction I want to take\" as he reflected on losing the Assembly seat he had held for 24 years.\n\nMr Beggs, a former Stormont deputy speaker, also said he believes he \"didn't sell myself on social media\" ahead of last week's election.\n\n\"I was too involved in the Assembly, I didn't sell myself on social media, candidates selling themselves on social media were the ones who were most successful, in many cases over-selling themselves,\" he told the Sunday World.\n\n\"I'm more modest, I've never believed in over-egging myself.\"\n\nFor the first time since East Antrim was created as a constituency in 1983, there is nobody from the Beggs family representing the area at either Stormont or Westminster.\n\nMr Beggs father, also called Roy, was the first MP when electoral boundaries were redrawn to form the constituency area in the early 1980s.\n\nIn the Assembly election, Mr Beggs - his party's longest serving MLA having held the seat since 1998 - polled only 3,549 first preference votes.\n\n\"Of course there is disappointment, but you have to accept the will of the people,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a new experience for me, I have been successful a number of times over my 24 year career, but it was clear from the early tallying something different was happening.\"\n\nHe described how as it emerged he was not going to be re-elected, he left the count centre and started taking his election posters.\n\n\"I had a coffee and then started to take my election posters down,\" he said.\n\n\"I've always done that, straight away, so even on Friday (count day) and then on Saturday, I was taking my posters down.
