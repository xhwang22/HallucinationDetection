Donaldson; Reporting by Christopher Frear\n\nRepresentative Joseph Hayne Rainey rose from his intricately carved wooden desk, ready to deliver one of the most important speeches of his life. The campaign for a new civil rights bill had stalled in the Senate, and Rainey could sense support in the House slipping away. White members of Congress had no experience living in fear of the Ku Klux Klan or being demeaned every day in ways both large and small. Rainey knew these indignities firsthand. On a boat ride from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., the main dining hall had refused to serve him. In a D.C. pub, Rainey had ordered a glass of beer, only to find he\u2019d been charged far more than white patrons. A hotel clerk had pulled the representative by his collar and kicked him out of a whites-only dining room.\n\nAfrican American leaders back home in South Carolina had sent a resolution urging him to fight for the bill, which would guarantee equal treatment of all Americans, regardless of race. Now, Rainey challenged his colleagues. \u201cWhy is it that colored members of Congress cannot enjoy the same immunities that are accorded to white members?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy cannot we stop at hotels here without meeting objection? Why cannot we go to restaurants without being insulted? We are here enacting laws of a country and casting votes upon important questions; we have been sent here by the suffrages of the people, and why cannot we enjoy the same benefits that are accorded to our white colleagues on this floor?\u201d\n\nThe year was 1873.\n\nA century and a half later, Americans are only beginning to acknowledge Rainey\u2019s contributions. He was the first African American to be seated in the United States House of Representatives and the first member of Congress born into enslavement. He was an architect of a crucial period in U.S. history, the era known as Reconstruction. Yet few are aware that Rainey and 15 other African Americans served in Congress during the decade just after the Civil War\u2014or that there was a protracted battle over a civil rights act in the 19th century.\n\nThis obscurity is no accident. Rainey\u2019s hopes were thwarted when white supremacists used violence and illegal tactics to force him and his colleagues out of office. Armed vigilante groups marauded throughout the South, openly threatening voters and even carrying out political assassinations. Southern Democrats\u2014identifying themselves as \u201cthe white man\u2019s party\u201d\u2014committed wide-scale voter fraud.\n\nAfter African American politicians were stripped of their positions, their contributions were deliberately hidden from view. Popular histories and textbooks reported that Southern Republicans, known by opponents as \u201cscalawags,\u201d had joined forces with Northern \u201ccarpetbaggers\u201d and allowed formerly enslaved people to have voting power they were unprepared to exercise. According to that story\u2014taught for generations in schools North and South\u2014the experiment of giving African Americans the vote had been a dismal failure, marked by incompetence and corruption.\n\nRainey has slowly regained some recognition. His family house in Georgetown, South Carolina, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and a park in the city was named in his honor. James E. Clyburn, a representative who currently represents part of Rainey\u2019s district, lobbied the House to commission a new portrait of Rainey, which was unveiled in 2005 on the second floor of the Capitol. The portrait is now part of a newly launched exhibition at the Capitol, commemorating the 150th anniversary of Rainey\u2019s December 1870 swearing in. The exhibition, which will remain on the walls for about three years, ends with a portrait of Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman elected to Congress, in 1968. (The exhibit was not damaged in the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.)\n\nThe revival of Rainey\u2019s legacy benefits greatly from the digitization of an array of primary records. These sources directly contradict earlier, disparaging histories. They offer new insight into how a man born enslaved rose to be a respected national politician and how his career came to an abrupt and tragic end.\n\n* * *\n\nRainey was born in Georgetown, South Carolina, on June 21, 1832, in an enslaved family. Only fragments of information remain from his early life, beyond the fact that his father, Edward L. Rainey, worked as a barber. In South Carolina, some enslaved people were allowed to practice a trade and even keep a small share of the income. Edward was able to cobble together enough money to buy, first, his own freedom, and then his family\u2019s.\n\nRainey became a barber, like his father, and before the Civil War, he\u2019d established his own business\u2014Rainey\u2019s Hair Cutting Salon\u2014at the Mills Hotel in Charleston, a block from city hall. In prewar Charleston, Joseph Rainey occupied a relatively privileged yet precarious position. He was one of about 3,400 free people of color among 20,000 white and 43,000 enslaved people in the city. Their liberties were limited by law. Every free man over the age of 15 was required to have a white \u201cguardian\u201d to enable him to live in the city, and any \u201cinsolence\u201d left the African American man open to violent assault. Free people of color had to pay an annual tax; if they failed to pay it, they could be sold into slavery for one year. Wherever they went, free people of color were assumed to be enslaved and had to show documents to prove they were not.\n\nIn September 1859, Rainey traveled to Philadelphia to marry Susan Elizabeth Cooper, the daughter of a free black family from Charleston. When the couple returned to South Carolina, Joseph faced legal trouble for having traveled to a free state. By state law, free people of color who traveled out of state were \u201cforever prohibited from returning.\u201d According to one biographical pamphlet, influential friends, perhaps white clients of his barbershop, interceded for him.\n\nThe state was already rife with tension about the future of slavery when Abraham Lincoln won the presidential election of 1860. In response, the South Carolina legislature voted to hold a special election for a state convention, and on December 20 the delegates\u2014mostly secession-minded planters\u2014voted unanimously to secede from the United States. Delegates marched through the streets of Charleston handing out placards declaring: \u201cThe Union Is Dissolved.\u201d\n\nOn April 12, 1861, the newly formed Confederate Army opened fire on Fort Sumter, a Union outpost in Charleston Harbor\u2014the beginning of the Civil War. Rainey was conscripted into service for the Confederacy. An early account suggests that he worked as a waiter or steward on a blockade-running steamer, making eight or more trips to and from Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nAccording to an oral tradition passed down through the Rainey family, Joseph made an audacious move in 1862. Taking advantage of the fact that \u201cforeign\u201d vessels were still permitted to trade in South Carolina, Joseph boarded a trade ship to Nova Scotia, then to St. George\u2019s, Bermuda. Susan followed later on the same route. As the story goes, Joseph used to go to the docks when ships arrived to watch for her.\n\nDuring the Civil War years, Bermuda, a British colony, was thriving. Slavery had ended there in 1834, and the Union\u2019s wartime trade prohibitions against the South had made Bermuda a go-between for Southern plantations exporting cotton and the Confederate military importing weapons.\n\nIn St. George\u2019s, Rainey worked as a barber. After an 1865 outbreak of smallpox closed the port in St. George\u2019s, where the Raineys were living, the couple relocated to the capital city, Hamilton. Joseph continued barbering, and Susan started a successful dressmaking business linked to a New York City designer.\n\nOne account based on Bermuda records suggests that Joseph received informal tutelage there from a highly educated customer at his barber shop. His personal journal shows a growing command of conventional spelling during this time. Bermuda is also mostly likely where he read the great works of literature, from Plato to Shakespearean tragedies, that he would later quote on the House floor.\n\nIn Bermuda, Rainey also joined a fraternal club and was involved in approving resolutions of condolence on Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1865 assassination, sending them on behalf of the Bermuda lodge to the U.S. consulate and to African American newspapers in New York City.\n\nIn September 1866, the Raineys took out a newspaper advertisement in the Bermuda Colonist: \u201cMr. and Mrs. J.H. Rainey take this method of expressing their thanks to the inhabitants of St. George\u2019s for the patronage bestowed upon them in their respective branches of business.\u201d The war was over, and Rainey\u2014armed with new wealth, new knowledge and new social status\u2014was ready to return to South Carolina, a state that needed him.\n\n* * *\n\nBefore the Civil War, fewer than 10,000 free people of color lived in South Carolina. When Rainey returned in 1866, 400,000 newly freed people had increased the African American population to a majority of nearly 60 percent. Yet President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, had subverted Congress and encouraged Southern white Democrats to rebuild their prewar governments. A bitter critic of civil rights legislation, Johnson declared, \u201cThis is a country for white men....As long as I am president it shall be a government by white men.\u201d\n\nIn South Carolina, the ex-Confederates had followed Johnson\u2019s lead and enacted Black Codes designed to \u201cestablish and regulate the Domestic Relations of Persons of Colour.\u201d One of these codes declared: \u201cAll persons of color who make contracts for service or labor, shall be known as servants, and those with whom they contract, shall be known as masters.\u201d\n\nAnother made allowances for \u201csuitable corporal punishment\u201d against servants. People of color were forbidden from working as artisans, shopkeepers, mechanics or in any other trade apart from husbandry unless they secured a license from the district court. Such licenses, if given at all, expired after one year.\n\nRainey\u2019s brother, Edward, had taken a leading role in protesting these codes and the unreconstructed state government. In November 1865, Edward had served as a delegate to the state Colored People\u2019s Convention, which declared, \u201cWe simply desire that we shall be recognized as men; that we have no obstructions placed in our way; that the same laws which govern white men shall direct colored men; that we have the right of trial by a jury of our peers, that schools be opened or established for our children; that we be permitted to acquire homesteads for ourselves and children; that we be dealt with as others, in equity and justice.\u201d\n\nThroughout the South, newly free people mobilized to make sure their freedom would be recognized and their rights would be lasting. Days after Congress passed the first Reconstruction Act, in March 1867, African American residents of Charleston staged sit-ins and streetcar boycotts, establishing a form of civil disobedience and nonviolent protest that activists would repeat a century later.\n\nThere were enough Republicans in the U.S. Congress to overcome Johnson\u2019s veto and pass four Reconstruction Acts. One ordered former Confederate states to draw up new constitutions and have them approved by voters\u2014including people of color. Beginning on January 14, 1868, Joseph Rainey served as a delegate to a statewide constitutional convention. For the first time, African American delegates were in the majority, 76-48. Numerous outsiders\u2014professionals, intellectuals, educators, sympathetic Republican politicians\u2014moved to the state to take part in the Reconstruction experiment. The number included some speculators and opportunists, as Rainey later observed.\n\nFor his part, Rainey was politically pragmatic about change. He backed creating a public school system and was willing to vote for an election poll tax to fund it. He also contended that freed people should purchase land confiscated from plantation owners. He was among the minority of delegates at the convention who believed that voters should be obligated to pay a poll tax, for educational purposes, and that those who did not meet property qualifications should have \u201cno right to vote.\u201d\n\nAfter the convention, in April 1868, Rainey was elected to the South Carolina State Senate where he served as chairman of the Finance Committee. In July, he cast his vote in the General Assembly to ratify the 14th Amendment, which gave full citizenship to all people born in America, including the formerly enslaved. Under this new constitutional amendment, African Americans now had \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d\n\nThe reaction came swiftly. Ex-Confederates and sympathizers formed terrorist groups, igniting violence across the South. On October 16, 1868, just months after the majority-black assembly took office, Rainey\u2019s African American colleague, state Senator Benjamin F. Randolph, was changing trains in Hodges, South Carolina, when three white men shot him to death on the railway platform. The assassins jumped on horses and rode away. Though the murder had taken place in broad daylight with several witnesses, law enforcement never identified any suspect. Democratic newspapers had disparagingly described Randolph as \u201ca persistent advocate of the social equality idea.\u201d His death was seen as a warning to Rainey and all those who advocated for the rights of the formerly enslaved\n\n* * *\n\nIn late 1870, the Rev. B. F. Whittemore of South Carolina left his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, creating a vacancy. Whittemore, a white New Englander who had served in the Union Army before moving to South Carolina, had been censured by the House for selling an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, and he resigned from the House rather than be expelled. The Republican Party nominated Rainey to serve in Whittemore\u2019s place for the last months of the 41st Congress. Then, in November, he also won the election to serve in the 42nd Congress. He was 38 years old.\n\nOn Monday, December 12, 1870, Joseph Hayne Rainey approached the rostrum, escorted by Representative Henry Dawes. \u201cMr. Rainey, the first colored member in the House of Representatives, came forward and was sworn in,\u201d the Washington Evening Star reported, after which he walked to his seat in the southwest corner, on the Republican side of the hall.\n\nOthers viewed Rainey with curiosity, seemingly obsessed by his appearance. In a January 1871 article, the Chicago Daily Tribune noted, \u201cHis long bushy side whiskers are precisely like a white man\u2019s. His physical organization seems to be sufficiently strong to bear all the strain his mental construction will give. His forehead is middling broad and high and the ennobling organization of the mind is well developed. He has an excellent memory, and his perceptive powers are good. His polite and dignified bearing enforces respect.\u201d The writer went on to qualify this praise: \u201cOf course Mr. Rainey will not compare with the best men of the House of Representatives, but he is a good average congressman, and stands head and shoulders above the ordinary carpet bagger.\u201d Other commentators were more blatantly racist. The Cincinnati Daily Enquirer asked, \u201cIs it possible to get further down in National degeneracy and disgrace?\u201d\n\nAmong the resounding voices of support, though, was that of Frederick Douglass\u2019 New National Era, which rejoiced that \u201cdespised Africa is now represented in no less a place than the American Congress.\u201d\n\nWhen the 42nd Congress began in March, two free men of color\u2014Robert De Large and Robert Brown Elliott\u2014joined Rainey as part of the South Carolina delegation. Two other former slaves\u2014Benjamin Turner of Alabama and Jefferson Long of Georgia\u2014had joined Congress shortly after Rainey (though Long served less than two months). In the U.S. Senate, Hiram Revels, a freeborn man of color, had taken office in 1870.\n\nTogether, these men grappled with the waves of white supremacist violence roiling the South. They championed provisions of the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, which called for federal forces to intervene against Klan activity and for federal district attorneys to prosecute the terrorists. Some members of Congress challenged the constitutionality of the act. Rainey took the floor. \u201cTell me nothing of a constitution which fails to shelter beneath its rightful power the people of a country!\u201d he declared. The bill was approved and signed by President Grant.\n\nRainey and other Republican leaders soon received copies of an ominous letter written in red ink. \u201cHere, the climate is too hot for you....We warn you to flee. Each and every one of you are watched each hour.\u201d\n\nStill, the coalition of African American representatives continued to grow. Its members debated issues that would determine the future of democracy. In 1872, for instance, Rainey fired back at a white colleague who feared that integrated schools might lead to full social equality between the races. Rainey disputed the way his colleague had depicted the African American: \u201cNow, since he is no longer a slave, one would suppose him a leper, to hear the objections expressed against his equality before the law. Sir, this is the remnant of the old pro-slavery spirit, which must eventually give place to more humane and elevating ideas. Schools have been mixed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other States, and no detriment has occurred. Why this fear of competition with a negro? All they ask for is an equal chance in life, with equal advantages, and they will prove themselves to be worthy American citizens.\u201d\n\nIn 1874, Rainey spoke out on behalf of other oppressed minorities, opposing a bill to ban Chinese workers from taking part in a federally funded construction project in San Francisco. \u201cThey come here and are willing to work and assist in the development of the country,\u201d he declared. \u201cI say that the Chinaman, the Indian, the negro, and the white man should all occupy an equal footing under this Government; should be accorded equal right to make their livelihood and establish their manhood.\u201d\n\nOn April 29 of that year, Rainey broke new ground. The entire House had gathered as a body to debate the Indian Affairs Bill over several days, and the Speaker of the House invited a sequence of representatives to serve as speaker pro tempore. Luke Potter Poland, a Republican from Vermont, was presiding when he invited Rainey to take the chair. It was the first time an African American had ever presided over the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nNewspapers spread the word, with headlines such as \u201cAfrica in the Chair.\u201d The Vermont Journal declared, \u201cSurely the world moves, for who would have dreamed it, 20 years ago?\u201d The Springfield Republican noted that just a generation earlier, \u201cmen of Mr. Rainey\u2019s race were sold under the hammer within bowshot of the capitol.\u201d The New National Era noted the event with a jab at racist alarmism: \u201cFor the first time in the nation\u2019s history a colored man, in the person of Hon. Joseph H. Rainey, of South Carolina, on Thursday last presided over the deliberations of the House of Representatives....The earth continues to revolve on its axis.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nRainey and his colleagues had Northern allies in the Republican Party. One of the most influential, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, had been an outspoken abolitionist. In 1870, he drafted a civil rights bill with the help of John Mercer Langston, an attorney who founded the law school at Howard University, the first to serve African American students. The bill would have banned discrimination in schools, churches and places of public access such as hotels and trains. Representative Benjamin Butler, also of Massachusetts, sponsored the bill in the House. As a lawyer and Union general, Butler had pioneered the strategy of treating enslaved people who escaped to Union Army camps as war contraband, which created a groundswell toward Lincoln\u2019s emancipation policy.\n\nSumner and Rainey had become friends, and as Sumner approached death in 1874, he pleaded with Rainey, \u201cDo not let the civil-rights bill fail!\u201d Sumner died in March of that year without achieving his fervent goal.\n\nA month later, Rainey\u2014who had accompanied the Sumner family to Boston for the burial\u2014gave a stirring speech before Congress, remembering a time when Sumner had nearly lost his life after South Carolina Congressman Preston S. Brooks assaulted him in the Senate chamber. \u201cThe unexpressed sympathy that was felt for him among the slaves of the South, when they heard of this unwarranted attack, was only known to those whose situations at the time made them confidants,\u201d Rainey recalled. \u201cTheir prayers and secret importunities were ever uttered in the interest of him who was their constant friend and untiring advocate and defender before the high court of the nation.\u201d\n\nBy that time, Rainey had earned a reputation for forcefully protecting the fledgling democracy in the South. Yet he was concerned enough about violent retaliation that he bought a second home, in Windsor, Connecticut, and his wife and children moved there in the summer of 1874. Even so, in a February 1875 speech Rainey made it clear that black politicians were not going anywhere. \u201cWe do not intend to be driven to the frontier as you have driven the Indian,\u201d said Rainey, who was also a member of the House Indian Affairs Act Committee and a champion of Indian rights. \u201cOur purpose is to remain in your midst as an integral part of the body-politic.\u201d\n\nAfter Democrats gained control of the House in the 1874 election, Republican sponsors rushed to pass the civil rights bill. To gain votes, they removed the integration of schools and churches, the places that drew the fiercest opposition. Personal testimonies from African American members of Congress, and sympathy for the departed Sumner, helped give it traction, and, on March 1, 1875, President Grant signed the Civil Rights Act.\n\nIt was the final Reconstruction act. Disgruntled Southern Democrats were already making plans to reverse the progress.\n\n* * *\n\nHamburg, South Carolina, lies along the Savannah River across from Augusta, Georgia. By 1876, newly freed African Americans had revitalized the declining town, making it a haven of business and property ownership, and electoral freedom. A town militia protected Hamburg from ex-Confederate vigilante raids. On July 4 of that year, 16 months after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, white travelers provoked a confrontation by attempting to drive a carriage through the African American militia\u2019s Independence Day parade on Main Street. After trying to force the militia to disband and surrender its weapons in court, one of the white travelers returned on the day of the hearing with more than 200 men and a cannon. The vigilantes surrounded the militia in a warehouse, shot men as they tried to escape, captured the rest and tortured and executed six. Not one person was ever prosecuted for the murders.\n\nIn Congress, Joseph Rainey said the assassination of Hamburg leaders was a \u201ccold-blooded atrocity.\u201d He implored his fellow members, \u201cIn the name of my race and my people, in the name of humanity, in the name of God, I ask you whether we are to be American citizens with all the rights and immunities of citizens or whether we are to be vassals and slaves again? I ask you to tell us whether these things are to go on.\u201d\n\nInstead, the massacre inspired a wave of open terror against African Americans across the state. In the 1876 gubernatorial race, Wade Hampton III\u2014who had succeeded Jeb Stuart as a Confederate cavalry commander\u2014reportedly won the election. But the tally made no mathematical sense. Of 184,000 eligible male voters, more than 110,000 were African American. Hampton had allegedly tallied more than 92,000 votes, which would have required 18,000 African Americans to choose a Confederate leader who had enslaved hundreds of people in South Carolina and Mississippi. A single county, Edgefield, reported 2,000 more votes than it had eligible voters.\n\nThe federal government did nothing in response to this flagrant abuse of the polls. In fact, its inaction was part of a secret deal. In the 1876 presidential election, the electoral college tally came down to three states in which both parties accused each other of fraud: South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. In January 1877, just two months before the new president was supposed to take office, there was still no clear winner. The two parties made a compromise in private. The Democrats would allow Rutherford B. Hayes, the Ohio Republican, to become the next president of the United States. In return, his administration would allow white Democratic \u201credeemers\u201d to reclaim their states from African Americans, however they saw fit. In essence, Northern Republicans agreed to take the presidency in exchange for withdrawing federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction.\n\nAs Rainey campaigned for re-election in 1878, he met with President Hayes. He was joined by Stephen Swails, a freeborn African American from the North who had served as an officer in the Civil War. Together, Rainey and Swails pleaded with the president to ensure fair elections. In keeping with the \u201ccompromise,\u201d the president declined. When votes came in, the official count showed that John Smythe Richardson, a former Confederate officer and a Democrat, had somehow won 62 percent of the vote for Rainey\u2019s seat\u2014in a strong Republican district where African Americans were the majority of residents.\n\nYears later, Southern Democratic leaders boasted about all kinds of illegal acts during the elections of the 1870s, from folding more than one \u201ctissue ballot\u201d inside regular paper ballots to bringing Georgians across state lines to vote in South Carolina. In his successful 1890 campaign for governor, Benjamin \u201cPitchfork\u201d Tillman, leader of the Red Shirts at Hamburg, brazenly referred to the massacre. \u201cThe leading white men of Edgefield\u201d had wanted to \u201cseize the first opportunity that the Negro might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the Negroes a lesson.\u201d He added, \u201cAs white men we are not sorry for it, and we do not propose to apologize for anything we have done in connection with it. We took the government away from them in 1876. We did take it.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nOn March 3, 1879, Rainey gave his final remarks to the U.S. House of Representatives. \u201cI was legally elected,\u201d he declared, \u201cbut was defrauded and tissued out of my seat.\u201d He asked his colleagues, \u201cMust the will of the majority to rule, the very foundation and cornerstone of this Republic, be supplanted, suppressed, or crushed by armed mobs of one party destroying the ballots of the other by violence and fraud?\u201d As he prepared to leave office, Rainey told Congress he hoped \u201can impartial historian\u201d would tell the truth about his era.\n\nTwo months later in Nashville, Tennessee, Rainey addressed the National Conference of Colored Men with grim realism. \u201cWe may never hold another conference,\u201d he told them. \u201cThe same faces will never be mirrored against these walls.\u201d He warned, \u201cWe are a proscribed people....We have stood a great deal....We want to say to the white people the time has come for us to give warning that we have stood all we can....We have been enriching the white man, and the time has come when forbearance has ceased to be a virtue....We have stood too much now, and I would not blame any colored man who would advise his people to flee from the oppressors to the land of freedom.\u201d Decades ahead of the Great Migration of the World War I era, the conference established a committee to explore conditions for a mass exodus to the western and northern United States.\n\nThe new America that Rainey had hoped to help create was a fading dream. In 1883, in an 8-1 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that key sections of the Civil Rights Act were unconstitutional. The majority opinion declared the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause only prohibited discrimination by state and local government, not by private individuals and organizations. Furthermore, the court ruled, the 13th Amendment had ended slavery but did not make any guarantees against racial discrimination.\n\nWith diminishing resources and in poor health, Rainey returned to Georgetown, South Carolina, where his wife opened a millinery shop. At the age of 55, he contracted malaria and died less than a year later, in August 1887. The Washington Evening Star described him as \u201cone of the most intelligent representatives of the colored race in the South.\u201d\n\nMonths later, a Georgia newspaper noted that Reconstruction politicians were \u201cglimmering into obscurity.\u201d The reporter ignored all the violence and fraud, claiming that the African American had \u201cdismissed politics from his mind and gone to making money....He is too busy to vote.\u201d\n\nWith black voters stripped of power, white politicians gathered to discuss the \u201cNegro question.\u201d At these meetings, there was little consideration of the African Americans who had held office during Reconstruction or the millions of new citizens they had represented. The whole era\u2014from 1868 to 1876\u2014was recast as an effort that had failed because black voters weren\u2019t capable of making good decisions.\n\nIn 1890, Hayes, no longer president, spoke to an all-white gathering at Lake Mohonk, New York, and gave voice to a malignant belief that was all too common: \u201cOne of the devoted friends of the colored people tells us that \u2018their ignorance, indifference, indolence, shiftlessness, superstition and low tone of morality are prodigious hindrances to the development of the great low country where they swarm.\u2019 It is, perhaps, safe to conclude that half of the colored population of the South still lack the thrift, the education, the morality, and the religion required to make a prosperous and intelligent citizenship.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nProminent academics would amplify and even justify this derogatory depiction of 19th-century African American voters and politicians. William Archibald Dunning, a historian and political scientist at Columbia University, worked with graduate students to write state-by-state histories of Reconstruction. Writing in the Atlantic Monthly, Dunning denigrated the era\u2019s African American politicians as \u201cvery frequently of a type which acquired and practiced the tricks and knavery rather than the useful art of politics, and the vicious courses of these negroes strongly confirmed the prejudices of the whites.\u201d\n\nJohn Schreiner Reynolds, who had been influenced by Dunning, lambasted African American leaders in his 1905 book Reconstruction in South Carolina. He called one of those leaders \u201ca vicious and mouthy negro\u201d who \u201clost no opportunity to inflame the negros against the whites.\u201d As Reynolds told it, the Red Shirt violence at Hamburg was \u201cthe culmination of troubles which had long been brewing in and around the negro-ridden town.\u201d The actual lives and contributions of African American politicians were entirely missing from establishment histories.\n\nAt the American Historical Association meeting in 1909, W.E.B. Du Bois tried to correct this with a presentation called \u201cReconstruction and Its Benefits.\u201d \u201cThere is danger today,\u201d Du Bois warned, \u201cthat between the intense feeling of the South and the conciliatory spirit of the North grave injustice will be done the negro American in the history of Reconstruction.\u201d\n\nBut the determined effort to recast Reconstruction as a debacle of corruption continued. In 1915, Woodrow Wilson showed Birth of a Nation at the White House. The revisionist film grossly demeaned Reconstruction and inspired the revival of the Ku Klux Klan as a nationwide terrorism organization.\n\nDu Bois made another attempt to set the record straight in his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America: A History of the Part Which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860\u20131880. In that bold work, he explicitly described the contributions black leaders had made to American politics. \u201cRainey of South Carolina was one of the first Americans to demand national aid for education,\u201d he noted.\n\nIn 1940, not long after Gone With the Wind premiered in theaters, South Carolina erected a statue of Tillman, the former governor, U.S. senator and violent Red Shirt leader, near the entry to the South Carolina statehouse. The goal: remind South Carolina that Tillman had believed \u201cin the inevitable triumph of white democracy.\u201d At the dedication, the keynote speaker was Senator James Byrnes, soon to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. Supporters of the statue praised Tillman for redeeming the state. To raise money for the statue, they\u2019d written, \u201cHe participated in the Hamburg and Ellenton Riots of 1876, and aided in the Democratic triumph of that year by frightening prospective Negro voters away from the polls.\u201d\n\nBut Rainey and his contemporaries hadn\u2019t been erased completely. In 1946, the Southern Negro Youth Congress, a decade-old political organization, gathered in the state capital Columbia. To prepare for W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019 keynote speech, the young organizers decorated the hall\u2019s upper level with six-foot-tall portraits of African American representatives from that era. Joseph Rainey was among them.\n\n* * *\n\nRainey\u2019s children and grandchildren continued his work, serving in leadership roles within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was founded in 1909. Joseph\u2019s daughter, Olive, used to lift young Lorna Rainey onto her lap and tell stories about the congressman. \u201cMaybe my great-aunt knew that this would always be a story that\u2019s always timely,\u201d Lorna recalls today. \u201cThis is not a black story or a white story. This is a story of inspiration, of courage, of forward thinking.\u201d\n\nLorna, a talent agent based in New York, is now working on a documentary film about Rainey, drawing on new scholarship as well as the wealth of knowledge his family has handed down about him. The film, called Slave in the House, will celebrate Rainey\u2019s personal acts of bravery as well as his political legacy. \u201cHe was a courageous man,\u201d Lorna says, describing how Rainey once refused to leave a hotel dining room that wouldn\u2019t serve him until escorts pushed him down the stairs. \u201cHe deliberately put his physical self in harm\u2019s way in order to prove a point, and he knew that regardless of what he said\u2014\u2018Oh, I\u2019m a congressman\u2019\u2014that wasn\u2019t going to help him. They didn\u2019t see \u2018congressman.\u2019 They saw color. So he didn\u2019t mind if he was threatened by the KKK, or the Red Shirts. They couldn\u2019t stop him from trying to exercise his position to try to help other people.\u201d\n\nUnlike Lorna, Representative Clyburn learned little about Rainey\u2019s life and career while he was growing up. \u201cNo one really talked about Rainey,\u201d says Clyburn, who was born in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1940. He began learning more about Rainey once he was elected to Congress, in 1992, representing part of Rainey\u2019s former district. Since then, he has become a vocal advocate for remembering Rainey and the whole generation of black Reconstruction politicians. \u201cIf people knew this history,\u201d Clyburn says, \u201cthey would have a better understanding of some of the political challenges we face today.\u201d\n\nClyburn\u2019s career has followed a different trajectory from Rainey\u2019s. He is serving his 14th term in Congress, where he is the third-highest ranking Democrat. (Through 20th-century black activism, the Democratic Party, which once barred black members throughout the South, became the party of civil rights under President Lyndon Johnson.) From 1999 to 2001, Clyburn chaired the Congressional Black Caucus, founded in 1971.\n\nBut while Rainey\u2019s own career was obstructed by white supremacists, and ultimately cut short, Clyburn believes that Rainey\u2019s story is ultimately one of victory. \u201cPeople who paved the road often get punished,\u201d Clyburn says. \u201cI really believe he smashed through and there emerged a deliberate attempt not to give him the recognition he was due. The people who are first sometimes pay a real big price.\u201d\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

Uncertainty hangs over the speakership election, as Kevin McCarthy attempts to quell a conservative revolt that could derail his long-held hopes of claiming the speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\nDemocrats meanwhile will begin the next Congress with a fresh slate of leaders, after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and her deputies stepped aside to pave the way for a new generation. Now, in a historical first, the triumvirate of top House Democrats includes no white men.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the highest-ranking members of the Republican and Democratic leadership for the 118th Congress.\n\nThe Republicans\n\nKevin McCarthy. Photograph: Michael McCoy/Reuters\n\nCongressman Kevin McCarthy of California, Republican nominee for speaker of the House\n\nMcCarthy, 57, has been plotting his path to the speakership for the better part of a decade. Whether he will finally win the top job remains unclear.\n\nElected to Congress in 2006, McCarthy was part of a triumvirate of self-styled Republican \u201cYoung Guns\u201d (along with Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan, neither of whom is currently in Congress) who rode the Tea Party wave to power. Republicans\u2019 romping success in the 2010 midterms catapulted McCarthy into one of the top leadership positions, House majority whip.\n\nHe was considered next in line for the speakership in 2015, but his bid imploded. McCarthy was eventually elected minority leader in 2018, after Democrats won the House.\n\nOnce considered a relative moderate, the California congressman has steadily moved to the right. He embraced Donald Trump early and remains one of his staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill. When Trump was defeated in 2020, McCarthy amplified his election lies. After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, McCarthy condemned Trump\u2019s actions but quickly retreated and made amends.\n\nNow McCarthy is in the fight of his political life as he again seeks the speakership. He won the party\u2019s internal leadership elections, dispatching a challenge from the far right. But the real test will come on the House floor, where he will need the support of nearly every member of his caucus to become speaker.\n\nSteve Scalise. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCongressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana, majority leader\n\nScalise, 57, is a Louisiana native who was elected to the No 2 spot by voice vote, a sign of his broad support in the House Republican conference. Should McCarthy fall short in his quest to become speaker, Scalise has been mentioned as a potential alternative.\n\nIn 2017, Scalise was critically wounded when a gunman opened fire during a congressional baseball practice. He spent weeks in the hospital and required intensive rehabilitation. A staunch defender of the second amendment, Scalise said the experience only reinforced his support for gun rights.\n\nA special election in 2008 brought Scalise to Washington, where he rose quickly through the Republican ranks. In 2012, he was elected chairman of the influential Republican study group, beating a candidate who had been handpicked by the group\u2019s founders. After that surprise victory, Scalise told reporters on Capitol Hill that his goal was to pull Republican leadership \u201cas far to the right\u201d as possible.\n\nTom Emmer. Photograph: US House of Representatives /Reuters\n\nCongressman Tom Emmer of Minnesota, majority whip\n\nIn 2020, as Democrats celebrated Joe Biden\u2019s victory, Republicans made an unexpectedly strong showing in the House. Emmer, in his role as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, was widely praised for his party\u2019s performance.\n\nJust two years later, Emmer, in the same role, faced blowback after Republicans only narrowly won the House, making far fewer gains than anticipated. In the wake of the disappointing results, he faced stiff competition in his bid to become the majority whip though he ultimately prevailed on the second ballot.\n\nEmmer, 61, a former attorney and the father of seven, began his career in the Minnesota legislature. He narrowly lost a bid to become governor of Minnesota in one of the closest elections in state history. Four years later, he was first elected to Congress, winning the seat vacated by the conservative firebrand Michele Bachmann.\n\nElise Stefanik. Photograph: Government Printing Office/Reuters\n\nCongresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York, Republican conference chair\n\nFew politicians exemplify Trump\u2019s grip on the Republican party better than the New York Republican.\n\nOnce a mainstream conservative from a moderate district, Stefanik transformed into one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters, embracing his election lies, flirting with the QAnon conspiracy theory and amplifying ads that echoed themes of the racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory.\n\nStefanik claimed the No 3 leadership post last year, after the conference ousted Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming over her vocal criticism of Trump in the wake of the Capitol attack. Despite speculation that Stefanik would run for majority whip if Republicans won the House in the 2022 midterms, she opted instead to keep her position, tasked with amplifying the party\u2019s message.\n\nWhen Trump announced his intention to run again for the White House in 2024, Stefanik was one of only a handful of prominent Republicans to endorse him, a move that rankled those in her party wary of his attempts at a political comeback.\n\nThe Democrats\n\nHakeem Jeffries. Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA\n\nCongressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, minority leader\n\nWith his unanimous election as Democratic leader, Jeffries, 52, becomes the first Black American to helm a major political party in congressional history. He inherits the job from Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats\u2019 long-serving leader. Yet he begins his tenure in the minority, after Democrats lost control of the chamber in the November midterms despite a stronger than expected performance.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born son of public sector workers, Jeffries speaks with pride about growing up in a working-class outer-borough neighborhood. After law school, he worked as a corporate attorney, representing clients such as Viacom and CBS.\n\nHis first foray into politics was unsuccessful. But he was soon elected to the New York state assembly, where he served for six years before running for Congress in 2012. He won the Brooklyn and Queens-based seat, parts of which were once represented by Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress.\n\nHis ascent to Democratic leader was long planned and came with the explicit backing of his predecessor. Now, as the new fresh face of House Democrats, Jeffries has vowed to bring his fractious caucus together with the goal of clawing back control of the chamber in two years. In remarks after his election, he said he hoped to work with Republicans, but would not remain silent if they continued to embrace extremism.\n\nKatherine Clark. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nCongresswoman Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, minority whip\n\nElected by acclamation, Clark will become the highest-ranking woman in House Democratic politics. As the party\u2019s top vote-counter, her main task for the next two years will probably be to keep Democrats aligned in opposition to Republican-backed legislation, rather than whipping them in favor of bills.\n\nClark, 59, began her political career as a member of a local public school committee, before rising through the ranks in the Massachusetts state legislature. She was elected to Congress in 2013, where she has been a vocal advocate for women\u2019s reproductive rights and other policies affecting women and children.\n\nFor years, Clark and Jeffries worked in partnership, cementing their status as heirs apparent for the moment when Pelosi and her deputies stepped down. She is well-liked among the many caucuses and coalitions within her party and her colleagues have praised her as someone who always keeps in touch, a trait that will serve her well as Democratic whip.\n\nPete Aguilar. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA\n\nCongressman Pete Aguilar of California, Democratic caucus chair\n\nWith his rise to the No 3 spot, Aguilar, 43, is now the highest-ranking Latino in Congress and a member of a historic Democratic leadership team that includes no white men for the first time in history.\n\nRaised in a working-class family in San Bernardino, Aguilar served as mayor of Redlands, a city in southern California. He lost his first bid for Congress in 2012, but tried again two years later and won.\n\nSince then, Aguilar has risen steadily in House Democratic politics. He was named to the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol and led the panel\u2019s high-profile third hearing, which focused on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure his vice-president, Mike Pence, to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nKnown among his colleagues as someone who can build alliances across factions and party lines, Aguilar is now responsible for Democratic messaging.\n\nJim Clyburn. Photograph: Meg Kinnard/AP\n\nCongressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, assistant Democratic leader\n\nBefore Jeffries\u2019 elevation, Clyburn was the highest-ranking Black man in Congress. After serving as the Democratic whip alongside Speaker Pelosi and the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, Clyburn, 82, decided to remain in leadership even as they stepped aside, though at a lower rank.\n\nHe briefly faced the possibility of a younger challenger, but was ultimately elected unanimously by the caucus.\n\nBorn in the Jim Crow south, Clyburn was a civil rights activist before entering politics. Elected to Congress in 1992, he quickly became a leading voice within the caucus, gaining prominence as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus before joining the Democratic leadership team. Often operating behind the scenes, Clyburn is known for mediating disputes within his caucus and using his clout to advocate for Black leadership.\n\nHailed as a kingmaker in South Carolina politics, his influence is widely felt. Clyburn helped power Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and is credited with rescuing Biden\u2019s foundering presidential campaign in 2020 when he offered his endorsement ahead of the state\u2019s primary."}]}
