USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-mar-10-me-vagos10-story.html", "page_content": "Times Staff Writers\n\nMore than 750 law enforcement officials conducted sweeps in five counties Thursday, aimed at breaking the back of the Vagos Motorcycle Club, an organization founded in the 1960s that authorities say is tied to dealing drugs and weapons.\n\nTwenty-two people were arrested in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange and Ventura counties, culminating a three-year investigation aimed at curtailing the operations of the Vagos organization.\n\nThe bust comes two years after another long-term investigation resulted in the arrests of 57 leaders from the Vagos\u2019 archrivals, the Hells Angels motorcycle gang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the two biker gangs have their roots in California\u2019s counterculture movement, law enforcement officials say both groups are actually sophisticated criminal enterprises with a large hand in the methamphetamine trade.\n\n\u201cToday is just the beginning,\u201d said Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona. \u201cThe Hells Angels, the Vagos -- they are not clubs. The reality is that they\u2019re supporting [street] terrorism.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the Vagos have long denied having any ties to criminal activity. The Vagos website states that the group was formed as a \u201ctight brotherhood to survive the wars between the rival clubs and the constant harassment of the police.\u201d\n\nThe message goes on to say that \u201cVagos comes from the Spanish language meaning \u2018traveling gypsy\u2019 or \u2018a streetwise person that\u2019s always up to something.\u2019 \u201d The club has about 300 members in California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Mexico.\n\nAuthorities said the Vagos investigation was among the largest coordinated law enforcement probes ever conducted in the region. Those arrested include seven chapter presidents, one vice president, one secretary, one treasurer and seven sergeants-at-arms.\n\nOfficers said they seized 95 illegal firearms; various illegal drugs, including methamphetamine; $6,000 in cash; and two stolen motorcycles.\n\nThe crimes may later be incorporated into a federal racketeering case, officials said.\n\nThe law enforcement operation was dubbed \u201c22-Green\u201d because Vagos gang members wear the number 22 on their vests, representing V, the 22nd letter of the alphabet, and green is the gang\u2019s color.\n\nThe Hells Angels wear red.\n\nThe Hells Angels and Vagos motorcycle gangs have been feuding for years. In 2001, a bloody melee broke out at a Costa Mesa swap meet that authorities later said stemmed from bad blood between Hells Angels and Vagos members. A fight between the Hells Angels and another gang, the Mongols, left three people dead at a Laughlin casino in 2003.\n\nThat year, federal officials arrested Angels leaders across several Western states on suspicion of firearms violations, narcotics trafficking, possession of stolen explosives and organized criminal activity.\n\nAuthorities on Thursday alleged that the Vagos gang also has a long history of involvement in the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine, as well as other controlled substances. They are believed to be responsible for selling drugs in parks in San Bernardino County, officials said.\n\nBecause the Vagos are classified as a criminal street gang, judges can add enhanced penalties if members are convicted.\n\nAmong those whose homes were searched Thursday was Terry Orendorff of Hesperia, the Vagos\u2019 23-year international president. Although he was not arrested, Orendorff and other gang leaders remain subject to future federal racketeering charges, based on the gang\u2019s alleged involvement in a July 2004 killing in Lucerne Valley and an attempted murder in Hesperia, authorities said.\n\nThose arrested included chapter presidents Scott \u201cPsycho\u201d Sikoff of Apple Valley, Vincent Mariano of Victorville, Nels \u201cSwede\u201d Bloom of Romoland, \u201cBig\u201d Roy Compton III of San Jacinto, Lino \u201cUmpire\u201d Garcia of Oxnard, and sergeant at arms Michael \u201cChainsaw\u201d Izykowski of Huntington Beach.\n\nNone of those arrested could be reached for comment Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe expect some of the gang leadership to cooperate with us,\u201d said Thomas Mangan, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\n\u201cThis is the just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nIn the Lucerne Valley homicide, James Gavin, 44, was fatally shot in the upper torso, and another person was injured during a home-invasion robbery.\n\nTwo alleged Vagos members were arrested Thursday on suspicion of murder: Daniel \u201cTwist\u201d Foreman, 28, of Apple Valley, and Vagos vice president Ryan Matteson, 29, of Victorville. They will be charged with murder, attempted murder, street terrorism, residential robbery and first-degree burglary, authorities said.\n\nForeman had previously been arrested on suspicion of the slaying in early 2005 but was released for lack of evidence. Considerably more evidence was uncovered in the latest investigation, said Britt Imes, the San Bernardino County deputy district attorney who will prosecute the case.\n\n\u201cIt was drug-related and retaliation-related, connected to the gang\u2019s perceived disrespect of another Vagos member\u2019s family member,\u201d Imes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been anxious to resolve that murder, and we are finally able to do that.\u201d\n\nTwo other Vagos members, whom Imes declined to identify, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder for their roles in firing multiple gunshots at a vehicle occupied by several people on a Hesperia street.\n\n\u201cWe believe [the shooting] was a retaliation for a high-ranking member\u2019s relative being disrespected,\u201d Imes said.\n\nThe Vagos organization is considered much smaller and less well-known than the Hells Angels, which rose to national prominence after a deadly altercation involving a member at a 1969 concert at Altamont in Northern California featuring the Rolling Stones and Jefferson Airplane.\n\nIn addition to their green outfits, Vagos wear patches with the image of Loki, the Norse god of mischief.\n\nLast week, 10 people associated with the group -- including the leader of the Northern California Vagos -- pleaded guilty to possessing firearms and conspiracy to sell methamphetamine.\n\n*\n\nTimes staff writer Michelle Keller contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.motorcycledigital.com/vagos-motorcycle-club-membership/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club is one of the most notorious and feared biker clubs in the world.

It is believed that the gang was originally formed by a group of Mexican-American teenagers who were looking for a way to express their dissatisfaction with society. The Vagos soon began to engage in a variety of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, robbery, and murder.\n\nThe gang has since grown in size and spread to other parts of the United States.

It is made up of a variety of different members with different backgrounds and beliefs. Some members of the gang may be white, while others may be of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nWhether or not the Vagos are a white gang is a matter of debate. There is no definitive answer to this question. Some people may consider the Vagos to be a white gang because the majority of its members are white, while others may not consider the gang to be white because it includes members of other races and ethnicities.\n\nUltimately, the answer to this question depends on your definition of a white gang. If you consider a white gang to be a gang whose members are all white, then the Vagos are not a white gang. However, if you consider a white gang to be a gang whose members are predominantly white, then the Vagos may be considered a white gang.\n\nWho are the enemies of the Vagos?\n\nThe Vagos are a motorcycle gang that has been around for over 50 years.

Every past national president of the Bandidos MC has been convicted and sent to prison usually for drug offenses. The same thing has happened to the last three national presidents of the Outlaws MC. Numerous Hells Angels MC national and chapter presidents, including the iconic leader, Sonny Barger, are convicted felons. Barger is a three time convicted felon. In June 11, 2007 the Spokane, Washington Hells Angels chapter president was convicted of racketeering acts, including mail fraud and extortion. Two other current and former Angel leaders were convicted along with him. The federal prosecutor was quoted as saying the case \u201cblows up the myth that (the Hells Angels) create\u2014that they just get together to sell T-shirts and ride motorcycles (Johnson, 2007).\u201d In July 2006, the former Sergeant-at-Arms of the San Diego Hells Angels chapter pled guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit and distribute methamphetamine and received a 14-year sentence. A Shasta County, California Hells Angels sergeant at arms, a registered sex offender, was arrested for the murders of two young girls\u201412 & 15\u2014over 20 years ago (Herendeen, 2006). After finishing a 13-month sentence for drug and weapons possession his DNA was run against DNA found at the girls murders and found to match. Members of the Washington Nomads Hell\u2019s Angels, including the chapter president and the former West Coast regional president where charged with racketeering offenses (Bowermaster, 2007). The government alleged that the Washington Hells Angels Nomads are a highly organized criminal organization.\n\nIn October 2006, the national and international Bandidos president was sentenced to a 20 month prison term after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering (McDonald, 2007). The same federal judge one month later sentenced the 65 year-old president of the Bellingham, Washington Bandidos chapter to 4 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to racketeering.\n\nIn 2007, a combined investigations by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies led to the indictments of fifteen members and associates of the Outlaws in Massachusetts and sixteen Outlaw members and associates in Indiana and Michigan (DOJ 1, 2007). The indictments charged the gang members with violent crime in aid of racketeering, illegal drug distribution and gun violations. The indictments charged that Outlaws in Indiana, Massachusetts and Michigan engaged in violent assaults on Hells Angels members resulting in beatings, shootings and fatalities. The Massachusetts task force seized 18 guns, including an AR-15 assault weapon; 116 g of cocaine, and $100,000 in cash. The Outlaws \u201cBlack Region\u201d president that oversees Michigan and Indiana was also arrested along with two former vice presidents.\n\nThe Indiana and Michigan cases were resolved by guilty pleas. Fourteen Outlaws from chapters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Indianapolis, and the Detroit chapters of Eastside, Detroit Westside, Downriver and Bay City pleaded guilty to violent crimes in aid of racketeering, illegal drug distribution and firearms violations. One pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm following three prior felony convictions (DOJ 2, 2009).\n\nIn October 2009, 55 members and associates of the Pagans MC were indicted on 44 counts that included kidnapping, racketeering, robbery, extortion, and conspiracy to commit murder (DOJ 3, 2009). Five Pagan officers, including the national president and vice-president, were among those indicted. The biker gang members were accused of conspiring with a prison guard to murder a Pagan who was cooperating with the authorities. A 20 year friend of the national vice-president, an electrical contractor from Northern Virginia was indicted because he asked for Pagan help in collecting two bad debts worth $30,000. The \u201crespectable\u201d businessman supplied the Pagan enforcers with the names addresses and physical descriptions of the two men who owed him money. Several of those indicted were accused of conspiring to murder an individual requested by the president of the Avengers MC. Trafficking in cocaine and operating an across state gambling operation, selling raffle tickets on a motorcycle, were included in the allegations. The illegal motorcycle raffle was an annual event earning the Mother Chapter [designated national headquarters] $50,000 a year. The robbery and extortion charges arose from a common practice among biker gangs, forcible taking the colors [patch] from rival gangs. As of February 2010, 18 defendants have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges including stockpiling explosives to use in their war with the HAMC [Hells Angels Motorcycle Club], intimidating other clubs, extortion and selling drugs. A Pagan vice president pled guilty to racketeering charges and conceded that the Pagans were, or were at one time, a criminal organization. The treasurer of the Charleston, West Virginia Pagans chapter pleaded guilty to setting up a plot with a prison guard to kill a Pagan in prison because it was believed he was cooperating with the authorities. He was also the second officer to admit that the \u201cclub\u201d was involved in racketeering activities. The electrical contractor who asked for help in collecting bad debts pleaded guilty and received a 38-month prison sentence. He said in court that asking for the Pagans help was \u201cthe worst decision and the biggest mistake of my life (Clevenger, 2010).\u201d\n\nSlightly less than a year later \u201cOperation On The Road Again\u201d by federal agents resulted in the arrests of 17 Pagans and their associates for racketeering, extortion, witness tampering, drug distribution and firearms offenses. Those arrested were members or affiliated with clubs in Long Island, upstate New York and New Jersey. Among the charges were allegations that the Rhode Island Pagans were going to attack the Hells Angels with home made grenades in retaliation for an earlier attack.\n\nIn June 2010, twenty-four members of the Outlaws and four Pagans were indicted by a Virginia federal grand jury for a wide range of criminal activities including attempted murder of rival Hells Angels, kidnapping, assault, robbery, extortion, witness intimidation, narcotics distribution, illegal gambling and weapons violations. The Outlaws national president Jack \u201cMilwaukee Jack\u201d Rosga and six chapter presidents and several vice-presidents, treasurers, and enforcers were arrested. Those arrested came from seven states\u2014Maine, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Included within the allegations is a racial assault on a black male in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Pagan members are included in the indictment because allegedly they joined the Outlaws in an assault against rival gangs.\n\nThe Hells Angles and other well-known biker gangs, are not the only 1% biker gangs engaged in organized criminal activities. On the West Coast in 2006, Operation Green 22 was carried out by 700 law enforcement officers against the Vagos MC. The coordinated effort involved officers from the BATF, and local police and sheriff\u2019s departments. Twenty-five members and associates of the Vagos MC were arrested for charges ranging from murder, attempted murder, weapons and drug violations. Those arrested included seven chapter presidents, one-vice president, one secretary, one treasurer, and seven sergeants-at-arms (Risling, 2006). The Vagos are currently challenging the Hells Angels in Arizona, a state the Angels consider their territory. In the last 2 years there have been shootouts between the two gangs in Mesa, Prescott, Bullhead City and Chino Valley. There is every reason to believe that this conflict will continue.\n\nFour ATF undercover agents infiltrated the Mongols MC over a 4-year period in \u201cOperation Black Rain\u201d in Southern California, resulting in a 2008 indictment. The Federal Racketeering indictment alleges 86 counts of murder, attempted murder, assaults, hate crimes, gun violations and drug trafficking and led to the arrests of 61 Mongols (www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2008/142). Among the allegations are that Mongols killed and assaulted numerous Hells Angels in California. The indictment alleges that senior Mongol members, including the national president traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey to meet with Pagan members to form an alliance to allow for Mongol expansion into the Northeast. Furthermore, according to the indictment the Mongols MC is \u2026 \u201cracist and hostile to the presence of African-Americans in bars or clubs where Mongols are present, or African-Americans in the presence of females associated with Mongols or Mongols members.\u201d As of September 2009, thirty-four Mongols have plead guilty to a variety of crimes all involving the furtherance of a criminal enterprise and knowing that the criminal enterprise, the Mongols MC, and its members and associates would commit racketeering offenses. In effect, admitting that the motorcycle club is a gang.\n\nThe violence between 1% \u201cbrothers\u201d here and overseas goes on unabated. The violence often results from long standing feuds and hatred. The feud and hatred between the Hells Angels and Mongols in 2002 erupted on the floor of Harrah\u2019s Casino in Laughlin, Nevada when hundreds of bikers went after each other with hammers, wrenches, four-cell MAG flashlights, aka death lights; knives and guns. Ball peen hammers are one of the favorite weapons of biker gangs, especially the Hells Angels. Ball peen hammers can inflict terrible injuries but they are legal and can be carried openly. The bloody melee left one Mongol and two Angels dead with numerous injuries. After the police got things under control they found fourteen guns, 107 knives, two hammers, two wrenches, and nine flashlights. The incident was such bad publicity for the casino that Harrah\u2019s sent out a letter to previous guests that everything was under control and it was safe to return. There is nothing but pure hatred between the two gangs who vow to kill each other on sight. Members of the Hells Angels and the Mongols fought in a Las Vegas wedding chapel in December 2008 after both groups showed up at separate weddings. Two members of the Mongols were stabbed and the chapel was trashed.\n\nViolence and hatred between the HAMC and the Outlaws has existed since the late 1960s. A favorite Outlaw patch reads ADIOS\u2014Angels Die in Outlaw States. Two Hells Angels, one a prospect of a Canadian chapter were arraigned and later convicted of shooting five members of the Outlaws at Custer State Park in South Dakota (Walker, 2006). Both gangs were in the area for the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. It was the first violence between 1% biker gangs at the rally since 1990 when a bar brawl between the Outlaws and the Sons of Silence left an Outlaw shot and two Sons of Silence members stabbed.\n\nIn September 2008, the president of the San Francisco Hells Angels, Mark \u201cPapa\u201d Guardado, was shot to death outside a bar in the Mission District of San Francisco. His death was reported to be the result of gang warfare but no one was charged until 2009 when Christopher Ablett a 36 year-old member of the Mongols was indicted on federal and state charges. The July 26, 2009 federal indictment charges Ablett with murder in the aid of racketeering and use of a firearm in a murder. The assassination is just one more murder between the two violent gangs. Mongols and Hells Angels have been murdering each other for decades. Their rivalry and hatred for one another is well known and marked by violence and murder.\n\nAt times biker violence extends to non-bikers, particularly blacks who are often the targets of racist bikers. A member of the Massachusetts Outlaws was convicted of interfering by force with the federally protected rights of a black man in an Ashland, Massachusetts\u2019s restaurant (DOJ 4, 2009). Two outlaws attacked the man and beat him with fists and a ball peen hammer for staring at them."}]}
