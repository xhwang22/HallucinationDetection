It\u2019s common nowadays to see society divided into segments each with a different perspective about the policies undertaken by their governments; it is something which keeps the true essence of democracy alive. There are many instances in the past of governance and society improving because of the positive criticism by some people or group of them. These examples give democracies around the world a chance of improving the quality of governance and hence create a better society.\n\nIn recent years in India, there has been a gradual change in perspective of the people regarding their governments. While some of them are a very good sign of a progressive society, some of them are quite worrying too. There is a common notion among some citizens that if they speak something against the actions of their government, then it\u2019s probably against the nation too.\n\nThis idea which is significant in numbers need to be thoroughly assessed. Chances might be there that some of the criticism may not be on the right note, but many of it if considered by the governments can be helpful in the real-time assessment of the needs and expectations of the people from the government. Unfortunately, there is a decline in these voices nowadays because of the type of mandate which India got in the 2019 election. People who voted for the NDA government think that it's wrong to speak against the government which they elected to power.\n\nPeople should realise that it is not the driving force of praise and overwhelming support which keeps the wheels of a government moving but also the steering force of people\u2019s participation which keep a check on government, and modify it, if the policies fail to meet the expectations of society as a whole. If people\u2019s criticism reaches the government\u2019s ear at an appropriate time and in significant numbers, then a lot of resources of the governmental machinery can be utilised wisely for some other activities which are brought to notice by the people itself.\n\nSome experts believe that praise and support of people are very crucial for maintaining efficient governance as it keeps leaders and bureaucrats motivated to work more to increase the overall output of governmental activities on the ground. This is true in practice too but it should be kept in mind that the power vested in the hands of people in a democracy is not only utilised for blindly praising the government but it should be used as an aid, to advise and correct the government whenever required so that the efficiency and quality of governance is maintained.\n\nsunny@alonehands.com"}, {"url": "https://www.itv.com/news/2021-10-12/11-key-findings-of-hugely-critical-report-into-governments-handling-of-covid", "page_content": "A study has highlighted multiple incompetencies in the way the government and its scientific advisors handled the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe study, by MPs in Parliament's Science and Technology Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee, looked at the government's management of the outbreak from the start of last year.\n\nIt found serious errors and delays at the hands of authorities that cost lives.\n\nHere are the key findings from the damning report:\n\n1. The UK's pandemic planning was outdated\n\nUK was not prepared for the Covid pandemic as plans were too \u201cnarrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model\u201d that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola, the report said.\n\nIt came despite assurances from Matt Hancock on January 23, 2020, that \"the whole of the UK is always well-prepared for these types of outbreaks\".\n\n2. The first lockdown in March 2020 did not come early enough\n\nCovid cases in the UK surged at the beginning of March, but it wasn't until March 23 that Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a lockdown.\n\nThere was a false belief that the public would not accept lockdown, or would only do so for a short period of time, the report said.\n\nThe report said government and scientists took \"gradual and incremental approach\" to introducing measures such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns, but this was \u201cwrong\u201d and led to a higher death toll.\n\nIf social distancing and lockdown was brought in early, it \u201cwould have bought much-needed time\u201d for vaccine research to begin, for Covid treatments to be developed and for a proper test and trace system to be set up, MPs said.\n\nThe MPs said the \u201cdecisions on lockdowns and social distancing during the early weeks of the pandemic \u2013 and the advice that led to them \u2013 rank as one of the most important public health failures the United Kingdom has ever experienced\u201d.\n\nListen to the ITV News podcast - Coronavirus: What you need to know\n\n3. Scientists in the UK did not treat Covid seriously enough in the early months\n\nFormer chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said \u201cgroupthink\u201d by infectious disease experts downplayed the seriousness of Covid and its potential risk of spread in the UK.\n\nWhile herd immunity was not official government strategy, MPs said, the government adopted a \u201cpolicy approach of fatalism\u201d, seeking to \u201conly moderate the speed of infection\u201d through the population, rather than seeking to stop its spread altogether.\n\nAs late as March 12, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, told a briefing that it was not possible to stop everyone being infected, and nor was that a desirable objective.\n\nThe MPs said it was only in the days leading up to the March 23 lockdown that people within government and advisers \u201cexperienced simultaneous epiphanies that the course the UK was following was wrong, possibly catastrophically so\u201d.\n\nBlackpool under lockdown Credit: pa\n\n4. A lack of data in early months led to poor decision-making\n\nThere was a lack of Covid data due to lack of testing capacity. MPs also branded the abandoning of community testing on March 12 a \u201cseminal failure\u201d.\n\nMPs said \u201cdeficiencies in both scientific advice and government action\u201d meant there was no real information about how far the virus had spread and authorities did not fully understand the role of asymptomatic transmission.\n\n5. When the test and trace system began, it was 'slow, uncertain and often chaotic'\n\nThe report said the poorly-executed test and trace system \u201cseverely hampered the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic\u201d.\n\nIt also \"took too long to become effective\".\n\n6. There weren't enough border controls to stop the virus reaching the country\n\nThe border controls in the first few months of 2020 were described as \u201clight-touch\u201d and were implemented only on countries with high Covid rates, even though 33% of cases during the first wave were introduced from Spain and 29% from France.\n\nA Covid testing centre Credit: PA\n\n7. More stringent Covid measures before second lockdown in November could have reduced the spread of the Alpha variant\n\nMPs said more could have been done to reduce the spread of Covid before the second lockdown on November 5. More stringent social distancing measures in autumn could have \u201creduced the seeding of the Alpha variant across the country, slowed its spread and therefore have saved lives\u201d.\n\n8. The regional tier system was confusing and not good enough\n\nThe regional tier system that began on October 14 as confusing for the public, MPs said. Furthermore, it was not \u201cwatertight\u201d enough to prevent infection spreading.\n\n9. Minorities were hit the hardest\n\nThere were \u201cunacceptably high death rates among people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities\u201d and those with learning disabilities, the report noted.\n\nTaxi driver wearing a PPE mask Credit: PA\n\n10. Government failures led to thousands of elderly people dying in care homes\n\nThousands of care home residents died during the first wave of the pandemic.\n\nThe decision not to test people discharged from hospitals to care homes early on was a failure and led to deaths, MPs said.\n\nThey said during the early months, the government did not focus enough on social care, saying \u201csocial care had a less prominent voice in government during the early stages of the pandemic than did the NHS\u201d.\n\n11. The government did well with the vaccine programme\n\nNews of a coronavirus vaccine in early November, 2020, lifted the hopes of many after the Pfizer vaccine was proven to be 90% effective. In December, the UK became the first country in the world to approve a Covid vaccine.\n\nMPs praised in the government's focus on treatments and vaccines, and described the vaccine programme as \"boldly planned and effectively executed\".\n\nThey said ministers were \u201ccorrect to identify that a vaccine would be the long-term route out of the pandemic\u201d and supported research and development.\n\nIn a joint statement, Tory MPs Greg Clark and Jeremy Hunt, who chair the committees, said: \u201cThe UK response has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes. It is vital to learn from both to ensure that we perform as best as we possibly can during the remainder of the pandemic and in the future.\n\n\u201cIn responding to an emergency, when much is unknown, it is impossible to get everything right\u201d."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/africa-tunisia-judiciary-assassinations-tunis-29ee6a5ce5c20776fcb59750a025fb74", "page_content": "FILE - Tunisian President Kais Saied gives a speech at the new government's swearing-in ceremony at the Carthage Palace outside the capital Tunis, on Feb. 27, 2020.

He\u2019s been governing by decree since then, cracking down on corruption and throwing several lawmakers and business people in jail on corruption charges.\n\nWhile constitutional lawyers and political opponents, including the influential Islamist party, say the president\u2019s actions are unlawful, the decision has proven widely popular with Tunisian public.\n\nSupporters of the assassinated politicians have blamed the Islamist party for the killings, saying that Ennahda has slowed down the judicial process in the cases. Ennahda leaders have denied involvement.\n\nSaied accused magistrates of mishandling Belaid\u2019s case and \u201cdenying Tunisians the right to know the truth.\u201d He called on Tunisians to peacefully protest against judges who have kept \u201cthe assassination file in the drawer for years.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s call to protest came despite the government\u2019s ban on public gatherings because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nSeveral hundred people marched in the capital, Tunis, on Sunday, demanding \u201ctruth and justice for Belaid.\u201d They staged a sit-in at the Superior Council of the Judiciary building and urged that the body be dissolved.\n\nThe council\u2019s president, Youssef Bouzakher, said the body remains intact because the president has no power to dissolve it under the Tunisian constitution.\n\n\u201cWe continue to carry out our duties and we will defend the judicial council with all means at our disposal,\u201d Bouzakher said in a statement Sunday.\n\nGhazi Chaouachi, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, said the president\u2019s attempt to dissolve the judiciary council was part of his \u201cpower grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy getting his hands on the judiciary, after he captured the executive and the legislative branches, his control is almost total,\u201d Ghaouachi said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/11/joe-biden-ron-klain-chief-of-staff", "page_content": "Joe Biden has named Ron Klain, who served as the \u201cEbola tsar\u201d during the Obama administration, as his chief of staff.\n\nKlain, 59, has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump\u2019s pandemic response. He first worked with Biden in the 1980s.\n\nIn a statement sharing the news, the president-elect praised Klain\u2019s \u201cdeep, varied experience\u201d.\n\n\u201cRon has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,\u201d said Biden. \u201cHis deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again.\u201d\n\n\n\nKlain said: \u201cIt\u2019s the honor of a lifetime to serve President-elect Biden in this role, and I am humbled by his confidence.\u201d\n\nKlain has had a long career in government. He served as the chief of staff to the former vice-president Al Gore, and the staff director of the Senate Democratic leadership committee. He has worked with several Democratic presidential campaigns, including Biden\u2019s 1988 and 2008 presidential campaigns. He was also the lead Democratic lawyer for Gore during the 2000 presidential election recount.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011, he served as then vice-president Biden\u2019s chief of staff and helped oversee the $787bn stimulus package that Barack Obama signed in response to the Great Recession.\n\nKlain\u2019s experience in a global health pandemic and a recession have been cited as among his top qualifications to help Biden in this moment. The president-elect made the coronavirus pandemic and the economic recession it has triggered central to his presidential campaign, promising to help lead Americans out of the crisis.\n\nWhen Klain was named the Ebola response coordinator in 2014, his appointment was initially criticized because he lacked public health experience. The Obama administration at the time noted he was chosen for his \u201cextensive management experience\u201d.\n\nAmong those to congratulate Klain was Elizabeth Warren, the progressive Massachusetts senator who ran against Biden in the 2020 primaries. Warren said Klain was a \u201csuperb choice for chief of staff. He understands the magnitude of the health and economic crisis and he has the experience to lead this next administration through it.\u201d Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, members of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of progressive congresswoman, also offered congratulations.\n\nWaleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive political action committee Justice Democrats, said Klain \u201cunderstands the Democratic \u200bparty has moved in a more progressive direction\u201d.\n\nProgressives and moderates came together to help elect Joe Biden. But post-election, the two camps have already begun to spar over the party\u2019s future, with progressives saying that Biden should embrace more ambitious policy on the climate crisis, policing and healthcare."}]}
