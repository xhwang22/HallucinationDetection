The Americans edged France 87-82 in the gold medal game to win their fourth straight title at the Games stretching back to 2008.\n\nKevin Durant of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets once again led the way offensively for the U.S. He scored 29 points and sealed the win with two last-second free throws. \"To fight through this adversity against a great team, to come together so fast it was beautiful to see, it was beautiful to be a part of,\" Durant said. Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz and Evan Fournier of the Boston Celtics each had 16 to lead a French team that beat the Americans in their first meeting in Tokyo.\n\nFor the U.S., the victory ended an Olympic run that began with doubts \u2014 the Americans weren't big enough, skeptics said, hadn't played together enough ... and the world was catching up.\n\n\"I think it's more joy than relief, but definitely some relief.

But the entire U.S. team was made up of top-tier NBA athletes and it now has a fourth straight gold medal, and seventh in the last eight Olympic Games.\n\nOverall, the gold is the 19th medal won by Team USA in men's basketball (16 gold, 1 silver, and two bronze).

This was no Dream Team or Redeem Team or any other collection of superstars who will be wistfully remembered in books or documentaries three decades from now.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have to be. At an Olympics that at times have felt like more of an obligation than a celebration, the U.S. men\u2019s basketball team met the moment. They did what they had to do. They got it done.\n\nSo they deserve our everlasting respect.\n\nKevin Durant, America\u2019s all-time Olympic scorer, scored 29 points on 9-18 shooting, and Jrue Holiday of the Milwaukee Bucks, the newly-minted NBA champion who along with Bucks teammate Khris Middleton and fellow NBA Finals participant Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns landed in Tokyo at 1 a.m. the morning their first Olympic game, set a defensive tone that was key to the U.S. victory over France, which beat the U.S in the Olympic opener for both teams. After that loss, and demoralizing pre-Games exhibition losses to Nigeria and Australia that caused some panic in basketball circles, the Americans defended their gold, again: following a bronze medal finish at the 2004 Athens Games that sparked a revamping of the U.S. Olympic team selection process, the U.S. men have now won the past four Olympic gold medals\u2014and maintains its status as world\u2019s most formidable hoops power.\n\nAfter the loss to France, the U.S. held a players-only meeting. \u201cPop wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Durant said after the gold-medal win, his coach, Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, sitting on a dais right next to him. \u201cWhen you have a team meeting, you\u2019re kind of at the bottom.\u201d Thanks in large part to Durant, who unlike most of his superstar brethren chose not to bail on Tokyo, the U.S. rose from those ashes. \u201cA lot of people back home doubted us,\u201d said Durant. \u201cA lot of people said that it was going to be tough for us to win. They really don\u2019t matter. But you hear the noise so much.\u201d\n\nKevin Durant #7 of Team USA celebrates following the United States' victory over France in the Men's Basketball Finals game of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Saitama Super Arena on Aug. 07, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. Gregory Shamus\u2014Getty Images\n\nUltimately, the chirping served as motivation. From the outset, France had a clear strategy: toss the ball down-low to big-man Rudy Gobert, of the Utah Jazz, whenever the relatively slender Durant was guarding him, or when a smaller player switched to defend Gobert. The plan was far from aesthetically pleasing\u2014there\u2019s likely a reason that a pass into the post is often termed a \u201cdump-down\u201d\u2014and flies in the face of in-vogue basketball tactics, which call for spacing and fast pace and lots of three-point shots.\n\nBut basketball\u2019s no beauty competition. Gobert finished with 16 points and shot a perfect 5-5 from the field. But he also missed 7 of his 13 free throws: after the game, he admitted he\u2019ll dwell on that failure a bit. And a few times, Holiday, who\u2019s 10 inches shorter than the 7\u20191\u2033 Gobert, bothered Gobert down low or poked it out of Gobert\u2019s hands. His refusal to back down set a tone.\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s the gold medal game,\u201d says Holiday. \u201cNo excuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis man is a super-champion,\u201d said Jason Tatum of the Boston Celtics, Team USA\u2019s second-leading scorer in the gold medal game with 19 points, putting a hand on Holiday\u2019s shoulder. Holiday and Middleton are the fifth and sixth players ever to win an NBA title and gold medal in the same year; Michael Jordan (1992), Scottie Pippen (1992 and 1996), LeBron James (2012) and Kyrie Irving (2016) are the others.\n\nBut none of these players landed in the Olympic host city at 1 a.m. the day of a game. Between celebrating his \u201892 title with the Bulls and the start of the Barcelona Games, Jordan, Holiday pointed out, \u201chad some time.\u201d\n\nHoliday, says teammate Draymond Green, \u201cis probably the best on-ball defender the NBA has to offer. Him coming to this team, keeping his commitment, is one of the main reasons we\u2019re sitting here as gold medalists.\u201d\n\nWhile Holiday set the defensive tone, Durant anchored the U.S. offense. Both teams did shoot\u2014and miss\u2014plenty of threes; the U.S. started a cool 0-8 before Durant ended that atrocious streak, and as a team finished 9-32 for the game; France went 10-31 from downtown, and bricked or air-balled three shots late that could have threatened Team USA\u2019s lead even more (Holiday also helped hold France\u2019s Evan Fournier, who scored 27 points in France\u2019s pool-play victory over the U.S., to 5-15 shooting, and 2 for 9\u2014including the late brick from Steph Curry range\u2014from deep).\n\nDurant did not enjoy his best long-range shooting game; he was 3-9 from three. But he delivered when needed. Durant scored 21 points in the first half alone; the U.S had a 44-39 lead at the half, and went up by as much as 14 points, 71-57, late in the third quarter, before France chipped away. France cut the deficit to three, 85-82, with 10 seconds left in the game; Durant was fouled and converted both free throws to clinch it.\n\nAll game long, Durant unleashed his usual array of drives to the hoops and silky pull-up jump shots. In the third quarter, he faced up against Gobert, and calmly drilled a three-pointer in his face, as if the reigning defensive player of the year wasn\u2019t even there. Also in the third, he rose for a monster dunk on Gobert\u2014and drew a foul. \u201cWe tried to make things really tough for him,\u201d says Gobert. \u201cWe tried to make him work as hard as he can. But he\u2019s Kevin Durant.\u201d\n\nAt times, Durant\u2019s own teammates can\u2019t help but gawk. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to watch him,\u201d says Damian Lillard. \u201dWhen you\u2019re on the floor with him, Pop\u2019s like don\u2019t stand around, cut, move. But you see some of the stuff he\u2019s doing out there, and it\u2019s hard not to, literally, watch him.\u201d\n\nDurant has his haters: he can be insecure on social media, and some fans will never forgive him for jumping at the chance to sign with the Golden State Warriors after that team won a record 73-games in 2016; two titles followed the Warriors and Durant. But if these Olympics don\u2019t win KD converts, nothing will.\n\nUSA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo, the architect of the last four gold-winning U.S. men\u2019s Olympic teams, teared up after the game when discussing Durant\u2019s sacrifices to play in three straight Olympics\u2014especially these ones. \u201cKD is not special because he\u2019s so talented,\u201d says Popovich, who\u2019s won five NBA titles as long-time coach of the Spurs. \u201cThe way he works on his game is more impressive. The relationships he builds with his teammates, the respect he garners, the joy he has in playing, it\u2019s like osmosis. It goes into all the other players, and allows you to develop camaraderie.\n\nAfter it was over, Durant and Green, the multiple gold medalists, led the on-court celebrations, draping the U.S. flag on their shoulders, hugging and hopping around with their teammates. Don\u2019t put it past Durant, who\u2019s 32, to return to the Games in three years, in Paris. More of the bigger U.S. names might commit; France could be a more compelling locale than Tokyo, especially if COVID-19 is behind us.\n\nBut no matter, the Tokyo team has secured its place. These players, as a whole, may have lacked glitz. They were far from the perfect team. But, as Durant put it, \u201cwe came together to finish it off. It was the perfect ending.\u201d\n\nRead more about the Tokyo Olympics:\n\nWrite to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/08/07/1025452727/how-home-field-advantage-gives-olympic-host-countries-an-edge-and-more-gold-meda", "page_content": "How Home Field Advantage Gives Olympic Host Countries An Edge \u2014 And More Gold Medals\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Pachoud/AFP via Getty Images Jeff Pachoud/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHome field advantage is known in sports for giving athletes competing on their own turf an edge over their opponents. It seems to still hold true even at the highest levels of competition, including the Olympics.\n\nJapan, who is hosting this year's games, has far surpassed its gold medal count from the previous Summer Olympics in Rio in 2016.\n\nData shows, almost without exception, that Olympic athletes from the host country end up on the podium more often and take home more gold medals in the summer games than they did when they were competing away from home.\n\nBut if all the Olympians are sleeping on the same cardboard beds, eating the same Olympic Village food, training on the same equipment and duking it on the same course or in the same swimming pool, why do some athletes have an edge over others?\n\nIt turns out there are lots of reasons home team athletes get a boost. And in the Olympics in particular, the deck is stacked even higher in favor of the host country.\n\nHome field advantage is real, athletes and experts say\n\nOne of the biggest pluses to competing at home is the positive energy from a supportive crowd, athletes say. (That is somewhat out the window at this year's Olympics, where fans were banned from entering facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n\nBriana Scurry, a former goalie for the U.S. women's national soccer team, said playing in the U.S. during the 1996 Summer Olympics helped the squad beat China to win gold that year.\n\n\"We had 76,000 people at the final in Athens, Georgia, all cheering for us. And China had, literally, a little tiny section of red up high in the nosebleed seats,\" she said.\n\nThree years later, during the 1999 Women's World Cup in California, Scurry said the home field advantage pushed the team to play better again. During the final, Scurry herself made an iconic save in the game-deciding shootout, deflecting the ball with her fingertips, helping the team win the championship.\n\n\"[The] times where I haven't really felt exceptionally energized, if I think about it, are the times usually when we weren't the home-based team. We were overseas and playing,\" she said.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnother factor that can hurt athletes from different places, especially other countries, is travel. International competitions such as the Olympics often require long flights across multiple time zones, which can give athletes jet lag and impact their sleep.\n\nForeign athletes may also be unaccustomed to the food and training equipment available at the competition. Even the weather, such as the oppressive humidity right now in Tokyo, may throw off a competitor used to a different climate.\n\nFor some athletes, though, the disadvantage to playing away may be more nebulous. It could simply be the feeling of being off in a new place.\n\n\"When we compete at home, we're comfortable. We're familiar with our surroundings, and that gives us some confidence. We know our course. We know the stadium we're performing in. We know the crowds that are there are generally cheering, hopefully, for us to do well,\" said Tim Baghurst, director of FSU COACH, the athletic coaching center at Florida State University.\n\n\"Now flip that, and you go somewhere where maybe the crowd base is more hostile. You haven't prepared the same way. Maybe the equipment to warm up isn't available that you're usually used to warming up with. Now we have that uncertainty of, 'maybe I'm not prepared for this.' And that little bit of doubt creeps in,\" he added.\n\n\"Theoretically it should be no different, but we know that it is.\"\n\nOlympic host countries get an even bigger boost\n\nThe home field advantage is dialed up even higher for the Olympics, where host countries are afforded additional benefits to help their athletes succeed.\n\nCompetitors from host countries have to meet lower qualification standards than their foreign peers, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThat may contribute to the phenomenon of host countries sending much bigger squads to their Olympics than the previous summer games when they competed abroad.\n\nLoading...\n\nJapan got yet another benefit this year thanks to an Olympic rule change. A new policy adopted by the The International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2016 allows the organizing committee for the host country to propose several new sporting events for their games.\n\nIt meant that baseball and softball, karate, skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing \u2014 all popular sports in Japan \u2014 were Olympic events in Tokyo. And Japanese athletes have already medaled in four of the five sports, at times crushing the competition.\n\nHistory shows host countries perform better\n\nIn every Summer Olympics since 1952, with two exceptions, the host country has won more medals than it did in the previous summer games.\n\nSo far this year, Japan nabbed 10 more medals than it did in 2016. In the 2008 games in Beijing, China won 100 medals, 37 more than it took home in 2004. (Finland, in 1952, and the United States, in 1996, saw their medal counts drop at home.)\n\nHost countries not only win more medals; they take home the top prize more often, too. Since 1952 only two countries (including Finland, again) have failed to improve on their previous gold medal counts when they hosted the summer games.\n\nWith the Tokyo Olympics still underway, Japan has already bested its 2016 gold medal tally. Brazil took home seven golds in 2016, more than double its previous haul.\n\nLoading...\n\nBaghurst, the Florida State University professor, says it pays for host country athletes to do well. It likely means more money for the IOC and the host country through merchandise and other sales. It also makes for a buzzier, more enjoyable competition for that country's citizens, who not only have to put up with the disruptions caused by the Olympics but also may want to take part in what is a rare, even patriotic-feeling, event.\n\n\"When there is success in an event at home, more people are talking about it, more people are coming to watch\" he said. \"It just increases that fervor and interest in what's going on.\""}, {"url": "https://www.flogymnastics.com/articles/5067401-catching-up-with-former-florida-gator-mackenzie-caquatto", "page_content": "FloGymnastics: What have you been up to since graduating in 2014?\n\nTell us about how teaching is going and what you enjoy the most.\n\n\n\nWhen you look back at your career at Florida, what moments stand out to you the most?\n\nWhat are you most proud of as a Florida Gator?\n\nWhat do you miss most about gymnastics and being a Florida Gator?\n\nWhat was it like competing with your sister, Bridgette?\n\nWhat was it like watching Bridgette compete after you had graduated?\n\nWhat personal accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\n\n\nYou competed under former UF coach Rhonda Faehn -- what is the biggest thing you learned from her?\n\n\n\nWhat is next for you personally?

I made friends for life and loved being with my teammates who understood what I was going through and always had my back.Representing the University of Florida and being able to wear the \"F\" on my chest. I am still proud to wear my Florida gear and be a part of the Gator community.I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and having someone to support me all the time. I also miss competing and the feeling of adrenaline with my teammates.I was so happy when my sister came to Florida. We trained our whole lives together, so when I came to Florida first, it felt like part of me was missing. She knows me better than anyone and was able to be there for me and push me and encourage me.I think the year after I graduated I was living vicariously through her. It was really hard to be up in the stands. I wanted to be down on the floor cheering her on. It was great to see her win another national championship and have her time to shine. I was also so nervous watching her.Being a part of a national championship team. As a junior, I was a member of the first-ever gymnastics team to win a national championship at Florida, so that was pretty special.Rhonda was a very calm and encouraging coach, which was very contagious. Every time we went to compete she told us we could do and you could feel that she believed in you and knew you could do it. That has stuck with me as I am now a teacher and I encourage my students and believe in them. Rhonda also knew our limits and knew how to get us where we needed to be. She cared about each of us as a person and was more than a coach to us.I plan to stay dedicated to teaching, as that is another passion of mine. I want to find a way to stay connected to the sport of gymnastics. I may want to try college coaching or judging to stay involved with the sport I love. I am currently coaching summer camps, and I love doing that.My time at Florida really was the best experience ever as I was surrounded by awesome girls and coaches. College gymnastics was the cherry on top for me.
