{"Edmund Husserl was a student of Wilhelm Windelband.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/husserls-transcendental-phenomenology/2B25ED1C3CE802A1DD74D9F064078AD0", "page_content": "Aristophanes . 2000 .

He has made important contributions to almost all areas of philosophy and anticipated central ideas of its neighbouring disciplines such as linguistics, sociology and cognitive psychology.\n\nHusserl was born in Prossnitz (Moravia) on April 8th, 1859. In the years 1876-78 he studied astronomy in Leipzig, where he also attended courses of lectures in mathematics, physics and philosophy. Among other things, he heard Wilhelm Wundt's lectures on philosophy. (Wundt was the originator of the first institute for experimental psychology.) Husserl's mentor was the philosophy professor Thomas Masaryk, a former student of Brentano's, who was later to become the first president of Czechoslovakia. In 1878-81 Husserl continued his studies in mathematics, physics and philosophy in Berlin. His mathematics teachers there included Leopold Kronecker and Carl Weierstrass, whose scientific ethos Husserl was particularly impressed with. However, he took his PhD in mathematics in Vienna, with a thesis on the theory of variations (Jan. 1883). After that he returned to Berlin, to become Weierstrass' assistant. When Weierstrass got seriously ill, Masaryk suggested that Husserl go back to Vienna, to study philosophy with Franz Brentano, the author of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). After a brief military service in Vienna, Husserl followed Masaryk's advice and studied with Brentano from 1884-86. Brentano then recommended Husserl to his pupil Carl Stumpf in Halle, who is perhaps best known for his Psychology of Tone (two volumes, 1883/90). This recommendation enabled Husserl to prepare and submit his habilitation dissertation On the Concept of Number (1887) with Stumpf.\n\nThat thesis was later integrated into Husserl's first published monograph, Philosophy of Arithmetic, which appeared in 1891. In this work, Husserl combined his mathematical, psychological and philosophical competencies to attempt a psychological foundation of arithmetic (see Willard 1984, pp. 38-118; Bell 1990, pp. 31-84). The book was, however, criticized for its underlying psychologism in a review by Gottlob Frege. It seems that Husserl took that criticism very seriously (see F\u00f8llesdal 1958). In any case, he turned away from psychologism and developed the philosophical method he is nowadays famous for: phenomenology.\n\nIn 1900/01 his first phenomenological work was published in two volumes, titled Logical Investigations. The first volume contains a forceful attack against psychologism, whereas the (much larger) second volume consists of six \u201cdescriptive-psychological\u201d and \u201cepistemological\u201d investigations into (I) expression and meaning, (II) universals, (III) the formal ontology of parts and wholes (mereology), (IV) the \u201csyntactical\u201d and mereological structure of meaning, (V) the nature and structure of intentionality as well as (VI) the interrelation of truth, intuition and cognition. Husserl now adheres to a version of platonism that he derived from ideas of Hermann Lotze and especially Bernard Bolzano, where he embeds platonism about meaning and mental content in a theory of intentional consciousness (see Beyer 1996).\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, Husserl considerably refined and modified his method into what he called \u201ctranscendental phenomenology\u201d. This method has us focus on the essential structures that allow the objects naively taken for granted in the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d (which is characteristic of both our everyday life and ordinary science) to \u201cconstitute themselves\u201d in consciousness. (Among those who influenced him in this regard are Descartes, Hume and Kant.) As Husserl explains in detail in his second major work, Ideas (1913), the resulting perspective on the realm of intentional consciousness is supposed to enable the phenomenologist to develop a radically unprejudiced justification of his (or her) basic views on the world and himself and explore their rational interconnections.\n\nHusserl developed these ideas in G\u00f6ttingen, where \u2014 thanks to his Logical Investigations \u2014 he received an associate professorship in 1901. From 1910/11 and 1913, respectively, he served as founding (co-)editor of Logos (in the first issue of which his programmatic article \u201cPhilosophy as a Rigorous Science\u201d appeared, containing a critique of naturalism) and of the Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Research (opening with his Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy). Husserl stayed in G\u00f6ttingen until 1916. It is here that he made his most important philosophical discoveries (cf. Mohanty 1995), such as the transcendental-phenomenological method, the phenomenological structure of time-consciousness, the fundamental role of the notion of intersubjectivity in our conceptual system, the horizon-structure of our singular empirical thought, and more. In later works \u2014 most notably in On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time (1928), Formal and Transcendental Logic (1929), Cartesian Meditations (1931), The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1936/54) and Experience and Judgement (1939) \u2014 these results were developed further and put into new contexts, such as the path-breaking project of linking the basic notions of science back to their conceptual roots in the pre-scientific (regions of the) \u201clifeworld\u201d (Crisis).\n\nIn the year 1916 Husserl became Heinrich Rickert's successor as full professor in Freiburg/Breisgau, where (among many other things) he worked on passive synthesis (cf. Husserliana, vol. XI, XXXI). He gave four lectures on Phenomenological Method and Phenomenological Philosophy at University College, London, in 1922 (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXV). In 1923 he received a call to Berlin, which he rejected. Husserl retired in 1928, his successor being his (and Rickert's) former assistant Martin Heidegger (whose major work Being and Time had been published in Husserl's Yearbook in 1927). In 1929 he accepted an invitation to Paris. His lectures there were published as Cartesian Meditations in 1931. In the same year, Husserl gave a number of talks on \u201cPhenomenology and Anthropology\u201d, in which he criticized his two \u201cantipodes\u201d, Heidegger and Max Scheler (cf. Husserl 1997). In 1933 Hitler took over in Germany. Husserl received a call to Los Angeles but rejected. Because of his Jewish ancestors, he became more and more humiliated and isolated. In 1935 he gave a series of invited lectures in Prague, resulting in his last major work, The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology.\n\nEdmund Husserl died on April 27, 1938 in Freiburg. His manuscripts (more than 40000 pages in total) were rescued by the Franciscan Herman Leo Van Breda, who brought them to Leuven (Belgium), where the first Husserl archive was founded in 1939. (Today, there are further archives in Freiburg, Cologne, Paris, New York and Pittsburgh.) Since 1950 the Husserl archives are editing Husserl's collected works, Husserliana.\n\nAs a philosophically-minded mathematician, Husserl was interested in developing a general theory of inferential systems, which (following Bolzano) he conceived of as a theory of science, on the ground that every science (including mathematics) can be looked upon as a system of propositions that are interconnected by a set of inferential relations. Following John S. Mill, he argues in Logical Investigations that the best way to study the nature of such propositional systems is to start with their linguistic manifestations, i.e., (sets of) sentences and (assertive) utterances thereof.\n\nHow are we to analyse these sentences and the propositions they express? Husserl's approach is to study the units of consciousness that the respective speaker presents himself as having \u2014 that he \u201cgives voice to\u201d \u2014 in expressing the proposition in question (for instance, while writing a mathematical textbook or giving a lecture). These units of consciousness he labels intentional acts or intentional experiences, since they always represent something as something \u2014 thus exhibiting what Brentano called intentionality. According to Husserl, there are non-intentional units of consciousness as well. (He quotes pain as an example.) What distinguishes intentional from non-intentional experiences is the former's having intentional content.\n\nEven objectless (i.e., empty) intentional experiences like your thought of the winged horse Pegasus have content. On Husserl's view, that thought simply lacks a corresponding object; the intentional act is merely \u201cas if of\u201d an object. In the case of propositional acts, i.e., units of consciousness that can be given voice to by a complete sentence, Husserl identifies their content with the propositional meaning expressed by that sentence. In the case of their non-propositional but still intentional parts, he identifies the corresponding intentional content with a sub-propositional meaning. For example, the judgement \u201cNapoleon is a Frenchman\u201d contains an act of thinking of Napoleon whose intentional content is the sub-propositional meaning expressed by the name \u201cNapoleon\u201d. (Accordingly, the judgement can be looked upon as an act of ascribing the property of being French to the referent of that name.) Experiences like this, which can be given voice to by either a singular or a general term, are called \u201cnominal acts\u201d (as opposed to the propositional acts containing them). Their contents are called \u201cnominal meanings\u201d.\n\nHusserl regards both propositional and nominal meanings as the subject-matter of \u201cpure logic\u201d or \u201clogic in the wide sense\u201d \u2014 the study of (i) what distinguishes sense (alias meaning) from nonsense (this part of pure logic being called \u201cpure grammar\u201d) and (ii) which of the senses delivered by pure grammar are logically consistent and which of them are not (this part of pure logic being labelled \u201clogic in the narrow sense\u201d).\n\nAn important and still largely unexplored claim of Husserl's is that any logically consistent meaning can in principle be subjectively fulfilled, more or less adequately, by a unified intuition, such as an act of continuous perception or intuitive imagination, where the structure and other essential features of the meaning in question can be read off from the respective mode of intuitive fulfillment. Inconsistent meanings can be singled out and studied by means of (reflection upon) corresponding experiences of intuitive conflict, like for instance the discrete switching back and forth between a duck-head-imagination and a rabbit-head-imagination in the case of an attempted intuitive imagination of a duck-head that is at the same time a rabbit-head. Some meanings are inconsistent for formal-logical reasons. According to Husserl, all analytically false propositions belong to this category. Other meanings are inconsistent because they conflict with some general material a priori truth, also called \u201cessential law\u201d. The proposition expressed by the sentence \u201cThere are perceptual objects whose surface is both (visibly) completely green and completely red at the same time\u201d is a case in point.\n\nMeanings generally and propositions in particular exist independently of their actually functioning as intentional content. Thus, true propositions such as the Pythagorean theorem can be discovered. Propositions and their components are abstract, i.e., atemporal, objects. However, what does it mean to grasp a proposition or, more generally, a sense? How can an abstract object become the content of an intentional act? Combining ideas of Bolzano and Lotze, Husserl answers this question by taking recourse to the notion of an ideal (i.e., abstract) species or type, as follows. Propositions and other meanings are ideal species that can be (but do not have to be) instantiated by certain particular features, i.e., dependent parts, of intentional acts. Those species are also called \u201cideal matters\u201d. The particular features instantiating an ideal matter \u2014 Husserl refers to them as \u201cmoments of matter\u201d \u2014 are laid bare by phenomenological description, a reflection-based (or introspective) analysis taking into account both the linguistic expression(s) (if any) and the modes of (possible) intuitive fulfillment or conflict associated with the respective experience.\n\nSince phenomenological description yields ideal species, it involves what Husserl was later (notably in Ideas) to call \u201ceidetic reduction\u201d, i.e., an unfolding of abstract features shared by appropriate sets of fictitious or real-life examples, by way, e.g., of free imaginative variation on an arbitrarily chosen initial example (for the method of \u201cfree variation\u201d, see Experience and Judgement, sec. 87).\n\nPhenomenological description also yields the \u201cmoment of quality\u201d of the intentional experience under investigation, i.e., the particular feature instantiating its psychological mode (judgement, conscious deliberation, conscious desire, conscious hope, etc.), which roughly corresponds to the speech act mode of an utterance giving voice to that experience. Furthermore, the description yields relations of \u201cfoundation\u201d, i.e., one-sided or mutual relative existential dependencies between (1) the experience in question and other experiences and (2) the particular descriptive features of the experience. Thus, an experience of pleasure about a given event is one-sidedly founded, relative to the stream of consciousness it belongs to, in a particular belief-state to the effect that this event has occurred. (The relativization to a particular stream of consciousness makes sure that both founded and founding experience occur in the same person's mind.) Like all foundation relations, this one holds in virtue of an essential law, to the effect that conscious pleasure about some state of affairs requires a corresponding (and simultaneous) belief. Quite generally, a given object a of type F is founded in a particular object b of type G (where a is different from b and F is different from G) relative to a particular whole c of type H if and only if (i) there is an essential law in virtue of which it holds that for any object x of type F there is an object y of type G and a whole z of type H, such that both x and y are (proper) parts of z, and (ii) both a and b are (proper) parts of c. Of course, the notion of an essential law needs further clarification.\n\nHowever, as Husserl was well aware, the species-theory of content faces at least one serious objection. It concerns utterances of \u201cessential occasional\u201d, i.e., systematically context-sensitive, expressions like \u201cI am here now\u201d and the (as one could call them) indexical experiences they give voice to. If the intentional content of an indexical experience is to serve as a (sub-)propositional content, it must uniquely determine the object (if any) that the respective experience refers to. That is to say: if two indexical experiences display the same intentional content, they must refer to the same object (if any). It seems, though, that the moments of matter of two such experiences can instantiate the same ideal matter \u2014 the same type of (particular) content \u2014 whilst representing different objects. If you and I both think \u201cI am here\u201d, our respective thoughts share the same type of content, or so it would seem, but they represent different states of affairs. In order to accommodate this observation, Husserl draws a distinction between, on the one hand, the \u201cgeneral meaning function\u201d of an utterance (which corresponds to what David Kaplan calls \u201ccharacter\u201d, roughly: the linguistic meaning of the expression used) and, on the other hand, the \u201crespective meaning\u201d (i.e., the propositional or sub-propositional content expressed in the relevant context of utterance). However, it is doubtful whether this distinction really helps Husserl overcome the difficulty the phenomenon of context-sensitivity poses for his species-theory of content. If intentional contents are ideal matters in the sense of types of particular matters, and if this kind of type may remain constant while the intentional object and hence the (sub-)propositional content differs, then surely intentional contents thus conceived cannot always function as (sub-)propositional contents, as Husserl's theory would have it. Rather, there must be another intentional content involved, namely the \u201crespective meaning\u201d, which serves as the (sub-)propositional content of the indexical experience. And this content does not appear to be an ideal species. (It may be argued, however, that even (sub-)propositional contents of indexical utterances can be instantiated multiply in thought and speech, thus qualifying as ideal species after all. But the crucial question is whether this holds true in complete generality: consider the above example \u201cI am here now\u201d.)\n\nHowever that may be, Husserl construes (sub-)propositional contents (\u201crespective meanings\u201d) as two-factored, with the general meaning function plus the relevant context of utterance (if any) determining the content in question. And at least in the case of indexical experiences he seems to identify their intentional contents with these two-factored contents, for he holds that intentional content, which is referred to as \u201cnoematic sense\u201d or \u201cnoematic nucleus\u201d in Ideas, uniquely determines reference, i.e., intentional object. (For the claim that noematic sense is contextually determined respective meaning rather than general meaning function \u2014 which rules out any internalist reading; see Section 4 below \u2014 cf. Husserliana, vol. XX/1, pp. 74-78; see also Husserliana, vol. XXVI, p. 212, fn.) Some scholars even go as far as to claim that Husserl defines the noematic sense as \u201ca certain person, object, event, state of affairs which presents itself, taken exactly as it present itself or as it is intended\u201d (Gurwitsch 1982, pp. 61 f.; cp. Sokolowski 1987; for a much-discussed critique of Gurwitsch's interpretation see F\u00f8llesdal 1982).\n\nHusserl sees quite clearly that indexical experiences (just as experiences given voice to by means of genuine proper names) are characterized, among other things, by their singularity: they represent a particular object, or set of objects, x, such that x is to be regarded as the intentional object of the respective experience in all relevant possible worlds (i.e., in all actual or counterfactual circumstances relative to which we are determining the object represented by that experience). Thus, for instance, in sec. 47 of Ideas, he describes what an experiencing subject, at a given time, in the light of his (or her) current indexical experiences, considers to be \u201cthe actual world\u201d as a \u201cspecial case\u201d of a whole manifold of \u201cpossible worlds\u201d each of which corresponds to a possible future course of experience (possible, that is, relative to the indexical experience in question). These (actual or potential) future experiences can be said to be (more or less) anticipated by the experiencing subject at the respective time, and they constitute what Husserl calls the \u201cintentional horizon\u201d of the indexical experience in the light of whose intentional content they are anticipated (cf. Smith and McIntyre 1982). For example, if you consciously see something as a table, you will expect it to appear to you in certain ways if you go around and observe it.\n\nWhat binds together the intentional horizon of a given indexical experience? According to Husserl, all of the (actual or potential) experiences constituting that horizon share a sense of identity through time, which sense he labels as the determinable X they belong to. As a first approximation, two experiences of a given subject belong to the same determinable X if and only if the subject believes them to represent the same object. (For a related criterion of intersubjective identity of determinable X, see Beyer 2000, sec. 7.) Hence, experiences belonging to a determinable X must be accompanied by at least one higher-order belief. This higher-order view fits in well with Husserl's claim (from sec. 35 ff. of Ideas) that intentional experiences are nothing but \u201cactual or potential cogitationes\u201d, where a given momentary intentional state is an actual cogitatio if and only if its subject is consciously aware of (being in) that state. This latter act of awareness \u2014 a reflective higher-order judgement \u2014 can be looked upon as actualizing a corresponding higher-order belief. Note that the respective higher-order belief need not be a conscious experience in turn. Rather, it may be thought of as a momentary disposition to make a reflective higher-order judgement (\u201ccogito\u201d), thus arguably constituting a form of implicit or pre-reflective self-consciousness (see the entry on phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness).\n\nThe determinable X a given indexical experience belongs to, with respect to certain other experiences, helps us answer the question of what determines the reference of that experience, if not its ideal meaning species alone. In order to take the role played by the determinable X into account properly, we have to employ a Husserlian research strategy that could be called the dynamic method. That is to say, we have to look upon intentional acts as momentary components of certain transtemporal cognitive structures \u2014 dynamic intentional structures \u2014 in which one and the same object or state of affairs is represented throughout a period of time during which the subject's cognitive perspective upon that object or state of affairs is constantly changing (see, e.g., Ideas, sec. 86). (Typical examples of dynamic intentional structures include continuous observations \u2014 which represent Husserl's standard example \u2014 as well as those totalities of successive judgements, or momentary belief-states, that actualize one and the same continuous belief. For instance, my judgement that yesterday was Thursday actualizes the same belief as the judgement I could have given voice to yesterday by \u201cToday is Thursday\u201d.) Consequently, the determinable X is apt to lead us back through time towards the original situation where the reference of the relevant unified series of successive intentional horizons was fixed, like for instance the occasion of the subject's first perceptual encounter with a particular object: the corresponding perceptual experience will belong to the same determinable X as all of the (remaining) experiences belonging to the relevant series. In a more recent terminology, one may say that in this perceptual situation the subject has opened a mental file about a particular object (cf. Perry 1993).\n\nIn a research manuscript from 1913 Husserl refers to mental files associated with proper names as \u201cindividual notions (Eigenbegriffe)\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XX/2, p. 358), characterizing them as being infinitely \u201copen\u201d and \u201cin flux\u201d (cf. ibid., p. 359). Now it is the \u201creferent\u201d of the relevant mental file, or individual notion, that will normally count as the common intentional object of the experiences bound together in a unified series of successive intentional horizons in which the object \u201cconstitutes itself\u201d empirically. (In cases where the \u201creferent\u201d of a mental file changes across time \u2014 i.e., is unnoticedly replaced by another object \u2014 the situation becomes more complicated. The same goes for cases of perceptual judgements leading to, or taken by the respective subject to be confirming, entries into an already existing file. See Beyer 2000, sec. 7.) Note that \u201cconstitution\u201d so conveived does not mean creation.\n\nOn this reading of Husserl's notion of the determinable X, there is a link, at least in the case of proper names and in the ubiqituous indexical case, between intentional content (including determinable X) on the one hand, and extra-mental reality on the other, such that intentional content thus understood determines reference in much the same way more recent externalist theories of content would have it, i.e. in such a way that the referent can in turn be said to help determine the intentional content (see Beyer 2000, 2001; cf. also Husserl's discussion of Twin Earth in Husserliana, vol. XXVI, p. 212). Notice, however, that Husserl does not naively take the existence of an extra-mental referent for granted. Instead, he asks which structures of consciousness entitle us to represent the world as containing particular objects transcending what is currently given to us in experience (see also Section 8 below).\n\nHusserl can thus be read (or at least be rationally reconstructed) as both an early direct reference theorist (headword: singularity) and a non-naive externalist about intentional content and (respective) meaning.\n\nAn externalist reading (or rational reconstruction) of Husserl's theory of content might, however, be taken to conflict with the methodological constraints posed by the phenomenological epoch\u00e9, which \u2014 together with the dynamic method and eidetic reduction \u2014 builds the essential core of the transcendental-phenomenological method introduced in Ideas.\n\nHusserl developed the method of epoch\u00e9 or \u201cbracketing\u201d around 1906. It may be regarded as a radicalization of the methodological constraint, already to be found in Logical Investigations, that any phenomenological description proper is to be performed from a first person point of view, so as to ensure that the respective item is described exactly as is experienced, or intended, by the subject. Now from a first-person point of view, one cannot, of course, decide whether in a case of what one takes to be, say, an act of perception one is currently performing, there actually is an object that one is perceptually confronted with. For instance, it is well possible that one is hallucinating. From a first-person point of view, there is no difference to be made out between the veridical and the non-veridical case \u2014 for the simple reason that one cannot at the same time fall victim to and detect a perceptual error or misrepresentation. In the non-veridical case, too, a transcendent object appears to \u201cconstitute itself\u201d in consciousness. It is for such reasons that Husserl demanded that in a phenomenological description proper the existence of the object(s) (if any) satisfying the content of the intentional act described must be \u201cbracketed\u201d. That is to say, the phenomenological description of a given act and, in particular, the phenomenological specification of its intentional content, must not rely upon the correctness of any existence assumption concerning the object(s) (if any) the respective act is about. Thus, the epoch\u00e9 has us focus on those aspects of our intentional acts and their contents that do not depend on the existence of a represented object out there in the extra-mental world.\n\nOn closer inspection, however, Husserl actually draws upon two different versions of the epoch\u00e9 in Ideas (as elsewhere), which versions he does not separate as clearly as one might have hoped: the \u201cuniversal epoch\u00e9\u201d on the one hand, and a much weaker \u201clocal epoch\u00e9\u201d (as one could label it) on the other. The former version requires the phenomenologist to put all his existence assumptions regarding the external world into brackets at once, whereas the weaker version merely requires him to bracket particular existence assumptions, depending on the respective \u201ctranscendental guide (Leitfaden)\u201d, i.e., on the issue to be clarified phenomenologically. This is supposed to enable the phenomenologist to make explicit his reasons for the bracketed existence assumptions, or for assumptions based upon them, such as, e.g., the presupposition that a given creature is a subject undergoing such-an-such an experience. (In Section 7 we shall see that Husserl draws upon empathy in this connection.)\n\nOnly the universal epoch\u00e9 seems to conflict with our externalist reading: if no extra-mental existence assumptions whatsoever are admitted, then phenomenologically there cannot be object-dependent intentional contents, as externalism would have it. By contrast, there may be some such contents, even many of them, without intentional content generally having to be dependent on a particular extra-mental object. Which leaves enough room for the method of local epoch\u00e9 to apply to any given particular case, as will become clear in Section 6 below.\n\nNow the only function of the universal epoch\u00e9 is to establish the residuum thesis, which holds that the realm of (empirical) consciousness is \u201cabsolute\u201d in that it does not depend on the existence of an external, spatio-temporal world (cf. Ideas, sec. 51, 55). But Husserl's argument for this thesis fails: it is invalid (see Beyer 2000, pp. 137-140). As a consequence, the universal epoch\u00e9 does not serve to establish what it was solely designed to show, namely the residuum thesis. We may therefore ignore it, stick to our externalist reading, and focus on what the method of local epoch\u00e9 allows Husserl to achieve.\n\nThe point of the local epoch\u00e9 can perhaps best be brought out if we follow Husserl in applying it to the case of perceptual experience. The phenomenologist is supposed to perform his descriptions from a first-person point of view, so as to ensure that the respective item is described exactly as it is experienced. Now in the case of perceptual experience one cannot, of course, both fall victim to and at the same time discover a particular perceptual error; it is always possible that one is subject to an illusion or even a hallucination, so that one's perceptual experience is not veridical. If one is hallucinating, there is really no object of perception. However, phenomenologically the experience one undergoes is exactly the same as if one were successfully perceiving an external object.\n\nTherefore, the (adequacy of a) phenomenological description of a perceptual experience should be independent of whether for the experience under investigation there is an object it represents or not. Either way, there will at least be a perceptual content (if not the same content on both sides, though). It is this content that Husserl calls the perceptual noema. Thanks to its noema, even a hallucination is an intentional act. Phenomenological description is concerned with those aspects of the noema that remain the same irrespective of whether the experience in question is veridical or not. Thus, our phenomenologist must not employ \u2014 he (or she) must \u201cbracket\u201d \u2014 his belief in the existence of the perceptual object.\n\nHowever, this lands him in a methodological dilemma. If, on the one hand, the phenomenologist leaves the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d and brackets his corresponding existence-belief, he cannot at the same time perform the perceptual experience he wishes to investigate. (This is the first horn of the dilemma.) For, as Husserl himself stresses (cf. Ideas, sec. 90, 109), the existence-belief is an indispensable part of the perceptual phenomenon: such experiences are essentially thetic, i.e., there can be no such thing as a perceptual experience without \u201cbelief-character\u201d (cf. 5th Logical Investigation, sec. 23). If, on the other hand, our phenomenologist makes use of that belief, then he is bound to violate the constraints put upon him by the local epoch\u00e9: he cannot but fail to assume the phenomenological attitude. (This is the second horn.)\n\nThere are at least three possible ways out of this dilemma. First, the phenomenologist could choose the first horn of the dilemma, but analyse an earlier perceptual experience of his, one that he now remembers. He just has to make sure here not to employ his earlier (and perhaps still persisting) belief in the existence of a perceptual object. Secondly, he could again decide in favour of the first horn and analyse a perceptual experience that he merely intuitively imagines himself to have. (For Husserl's view on imagination see esp. Husserliana, vol. XXIII.) Thirdly, he could instead choose the second horn, keep employing his existence-belief, but make a kind of \u201cpragmatic ascent\u201d and describe the perceptual experience in such a way that the description, i.e., the speech act thus performed, does not presuppose the existence of a perceptual object. (The following sort of description may serve that function: \u201cI am demonstratively identifying a so-and-so\u201d; \u201cI am performing an act of this-meaning under the aspect so-and-so\u201d.)\n\nIt is not entirely clear if Husserl considers all of these strategies to be admissable. The second one is certainly in line with the important methodological role he ascribes to \u201cphantasy\u201d, i.e., mere intuitive imagination, when it comes to eidetic reduction, which in turn constitutes an important part of the phenomenological method. The third strategy \u2014 pragmatic ascent \u2014 fits in well with the way he uses to specify the common element of the noema of both veridical perceptions and corresponding hallucinations (see, e.g., the first-person description of someone's experience of \u201cthis blooming tree there in space\u201d presented in sec. 90 of Ideas; also see ibid., sec. 89 f.).\n\nNow we can apply the local epoch\u00e9 to specify the noema of both veridcal perceptions and hallucinations so as to bring out their singularity. Already in his 1894 essay \u201cIntentional Objects\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXII; English translation of a somewhat different version of the essay in: Rollinger 1999) Husserl stressed that objectless representations such as hallucinations can in a sense be chararacterized as \u201crepresenting an intentional object\u201d, provided that this characterization is understood to be made \u201cunder an existential assumption\u201d, as follows: \u201cIf the act of hallucination were veridical, it would sucessfully represent such-and-such an object (under such-and-such aspects)\u201d. Something similar goes with regard to the singularity of a hallucinatory experience's noema: if such an experience were veridical, it would, in virtue of its noema, represent a particular perceptual object in all relevant possible worlds (see Section 3 above). Thus, we can provide an existentially neutral specification of the noema of a (veridical, illusory or hallucinatory) perceptual experience, just as local epoch\u00e9 demands, and still bring out the singular character of their content that Husserl has done so much to uncover, especially in his investigations into indexicality and the role of the determinable X in our constitution of spatio-temporal reality. The specification might run as follows: The noema of a perceptual experience i is such that either (1) there is an object x that i represents in virtue of its noema, where x is to be regarded as the referent of i in all relevant possible worlds, or (2) there would be an object meeting condition (1) if i were veridical. Condition (2) enables us to make sense of the behaviour of a speaker/thinker making counterfactual assumptions about an object which he, unknowingly, merely hallucinates or quantifying into modal statements about that alleged object (cf. Beyer 2000, pp. 26-31). Notice that on the above-proposed externalist reading of Husserl's notion of intentional content, the noema will differ depending on whether condition (1) or (2) is satisfied. Nevertheless, our noematic specification meets the requirements of local epoch\u00e9, as it does not rely on the existence of a particular perceptual object. If there is no such object, condition (2) will be satisfied \u2014 provided that we are dealing with a perceptual experience. The rationale behind condition (2) is that even in the non-veridical case an individual notion (a mental file) and consequently a unified series of intentional horizons gets activated, on the basis of the same sensory material, or h\u00fdle (see the following paragraph), as in the veridical case.\n\nIt should be noted that according to Husserl the complete noema of a perceptual experience contains an additional element, to be distinguished from the intentional content, notably its \u201cthetic\u201d or \u201cpositing\u201d character, i.e., its quality. Moreover, the manner in which the perceptual object (if any) presents (or would present) itself includes the sensual matter or \u201ch\u00fdle\u201d underlying the respective perceptual experience. Typical examples of h\u00fdle include sense impressions (i.e., sensory experiences), as opposed to the perceptual experiences based upon them. Thus, to take Jastrow's/Wittgenstein's duck-rabbit head as an example, the perception of a duck-head may be founded in the same sense impressions or h\u00fdle as the perception of a rabbit-head (cf. F\u00f8llesdal 1988, pp. 108 f.). (For Husserl all remaining intuitive acts are likewise founded in something like h\u00fdle, which he labels as their \u201cintuitive representational content\u201d. In the case of acts of phantasy, he refers to the intuitive representational content as \u201cphantasma\u201d.) Husserl regards sense impressions as non-conceptual in nature. It is only the intentional content of a perceptual experience that \u201cforms\u201d its underlying h\u00fdle so as to yield a conceptual representation of the perceptual object. Husserl compares this process of conceptual \u201cforming\u201d of sensual matter to the interpretation of a linguistic expression, but this comparison should not mislead us to conclude that he subscribes to a sense-datum theory of perception. Rather, his view on perception is best characterized as a sophisticated version of direct realism.\n\nFinally, we should note that on Husserl's view there is a further important dimension to perceptual experience, in that it displays a phenomenological deep- or micro-structure constituted by time-consciousness (Husserliana, vol. X, XXXIII; also see Miller 1984). This merely seemingly unconscious structure is essentially indexical in character and consists, at a given time, of both retentions, i.e., acts of immediate memory of what has been perceived \u201cjust a moment ago\u201d, original impressions, i.e., acts of awareness of what is perceived \u201cright now\u201d, and protentions, i.e., immediate anticipations of what will be perceived \u201cin a moment\u201d. It is by such momentary structures of retentions, original impressions and protentions that moments of time are continuously constituted (and reconstituted) as past, present and future, respectively, so that it looks to the experiencing subject as if time were permanently flowing off.\n\nOne of the main themes of transcendental phenomenology is intersubjectivity. Among other things, it is discussed in considerable detail in the 5th of the Cartesian Meditations and in the manuscripts published in vol. XIII-XV of Husserliana. (A particularly important critique of Husserl's view on intersubjectivity from a sociological viewpoint is found in Sch\u00fctz 1966.)\n\nAccording to Husserl, intersubjective experience plays a fundamental role in our constitution of both ourselves as objectively existing subjects, other experiencing subjects, and the objective spatio-temporal world. Transcendental phenomenology attempts to reconstruct the rational structures underlying \u2014 and making possible \u2014 these constitutive achievements.\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, intersubjectivity comes in when we undergo acts of empathy. Intersubjective experience is empathic experience; it occurs in the course of our conscious attribution of intentional acts to other subjects, in the course of which we put ourselves into the other one's shoes. In order to study this kind of experience from the phenomenological attitude, we must bracket our belief in the existence of the respective target of our act-ascription qua experiencing subject and ask ourselves which of our further beliefs justify that existence-belief as well as our act-ascription. It is these further beliefs that make up the rational structure underlying our intersubjective experience. Since it takes phenomenological investigation to lay bare these beliefs, they must be first and foremost unconscious when we experience the world in the natural attitude.\n\nAmong the fundamental beliefs thus uncovered by Husserl is the belief (or expectation) that a being that looks and behaves more or less like myself, i.e., displays traits more or less familiar from my own case, will generally perceive things from an egocentric viewpoint similar to my own (\u201chere\u201d, \u201cover there\u201d, \u201cto my left\u201d, \u201cin front of me\u201d, etc.), in the sense that I would roughly look upon things the way he does if I were in his shoes and perceived them from his perspective. This belief allows me to ascribe intentional acts to others immediately or \u201cappresentatively\u201d, i.e., without having to draw an inference, say, by analogy with my own case. So the belief in question must lie quite at the bedrock of my belief-system. It forms a part of the already pregiven (and generally unreflected) intentional background, or \u201clifeworld\u201d (cf. Crisis), against which my practice of act-ascription and all constitutive achievements based upon that practice make sense in the first place, and in terms of which they get their ultimate justification.\n\nHusserl's notion of lifeworld is a difficult (and at the same time important) one. It can roughly be thought of in two different (but arguably compatible) ways: (1) in terms of belief and (2) in terms of something like socially, culturally or evolutionarily established (but nevertheless abstract) sense or meaning.\n\n(1) If we restrict ourselves to a single subject of experience, the lifeworld can be looked upon as the rational structure underlying his (or her) \"natural attitude\". That is to say: a given subject's lifeworld consists of the beliefs against which his everyday attitude towards himself, the objective world and others receive their ultimate justification. (However, in principle not even beliefs forming part of a subject's lifeworld are immune to revision. Hence, Husserl must not be regarded as an epistemological foundationalist; see F\u00f8llesdal 1988.)\n\n(2a) If we consider a single community of subjects, their common lifeworld, or \"homeworld\", can be looked upon, by first approximation, as the system of senses or meanings constituting their common language, or \"form of life\" (Wittgenstein), given that they conceive of the world and themselves in the categories provided by this language.\n\n(2b) If we consider subjects belonging to different communities, we can look upon their common lifeworld as the general framework, or \"a priori structure\", of senses or meanings that allows for the mutual translation of their respective languages (with their different associated \"homeworlds\") into one another.\n\nOne of the constitutive achievements based upon my lifeworldly determined practice of act-ascription is my self-image as a full-fledged person existing as a psycho-physical element of the objective, spatio-temporal order. This self-image can be justified by what Edith Stein, in a PhD thesis on empathy supervised by Husserl (Stein 1917), has labelled as iterated empathy, where I put myself into the other subject's shoes, i.e., (consciously) simulate him, under the aspect that he (or she) in turn puts himself into my shoes. In this way, I can figure out that in order for the other subject to be able to ascribe intentional acts to me, he has to identify me bodily, as a flesh-and-blood human being, with its egocentric viewpoint necessarily differing from his own. This brings home to me that my egocentric perspective is just one among many, and that from all foreign perspectives I appear as a physical object among others in a spatio-temporal world. So the following criterion of subject-identity at a given time applies both to myself and to others: one human living body, one experiencing subject. However, Husserl does not at all want to deny that we also ascribe experiences, even intentional ones, to non-human animals. This becomes the more difficult and problematic, though, the less bodily and behavioural similarity obtains between them and ourselves.\n\nBefore finally turning to the question of what \u201cobjectivity\u201d amounts to in this connection, let us notice that in Husserl's eyes something like empathy also forms the basis of both our practical, aesthetical and moral evaluations and of what might be called intercultural understanding, i.e., the constitution of a \u201cforeign world\u201d against the background of one's own \u201chomeworld\u201d, i.e., one's own familiar (but, again, generally unreflected) cultural heritage (cf. Husserliana, vol. XV). Husserl studied many of these phenomena in detail, and he even outlined the beginnings of a phenomenological ethics and value theory (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXVIII, XXXVII).\n\nEven the objective spatio-temporal world, which represents a significant part of our everyday lifeworld, is constituted intersubjectively, says Husserl. (The same holds true for its spatio-temporal framework, consisting of objective time and space.) How so? Husserl starts (again, from a first-person viewpoint) from a \u201csolipsistic\u201d abstraction of the notion of a spatio-temporal object which differs from that notion in that it does not presuppose that any other subject can observe such an object from his (or her) own perspective. His question is what justifies us (i.e., each of us for him- or herself) in the assumption of an objective reality consisting of such objects, given only this \u201csolipsistic\u201d conception of a spatio-temporal thing (or event) as our starting point. Once again, he draws upon empathy in this regard.\n\nRoughly, his argument goes as follows. In order for me to be able to put myself into someone else's shoes and simulate his (or her) perspective upon his surrounding spatio-temporal world, I cannot but assume that this world coincides with my own, at least to a large extent; although the aspects under which the other subject represents the world must be different, as they depend on his own egocentric viewpoint. Hence, I must presuppose that the spatio-temporal objects forming my own world exist independently of my subjective perspective and the particular experiences I perform; they must, in other words, be conceived of as part of an objective reality. This result fits in well with \u2014 in fact, it serves to explain \u2014 Husserl's view, already stressed in Ideas, that perceptual objects are \u201ctranscendent\u201d in that at any given moment they display an inexhaustive number of unperceived (and largely even unexpected) features, only some of which will become manifest \u2014 will be intuitively presented \u2014 in the further course of observation.\n\nHowever, according to Husserl this does not mean that the objective world thus constituted in intersubjective experience is to be regarded as completely independent of the aspects under which we represent the world. For on his view another condition for the possibility of intersubjective experience is precisely the assumption that by and large the other subject structures the world into objects in the same style I myself do. It is for this reason that Husserl can be said to adhere to a version of both \u201crealism\u201d and \u201cidealism\u201d at the same time.\n\n[Publication dates of German originals are in brackets.]\n\nHusserl, Edmund (1950-) Husserliana: Edmund Husserl \u2014 Gesammelte Werke, The Hague/Dordrecht: Nijhoff/Kluwer.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 (1965) \u201cPhilosophy as Rigorous Science,\u201d trans. in Q.

His parents were non-orthodox Jews; Husserl himself and his wife would later convert to Protestantism. They had three children, one of whom died in World War I. In the years 1876\u201378 Husserl studied astronomy in Leipzig, where he also attended courses of lectures in mathematics, physics and philosophy. Among other things, he heard Wilhelm Wundt\u2019s lectures on philosophy. (Wundt was the originator of the first institute for experimental psychology.) Husserl\u2019s mentor was Thomas Masaryk, a former student of Brentano\u2019s, who was later to become the first president of Czechoslovakia. In 1878\u201381 Husserl continued his studies in mathematics, physics and philosophy in Berlin. His mathematics teachers there included Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass, whose scientific ethos Husserl was particularly impressed with. However, he took his PhD in mathematics in Vienna (January 1883), with a thesis on the theory of variations (Variationstheorie). After that he returned to Berlin, to become Weierstrass\u2019 assistant. When Weierstrass got seriously ill, Masaryk suggested that Husserl go back to Vienna, to study philosophy with Franz Brentano, the author of Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). After a brief military service in Vienna, Husserl followed Masaryk\u2019s advice and studied with Brentano from 1884\u201386. Brentano\u2019s lectures on psychology and logic had a lasting impact on Husserl, as had his general vision of a strictly scientific philosophy. Brentano then recommended Husserl to his pupil Carl Stumpf in Halle, who is perhaps best known for his Psychology of Tone (two volumes, 1883/90). This recommendation enabled Husserl to prepare and submit his habilitation dissertation On the Concept of Number (1887) with Stumpf.\n\nThat thesis was later integrated into Husserl\u2019s first published monograph, Philosophy of Arithmetic, which appeared in 1891. In this work, Husserl combined his mathematical, psychological and philosophical competencies to attempt a psychological foundation of arithmetic (see Willard 1984, pp. 38\u2013118; Bell 1990, pp. 31\u201384). The book was, however, criticized for its underlying psychologism in a review by Gottlob Frege. It seems that Husserl took that criticism very seriously (see F\u00f8llesdal 1958), although it is far from clear that the author of Philosophy of Arithmetic regards logic as a branch of psychology, as \u201cstrong psychologism\u201d (Mohanty 1982, p. 20) has it. In any case, Husserl sharply attacked that kind of psychologism (raising about eighteen objections in total; see Soldati 1994, pp. 117 ff) and developed the philosophical method he is nowadays famous for: phenomenology.\n\nIn 1900/01 his first phenomenological work was published in two volumes, titled Logical Investigations. The first volume contains a forceful attack against psychologism, whereas the (much larger) second volume consists of six \u201cdescriptive-psychological\u201d and \u201cepistemological\u201d investigations into (I) expression and meaning, (II) universals, (III) the formal ontology of parts and wholes (mereology), (IV) the \u201csyntactical\u201d and mereological structure of meaning, (V) the nature and structure of intentionality as well as (VI) the interrelation of truth, intuition and cognition. Husserl now adheres to a version of platonism that he derived from ideas of Hermann Lotze and especially Bernard Bolzano, where he embeds platonism about meaning and mental content in a theory of intentional consciousness (see Beyer 1996).\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, Husserl considerably refined and modified his method into what he called \u201ctranscendental phenomenology\u201d. This method has us focus on the essential structures that allow the objects naively taken for granted in the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d (which is characteristic of both our everyday life and ordinary science) to \u201cconstitute themselves\u201d in consciousness. (Among those who influenced him in this regard are Descartes, Hume and Kant.) As Husserl explains in detail in his second major work, Ideas (1913), the resulting perspective on the realm of intentional consciousness is supposed to enable the phenomenologist to develop a radically unprejudiced justification of his (or her) basic views on the world and himself and explore their rational interconnections.\n\nHusserl developed these ideas in G\u00f6ttingen, where\u2014thanks to his Logical Investigations and the support by Wilhelm Dilthey, who admired that work and recommended Husserl to the Prussian ministry of culture\u2014he received an associate professorship (\u201cExtraordinariat\u201d, later turned into a \u201cPers\u00f6nliches Ordinariat\u201d) in 1901. From 1910/11 and 1913, respectively, he served as founding (co-)editor of Logos (in the first issue of which his programmatic article \u201cPhilosophy as a Rigorous Science\u201d appeared, containing a critique of naturalism) and of the Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Research (opening with his Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy). Husserl stayed in G\u00f6ttingen until 1916. It is here that he made his most important philosophical discoveries (cf. Mohanty 1995), such as the transcendental-phenomenological method, the phenomenological structure of time-consciousness, the fundamental role of the notion of intersubjectivity in our conceptual system, the horizon-structure of our singular empirical thought, and more. In later works\u2014most notably in On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time (1928), Formal and Transcendental Logic (1929), Cartesian Meditations (1931), The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1954) and Experience and Judgement (1939)\u2014these results were developed further and put into new contexts, such as the path-breaking project of linking the basic notions of science back to their conceptual roots in the pre-scientific (regions of the) \u201clifeworld\u201d (Crisis).\n\nIn the year 1916 Husserl became Heinrich Rickert\u2019s successor as full professor (\u201cOrdinarius\u201d) in Freiburg/Breisgau, where (among many other things) he worked on passive synthesis (cf. Husserliana, vol. XI, XXXI). He gave four lectures on Phenomenological Method and Phenomenological Philosophy at University College, London, in 1922 (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXV). In 1923 he received a call to Berlin, which he rejected. Husserl retired in 1928, his successor being his (and Rickert\u2019s) former assistant Martin Heidegger (whose major work Being and Time had been published in Husserl\u2019s Yearbook in 1927). In 1929 he accepted an invitation to Paris. His lectures there were published as Cartesian Meditations in 1931. In the same year, Husserl gave a number of talks on \u201cPhenomenology and Anthropology\u201d, in which he criticized his two \u201cantipodes\u201d, Heidegger and Max Scheler (cf. Husserl 1997). In 1933 Hitler took over in Germany. Husserl received a call to Los Angeles but rejected. Because of his Jewish ancestors, he became more and more humiliated and isolated. In 1935 he gave a series of invited lectures in Prague, resulting in his last major work, The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology.\n\nEdmund Husserl died on April 27, 1938 in Freiburg. His manuscripts (more than 40000 pages in total) were rescued by the Franciscan Herman Leo Van Breda, who brought them to Leuven (Belgium), where the first Husserl archive was founded in 1939. (Today, there are further archives in Freiburg, Cologne, Paris, New York and Pittsburgh.) Since 1950 the Husserl archives are editing Husserl\u2019s collected works, Husserliana.\n\nAs a philosopher with a mathematical background, Husserl was interested in developing a general theory of inferential systems, which (following Bolzano) he conceived of as a theory of science, on the ground that every science (including mathematics) can be looked upon as a system of propositions that are interconnected by a set of inferential and grounding relations. Following John S. Mill, he argues in Logical Investigations that the best way to study the nature of such propositional systems is to start with their linguistic manifestations, i.e., (sets of) sentences and (assertive) utterances thereof.\n\nHow are we to analyse these sentences and the propositions they express? Husserl\u2019s approach is to study the units of consciousness that the respective speaker presents himself as having\u2014that he \u201cgives voice to\u201d\u2014in expressing the proposition in question (for instance, while writing a mathematical textbook or giving a lecture). These units of consciousness he labels intentional acts or intentional experiences, since they always represent something as something\u2014thus exhibiting what Brentano called intentionality. According to Husserl, there are non-intentional units of consciousness as well. (He quotes pain as an example.) What distinguishes intentional from non-intentional experiences is the former\u2019s having intentional content.\n\nEven objectless (i.e., empty) intentional experiences like your thought of the winged horse Pegasus have content. On Husserl\u2019s view, that thought simply lacks a corresponding object; the intentional act is \u201cmerely as of\u201d, but not really of, an object. Husserl rejects \u201crepresentationalist\u201d accounts of intentionality, such as the mental image theory, according to which intentional experiences represent intra-mental pictorial representations of objects, where like other pictures such images may exist without there being a depicted object in the actual world. For Husserl, this view leads to a \u201cfalse duplication\u201d of objects represented in the veridical case; and it already presupposes what an adequate conception of pictorial representation is yet to accomplish: an explanation of what it is that makes the underlying \u201cphantasy content\u201d, or phantasm, \u201cthe [r]epresenting image of something or other\u201d (Husserl 1994, p. 347; Husserliana, vol. XXII, pp. 305f). It is precisely an intentional content that does the trick here (as in all cases of intentional consciousness), according to Husserl, in a way to be explained in more detail by his phenomenology of consciousness.\n\nIn the case of propositional acts, i.e., units of consciousness that can be given voice to by a complete sentence (paradigmatically, a declarative sentence), Husserl identifies their content with the propositional meaning expressed by that sentence. In the case of their non-propositional but still intentional parts, he identifies the corresponding intentional content with a sub-propositional meaning. For example, the judgement \u201cNapoleon is a Frenchman\u201d contains an act of thinking of Napoleon whose intentional content is the sub-propositional meaning expressed by the name \u201cNapoleon\u201d. (Accordingly, the judgement can be looked upon as an act of ascribing the property of being French to the referent of that name.) Experiences like this, which can be given voice to by either a singular or a general term, are called \u201cnominal acts\u201d (as opposed to the propositional acts containing them). Their contents are called \u201cnominal meanings\u201d.\n\nHusserl regards both propositional and nominal meanings as the subject-matter of \u201cpure logic\u201d or \u201clogic in the wide sense\u201d\u2014the study of (i) what distinguishes sense (alias meaning) from nonsense (this part of pure logic being called \u201cpure grammar\u201d) and (ii) which of the senses delivered by pure grammar are logically consistent and which of them are not (this part of pure logic being labelled \u201clogic in the narrow sense\u201d).\n\nAn important and still largely unexplored claim of Husserl\u2019s is that any logically consistent meaning can in principle be subjectively fulfilled, more or less adequately, by a unified intuition, such as an act of continuous perception or intuitive imagination, where the structure and other essential features of the meaning in question can be read off from the respective mode of intuitive fulfillment. Inconsistent meanings can be singled out and studied by means of (reflection upon) corresponding experiences of intuitive conflict, like for instance the discrete switching back and forth between a duck-head-imagination and a rabbit-head-imagination in the case of an attempted intuitive imagination of a duck-head that is at the same time a rabbit-head. Some meanings are inconsistent for formal-logical reasons. According to Husserl, all analytically false propositions belong to this category. Other meanings are inconsistent because they conflict with some general material a priori truth, also called \u201cessential law\u201d. The proposition expressed by the sentence \u201cThere are perceptual objects whose surface is both (visibly) completely green and completely red at the same time\u201d is a case in point.\n\nMeanings generally and propositions in particular exist independently of their actually functioning as intentional content. Thus, true propositions such as the Pythagorean theorem can be discovered. Propositions and their components are abstract, i.e., atemporal, objects. However, what does it mean to grasp a proposition or, more generally, a sense? How can an abstract object become the content of an intentional act? Combining ideas of Bolzano and Lotze, Husserl answers this question by taking recourse to the notion of an ideal (i.e., abstract) species or type, as follows. Propositions and other meanings are ideal species that can be (but do not have to be) instantiated by certain particular features, i.e., dependent parts, of intentional acts. Those species are also called \u201cideal matters\u201d. The particular features instantiating an ideal matter\u2014Husserl refers to them as \u201cmoments of matter\u201d\u2014are laid bare by phenomenological description, a reflection-based (or introspective) analysis taking into account both the linguistic expression(s) (if any) and the modes of (possible) intuitive fulfillment or conflict associated with the respective experience.\n\nSince phenomenological description yields ideal species, it involves what Husserl was later (notably in Ideas) to call \u201ceidetic reduction\u201d, i.e., an unfolding of abstract features shared by appropriate sets of fictitious or real-life examples, by way, e.g., of free imaginative variation on an arbitrarily chosen initial example (for the method of \u201cfree variation\u201d, see Experience and Judgement, sec. 87).\n\nPhenomenological description also yields the \u201cmoment of quality\u201d of the intentional experience under investigation, i.e., the particular feature instantiating its psychological mode (judgement, conscious deliberation, conscious desire, conscious hope, etc.), which roughly corresponds to the speech act mode of an utterance giving voice to that experience. Furthermore, the description yields relations of \u201cfoundation\u201d, i.e., one-sided or mutual relative existential dependencies between (1) the experience in question and other experiences and (2) the particular descriptive features of the experience. Thus, an experience of pleasure about a given event is one-sidedly founded, relative to the stream of consciousness it belongs to, in a particular belief-state to the effect that this event has occurred. (The relativization to a particular stream of consciousness makes sure that both founded and founding experience occur in the same person\u2019s mind.) Like all foundation relations, this one holds in virtue of an essential law, to the effect that conscious pleasure about some state of affairs requires a corresponding (and simultaneous) belief. Quite generally, a given object a of type F is founded in a particular object b of type G (where a is different from b and F is different from G) relative to a particular whole c of type H if and only if (i) there is an essential law in virtue of which it holds that for any object x of type F there is an object y of type G and a whole z of type H, such that both x and y are (proper) parts of z, and (ii) both a and b are (proper) parts of c. Of course, the notion of an essential law needs further clarification (see De Santis 2021, pt. III ff).\n\nHowever, as Husserl was well aware, the species-theory of content faces at least one serious objection. This objection concerns utterances that are \u201cessentially occasional\u201d, i.e., systematically context-sensitive, expressions like \u201cI am here now\u201d and the \u2018indexical\u2019 experiences they give voice to. If the intentional content of an indexical experience is to serve as a (sub-)propositional content, it must uniquely determine the object (if any) that the respective experience refers to. That is to say: if two indexical experiences display the same intentional content, they must refer to the same object (if any). It seems, though, that the moments of matter of two such experiences can instantiate the same ideal matter\u2014the same type of (particular) content\u2014whilst representing different objects. If you and I both think \u201cI am here\u201d, our respective thoughts share the same type of content, or so it would seem, but they represent different states of affairs. In order to accommodate this observation, Husserl draws a distinction between, on the one hand, the \u201cgeneral meaning function\u201d of an utterance (which corresponds to what David Kaplan calls \u201ccharacter\u201d, roughly: the linguistic meaning of the expression used) and, on the other hand, the \u201crespective meaning\u201d (i.e., the propositional or sub-propositional content expressed in the relevant context of utterance). However, it is doubtful whether this distinction really helps Husserl overcome the difficulty the phenomenon of context-sensitivity poses for his species-theory of content. If intentional contents are ideal matters in the sense of types of particular matters, and if this kind of type may remain constant while the intentional object and hence the (sub-)propositional content differs, then surely intentional contents thus conceived cannot always function as (sub-)propositional contents, as Husserl\u2019s theory would have it. Rather, there must be another intentional content involved, namely the \u201crespective meaning\u201d, which serves as the (sub-)propositional content of the indexical experience. And this content does not appear to be an ideal species. (It may be argued, however, that even (sub-)propositional contents of indexical utterances can be instantiated multiply in thought and speech, thus qualifying as ideal species after all. But the crucial question is whether this holds true in complete generality: consider the above example \u201cI am here now\u201d.)\n\nHowever that may be, Husserl construes (sub-)propositional contents (\u201crespective meanings\u201d) as two-factored, with the general meaning function plus the relevant context of utterance (if any) determining the content in question. And at least in the case of indexical experiences he seems to identify their intentional contents with these two-factored contents, for he holds that intentional content, which is referred to as \u201cnoematic sense\u201d or \u201cnoematic nucleus\u201d in Ideas, uniquely determines reference, i.e., intentional object. (For the claim that noematic sense is contextually determined respective meaning rather than general meaning function\u2014which rules out any internalist reading; see Section 4 below\u2014cf. Husserliana, vol. XX/1, pp. 74\u201378; see also Husserliana, vol. XXVI, p. 212, fn.) Some scholars even go as far as to claim that Husserl defines the noematic sense as \u201ca certain person, object, event, state of affairs which presents itself, taken exactly as it present itself or as it is intended\u201d (Gurwitsch 1982, pp. 61 f.; cp. Sokolowski 1987 and Drummond 1992; for a much-discussed critique of Gurwitsch\u2019s interpretation see F\u00f8llesdal 1969). The notion of an intentional object \u201cas it is intended\u201d is already introduced in LI. It is argued (in LI V, sec. 20) that the object (e.g. the situation of affairs) as it is intended is to be distinguished from the (sub-)propositional content, on the grounds that, for instance, the state of affairs judged (the situation of affairs as it is categorically formed in the judgment) exists iff it obtains (so that the judgment is true), whilst the propositional content judged exists even if it is false (cf. Husserliana, vol. XIX/1, 427).\n\nHusserl sees quite clearly that indexical experiences (just as experiences given voice to by means of genuine proper names) are characterized, among other things, by their singularity: they represent a particular object, or set of objects, x, such that x is to be regarded as the intentional object of the respective experience in all relevant possible worlds (i.e., in all actual or counterfactual circumstances relative to which we are determining the object represented by that experience). Thus, for instance, in sec. 47 of Ideas, he describes what an experiencing subject, at a given time, in the light of his (or her) current indexical experiences, considers to be \u201cthe actual world\u201d as a \u201cspecial case\u201d of a whole manifold of \u201cpossible worlds\u201d each of which corresponds to a possible future course of experience (possible, that is, relative to the indexical experience in question). These (actual or potential) future experiences can be said to be (more or less) anticipated by the experiencing subject at the respective time, and they constitute what Husserl calls the \u201cintentional horizon\u201d of the indexical experience in the light of whose intentional content they are anticipated (cf. Smith and McIntyre 1982). For example, if you see something as a table, you will expect it to appear to you in certain ways if you go around and observe it.\n\nWhat binds together the intentional horizon of a given indexical experience? According to Husserl, all of the (actual or potential) experiences constituting that horizon share a sense of identity through time, which sense he labels as the determinable X they belong to. As a first approximation, two experiences of a given subject belong to the same determinable X if and only if the subject believes them to represent the same object. (For a related criterion of intersubjective identity of determinable X, see Beyer 2000, sec. 7.) Hence, experiences belonging to a determinable X must be accompanied by at least one higher-order belief. This view fits in well with the thesis (shared, at least in part, by so-called dispositional higher-order belief theories of consciousness) that intentional experiences automatically give rise to (i.e., motivate) momentary dispositions to make corresponding reflective higher-order judgements, based on something like inner perception, thus constituting a form of implicit or \u201cpre-reflective self-consciousness\u201d (to use Sartre\u2019s term).\n\nIt is controversial whether such a dispositional higher-order view may be ascribed to Husserl (see Zahavi 2015, sec. 1; for a reply see Beyer 2018, sec. 1). It should be uncontroversial that on his view the motivational basis of the relevant higher-order dispositional beliefs must already display the essential feature of consciousness independently of occurrent higher-order thought in order to be available for such thought in the first place (see Beyer 2011, p. 44). This becomes clear on a close study of Husserl\u2019s work on \u201cinner time-consciousness\u201d (see the entry on phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness; also see Section 6 below). However, there is ample textual evidence showing that he regards the availability to inner perception (in the sense of a \u201creal possibility\u201d or \u201cpractical ability\u201d; see Section 8 below) and to accordingly motivated reflective higher-order judgements (in which a hitherto \u201clatent Ego\u201d becomes \u201cpatent\u201d) as an essential feature of consciousness, constituting its \u201cmode of being\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. III/1, p. 77, l. 27\u201335; p. 95, l. 36\u201338; Husserliana, vol. VIII, p. 90).\n\nThe determinable X a given indexical experience belongs to, with respect to certain other experiences, helps us answer the question of what determines the reference of that experience, if not its ideal meaning species alone. In order to take the role played by the determinable X into account properly, we have to employ a Husserlian research strategy that could be called the dynamic method. That is to say, we have to look upon intentional acts as momentary components of certain transtemporal cognitive structures\u2014dynamic intentional structures\u2014in which one and the same object or state of affairs is represented throughout a period of time during which the subject\u2019s cognitive perspective upon that object or state of affairs is constantly changing (see, e.g., Ideas, sec. 86). (Typical examples of dynamic intentional structures include continuous observations\u2014which represent Husserl\u2019s standard example\u2014as well as those totalities of successive judgements, or momentary belief-states, that actualize one and the same continuous belief. For instance, my judgement that yesterday was Thursday actualizes the same belief as the judgement I could have given voice to yesterday by \u201cToday is Thursday\u201d.) Consequently, the determinable X is apt to lead us back through time towards the original situation where the reference of the relevant unified series of successive intentional horizons was fixed, like for instance the occasion of the subject\u2019s first perceptual encounter with a particular object: the corresponding perceptual experience will belong to the same determinable X as all of the (remaining) experiences belonging to the relevant series. In a more recent terminology, one may say that in this perceptual situation the subject has opened a mental file about a particular object (cf. Perry 1980).\n\nIn a research manuscript from 1913 Husserl refers to mental files associated with proper names as \u201cindividual notions (Eigenbegriffe)\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XX/2, p. 358), characterizing them as being infinitely \u201copen\u201d and \u201cin flux\u201d (cf. ibid., p. 359). Now it is the \u201creferent\u201d of the relevant mental file, or individual notion, that will normally count as the common intentional object of the experiences bound together in a unified series of successive intentional horizons in which the object \u201cconstitutes itself\u201d empirically. (In cases where the \u201creferent\u201d of a mental file changes across time\u2014i.e., is unnoticedly replaced by another object\u2014the situation becomes more complicated. The same goes for cases of perceptual judgements leading to, or taken by the respective subject to be confirming, entries into an already existing file. See Beyer 2000, sec. 7.) Note that \u201cconstitution\u201d so conceived does not mean creation.\n\nOn this reading of Husserl\u2019s notion of the determinable X, there is a link, at least in the case of proper names and in the ubiqituous indexical case, between intentional content (including determinable X) on the one hand, and extra-mental reality on the other, such that intentional content thus understood determines reference in much the same way more recent externalist theories of content would have it, i.e. in such a way that the referent can in turn be said to help determine the intentional content (see Beyer 2000, 2001; cf. also Husserl\u2019s discussion of Twin Earth in Husserliana, vol. XXVI, p. 212). Notice, however, that Husserl does not naively take the existence of an extra-mental referent for granted. Instead, he asks which structures of consciousness entitle us to represent the world as containing particular objects transcending what is currently given to us in experience (see Sections 7 and 8 below).\n\nHusserl can thus be read (or at least be rationally reconstructed) as both an early direct reference theorist (headword: singularity) and a non-naive externalist about intentional content and (respective) meaning.\n\nThe dynamic method has us look upon noematic Sinn under the \u201cfunctional aspect\u201d of how it enables us to keep the intentional object \u201cin mind (im Sinn)\u201d (Husserliana, vol. II/1, pp. 196 ff), instead of viewing it merely statically as a psychological type or species to be instantiated by isolated moments of consciousness. It makes us regard any content of the latter sort, particularly \u201cstatic perceptual content\u201d, as a mere \u201cabstraction from dynamic content\u201d (Mulligan 1995, pp. 195, 197). This may help to explain why the species-theory of content had become less important to Husserl by the time he wrote Ideas.\n\nAn externalist reading (or rational reconstruction) of Husserl\u2019s theory of content might, however, be taken to conflict with the methodological constraints posed by the phenomenological epoch\u00e9, which\u2014together with the dynamic method and eidetic reduction\u2014builds the essential core of the transcendental-phenomenological method introduced in Ideas.\n\nHusserl developed the method of epoch\u00e9 or \u201cbracketing\u201d around 1906. It may be regarded as a radicalization of the methodological constraint, already to be found in Logical Investigations, that any phenomenological description proper is to be performed from a first person point of view, so as to ensure that the respective item is described exactly as is experienced, or intended, by the subject. Now from a first-person point of view, one cannot, of course, decide whether in a case of what one takes to be, say, an act of perception one is currently performing, there actually is an object that one is perceptually confronted with. For instance, it is well possible that one is hallucinating. From a first-person point of view, there is no difference to be made out between the veridical and the non-veridical case\u2014for the simple reason that one cannot at the same time fall victim to and detect a perceptual error or misrepresentation. In the non-veridical case, too, a transcendent object appears to \u201cconstitute itself\u201d in consciousness. It is for such reasons that Husserl demanded (in Ideas) that in a phenomenological description proper the existence of the object(s) (if any) satisfying the content of the intentional act described must be \u201cbracketed\u201d. That is to say, the phenomenological description of a given act and, in particular, the phenomenological specification of its intentional content, must not rely upon the correctness of any existence assumption concerning the object(s) (if any) the respective act is about. Thus, the epoch\u00e9 has us focus on those aspects of our intentional acts and their contents that do not depend on the existence of a represented object out there in the extra-mental world.\n\nOn closer inspection, however, Husserl actually draws upon two different versions of the epoch\u00e9 when introducing this method in Ideas, which versions he does not separate as clearly as one might have hoped: the \u201cuniversal epoch\u00e9\u201d on the one hand, and a weaker \u201clocal epoch\u00e9\u201d (as one could label it) on the other. The former version (as described in Ideas) seems to require the phenomenologist to put all his existence assumptions regarding the external world into brackets at once, at any point, whereas the weaker version merely requires him to bracket particular existence assumptions. The weaker version underlies the introducing of the notion of noema in Ideas in connection with examples like the perceptual hallucination (a concept not applicable within the universal epoch\u00e9; see Overgaard 2004, p. 23) of a blooming apple tree (Husserliana, vol. III/1, pp. 204 ff): Husserl here in fact only brackets the existence of particular real objects (Beyer 2000, pp. 140\u2013148). By contrast, the sole function of the universal epoch\u00e9 in Ideas seems to be to establish the \u201cresiduum\u201d thesis, according to which the realm of \u201cpure consciousness\u201d exists independently of the external world. His argument for this thesis in Ideas, referring to the possibility of \u201cworld annihilation\u201d, is flawed, however (see Beyer 2000, pp. 138 ff; 2007, pp. 76ff) and, as Erhard (2014, fn. 718) has observed, Husserl later discovered the relevant fallacy himself (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXIX, 256f).\n\nThis leaves it an open question what other function the epoch\u00e9 may serve in the context of Husserl\u2019s methodology. The most plausible interpretation seems to be that \u201cthe only thing that is excluded as a result of the epoch\u00e9 is a certain naivety, the naivety of simply taking the world for granted, thereby ignoring the contribution of consciousness (Husserliana, vol. 27/173)\u201d (Zahavi 2017, p. 67; also cf. Landgrebe 1982a, pp. 26 ff), where \u201cthe suspension [of existential positings] in question is merely propaedeutic and provisional\u201d (Zahavi 2017, p. 58).\n\nOnly the method of universal epoch\u00e9 as introduced in Ideas seems to conflict with our externalist reading: if no extra-mental existence assumptions whatsoever are admitted at any point, then phenomenologically there cannot be object-dependent intentional contents, as externalism would have it. By contrast, there may be some such contents, even many of them, without intentional content generally having to be dependent on a particular extra-mental object. Which leaves enough room for the method of epoch\u00e9 to apply to any given particular case, as will become clear in Section 6.\n\nThe point of the local epoch\u00e9 can perhaps best be brought out if we follow Husserl in applying it to the case of perceptual experience. The phenomenologist is supposed to perform his or her descriptions from a first-person point of view, so as to ensure that the respective item is described exactly as it is experienced. Now in the case of perceptual experience one cannot, of course, both fall victim to and at the same time discover a particular perceptual error; it is always possible that one is subject to an illusion or even a hallucination, so that one\u2019s perceptual experience is not veridical. If one is hallucinating, there is really no object of perception. However, phenomenologically the experience one undergoes is exactly the same as if one were successfully perceiving an external object.\n\nTherefore, the (adequacy of a) phenomenological description of a perceptual experience should be independent of whether for the experience under investigation there is an object it represents or not. Either way, there will at least be a perceptual content (if not the same content on both sides, though). It is this content that Husserl calls the perceptual noema. Thanks to its noema, even a hallucination is an intentional act, an experience \u201cas of\u201d an object. Phenomenological description is concerned with those aspects of the noema that remain the same irrespective of whether the experience in question is veridical or not. Thus, our phenomenologist must not employ\u2014he (or she) must \u201cbracket\u201d\u2014his belief in the existence of the perceptual object.\n\nHowever, this lands him in a methodological dilemma. If, on the one hand, the phenomenologist leaves the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d and brackets his corresponding existence-belief, he cannot at the same time perform the perceptual experience he wishes to investigate. (This is the first horn of the dilemma.) For, as Husserl himself stresses (cf. Ideas, sec. 90, 109), the existence-belief is an indispensable part of the perceptual phenomenon: such experiences are essentially thetic, i.e., there can be no such thing as a perceptual experience without \u201cbelief-character\u201d (cf. 5th Logical Investigation, sec. 23). If, on the other hand, our phenomenologist makes use of that belief, then he is bound to violate the constraints put upon him by the local epoch\u00e9: he cannot but fail to assume the phenomenological attitude. (This is the second horn.)\n\nThere are at least three possible ways out of this dilemma. First, the phenomenologist could choose the first horn of the dilemma, but analyse an earlier perceptual experience of his, one that he now remembers. He just has to make sure here not to employ his earlier (and perhaps still persisting) belief in the existence of a perceptual object. Secondly, he could again decide in favour of the first horn and analyse a perceptual experience that he merely intuitively imagines himself to have. (For Husserl\u2019s view on imagination see esp. Husserliana, vol. XXIII.) Thirdly, he could instead choose the second horn, keep employing his existence-belief, but make a kind of \u201cpragmatic ascent\u201d and describe the perceptual experience in such a way that the description, i.e., the speech act thus performed, does not presuppose the existence of a perceptual object. (The following sort of description may serve that function: \u201cI am demonstratively identifying a so-and-so\u201d; \u201cI am performing an act of this-meaning under the aspect so-and-so\u201d.) In any case, Husserl regards \u201cbracketing\u201d as what he calls the \u201cneutrality modification\u201d of a positing act, to be distinguished both from a corresponding supposition (hypothesis) and from what is commonly referred to as suspension of judgment, as in a case of serious doubt (cf. Hua III/1, 247 ff). While in the latter case the subjective probability may be 0.5, no degree of belief whatsoever can be assigned to an act of neutrality-modification (cf. Hua III/1, 252).\n\nIt is not entirely clear if Husserl considers all of these strategies to be admissible. The second one is certainly in line with the important methodological role he ascribes to \u201cphantasy\u201d, i.e., mere intuitive imagination, when it comes to eidetic reduction, which in turn constitutes an important part of the phenomenological method. The third strategy\u2014pragmatic ascent\u2014fits in well with the way he uses to specify the common element of the noema of both veridical perceptions and corresponding hallucinations (see, e.g., the first-person description of someone\u2019s experience of \u201cthis blooming tree there in space\u201d presented in sec. 90 of Ideas; also see ibid., sec. 89f).\n\nNow we can apply the local epoch\u00e9 to specify the noema of both veridical perceptions and hallucinations so as to bring out their singularity. Already in his 1894 essay \u201cIntentional Objects\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXII; English translation of a somewhat different version of the essay in: Rollinger 1999) Husserl stressed that objectless representations such as hallucinations can in a sense be characterized as \u201crepresenting an intentional object\u201d, provided that this characterization is understood to be made \u201cunder an existential assumption\u201d, as follows: \u201cIf the act of hallucination were veridical, it would successfully represent such-and-such an object (under such-and-such aspects)\u201d. Something similar goes with regard to the singularity of a hallucinatory experience\u2019s noema: if such an experience were veridical, it would, in virtue of its noema, represent a particular perceptual object in all relevant possible worlds (see Section 3 above). Thus, we can provide an existentially neutral specification of the noema of a (veridical, illusory or hallucinatory) perceptual experience, just as local epoch\u00e9 demands, and still bring out the singular character of their content that Husserl has done so much to uncover, especially in his investigations into indexicality and the role of the determinable X in our constitution of spatio-temporal reality. The specification might run as follows: The noema of a perceptual experience i is such that either (1) there is an object x that i represents in virtue of its noema, where x is to be regarded as the referent of i in all relevant possible worlds, or (2) there would be an object meeting condition (1) if i were veridical. Condition (2) enables us to make sense of the behaviour of a speaker/thinker making counterfactual assumptions about an object which he, unknowingly, merely hallucinates, or of quantifying into modal statements about that alleged object (cf. Beyer 2000, pp. 26\u201331). Notice that on the above-proposed externalist reading of Husserl\u2019s notion of intentional content, the noema will differ depending on whether condition (1) or (2) is satisfied. Nevertheless, our noematic specification meets the requirements of local epoch\u00e9, as it does not rely on the existence of a particular perceptual object. If there is no such object, condition (2) will be satisfied\u2014provided that we are dealing with a perceptual experience. The rationale behind condition (2) is that even in the non-veridical case an individual notion (a mental file) and consequently a unified series of intentional horizons gets activated, on the basis of the same sensory material, or h\u00fdle (see the following paragraph), as in the veridical case.\n\nIt should be noted that according to Husserl the complete noema of a perceptual experience contains an additional element, to be distinguished from the intentional content, notably its \u201cthetic\u201d or \u201cpositing\u201d character, i.e., its quality. Moreover, the manner in which the perceptual object (if any) presents (or would present) itself includes the sensual matter or \u201ch\u00fdle\u201d underlying the respective perceptual experience. Typical examples of h\u00fdle include sense impressions (i.e., sensory experiences), as opposed to the perceptual experiences based upon them. Thus, to take Jastrow\u2019s/Wittgenstein\u2019s duck-rabbit head as an example, the perception of a duck-head may be founded in the same sense impressions or h\u00fdle as the perception of a rabbit-head (cf. F\u00f8llesdal 1988, pp. 108f). (For Husserl all remaining intuitive acts involve something analogous (in a sense needing further explanation) to h\u00fdle, which he labels as their \u201cintuitive representational content\u201d. In the case of acts of phantasy, he refers to the intuitive representational content as \u201cphantasma\u201d.) Husserl regards sense impressions as non-intentional (and thus non-conceptual) in nature. It is only the intentional content of a perceptual experience that \u201cforms\u201d its underlying h\u00fdle so as to yield the perception of an object (for critical discussion see Hopp 2011, esp. sec. 7.3). Husserl compares this process of intentional \u201cforming\u201d of sensual matter to the interpretation of a linguistic expression, but this comparison should not mislead us to conclude that he subscribes to a sense-datum theory of perception (see Section 2 above, headword: mental image theory). Rather, his view on perception is best characterized as a sophisticated version of direct (i.e., non-representationalist) realism.\n\nFinally, we should note that on Husserl\u2019s view there is a further important dimension to perceptual experience, in that it displays a phenomenological deep- or micro-structure constituted by time-consciousness (Husserliana, vol. X, XXXIII; also see Miller 1984). This merely seemingly unconscious structure is essentially indexical in character and consists, at a given time, of both retentions, i.e., acts of immediate memory of what has been perceived \u201cjust a moment ago\u201d, original impressions, i.e., acts of awareness of what is perceived \u201cright now\u201d, and protentions, i.e., immediate anticipations of what will be perceived \u201cin a moment\u201d. It is by such momentary structures of retentions, original impressions and protentions that moments of time are continuously constituted (and reconstituted) as past, present and future, respectively, so that it looks to the experiencing subject as if time were permanently flowing off.\n\nThis deep-structure of intentional consciousness comes to light in the course of what Husserl calls the \u201cphenomenological reduction\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XIII, pp. 432 ff), which uses the method of epoch\u00e9 in order to make coherent sense, in terms of the essential horizon-structure of consciousness, of the transcendence of objective reality. The most global form of epoch\u00e9 is employed when this reality in total is bracketed. There is still something left at this point, though, which must not, and cannot, be bracketed: the temporal flow of one\u2019s \u201cpresent\u201d experience, constituted by current retentions and original impressions. These recurrent temporal features of the horizon-structure of consciousness cannot be meaningfully doubted. They provide a kind of h\u00fdle for \u201cinner perception\u201d and corresponding reflective judgements, but it is a very special kind of h\u00fdle: one that is a proper part of the \u201cperceived\u201d item and does not get conceptually \u201cformed\u201d in the course of perception (reflecting the fact that unlike spatio-temporal objects, lived experiences \u201cdo not adumbrate themselves\u201d; cf. Husserliana, vol. III/1, p. 88). Hence, there is no epistemically problematic gap between experience and object in this case, which therefore provides an adequate starting point for the phenomenological reduction, that may now proceed further by using holistic justification strategies. After all, intentional consciousness has now been shown to be coherently structured at its phenomenologically deepest level.\n\n7. Passivity vs. activity\n\nHyletic data are arguably experiences, in the sense of \u201cnon-intentional\u201d, \u201cpre-reflective lived experiences that can be grasped only abstractly in reflection\u201d (Gallagher 2011, p. 3). At the same time, at least some of them (the \u201ckinaesthetic\u201d sensations; cf. Zahavi 2003, p. 107) belong to the sphere of bodily passivity: they \u201cserve in the constitution of the experiencing body (the body-as-subject)\u201d (Gallagher 2011, p. 4; for the distinction between \u201cbody-as-subject\u201d and \u201cbody-as-object\u201d, cf. Zahavi 2003, pp. 101\u2013106). The notion of passivity is given particular emphasis both in the context of Husserl\u2019s genetic-phenomenological analyses, focussing on the dynamic aspects of self- and object-constitution, and in his reply to the \u201cobjection of solipsism\u201d against transcendental phenomenology developed in the 5th of his Cartesian Meditations (see Section 10 below). In Experience and Judgement Husserl stresses \u201cthat the distinction between activity and passivity is not a rigid one, that it cannot be a matter of terms that can be defined once and for all, but only of means of description and contrast, the meaning of which must originally be recreated in each individual case with regard to the concrete situation of the analysis\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 119). On a plausible (i.e., epistemological) interpretation, a unit of consciousness in which something constitutes itself is to be described as \u201cpassive\u201d just in case this constitution occurs independently of any simultaneous execution of the subject\u2019s will, e.g., its will to acquire knowledge; otherwise, it is to be described as \u201cactive\u201d. Passive constitution is sometimes referred to as \u201cpre-constitution\u201d, as it is an indispensible precondition for active constitution (cf. Landgrebe 1982b, p. 72.) According to the above interpretation, active constitution in the form of judgements in turn initiates beliefs as personal \u201cacquisitions (Erwerbe)\u201d or \u201chabitualities\u201d that help pre-constitute the further course of experience, thus forming a \u201csecondary\u201d level of passivity (cf. ibid.; for an overview of Husserl\u2019s \u201cphenomenology of habituality\u201d cf. Moran 2011; Caminada 2019 investigates into Husserl\u2019s view of habit against the background of the re-edition of Ideas II on the basis of his original texts; see esp. ch. 10f).\n\nIn the context of the analysis of the constitution of individual perceptual objects, the spatio-temporally structured \u201cfield of pre-givenness\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 74) against whose background the object stands out contrastively (ready to catch the perceiver\u2019s attention) counts as primarily passive (cf. Wu 2021, sec. 58). This field is structured by \u201csyntheses of association\u201d between (hyletic adumbrations of) similar and dissimilar elements (cf. Wu 2020, p. 189). These associative syntheses are such that (in the case at issue) one of those elements, e.g. a colored three-dimensional (and thus non-hyletic; cf. Lee 1993, p. 99) dot, serves as sensual \u201cstimulus\u201d by \u201cinstinctively driving\u201d (Husserliana Mat., vol. VIII, p. 326) the perceiver to attend to it unwillingly, thus passively \u201caffecting\u201d the perceiver (Husserliana, vol. XXXIII, pp. 275f; cf. Yamaguchi 1982; Lee 1993; also cf. Mensch 1997; and Brudzinska 2020, containing a detailed comparison with Freud). If the stimulus then catches the subject\u2019s attention, it can subsequently be \u201cexplicated\u201d perceptually according to its objectual determinations, in which case the subject enters \u201cthe first main stage of the striving for knowledge, i.e. the pre-predicative or receptive stage\u201d (Wu 2021, p. 190). Thus, passivity precedes receptivity, which in turn precedes the second main stage, i.e. the \u201cpredicative\u201d stage \u2013 the level of the \u201cspontaneity\u201d of judgement (cf. Wu 2021, p. 191). Both of these stages (the receptive and the spontaneous one) constitute the level of cognitive \u201cactivity\u201d. At the second stage, the processing of mental files such as \u201cindividual notions\u201d (see Section 4 above), guided by the subject\u2019s \u201cwill to knowledge\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 92), is located. In Experience and Judgement Husserl calls the perceptual acts motivating predicative file entries (i.e., habitual yet variable empirical beliefs) \u201cexplications\u201d of perceptual objects (cf. Husserl 1939, ch. 2). Such explications are founded in \u201cattention as a tendency of the ego\u201d \u201ctoward the intentional object\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 85). (For the multifarious use of the term \u201cattention\u201d in Husserl cf. the introduction to Husserliana, vol. XXXVIII, p. XXXII; see also the entry on \u201cAufmerksamkeit\u201d in Gander 2010, pp. 36ff, and the secondary literature cited there, as well as Breyer 2011, ch. V, and Wehrle 2013, ch. I.)\n\nNote that while Husserl sometimes describes the field of pre-givenness in which pre-predicative and predicative acts are founded as \u201coriginarily passive\u201d (cf. Husserl 1939, p. 300), he holds that this field is itself pre-constituted at an even more basic level of constitution, also sometimes (in another context) described as originarily or primarily passive. This more basic level is the \u201cabsolutely\u201d originary one of (1) bodily and (2) temporal pre-reflective self-consciousness, at which (1) the spatial and (2) the temporal aspects of the field, respectively, constitute themselves (cf. Wu 2021, pp. 187f). This pre-constitution occurs automatically or \u201cinstinctively\u201d, by \u201cassociation\u201d of \u201cacquired\u201d affective \u201cdrives\u201d and teleologically directed \u201ccourses of drives (Triebverl\u00e4ufe)\u201d rather than mere \u201c(courses of) ideas\u201d, such that \u201cthe ego as the subject of the drive [\u2026] is awakened\u201d (transcr. A VII 13, p. 20, cited after Yamaguchi 1982, p. 57). If the subject then acquires an according affective \u201chabituality\u201d, then a new level of \u201csecondary passivity\u201d has been constituted (cf. Yamaguchi 1982, p. 56). For example, the above-mentioned colored dot is then ready to be perceived as located, at \u2018this current moment\u2019 of (internal) time, at \u2018that position\u2019 in \u2018my own\u2019 (egocentric) perceptual field; it \u201caffects\u201d the subject accordingly, thus serving as a visual stimulus. This perceptual field is regarded as \u2018my own\u2019 and \u2018my current\u2019 one in virtue of its pre-constitution in pre-reflective self-awareness, in which both the subject\u2019s stream of consciousness and its living body (as it would appear in the \u201csphere of ownness\u201d, i.e. independently of intersubjective experience) constitute themselves, notably by both internal time-consciousness (see Sections 4 and 6 above; cf. Held 1966) and the instinctive \u201coriginary kinestheses\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XV, p. 385) or \u201ckinesthetic syntheses\u201d associated with the bodily movements involved in perception (cf. Landgrebe 1982b, pp. 81 ff; also cf. Dodd 1997 for a further analysis of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology of the body, taking into account the rich material to be found in Ideas II, but also in Thing and Space and the 5th of the Cartesian Meditations; and Taipale 2014, stressing the importance of the living body for the different levels of constitution in Husserl; more recent literature on embodiment in Husserl, covering topics like the constitution of the ego\u2019s own living body and the living bodies of others, also includes Behnke 1996; Hein\u00e4maa 2011, 2018; Moran and Janssen, eds., 2018; Carr 2019; and Jardine 2022, ch. 5f).\n\nOn (one reading of) Husserl\u2019s view, these very basic levels or strata underlying self- and world-constitution are still \u201canonymous\u201d, i.e. not available through (self-)\u201creflection\u201d (cf. Landgrebe 1982b, p. 76), but only through the \u201cgenetic-phenomenological\u201d method of \u201cdeconstruction\u201d or \u201cdismantling (Abbau)\u201d. Dismantling starts from a given noematic sense, like \u2018this coloured dot\u2019, and tells a story about how (the intentionality correlated with) this sense could have come about, to which kinds of \u201csubjective sources\u201d or origins it implicitly refers back (as their \u201csedimentation\u201d), given the transcendental conditions for the possibility of the corresponding forms of intentionality (cf. Husserl 1939, p. 47). This dismantling leads back to the associative \u201coriginary pairing\u201d of \u2018my own\u2019, originarily-kinesthetic pre-constituted living body, on the one hand, and a foreign one affecting \u2018my own\u2019, on the other, due to similarities which passively drive the \u201cfirst \u2018ego\u2019 of the reduction\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XV, p. 586) to co-constitute \u2018my own\u2019 and the \u2018other\u2019 bodily ego by accordingly motivated \u201capperceptive transfer\u201d (Husserliana, vol. I, 140) of the pre-constituted sense \u2018this living body of mine\u2019 to the similarly behaving body \u2018over there\u2019 (cf. A. D. Smith 2003, pp. 224\u2013251). This co-constitution forms the basis of, first, the co-constitution of the alter ego as a personal human being and (on this basis; cf. Husserliana, vol. XIV, p. 418) myself as the same kind of being and, secondly, the constitution objective reality. The (analysis of the) constitution of the latter is sketched in Section 10 below. Husserl supposes that its passive pre-constitution \u201c\u2018instinctively\u2019 predeliniates the constitution of the whole world for me\u201d, a teleological \u201cfacticity\u201d perhaps deriving from \u201cGod\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XV, p. 385; see Held 2010). (In other words, the spade bends back here.)\n\n8. Communication, sociality, personhood and personal values\n\nAs for the constitution of oneself as a person, Husserl (Husserliana, vol. XIV, pp. 170 ff) holds that it occurs, among other things, in connection with communicative or social acts (\u201cMitteilungen\u201d, \u201csoziale Akte\u201d), which are pre-constituted by the mutual drives and instincts involved in the education of small children who confidently \u201cimitate\u201d the linguistic behavior of educators \u201cloving\u201d them like parents (Husserliana, vol. XIV, 165f). (For additional aspects of the constitution of personhood, see the last two paragraphs of this section and the literature cited there. Further elements of Husserl\u2019s view of personal love, esp. concerning his ethics, are discussed in Melle 2002; R\u00f6mer 2011; Kern 2019, sec. 22f; Crespo 2019; Hein\u00e4maa 2020.) The relevant communicative acts are \u201cI-thou acts\u201d, in which the utterer empathetically ascribes to the addressee the empathetic ascription of the \u201cintention (Absicht)\u201d to motivate the addressee, by means of his or her recognition of that very intention (cf. Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 192), to behave a certain way (Husserliana, vol. XIV, 166f in the light of Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 192); where utterer and addressee simultaneously perceive each other (Husserliana, vol. XIV, p. 167). Thus, these acts are based on \u201creciprocal empathy\u201d (Zahavi 2018, p. 746), notably on \u201citerated, reflexive empathy: I empathetically ascribe to the Other(s) an empathetic ascription of an intention to me\u201d (Beyer 2018, p. 100). In I-thou acts, the \u201coriginarily social I-thou relationship\u201d is constituted, in which ego and alter ego deliberately and reflexively motivate each other to display certain practical forms of behavior (Husserliana, vol. XIV, pp. 171f). It is at this stage that the subject constitutes itself as a person (belonging to the \u201cworld of persons\u201d) by gaining \u201cpersonal \u2018self-consciousness\u2019\u201d of the sort just described in the course of I-thou acts (Husserliana, vol. XIV, pp. 171, 175f). This enables the subject to see him- or herself as subject to acts of self-determination: \u201cIf I agree [Vereinbare ich mich] with an other [...], the other determines me to determine myself to take on this or that [commitment; CB]\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XIV, p. 180). (For some other aspects of the role of communicative acts in Husserl\u2019s analyses of constitution see, e.g., Zahavi 2003, ch. 3, sec. C\u2013D; Caminada 2019, esp. ch. 6., sec. 2f.; also see Sections 9f below.)\n\nIt is by self-determination through \u201cposition-taking\u201d, in the form of \u201cjudgement\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d, that the subject constitutes itself as an individual person. (For the following cf. Beyer 2013, pp. 94, 110f. For a more recent analysis, also taking into account the new critical edition of Ideas II, see Jardine 2022. Also see Jacobs 2010, pp. 353\u2013356.) What distinguishes an individual personal subject from other such subjects is a \u201ctotal\u201d personal \u201cstyle and habitus\u201d, including \u201ca certain pervasive unitary style in the way [the subject] decides by judgement and will\u201d (Husserliana, vol. IV, \u00a761 p. 277; Husserl 1989, p. 290; also cf. Husserliana, vol. IV, \u00a759, p. 256). This latter style depends on the subject\u2019s habits to let itself be determined by value-motives, that is, by emotional valuings (\u201cWertnehmungen\u201d; cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVII, p. 72) and, sometimes, also by accordingly motivated explicit value judgements, which concern the subject\u2019s volitional motives, regarding which the free subject says \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. (These valuings, which motivate the subject\u2019s will, stand to passive emotional affections as full-fledged perceptual acts stand to their underlying sensual hyle; they can be looked upon as nonveridical or veridical, and, in the latter case, more or less adequate perceptions of (instances of) values; cf. Husserliana, vol. IV, sec. 44, p. 215, sec. 45, pp. 227f; Husserliana, vol. XXXVII, p. 326.)\n\nIn the former case (the subject says \u2018yes\u2019) the respective motive becomes \u201ca position-taking that issues from [the subject\u2019s] own ego\u201d, as opposed to a mere stimulus coming from outside; the subject \u201cannexes\u201d it on his or her \u201cown accord\u201d (eignet es sich selbstt\u00e4tig an), i.e. it internalizes the corresponding value (Husserliana, vol. IV, \u00a760, p. 269; Husserl 1989, p. 281). This enables the subject to get to know itself as an individual person, i.e. with regard to its \u201cpersonal character-traits\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XIV, p. 18), notably by learning \u201chow such and such motives [...] would affect me, how I, as the one that I am, would act and could act, how I could, and how I could not, judge, value and will\u201d (Husserliana, vol. IV, \u00a760, p. 265f; Husserl 1989, p. 278). Husserl\u2019s conception of individual personhood also underlies his ethics (see end of Section 9).\n\nOne of the main themes of transcendental phenomenology is intersubjectivity. Among other things, it is discussed in considerable detail in the 5th of the Cartesian Meditations and in the manuscripts published in vol. XIII\u2013XV of Husserliana (see Kern 2019 for an overview). (A particularly important critique of Husserl\u2019s view on intersubjectivity from a sociological viewpoint is found in Sch\u00fctz 1966.)\n\nAccording to Husserl, intersubjective experience plays a fundamental role in our constitution of both ourselves as objectively existing subjects, other experiencing subjects, and the objective spatio-temporal world. Transcendental phenomenology attempts to reconstruct the rational structures underlying\u2014and making possible\u2014these constitutive achievements.\n\nFrom a first-person point of view, intersubjectivity comes in when we undergo acts of empathy. Intersubjective experience is empathic experience; it occurs in the course of our conscious attribution of intentional acts to other subjects, in the course of which we put ourselves into the other one\u2019s shoes. In order to study this kind of experience from the phenomenological attitude, we must bracket our belief in the existence of the respective target of our act-ascription qua experiencing subject and ask ourselves which of our further beliefs justify that existence-belief as well as our act-ascription. It is these further beliefs that make up the rational structure underlying our intersubjective experience. Since it takes phenomenological investigation to lay bare these beliefs, they must be first and foremost unconscious when we experience the world in the natural attitude.\n\nAmong the fundamental beliefs thus uncovered by Husserl is the belief (or expectation) that a being that looks and behaves more or less like myself, i.e., displays traits more or less familiar from my own case, will generally perceive things from an egocentric viewpoint similar to my own (\u201chere\u201d, \u201cover there\u201d, \u201cto my left\u201d, \u201cin front of me\u201d, etc.), in the sense that I would roughly look upon things the way he does if I were in his shoes and perceived them from his perspective. This belief allows me to ascribe intentional acts to others immediately or \u201cappresentatively\u201d, i.e., without having to draw an inference, say, by analogy with my own case. So the belief in question must lie quite at the bedrock of my belief-system. It forms a part of the already pregiven (and generally unreflected) intentional background, or \u201clifeworld\u201d (cf. Crisis), against which my practice of act-ascription and all constitutive achievements based upon that practice make sense in the first place, and in terms of which they get their ultimate justification.\n\nHusserl\u2019s notion of lifeworld is a difficult (and at the same time important) one. It can roughly be thought of in two different (but arguably compatible) ways: (1) in terms of belief and (2) in terms of something like socially, culturally or evolutionarily established (but nevertheless abstract) sense or meaning.\n\n(1) If we restrict ourselves to a single subject of experience, the lifeworld can be looked upon as the rational structure underlying his (or her) \u201cnatural attitude\u201d. That is to say: a given subject\u2019s lifeworld consists of the beliefs against which his everyday attitude towards himself, the objective world and others receive their ultimate justification. (However, in principle not even beliefs forming part of a subject\u2019s lifeworld are immune to revision. Hence, Husserl must not be regarded as an epistemological foundationalist; see F\u00f8llesdal 1988.)\n\n(2a) If we consider a single community of subjects, their common lifeworld, or \u201chomeworld\u201d, can be looked upon, by first approximation, as the system of senses or meanings constituting their common language, or \u201cform of life\u201d (Wittgenstein), given that they conceive of the world and themselves in the categories provided by this language.\n\n(2b) If we consider subjects belonging to different communities, we can look upon their common lifeworld as the general framework, or \u201ca priori structure\u201d, of senses or meanings that allows for the mutual translation of their respective languages (with their different associated \u201chomeworlds\u201d) into one another.\n\nThe term \u201clifeworld\u201d thus denotes the way the members of one or more social groups (cultures, linguistic communities) use to structure the world into objects (Husserliana, vol. VI, pp. 126\u2013138, 140\u2013145). The respective lifeworld is claimed to \u201cpredelineate\u201d a \u201cworld-horizon\u201d of potential future experiences that are to be (more or less) expected for a given group member at a given time, under various conditions, where the resulting sequences of anticipated experiences can be looked upon as corresponding to different \u201cpossible worlds and environments\u201d (Husserliana, vol. III/1, p. 100). These expectations follow typical patterns, as the lifeworld is fixed by a system of (first and foremost implicit) intersubjective standards, or conventions, that determine what counts as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d observation under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions (Husserliana, vol. XV, pp. 135 ff, 142) and thus as a source of epistemic justification. Some of these standards are restricted to a particular culture or \u201chomeworld\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XV, pp. 141 f, 227\u2013236), whereas others determine a \u201cgeneral structure\u201d that is \u201ca priori\u201d in being \u201cunconditionally valid for all subjects\u201d, defining \u201cthat on which normal Europeans, normal Hindus, Chinese, etc., agree in spite of all relativity\u201d (Husserliana, vol. VI, p. 142). Husserl quotes universally accepted facts about \u201cspatial shape, motion, sense-quality\u201d as well as our prescientific notions of \u201cspatiotemporality\u201d, \u201cbody\u201d and \u201ccausality\u201d as examples (ibid.). These conceptions determine the general structure of all particular thing-concepts that are such that any creature sharing the essential structures of intentional consciousness will be capable of forming and grasping them, respectively, under different lifeworldly conditions.\n\nThe notion of lifeworld was already introduced in the posthumously published second volume of Ideas, under the heading of \u201cUmwelt\u201d, to be translated as \u201csurrounding world\u201d or \u201cenvironment\u201d. Husserl there characterizes the environment as a world of entities that are \u201cmeaningful\u201d to us in that they exercise \u201cmotivating\u201d force on us and present themselves to us under egocentric aspects. Any subject taking the \u201cpersonalistic attitude\u201d builds the center of an environment containing such objects. The personalistic attitude is \u201cthe attitude we are always in when we live with one another, talk to one another, shake hands with one another in greeting, or are related to one another in love and aversion, in disposition and action, in discourse and discussion\u201d (Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 183; Husserl 1989, p. 192). The central notion of Husserl\u2019s \u201cUmweltanalyse\u201d is the concept of motivation, whose application he explains as follows: \u201chow did I hit upon that, what brought me to it? That questions like these can be raised characterizes all motivation in general\u201d (Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 222; Husserl 1989, p. 234, with translation change). The entities exercising motivating force on us owe their corresponding \u201cmeaning\u201d or significance to certain forms of intentional consciousness and intersubjective processes. Thus, to quote one of Husserl\u2019s examples, \u201cI see coal as heating material; I recognize it and recognize it as useful and as used for heating, as appropriate for and as destined to produce warmth. [...] I can use [a combustible object] as fuel; it has value for me as a possible source of heat. That is, it has value for me with respect to the fact that with it I can produce the heating of a room and thereby pleasant sensations of warmth for myself and others. [...] Others also apprehend it in the same way, and it acquires an intersubjective use-value and in a social context is appreciated and is valuable as serving such and such a purpose, as useful to man, etc.\u201d (Husserliana, vol. IV, pp. 186f; Husserl 1989, pp. 196f).\n\nOn Husserl\u2019s view, it is precisely this \u201csubjective-relative lifeworld\u201d, or environment, that provides the \u201cgrounding soil\u201d of the more objective world of science (Husserliana, vol. VI, p. 134), in the twofold sense that (i) scientific conceptions owe their (sub-)propositional content and thus their reference to reality to the prescientific notions they are supposed to \u201cnaturalize\u201d and that, consequently, (ii) when things get into flux in science, when a crisis occurs, all that is left to appeal to in order to defend new scientific approaches against their rivals is the prescientific lifeworld, as manifested in our according intuitive acceptances (for references cf. F\u00f8llesdal 1990a, pp. 139f). This view offers an alternative to the \u201cnaturalistic\u201d stance taken by many analytic philosophers today.\n\nOne of the constitutive achievements based upon my lifeworldly determined practice of act-ascription is my self-image as a full-fledged person existing as a psycho-physical element of the objective, spatio-temporal order. This self-image can be justified by what Edith Stein, in a PhD thesis on empathy supervised by Husserl (Stein 1917), has labelled as iterated empathy, where I put myself into the other subject\u2019s shoes, i.e., (consciously) simulate him, under the aspect that he (or she) in turn puts himself into my shoes. In this way, I can figure out that in order for the other subject to be able to ascribe intentional acts to me, he has to identify me bodily, as a flesh-and-blood human being, with its egocentric viewpoint necessarily differing from his own. This brings home to me that my egocentric perspective is just one among many, and that from all foreign perspectives I appear as a physical object among others in a spatio-temporal world. So the following criterion of subject-identity at a given time applies both to myself and to others: one human living body, one experiencing subject. However, Husserl does not at all want to deny that we also ascribe experiences, even intentional ones, to non-human animals. This becomes the more difficult and problematic, though, the less bodily and behavioural similarity obtains between them and ourselves.\n\nBefore finally turning to the question of what \u201cobjectivity\u201d amounts to in this connection, let us notice that in Husserl\u2019s eyes something like empathy also forms the basis of both our practical, aesthetical and moral evaluations and of what might be called intercultural understanding, i.e., the constitution of a \u201cforeign world\u201d against the background of one\u2019s own \u201chomeworld\u201d, i.e., one\u2019s own familiar (but, again, generally unreflected) cultural heritage (cf. Husserliana, vol. XV). Husserl studied many of these phenomena in detail, and he even outlined the beginnings of a phenomenological ethics and value theory (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXVIII, XXXVII). In this context, he formulates a \u201ccategorical imperative\u201d that makes recourse to the notion of lifeworld, or environment, as follows: Always act in such a way that your action contributes as well as possible to the best (the most valuable) you recognize yourself to be able to achieve in your life, given your individual abilities and environment (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVII, pp. 251 ff). (This version of the \u201ccategorical imperative\u201d stems from Husserl\u2019s post-war lectures on ethics and value theory. Earlier versions differ significantly; for the development of Husserl\u2019s thought on this and related issues, see, e.g., Melle 1991; Peucker 2008; Donohoe 2016, ch. 4; Drummond 2018; and Crespo 2021.)\n\nNote that on Husserl\u2019s view the will of a free agent, capable of following this imperative, is always already embedded in a \u201cvolitional context\u201d predelineating the open \u201cfuture horizon\u201d of a \u201cfull individual life\u201d that the agent is currently able to lead (Husserliana, vol. XXXVII, p. 252), thus qualifying as a dynamic intentional structure. This individual life corresponds to the agent\u2018s self-determination as an individual person (see Section 8 above). The valuings underlying this self-determination can be veridical, and thus suitable for motivating objectively valid evaluative judgments, because their correlates, i.e. values, are part of the ideal (but still intersubjectively constituted) spiritual world (Husserliana, vol XXXVI, pp. 217 ff). These values stand in hierarchical relations to each other, governed by laws to be studied in what Husserl calls formal axiology (ibid., pp. 226\u2013232). Value-perception in the form of emotional valuing thus allows for a priori insights. It is such insights that determine the good will, in that the latter orients itself by the highest values the subject, on reflection, including a priori reflection, based on emotion, recognizes him- or herself to be able to realize in life, given his or her abilities and environment (for the present paragraph cf. Beyer 2013, sec. 1; for more detailed analyses of Husserl\u2019s ethics and value theory see, e.g., Luft 2010, the contributions to Luft, ed., 2011 and the literature cited there, as well as the secondary literature cited at the end of the foregoing paragraph.)\n\nEven the objective spatio-temporal world, which represents a significant part of our everyday lifeworld, is constituted intersubjectively, says Husserl. (The same holds true for its spatio-temporal framework, consisting of objective time and space.) How so? Husserl starts (again, from a first-person viewpoint) from a \u201csolipsistic\u201d abstraction of the notion of a spatio-temporal object which differs from that notion in that it does not presuppose that any other subject can observe such an object from his (or her) own perspective. His question is what justifies us (i.e., each of us for him- or herself) in the assumption of an objective reality consisting of such objects, given only this \u201csolipsistic\u201d conception of a spatio-temporal thing (or event) as our starting point. On Husserl\u2019s view, \u201cthe crucial further step\u201d in order to answer this question consists in disclosing the dimension that opens up when the epistemic justification, or \u201cmotivation\u201d, of intersubjective experience, or empathy, is additionally taken into account and made explicit (Husserliana, vol. VII, p. 435).\n\nRoughly, his argument goes as follows. In order for me to be able to put myself into someone else\u2019s shoes and simulate his (or her) perspective upon his surrounding spatio-temporal world, I cannot but assume that this world coincides with my own, at least to a large extent; although the aspects under which the other subject represents the world must be different, as they depend on his own egocentric viewpoint. Hence, I must presuppose that the spatio-temporal objects forming my own world exist independently of my subjective perspective and the particular experiences I perform; they must, in other words, be conceived of as part of an objective reality. This result fits in well with\u2014in fact, it serves to explain\u2014Husserl\u2019s view, already stressed in Ideas, that perceptual objects are \u201ctranscendent\u201d in that at any given moment they display an inexhaustive number of unperceived (and largely even unexpected) features, only some of which will become manifest\u2014will be intuitively presented\u2014in the further course of observation.\n\nHowever, according to Husserl this does not mean that the objective world thus constituted in intersubjective experience is to be regarded as completely independent of the aspects under which we represent the world. For on his view another condition for the possibility of intersubjective experience is precisely the assumption that by and large the other subject structures the world into objects in the same style I myself do. It is partly for this reason that Husserl can be said to adhere to a version of both \u201crealism\u201d and \u201cidealism\u201d at the same time.\n\nAnother, related, reason is that Husserl\u2019s argument for realism is developed in a context in which he defends what he refers to as \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d (a terminological choice he would later regret; see F\u00f8llesdal 1990a, p. 128). During the years in which his transcendental phenomenology took shape, he developed a number of \u201cproofs\u201d of this position, most of which are based upon his conception of a \u201creal possibility\u201d regarding cognition or the acquisition of knowledge. By a \u201creal possibility\u201d, Husserl understands a possibility that is such that \u201csomething\u2014more or less\u2014 \u2018speaks in favour of it\u2019\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XX/1, p. 178). Real possibilities are, in other words, conceived of as more or less (rationally) motivated possibilities; and Husserl understands motivation in such a way that it is always someone who is motivated a certain way (cf. Husserliana, vol. IV, p. 222). This is why Husserl subscribes to the following dependency thesis: The real possibility to acquire (empirical) knowledge regarding a contingent object A (possible world, individual thing, state of affairs involving such thing; cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, pp. 139f) \u201crequires\u201d an \u201cepistemic subject\u201d, which \u201ceither experiences A, or acquires knowledge regarding A on the basis of experience, or else has the practical possibility (or the practical ability) to experience A and acquire knowledge regarding it\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 139). Husserl also adheres to the following correlation thesis with regard to empirical reality and real epistemic possibility: If a contingent object A is real (really exists), then the real (as opposed to the merely logical) possibility obtains to acquire knowledge regarding A (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 138, l. 35\u201336). From these two propositions\u2014the dependency and the correlation thesis\u2014he derives the conclusion that the existence of a contingent object A requires \u201cthe necessary co-existence of a subject either acquiring knowledge\u201d regarding A \u201cor having the ability to do so\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, pp. 139f). This is nothing but \u201c[t]he thesis of transcendental idealism [...]: A nature without co-existing subjects of possible experience regarding it is unthinkable; possible subjects of experience are not enough\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 156).\n\nWhy are actual subjects of experience supposed to be necessary? Husserl\u2019s answer refers to the notion of full epistemic justification, or full degree of real possibility (with regard to empirical knowledge): \u201cIn order for [a thing of nature] to really exist, and thus in order for the assumption that it exists to be reasonable or justified not merely in a restricted but rather in an unrestricted way, i.e. to the fullest extent, there must be an actual ego in whose experiences [...] the being of the thing manifests itself [...].\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, pp. 76f). Husserl takes this notion to be applicable (as far as empirical consciousness is concerned) in case of truth only. Thus, in sec. 16 of Formal and Transcendental Logic he first equates \u201ctruth\u201d with \u201cgenuine knowledge\u201d which is \u201crepeatable by any [...] rational being\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XVII, p. 46) and then makes the (somewhat weaker) claim that truth and such knowledge are \u201ccorrelated\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XVII, p. 47). This conception of (empirical) truth, which is already to be found in Logical Investigations, has been compared to ideal verificationism (cf. Soldati 1994, p. 119) and to Putnam\u2019s internal realism (cf. Beyer 2020, p. 69).\n\nHusserl seems to regard real possibilities as epistemic dispositions (habitualities), or abilities, that require an actual \u201csubstrate\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 139). At the same time, he stresses that \u201csurely no human being and no animal\u201d must exist in the actual world (adding that their non-existence would however already result in a \u201cchange of the world\u201d) (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXVI, p. 121). One way to make sense of this would be to weaken the dependency thesis, and the requirement of an actual substrate, and to merely require what might be called real higher-order possibilities\u2014possibilities for acquiring epistemic dispositions in counterfactual (or actual) cases where epistemic subjects would be co-existing\u2014that may remain unactualized but could be actualized by someone properly taking into account a multitude of individual epistemic perspectives, by means of intersubjective experience. But even under this reconstruction there remains a sense in which the criteria of real possibility and reality constitution, and the corresponding structure of the real world, are dependent on an \u201cego\u201d, on Husserl\u2019s view: What counts as a real possibility, or as epistemically justified, is dependent on the phenomenological subjects reflecting about such counterfactual cases in the methodological context of the transcendental reduction and the results they arrive at in this context."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edmund-Husserl", "page_content": "Edmund Husserl, (born April 8, 1859, Prossnitz, Moravia, Austrian Empire [now Prost\u011bjov, Czech Republic]\u2014died April 27, 1938, Freiburg im Breisgau, Ger.), German philosopher, the founder of Phenomenology, a method for the description and analysis of consciousness through which philosophy attempts to gain the character of a strict science. The method reflects an effort to resolve the opposition between Empiricism, which stresses observation, and Rationalism, which stresses reason and theory, by indicating the origin of all philosophical and scientific systems and developments of theory in the interests and structures of the experiential life. (See phenomenology.)\n\nEducation and early life. Husserl was born into a Jewish family and completed his qualifying examinations in 1876 at the German public gymnasium in the neighbouring city of Olm\u00fctz (Olomouc). He then studied physics, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy at the universities of Leipzig, Berlin, and Vienna. In Vienna he received his doctor of philosophy degree in 1882 with a dissertation entitled Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Variationsrechnung (\u201cContributions to the Theory of the Calculus of Variations\u201d). In the autumn of 1883, Husserl moved to Vienna to study with the philosopher and psychologist Franz Brentano. Brentano\u2019s critique of any psychology oriented purely along scientific and psychophysical lines and his claim that he had grounded philosophy on his new descriptive psychology had a widespread influence. Husserl received a decisive impetus from Brentano and from his circle of students. The spirit of the Enlightenment, with its religious tolerance and its quest for a rational philosophy, was very much alive in this circle. Husserl\u2019s striving for a more strictly rational foundation found its corroboration here. From the outset, such a foundation meant for him not only a theoretical act but the moral meaning of responsibility in the sense of ethical autonomy. In Vienna Husserl converted to the Evangelical Lutheran faith, and one year later, in 1887, he married Malvine Steinschneider, the daughter of a secondary-school professor from Prossnitz. As his energetic and skilled wife, she was his indispensable support, until his death, in all the things of their daily life.\n\nLecturer at Halle. In 1886 Husserl went\u2014with a recommendation from Brentano\u2014to Carl Stumpf, the oldest of Brentano\u2019s students, who had further developed his psychology and who was professor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Halle. In 1887 Husserl qualified as a lecturer in the university (Habilitation). He had become a close friend of Stumpf, and he was indebted to Stumpf for many suggestions in the formation of his own descriptive concepts. The theme of Husserl\u2019s Habilitation thesis, \u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl: Psychologische Analysen (\u201cOn the Concept of Number: Psychological Analyses\u201d), already showed Husserl in the transition from his mathematical research to a reflection upon the psychological source of the basic concepts of mathematics. These investigations were an earlier draft of his Philosophie der Arithmetik: Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen, the first volume of which appeared in 1891. Britannica Quiz Philosophy 101 The title of his inaugural lecture in Halle was \u201c\u00dcber die Ziele und Aufgaben der Metaphysik\u201d (\u201cOn the Goals and Problems of Metaphysics\u201d). In the traditional sense metaphysics is the study of Being. Though the text is lost, it is clear that Husserl already understood his method of the analysis of consciousness to be the way to a new universal philosophy and metaphysics, which he hoped would lay all previous schemes of metaphysics to rest. The years of his teaching in Halle (1887\u20131901) were later seen by Husserl to have been his most difficult. He often doubted his ability as a philosopher and believed he would have to give up his occupation. The problem of uniting a psychological analysis of consciousness with a philosophical grounding of formal mathematics and logic seemed insoluble. But from this crisis there emerged the insight that the philosophical grounding of logic and mathematics must commence with an analysis of the experience that lies before all formal thinking. It demanded an intensive study of the British Empiricists (such as John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and John Stuart Mill) and a coming to terms with the logic and semantics stemming from this tradition\u2014especially the logic of Mill\u2014and with the attempts at a \u201cpsycho-logic\u201d grounding of logic then being made in Germany.

A student of Brentano (b. 1838\u2013d. 1917) and a contemporary of Frege (b. 1848\u2013d. 1925), he is the founding father of phenomenology and thereby a figure with a decisive impact not only on thinkers like Heidegger (b. 1889\u2013d. 1976), Merleau-Ponty (b. 1908\u2013d. 1961), and Sartre (b. 1905\u2013d. 1980) but also on subsequent theory formations in German and French philosophy. More recently, a number of Husserl\u2019s ideas have also been taken up and discussed by analytic philosophers. Husserl is primarily known for his analyses of intentionality, perception, temporality, embodiment and intersubjectivity, for his rehabilitation of the lifeworld and his commitment to a form of transcendental idealism and for his criticism of reductionism, objectivism, and scientism. Most of Husserl\u2019s writings have been published posthumously and they continue to disclose aspects of his thinking that it would have been difficult to anticipate through the study of the works originally published by Husserl himself. Many of these volumes have not yet been translated into English, and the same holds true for much of the relevant research literature.\n\nback to top"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-6730-0_995-1", "page_content": "Edmund Husserl (1858\u20131938) is one of the founders of phenomenology, a major tradition in Western philosophy since the twentieth century.

He was from a secular Jewish family but later converted to Protestantism under the influence of an older friend from Moravia, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk. However, based on what we now know of his words and deeds, Husserl regarded himself as belonging to Germany, where he was based after the autumn of 1886 until his death. For example, in his obituary of Brentano published during World War I, he admired Prussia, recalling his disagreement with his teacher\u2019s Great Germanist political position (Husserl 1950ff., vol. XXV, 307). These complexities of his identity may well be relevant for his discussions of communities (for a more detailed biography of Husserl, see Moran 2005, chap. 1).\n\nAlthough he did not consider himself a philosopher of law or a social philosopher, he left his mark in social sciences and discussions over their foundation. His Logical Investigations, published in 1900/1901, provided the impetus for forming the early phenomenological schools in Munich and G\u00f6ttingen, where society and law were central topics (Salice 2020). His phenomenology of internal time consciousness and intersubjectivity played a decisive role in Alfred Schutz\u2019s conception of phenomenological sociology (Schutz 2011, 2). As exemplified by, among others, Schutz\u2019s close friend Felix Kaufmann, a legacy of Husserl is also found in the history of philosophy of law (Loidolt 2010).\n\nIt should be noted that those influences can be attributed mainly to Husserl\u2019s published works in his lifetime. In those writings, he seldom dealt directly with issues from philosophy of law or social philosophy. Therefore, in the cases mentioned above, Husserl brought about the influences primarily by providing general ideas of phenomenology, which his successors would apply for particular topics such as law and society.\n\nWith the publication of Husserliana, the complete works of Husserl (1950ff.), it turned out that Husserl had a more detailed idea of social philosophy than what transpires from his published works. The vast amount of his Nachlass included many discussions of topics such as communities, (social or shared) norms, and their connections.

In 1887, he wrote \u2018\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl\u2019 (\u2018On the Concept of Number\u2019) under the supervision of Stumpf. It later became the basis for his 1891 book on the philosophy of mathematics, titled \u2018Philosophie der Arithmetik,\u2019 which was also considered his first significant work.\n\nHe attended lectures on philosophy and philosophical psychology by Franz Brentano at the \u2018University of Vienna\u2019 in 1884. He was exposed to the works of David Hume, Hermann Lotze, Bernard Bolzano, and J. Stuart Mill, through Brentano. The impact of Brentano led Husserl to resolve to devote his life to philosophy.\n\nHe joined the \u2018University of Vienna\u2019 in 1881. There, he studied mathematics under Leo K\u00f6nigsberger. He earned his PhD from the institute in 1883. His thesis was titled \u2018Beitr\u00e4ge zur Variationsrechnung\u2019 (\u2018Contributions to the Calculus of Variations\u2019). He then began working as an assistant to Karl Weierstrass in Berlin. After the latter fell ill, Husserl returned to Vienna. After a short stint in the military, he started focusing on philosophy.\n\nHe was raised in Prost\u011bjov, where he studied at the secular elementary school. He then attended the \u2018Realgymnasium\u2019 in Vienna and the \u2018Staatsgymnasium\u2019 in Olomouc. He studied physics, mathematics, and astronomy at the \u2018University of Leipzig\u2019 from 1876 to 1878. The philosophy lectures of Wilhelm Wundt at \u2018Leipzig\u2019 inspired him. In 1878, he joined the \u2018Frederick William University\u2019 of Berlin. There, he studied mathematics under the tutelage of Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. Former philosophy student Thomas Masaryk, who later became the first president of Czechoslovakia, was his mentor.

He was the second child (and the second son) of a Jewish milliner named Adolf. He grew up with two brothers and a sister.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer & Work in Philosophy\n\nIn 1887, he became a \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d at the \u2018University of Halle.\u2019 In 1891, he published \u2018Philosophy of Arithmetic,\u2019 his first book. It was a product of his extensive study of mathematics (under Weierstrass and K\u00f6nigsberger) and his research on philosophy and psychology (under Brentano and Stumpf). Dedicated to Brentano, the book was based much on Husserl\u2019s 1887 \u201chabilitationsschrift\u201d \u2018\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl\u2019 (\u2018On the Concept of Number\u2019). Gottlob Frege criticized the psychologism of the book. Such criticism adversely affected Husserl\u2019s career as a professor.\n\nAfter around a decade, in 1900\u20131901, he came up with a two-volume work titled \u2018Logische Untersuchungen' (\u2018Logical Investigations\u2019), in which he discussed the philosophy of logic and criticised psychologism. It secured his reputation, influenced philosophers such as Emil Lask and Martin Heidegger, and also contributed to the development of phenomenology, structuralism, and continental philosophy. However, he was never accepted as a practitioner of true logic by Frege and others. It is also believed that through this work, Husserl became the first to reason consciously (and at length) on parts and wholes (a study known as mereology in philosophy and mathematical logic).\n\nHe became an \u201cextraordinarius professor\u201d at the \u2018University of G\u00f6ttingen\u2019 in 1901. He became a co-editor of the journal \u2018Logos\u2019 in 1910.\n\nHe founded the journal \u2018Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung\u2019 (\u2018Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research\u2019) at \u2018Freiburg\u2019 in 1912.

Soon, he focussed on the ideal, vital structures of consciousness.\n\nIn 1916, he joined the \u2018Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\u2019 as a professor of philosophy. In 1923, he refused an offer to join the \u2018University of Berlin.\u2019 After serving for over a decade, Husserl requested retirement from \u2018Freiburg.\u2019 He took his last class at the institute on July 25, 1928.

In the sphere of the theory of knowledge, it meant the refusal of revelation as a source of knowledge and an attempt of validating knowledge by reason and experience. Within the framework of medieval philosophy, the concept of experience included religious experiences as well as sense experiences. Through the shift of the philosophical framework, modern philosophers narrowed down the primary meaning of experience to that of sense experience.\n\nHusserl redefined the concept of experience in the broadest sense, including the religious, mythical, aesthetic, perceptual, linguistic, and bodily sense. For Husserl, phenomenology is a philosophical methodology that allows us to describe the essence of each kind of experience without distortion. The motto of phenomenology, \u201cto the things themselves,\u201d expresses the spirit of phenomenology, which is trying to be a descriptive science that is faithful to the phenomena themselves. After Husserl, phenomenology became a movement and developed in various forms and variations. Problems of modern philosophy and its presuppositions were further exposed by phenomenologists after Husserl and the primacy of sense experience was questioned.\n\nHusserl defined phenomenology as the \u201cscience of all sciences,\u201d thereby establishing the objectivity of truth and knowledge against the skepticism and relativism of his days. He criticized two forms of relativism in particular, psychologism and historicism.\n\nFor Husserl, consciousness is a rich field where believing, loving, hoping, feeling, willing, imagining, perceiving, sensing, remembering, attending, anticipating, and all other conscious and unconscious acts are performed, and the meaning of objects of these mental acts are disclosed. While positivism, logocentricism, and scientism narrowed and limited the sphere of philosophical research only to the realm that is accessible by physical experiences, logical analyses of language, and mathematical and empirical sciences, Husserl defined philosophy as the study of the entire sphere of human life including social, political, religious, and cultural fields. By restoring and placing traditional questions of philosophy on a new ground of phenomenology, Husserl laid the cornerstone of continental philosophy.\n\nLife and works\n\nHusserl was born into a Jewish family in Prost\u011bjov (Prossnitz), Moravia, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). He was a pupil of Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. Among others, he would influence Edith Stein (St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross), Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Hermann Weyl's interest in intuitionistic logic and impredicativity, for example, seems to have been as a result of contact with Husserl. In 1887, he converted to Christianity and joined the Lutheran Church. He taught philosophy at Halle as a tutor (Privatdozent) from 1887, then at G\u00f6ttingen as professor from 1901, and at Freiburg im Breisgau from 1916 until he retired in 1928. Following \"retirement,\" he used the library at Freiburg to continue his researches and writing. He died at Freiburg on April 26, 1938.\n\nHusserl's studies and early works\n\nHusserl initially studied mathematics at the universities of Leipzig (1876) and Berlin (1878) with Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. In 1881, he went to Vienna to study under the supervision of Leo K\u00f6nigsberger, a former student of Weierstrass, and obtained his doctorate degree in 1883 with the work Beitr\u00e4ge zur Variationsrechnung (Contributions to the Calculus of Variations).\n\nIn 1884 in Vienna he started following lectures by Franz Brentano on psychology and philosophy. Brentano impressed him so much that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy. Husserl studied briefly with him and then in 1886 went to the University of Halle to obtain his habilitation with Carl Stumpf, a former student of Brentano. Under his supervision he wrote \u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl (On the concept of Number; 1887) which would serve later as the base for his first major work the \u201cPhilosophie der Arithmetik\u201d (Philosophy of Arithmetic; 1891).\n\nIn these first works he tried to combine mathematics, psychology, and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzed the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tried to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he used several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass, he derived the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. From Brentano and Stumpf, he took the distinction between proper and improper presenting. In an example, Husserl explained this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (for example, the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also called it) presentation if that object can be indicated only through signs, symbols, etc.\n\nAnother important element that Husserl took from Brentano is intentionality, the notion that the main characteristic of consciousness is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarized as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of psychical phenomena, by which they could be distinguished from physical phenomena. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act has a content, is directed at an object (the intentional object). Every belief and desire has an object that they are about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish psychical phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.\n\nPhenomenology as the Science of All Sciences\n\nSome years after the publication of his main work, the Logische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations, first edition, 1900\u20131901), Husserl made some key discoveries leading him to make the assertion that phenomenology is the \u201cscience of all sciences\u201d; in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness, the noesis, and the phenomena at which it is directed, the noemata. Knowledge of essences would only be possible by \"bracketing\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called epoch\u00e9. These new concepts prompted the publication of the Ideen (Ideas) in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and gave Husserl a plan for a second edition of the Logische Untersuchungen.\n\nHusserl conceived phenomenology as the \u201cscience of all sciences\u201d in contradistinction to sciences of all kinds. In Husserl\u2019s analyses, sciences are na\u00efve in the sense that they are built upon certain presuppositions which are simply taken for granted. Phenomenology, on the other hand, is built upon a rigorous self-examination of one\u2019s point of departure and the justification of one\u2019s thought processes. Husserl characterized phenomenology as the self-grounding discipline built upon rigorous self-examination. He defined phenomenology as the science that can ground and justify all other sciences.\n\nOne of Husserl\u2019s major concerns were the relativism and skepticism of his days, psychologism and historicism in particular. Psychologism is a position which considers that all phenomena can be reduced to psychic events in the human mind, since our mind is what offers access to all phenomena. Historicism is another form of reductionism. It holds the position that all phenomena can be conceived as and reducible to historical events. Husserl criticized the relativism and skepticism inherent to these two forms of reductionism from the objectivist perspective of truth and knowledge. Husserl\u2019s focus on essence, that is, his essentialism, went parallel to his objectivist endeavor.\n\nFrom the Ideen onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the material reality of what we perceive was of little interest to Husserl, except when he had to repeatedly defend his position of transcendental idealism, which did not at any point, propose that there were no real material objects. Husserl proposed that the world of objects and ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural attitude,\" which is characterized by a belief that objects materially exist and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them. Husserl proposed a radical new, phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \"constitute\" them. This is to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination. In the phenomenological attitude, the object ceases to be something simply \"external\" and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or \"type.\" A way of looking that is most explicitly delineated by the natural sciences. The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but \"bracketed\" as a way in which we regard objects instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence, founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive, or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects.\n\nPhenomenology of the \u201cLife World\u201d\n\nIn his early and middle periods, Husserl developed phenomenology as the study of consciousness. He conceived consciousness as an independent realm that could be detached from the world. In his later period, however, he began to realize how inseparable human consciousness is from the social, political, cultural, and historical environments in which one lives. Husserl developed a phenomenology of the life-world. He began to wrestle with the complicated issues of intersubjectivity, specifically how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity. He tried new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of phenomenology to scientific inquiry, specifically to psychology, and what it means to \"bracket\" the natural attitude. The \"Crisis of the European Sciences\" is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues.\n\nHusserl was denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation the National Socialists passed in April 1933. His former pupil and Nazi Party member, Martin Heidegger, informed Husserl that he was discharged. Heidegger removed the dedication to Husserl from his most widely known work, Being and Time, when it was reissued in 1941.\n\nIn 1939, Husserl's manuscripts, amounting to approximately 40,000 pages, were deposited at Leuven to form the Archives Husserl. Most of this material has been published in the collection known as Husserliana.\n\nBibliography\n\nWorks by Husserl\n\nGerman\n\n\u00dcber den Begriff der Zahl.

Although his life was tragically cut short, and his corpus of writings modest in size, Reinach's essays on general ontology, on the philosophy of law and on the philosophy of language, are remarkably clear and original examples of the phenomenological approach to philosophizing. His principal distinction lies in his 1913 monograph \u201cOn the A Priori Foundations of the Civil Law\u201d, whose analysis of the act of promising anticipates several crucial aspects of the speech act theories of Austin and Searle.\n\nAdolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in Mainz, Germany in 1883. He began his university studies in Munich in 1901, where he studied law, psychology and philosophy. In 1905 he completed his doctorate under the direction of Theodor Lipps with a dissertation entitled, \u201cOn the Concept of Causality in the Criminal Code.\u201d During this time, Reinach joined a circle of philosophers who had studied Husserl's recently published Logical Investigations (1900\u201301), a circle which included Johannes Daubert, Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Theodor Conrad, and Moritz Geiger. In 1909 Reinach moved to G\u00f6ttingen, where he completed his Habilitation under Husserl's sponsorship.\n\nShortly after the declaration of war in 1914 Reinach enlisted in the German army. While some letters and philosophical sketches from the war years have survived, Reinach never published another manuscript or directed another seminar. He died in battle in Flanders in 1917, shortly after becoming baptized into the Protestant Church.\n\nThe historian of phenomenology Herbert Spiegelberg writes:\n\nIndependently of each other, the G\u00f6ttingen students of phenomenology like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexander Koyr\u00e9 and Edith Stein, in their accounts of this period, refer to Reinach, not to Husserl, as their real teacher in phenomenology. Hedwig Conrad-Martius even goes so far as to call him the phenomenologist par excellence \u2026 It was his death in action in 1917 rather than Husserl's going to Freiberg which cut short not only his own promise but that of the G\u00f6ttingen phenomenological circle. (1984, pp. 191\u2013192)\n\nThe influence of Reinach did however continue to make itself felt above all in Poland through the work of Roman Ingarden and to some degree also of Karol Wojty\u0142a (Pope John Paul II).\n\nLike the other realist phenomenologists, Reinach saw himself as developing a distinctive approach to philosophy, inspired by Husserl's Logical Investigations, with the goal of being faithful to what is given in different kinds of experience (e.g., linguistic, religious, moral, or aesthetic experience).\n\nFor realist phenomenologists, the distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge has to do with the kind of object studied and not (as for the later Husserl) with any special epistemological technique such as that of epoch\u00e9 or transcendental reduction. Reinach credited the possibility of a priori knowledge to certain special features (necessity, universality, timelessness, intelligibility) of the corresponding objects of knowledge (which are in Reinach's eyes certain kinds of states of affairs and associated essences or natures). Thus, Reinach writes\n\nWe can surely take it as generally granted that there are no self-evident and necessary relations of essence in the causal relations of external events. However it is, to speak with Hume, that we come to know that fire produces smoke, this is surely not intelligibly grounded in the essence of fire, as it lies in the essence of the number 3 to be larger than the number 2. (1913, p. 15, emphasis added)\n\nReinach saw these special features of certain essences\u2014such as numbers, promising, and asserting\u2014as straightforward features of reality, thereby insisting that calling something a priori \u201cdoes not mean anything dark or mystical\u201d (1913, p. 5). His realist understanding of material and synthetic a priori knowledge of essences is further elucidated in the next two sections.\n\nAccording to Reinach, material a priori states of affairs and essences exist independently of the contingent minds that may apprehend them and of the individual objects that may instantiate them. Such instantiation will however bring in its wake a series of concrete associations with other entities. Thus in writing about the legal entities (such as rights and obligations) that are grounded in the essence of promising, Reinach notes that when such legal entities exist, they become \u201cintimately interwoven with the rest of the natural world, with all the experiencing of persons who perform acts, with their feelings and wishes, their desires and intentions, their expectations and fears, etc.\u201d (1913, p. 130)\n\nReinach's insistence that the objects of a priori knowledge can be considered apart from any realization in the world led to Husserl's later accusation that Reinach embraced a Platonism that \u201cdistorted the true picture of phenomenology\u201d (Spiegelberg, p. 192). Yet Reinach explicitly rejected any notion of essences of the sort that would generate any form of third man argument. In his article, \u201cThe Supreme Rules of Rational Inference According to Kant\u201d (1911a), he observes that judgments such as \u201cthe triangle has three sides\u201d or \u201cthe lion has a tail\u201d have often been said to refer to general concepts such as \u201ctriangle\u201d or \u201clion.\u201d But this leads not only to odd ideas (e.g., that a concept has a tail) but also, as Berkeley noted, to impossible ideas (such as a triangle that is at once right-angled, equilateral, and obtuse). Reinach notes that the ontological mistake lies in assuming that essences are substances or really existing particulars; the logical mistake is assuming that judgments about \u201cthe triangle\u201d or \u201cthe lion\u201d refer to concepts at all. Rather, the judgment that \u201cthe triangle has three sides\u201d is more precisely expressed as having the general form \u201ceverything that is a triangle has three sides.\u201d It is this general state of affairs that is the specific object of our a priori knowledge.\n\nReinach notes in his Marburg lecture (1914) that, while many philosophers had acknowledged the existence of a priori truths, most had restricted the a priori to a very narrow sphere, confining it either to the formal a priori (Hume) or to the a priori of Newtonian physics (Kant). For Reinach, in contrast, there are material a priori structures in every domain of reality. If we know that only a free agent can be responsible, then this is because we understand the necessary and timeless natures of freedom and responsibility. In \u201cConcerning Phenomenology\u201d Reinach states that \u201cthe realm of the a priori is incalculably large \u2026 [and this] opens up for investigation an area so large and rich that still today we cannot see its boundaries\u201d (1914, pp. 215\u2013216). In defending the existence of material a priori truths (also called \u2018essential laws\u2019), Reinach and his colleagues thus believed that they had established a new kind of research agenda for philosophy. And while in many respects this is an agenda which combats reductionism, its proponents have at the same time provided us with several examples in which careful analysis of essences in the spirit of this agenda precisely refutes the existence of certain supposed entities.\n\n\u201cConcerning Phenomenology\u201d stands out not least in that it is one of the earliest attempts by a German philosopher to come to grips with Frege's work. Reinach observes that, while the division of numbers into two sorts, the ordinal and the cardinal, is generally accepted, it is widely debated which kind of number is more primitive or basic. Reinach attempts to resolve this debate, and in the process provides an account of number predications, such as \u201cThe Kaiser's coach is drawn by four horses,\u201d of a sort treated also by Frege. He begins by noting that cardinal numbers are properly speaking not predicated of things. Frege, for example, argued that in statements such as \u201cThe Kaiser's coach is drawn by four horses\u201d the number four is predicated of a concept, namely, horse that draws the Kaiser's coach. However, Reinach finds it to be self-evident that \u201ca concept which subsumes four objects is just as little four as a concept which subsumes material objects is, therefore, itself material\u201d (p. 206). Neither numbers nor categorical elements such as \u201csome\u201d or \u201call\u201d are properties, by this argument, and accordingly they are not really predicated of things. Numbers rather give the range of objects that fall within the scope of a predication. Put another way, numbers do not answer the question \u201chow many\u201d but rather \u201chow many As are B?\u201d\n\nReinach finds that so-called ordinal numbers are nothing but a shorthand way of referring to the (cardinal) number of terms a certain series contains up to some given term. In any given series, we have a first term, a last term, and any number of terms in between. Naturally, we may wish to denote the position of a term within an ordered series. Yet this can quickly become very cumbersome. As Reinach notes, if we use letters to denote an ordered series of four terms\u2014a, b, c, and d\u2014then already \u201cc\u201d would be called \u201cthe term following the term following the opening term.\u201d It is much easier simply to adopt a numerical convention according to which \u201cc\u201d is named in reflection of the fact that it is the term up to which the series contains three terms. Yet in no way does such designation constitute a new sort of number; in saying the series \u2018contains three members up to this point\u2019, we are still making use of the cardinal number three. Reinach writes that there is\n\nno peculiarity of series terms as such, nothing numerical\u2014which might be grasped by us. The elements have their positions in the series, and these positions can be defined by the successor's relation to the opening term. Nothing is said of number. \u2026 there are no ordinal numbers. Philosophy has possibly been flustered here because it blindly followed the sign-makings of the mathematicians, and thereby took words for facts. (p. 208)\n\nReinach's view of ordinal numbers may seem radical. However, it is not only internally consistent with his philosophy of ideal objects and predication, but it seems consistent also with ordinary language. As Reinach observes, the way that we designate the position of elements in a series does not always use numerical names:\n\nthe first is not the onest [einste]. \u2026 Also, the term following the first need not be designated with the aid of a number. We, indeed, say \u201czweite,\u201d but the Latin says \u201csecundus.\u201d So not all ordinal designations are ordinal number-designations.\n\nThroughout his writings, Reinach makes extensive use of the category of states of affairs (Sachverhalte). For example, he maintains that a priori knowledge is first and foremost knowledge of specific states of affairs (e.g., the being equal of 2+2 and 4) rather than of propositions or things. States of affairs may be most accurately described as states of being. This is because it is the being (the copula) in a state of affairs that typically bears the special (for example modal) properties attributed to that state of affairs. For example, in the being equal of 2+2 and 4 it is the being equal that is necessary, just as in the being red of the house it is the being red that is contingent. Similarly, when we assert \u201cthat house is not red\u201d we are asserting a state of affairs we have apprehended, namely, the not being red of the house. In this case, the negativity pertains to the copula of the state of affairs, that is, the not being red of the house, rather than the being not-red of the house. There are no negative properties, for Reinach. That is to say, negative properties have no existence, and those philosophers who have posited their existence have been misled by language, which frequently says things are, e.g., not red.\n\nReinach claims that numerous properties that are standardly viewed by philosophers as properties of objects are most properly conceived as properties of states of affairs.\n\nMany of Reinach's fellow realist phenomenologist came to embrace the idea that either all states of affairs (Lipps 1928; Pf\u00e4nder 1921) or at least negative states of affairs (Ingarden 1964\u201365) exist only as intentional objects. Reinach, however, embraced a realist position towards both positive and negative states of affairs. The kind of being Reinach attributed to states of affairs was that of \u201cobtaining\u201d (Bestehen); they do not really \u201cexist\u201d as do things, but neither are they simply mental or intentional objects. Reinach believed that negative states of affairs obtain precisely as do positive states of affairs; otherwise, he did not see how we could defend objective knowledge of the most basic laws of ontology and logic (specifically, the principle of contradiction and the law of the excluded middle). On the other hand he did not believe that every positive or negative sentence corresponds to some state of affairs which obtains; this applies only to those sentences which are true, and thus only to one member of any given positive and negative pair of putative states of affairs.\n\nIn his essay, \u201cDeliberation: Its Ethical and Legal Significance\u201d (1912/1913), Reinach observes that there are contradictions in how we evaluate the moral significance of deliberation. For example, we consider a crime more reprehensible if it is performed after deliberation, yet we also judge harshly one who performs a crime without a second thought. Reinach noted that in the German law in his day killing without deliberation could mean as little as six months in prison where killing after deliberation would mean certain capital punishment.\n\nReinach distinguishes between intellectual and volitional deliberation. The former aims at apprehending what is the case, the latter at apprehending what should be done. For example, upon arriving in a concentration camp, an inmate might intellectually deliberate about the odds of successfully escaping. He might decide the odds are low (say 1 in 20) yet still volitionally deliberate about whether he ought to attempt to escape. Of the two, volitional deliberation is psychologically the more complex. Intellectual deliberation tends to culminate in conviction once we apprehend what is the case. In contrast, volitional deliberation has no \u201cautomatic\u201d conclusion because the value of an act is subject to modification when it is connected to the real world of consequences. An act that appears highly noble in itself may have such negative consequences that the value of actually undertaking it is modified to a disvalue. For example, while escaping from a concentration camp may be good in itself, it may be a disvalue if escapes are punished through increased torture and killing of remaining inmates. Moreover, even after one rightly discerns the value of an action per se and the value of undertaking a proposed action, experience shows that value perception does not compel either the will or the heart to provide a fitting response. That is, one might decide that escaping is wrong\u2014all things considered\u2014yet still attempt an escape to save one's own life or sanity.\n\nThese facts about deliberation help us to recognize shortcomings in the significance that the law attaches to deliberation. Reinach claims that our belief that a crime is made worse by deliberation rests on the assumption that when an individual undertakes a project that is disvaluable (say killing), the moral situation is worsened by knowledge of the relevant disvalue. That is to say, individuals are less culpable when they act in ignorance of the disvalue of their crime. Reinach finds that deliberation is actually playing a symbolic role when its significance is interpreted in this fashion: it is taken to signify that the individual had in fact apprehended the disvalue of an act prior to choosing to perform it. However, the connection between deliberation and the perception of a disvalue is not a necessary connection: one may apprehend a disvalue without deliberation, and one may deliberate and still fail to apprehend a disvalue. Thus, the law is in no position to determine the precise significance of deliberation in an a priori fashion.\n\nIn fact, Reinach argues that the common-sense assumption that a reprehensible deed is actually worse when done without a second thought\u2014an assumption that contradicts the prevailing wisdom of criminal law\u2014more properly reflects the direct moral significance of deliberation. It is good for people to consider what they do. Failure to deliberate about a crime implies either a fundamental disregard for or an insensitivity to values\u2014and neither seems to reduce the culpability of a criminal act. Thus, Reinach concludes that the law is mistaken in attaching more severe punishment to deliberate than to non-deliberate crimes.\n\nReinach's major work, \u201cThe A priori Foundations of the Civil Law\u201d (1913) begins with the following claim:\n\nInsofar as philosophy is ontology or the a priori theory of objects, it has to do with the analysis of all possible kinds of objects as such. We shall see that philosophy here comes across objects of quite a new kind, objects which do not belong to nature in the proper sense, which are neither physical nor psychical and which are at the same time different from all ideal objects in virtue of their temporality. (p. 6)\n\nReinach here refers specifically to claims and obligations. He asserts that they exist just as much as do trees and houses. Clearly, they are not physical entities, but neither are they mental. They do indeed presuppose a person as their \u201cbearer\u201d\u2014that is, real claims and obligations always belong to someone. In addition, psychological properties may correspond to claims and obligations; for example, one may feel entitled or feel obligated. However, if I accept a car loan and contractually agree to pay back the loan over a 36-month period, my obligation does not cease to exist even if such feelings fade away and even if I forget about the obligation completely. The very fact that a claim or obligation may last for years without change speaks against any alleged reduction to something psychological, for there is nothing in the psychological (or indeed in the physical) domain that remains static over time.\n\nIn the Logical Investigations, Husserl developed a thesis advanced by his teacher Brentano to the effect that all mental acts are intentional, that is, that they are directed towards an object. Husserl maintained that all intentional experiences are in this sense \u2018objectifying acts\u2019.\n\nHusserl's account of meaning builds upon this theory. All uses of language are, he says, referential. Accordingly, Husserl viewed acts such as questions or commands as masked assertions. The command \u201csit down on the chair\u201d he interpreted as a statement to the effect that \u201cyour sitting down on the chair is my current request.\u201d\n\nIt was in critical reaction to such theses that Reinach developed his theory of social acts (Smith 1990), a theory which bears striking similarities to the theory of speech acts later developed by Austin and Searle.\n\nBoth promising and communicating one's intention to do something, according to Reinach, belong to the category of what he calls \u201cspontaneous\u201d acts, i.e. acts which involve a subject's bringing something about within his own psychic sphere, as contrasted with passive experiences of, say, feeling a pain or hearing an explosion (1913, p. 706, Eng. p. 18). Certain types of spontaneous act are such as to require as a matter of necessity a linguistic utterance or some other overt performance of a non-natural and rule-governed sort. This does not hold of judging or deciding, nor even of forgiving, but it does hold of apologizing, commanding, or accusing. We may accordingly divide spontaneous acts into two classes, which we might call internal and external, according to whether the act's being brought to overt expression is a separable or an inseparable moment of the relevant complex whole.\n\nActs are divided further into self-directable and non-self-directable. Self-directable acts are such that the subject toward whom they are directed may be identical with the subject of the act (as in cases of self-pity, self-hatred, etc.). Non-self-directable acts, on the other hand, such as forgiving or praying, demand an alien subject. A peculiarity of certain external and non-self-directable acts is that the relevant utterance must of necessity be not only directed toward a certain subject but also registered or grasped by this subject in a further act: a command must be received and understood by those to whom it is addressed (something which does not apply, for example, to an act of blessing or cursing). It is part of the essential structure of a command that it be an action of a subject which is spontaneous, intentional, non-self-directable and in need of being grasped by the subject towards whom it is addressed. The same holds also of requests, admonishments, questionings, informings, answerings, and many other types of act. (Reinach 1913, p. 707, Eng. pp. 19f.) Each social act constitutes an inner unity of deliberate execution and deliberate utterance. The experience is here impossible in the absence of the utterance. And the utterance for its part is not something that is added to the experience as an incidental extra; it stands in the service of the social act and is necessary in order that the latter should fulfill its announcing function.\n\nReinach mentions many social acts in his treatise on \u201cThe A Priori Foundations of the Civil Law\u201d (1913)\u2014commanding, requesting, warning, questioning and answering, informing, enacting, revoking, transferring, granting, and waiving of claims\u2014but he devotes the most attention to the act of promising. Drawing on the theory of essences or intrinsically intelligible structures referred to above, Reinach offers the following examples of a priori truths about what he sees as the intrinsically intelligible structure instantiated through the performance of a promising act:\n\nthrough promising one incurs an obligation;\n\nby receiving a promise one has a claim to what was promised;\n\nsuch claims are extinguished when the promise is fulfilled;\n\nsuch claims may also be extinguished if the claimholder waives the claim;\n\npromising is subject to a range of variations or modifications, including conditional promising, promising on behalf of or as a representative of someone else, promising to a group, promising by a group, and so forth.\n\nReinach maintains that such truths are not merely necessary and universal, but also informative, thus that they are examples of truths that are both a priori and synthetic.\n\nReinach's views are in this respect opposed to those of Searle (1969), who argued that promising is a social institution that can be explained in terms of so-called constitutive rules analogous to the rules of chess (Zaibert and Smith 2007). Once one stipulates the rules, on this account, then certain necessary truths can be derived. Reinach, in contrast, held that promising is a sui generis phenomenon that is not invented but rather discovered, as is seen in the contrast between promising and those elements of a code of law which truly are constructed, for example specific rules concerning primogeniture or the discharging of liens. Reinach speculates that an individual who orally contracts to rent a piece of property for three years may be surprised to learn that, in German law, this contract is made for an \u201cindefinite length of time.\u201d In contrast, someone who waives a claim will hardly be surprised by the fact that the claim is now extinguished. The latter, in Reinach's terms, flows from the very essence of a claim and of the act of waiving a claim, and in this it contrasts sharply with the non-intuitive arbitrariness of the rules of chess.\n\nReinach next surveys Hume, who familiarly provides an account of why a promise is binding which rests on the idea that there is a certain sort of sui generis experience which becomes expressed in a promise and which is somehow binding on the subject but which is at the same time analogous to experiences of resolving, wishing, willing in that it can be present also without any accompanying expression. Reinach rejects this account \u2013 denying that such an experience could exist \u2013 and rejects also a variety of other psychologistic and consequentialistic theories because they are, he claims, seeking an explanation of a phenomenon so basic that it cannot be further elucidated in terms of anything more simple. As he himself expresses it:\n\nStrictly speaking, we are not proposing any theory of promising. For we are only putting forward the simple thesis that promising as such produces claim and obligation. One can try, and we have in fact tried, to bring out the intelligibility of this thesis by analysis and clarification. To try to explain it would be just like trying to explain the proposition, 1 \u00d7 1 = 1. It is a fear of what is directly given, a strange reluctance or incapacity to look the ultimate data in the face and to recognize them as such, that has driven unphenomenological philosophies, in this as in so many other more fundamental problems, to untenable and ultimately to extravagant constructions. (1913, p. 46)\n\nIn this passage, Reinach summarizes his view not only of promising, but also of phenomenological philosophy itself. The central task of phenomenology is to describe faithfully what is given in experience, preferring knowledge that is immediate and intuitive to that which is known indirectly through deduction or other means."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-6730-0_874-1", "page_content": "Adolf Reinach (1883\u20131917), philosopher and jurist and brilliant and meticulous thinker, was one of the great exponents of realistic phenomenology.\n\nAdolf Reinach\u2019s life, like that of so many intellectuals of his generation, was cut short by his eager enlistment in the German army during World War I.

Reinach's version of phenomenology was simpler and clearer than Husserl's and more concrete. He stressed the intuiting of the essential core of phenomena and developed a theory of the phenomenological a priori, a property of states of affairs rather than of acts of judging. He applied phenomenology to the philosophy of law, and tried to construct an a priori theory of law, contending that there are essential elements of law that have an absolute validity, independent of the mind that thinks of them and of temporal conditions. Reinach tried to explore the relationships of these elements. He was killed during World War I.

In the circle of Lipps' students he came in contact with Moritz Geiger, Otto Selz, Aloys Fischer and above all Johannes Daubert. From onward 1903/4 he was increasingly busy with the works of Edmund Husserl, especially his Logische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations).\n\nIn 1904, Reinach obtained his doctorate in philosophy under Lipps with his work \u00dcber den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Strafrecht (On the concept of cause in penal law). In 1905, he still intended to continue his studies in Munich (where in the meanwhile he had also befriended Alexander Pf\u00e4nder), to obtain a degree in law, but then decided to go to study with Husserl in G\u00f6ttingen. In that period more students of Lipps (captained by Daubert) had decided to abandon Munich and to head for G\u00f6ttingen, inspired by Husserl's works (which is referred to as the Munich invasion of G\u00f6ttingen).\n\nLater in 1905 Reinach returned to Munich to complete his studies in law and then continued in 1906-1907 in T\u00fcbingen. He attended several lectures and seminars on penal law by the legal theorist Ernst Beling, by which he was quite impressed and to which he owes a great deal of inspiration of his later works. In the summer of 1907 he took the First State Examination in Law, but also went later to G\u00f6ttingen to attend discussion circles with Husserl.\n\nWith the support of Husserl, Reinach was able to obtain habilitation for university teaching at G\u00f6ttingen in 1909. From his lectures and research, we can see that at the time he was influenced also by Anton Marty and Johannes Daubert, besides obviously and greatly by Husserl. On his turn Reinach appears to have inspired several young phenomenologists (like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 and Edith Stein) with his lectures. Besides giving an introduction to phenomenology, he lectured i.a. on Plato and Immanuel Kant.\n\nIn this period, Husserl embarked on a thorough revision of his main work, the Logical Investigations, and asked Reinach\u2019s assistance in this endeavour. Moreover, in 1912 Reinach, together with Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pf\u00e4nder founded the famous Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung, with Husserl as main editor.\n\nBesides his work in the area of phenomenology and philosophy in general, Reinach is credited for the development of a forerunner to the theory of speech acts by Austin and Searle: Die apriorischen Grundlagen des b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechtes (The A Priori Foundations of Civil Law) is a systematic treatment of social acts as performative utterances and a priori foundations of civil law. Reinach's work was based mostly on Husserl's analysis of meaning in the Logical Investigations, but also on Daubert's criticism of it. Alexander Pf\u00e4nder (1870\u20131941) had also been doing research on commands, promises and the like in the same period.\n\nAfter Husserl's publication of the Ideen (Ideas) in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories and the current of Munich phenomenology came effectively into being, as Reinach, Daubert and others chose to remain closer to Husserl's earlier work, the Logical investigations. Instead of following Husserl into idealism and transcendental phenomenology, the Munich group remained a realist current.\n\nReinach was converted to Lutheranism along with his wife[4][5]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I Reinach volunteered to join the army. After many battles and having received the Iron Cross, Reinach fell outside Diksmuide in Flanders on 16 November 1917.\n\nList of main works [ edit ]\n\n\u00dcber den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Leipzig: J.

Stumpf supervised Husserl\u2019s habilitation thesis in Halle in 1887 and the latter\u2019s seminal work on phenomenology, Logical Investigations (1900\u20131901), is dedicated to him in recognition of his friendship and his philosophical contribution to this book. Stumpf is also known as the founder of the Berlin Institute of Psychology, which gave rise to Gestalt psychology, another important current during the early twentieth century and whose main adherents were among others, his students W. K\u00f6hler, K. Koffka, W. Wertheimer and K. Lewin. Founder of the Phonogram Archive in Berlin, now under the protection of the UNESCO, he is also considered one of the forefathers of comparative musicology and a pioneer in ethnomusicology. He held positions in the philosophy departments at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen, W\u00fcrzburg, Prague, Munich and Halle, before obtaining a professorship at the University of Berlin, where he was also rector in 1907\u20131908. His two main sources of inspiration in philosophy are Franz Brentano, of whom he was the first student in W\u00fcrzburg, and Hermann Lotze, who supervised his doctoral thesis on Plato (1868) and his habilitation thesis on mathematical axioms (1870). The philosophical work he left us is as original and as diversified as his academic and institutional achievements. Besides many treatises in the fields of acoustics and musicology, his important contributions to the development of the \u201cnew psychology\u201d and to the philosophy of the mind in general should also be noted. His friend William James said of him in his Principles of Psychology (p. 911) that he was \u201cthe most philosophical and profound of all writers; and I owe him much.\u201d His studies in the field of descriptive psychology and phenomenology (known as the science of phenomena) for example, are of particular interest to current research in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive sciences.\n\nStumpf\u2019s intellectual biography is rich and complex due to his long university career that lasted for more than 50 years, his academic achievements, and his philosophical work. To complete this biographical sketch, the reader is invited to consult Stumpf\u2019s autobiography (published in 1924) and Sprung\u2019s biography, published in German under the title Carl Stumpf \u2013 Eine Biografie (2006).\n\n1848 Carl Friedrich Stumpf was born on April 21, 1848 in Wiesentheid in Franconia, Germany.\n\n1859\u20131863 Attended the Gymnasium in Bamberg, studied music and composed several pieces.\n\n1864\u20131865 Attended the Gymnasium in Aschaffenburg where he studied Plato with Hocheder.\n\n1865 Entered the University of W\u00fcrzburg and during his first year studied aesthetics and law\n\n1866 Met Franz Brentano on July 14, 1866 during the disputatio of his habilitation and then decided to study philosophy with Brentano. From 1867 to 1870 he attended Brentano\u2019s lectures on the history of philosophy, metaphysics, Comte and positivism and logic.\n\n1867\u20131868 Because Brentano had not been habilitated to supervise dissertations, it was recommended that Stumpf study with Hermann Lotze in G\u00f6ttingen. He attended Lotze\u2019s lectures on psychology, history of philosophy since Kant, philosophy of nature, and practical philosophy. He also attended lectures from the physiologist G. Meissner and the physician W.

His debt to Brentano is well documented in his autobiography and in the three biographies, which Stumpf (1918, 1919, 1922) devoted to him after his death in 1917. But opinions diverged regarding Stumpf\u2019s later position to Brentano\u2019s philosophical program. Some claim that Stumpf is a truly orthodox Brentanian (K. Schuhmann, 1996) while others argue that Stumpf gradually distanced himself from Brentano\u2019s thinking and moved closer to that of Lotze (Ewen, 2008 Milkov 2015). The truth must lie somewhere in the middle if we are to judge the matter in light of Stumpf\u2019s many testimonies in his biographical articles and in his substantial correspondence with Brentano where he unequivocally acknowledges his debt to Brentano.\n\nStumpf\u2019s debt to Lotze\u2019s philosophy is certainly significant but it is not very well documented. Most studies on the relationship between Stumpf and Lotze emphasize Lotze\u2019s theory of local signs (see W. R. Woodward, 1978; Fisette, 2006, 2012; B. Centi, 2011) and the problem of the origins of space perception, which is in fact the central theme of Stumpf\u2019s Raumbuch (Stumpf, 1873; M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 1994; D. Pradelle, 2015). In this book, dedicated to Lotze, Stumpf offers a summary of the debates between philosophers, scientists, and psychologists on the origins of space perception since Fechner. In the preface to this book, Stumpf explains that his starting point is the controversy between nativism and empiricism triggered by Helmholtz in his Handbuch (H. von Helmholtz, 1910, vol. 3, \u00a7 25) while his inspiration lies in Lotze (1852) Medizinischer Psychologie. Lotze\u2019s influence on the young Stumpf\u2019s thought is not limited to his doctrine of local signs as Stumpf repeatedly emphasized (R. Rollinger, 2008; N. Milkov, 2015; D. Fisette, 2009b). Beyond the question of influence, Stumpf assigns a central role to Lotze\u2019s thought in the history of philosophy and associates him with a renaissance of philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century (Stumpf, 1907).\n\nFrom his two mentors Brentano and Lotze, Stumpf inherited a marked interest in the history of philosophy. This interest was not strictly historiographical: his point of departure was Brentano\u2019s theory of the four phases in the history of philosophy, and he worked out his own philosophy of history, which constitutes the basis of his diagnosis on the state of philosophy in the nineteenth century, which is inseparable from the way he conceived of philosophy. In his first address as the rector of the university of Berlin delivered in 1907 under the title \u201cRenaissance of Philosophy,\u201d exactly a hundred years after Fichte\u2019s \u201cAddress to the German Nation\u201d at the same university, Stumpf applied this philosophy of history to the nineteenth century and asked whether philosophy at this time belonged to an ascending stage of history and whether it tended towards a renaissance of philosophy. He identified two factors which marked the development of philosophy during this period: the empty space left by the decline of speculative philosophy of German idealism during the first half of the nineteenth century, and the remarkable development of psychology and of the physiology of senses during the second half of this century, due to the works of physiologists and physicists such as Fechner, Weber, Hering, and Helmholtz. These two factors corresponded to two divergent philosophical orientations at the time when Stumpf was undertaking his studies in philosophy. The first was the Kantian tradition in its different ramifications, including Neo-Kantianism; the second corresponds to what he called Erfahrungsphilosophie or philosophy of experience, which began with Fechner and above all with Lotze\u2019s works on psychology and more particularly on the problem of space perception. Although it does not represent a homogeneous tradition, the philosophy of experience refers to common features of several schools and currents of thought which attempted to bring philosophy closer to natural sciences, and more particularly to the \u201cnew psychology\u201d, which was neglected and relegated to the background by the other tradition. Corresponding to these two orientations are two different ways of doing philosophy: the philosophy of experience starts from below, and like any empirical science, uses the inductive method. They differ from an a priori and speculative approach to philosophy which favors an autocratic regime entirely disconnected from the empirical.\n\nAs B. Russell pointed out in his Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, Stumpf\u2019s main criticism against Kant and a priori philosophy concerns the dichotomy between form and matter, more precisely the postulate of a priori forms of thought and sensibility. This criticism was already clearly formulated in his Raumbuch, where he examined the nativism-empiricism controversy on space perception, prepared some years earlier by Helmholtz in the third book of his Handbuch. This controversy is at the origin of an important division in the middle of the nineteenth century within the new psychology proponents, between empiricism advocated mainly by Helmholtz and Wundt; and nativism which, according to Helmholtz, characterizes the works of Ewald Hering in physiology, the latter of which in fact exercised an influence on the Brentano school and to a certain extent on Gestalt psychology. Instead of using Helmholtz\u2019s terminology, as did most historians, Stumpf preferred the term phenomenology to designate the study of phenomenal experience, which occupied center stage in the field of physiology and psychology. In his Raumbuch Stumpf takes a stand in favor of a moderate form of nativism, according to which space is a unitary sense, its content is perceptible in an immediate and direct way, and it is inseparable from sensory qualities such as color and sound. Consequently, space and color constitute one and the same content, of which they are partial contents or attributes. They are in a relation of logical dependence with the phenomena of which they form a part. Hence, extension and color form a concrete whole which can only be separated through abstraction. From this point of view, the concept of space, as any concept, draws upon its origin in sense perception and is, to use the Scholastic expression, an abstracta cum fundamento in re.\n\nPhilosophy of mind or what is called descriptive psychology represents one of the main axes of Stumpf\u2019s program in philosophy. His treatises in this domain are quite diversified, ranging from animal and developmental psychology to acoustic psychology and Gestalt psychology. Other than his Raumbuch, the book that made Stumpf renowned in psychology is Psychology of Sound (published in two volumes in 1883 and 1890) which was widely received in Germany and England (see reviews by P. Natorp, A. Meinong, T. Lipps and J. Sully). In this book, as in most of his treatises on psychology, Stumpf\u2019s approach is similar to that of Brentano\u2019s descriptive psychology. It differs from experimental and physiological psychology in that it conceptually analyses and describes what physiological psychology explains through the descriptive apparatus of the natural sciences such as biology or physiology. Between these two branches of psychology there is a form of division of labor wherein the first analyses and describes what the other explains. However, descriptive psychology has a methodological priority over experimental psychology in that the analysis and description of the explanandum is a prerequisite to its explanation. The two main tasks assigned to descriptive psychology are the analysis and the classification of mental states (also called acts or mental functions). In his influential study entitled \u201cPhenomena and Mental Functions,\u201d Stumpf shows how phenomena are closely linked in that they form a real unity, which can only be separated by abstraction. He conceives of phenomena as unitary wholes and not as aggregates, and claims that they are perceived as concrete and unitary wholes. As such, phenomena are the contents of sensations that are characterized by certain properties or attributes, for example extension, intensity, brightness, etc., and these contents of sensations are first-order phenomena as opposed to second-order phenomena like \u201cmnemonic images\u201d and phenomena such as color or sound, to the extent that they \u201care merely represented.\u201d Although Stumpf rarely uses the concept of intentionality, one might say that mental functions are distinct from physical phenomena in that they are related to their objects by intentional relations.\n\nPsychical functions have a specific structure that is characterized by the distinction between the content of a function and its relation to an object. This relationship is characterized by the notion of specific content, to which Stumpf refers with the concept of Gebilde (product), and by the quality and matter of an act. In an act of judgment, for example, the quality of an act consists in an affirmation or a negation, and it is characterized linguistically by the copula \u201cis\u201d or its negation. The \u201cmatter\u201d (Materie) of a judgment is what remains when one disregards the affirmation and negation, i.e. the mere complex of presentations (subject and predicate without the copula). In addition to its quality and matter, the judgment conveys a specific \u201cformation\u201d or product (Gebilde) that Stumpf sometimes calls a state of affairs. They are \u201ccorrelates\u201d of thought and distinguish themselves from the individual act, of which they are the content, through their objective character. All other functions, from the simplest to the most complex, have their specific content. For example, the act of abstraction, which is responsible for the formation of concepts, has a concept as its specific content. In the field of more complex functions such as emotion, desire, and will, Stumpf maintains that we must also presuppose specific contents which he calls values.\n\nDescriptive psychology\u2019s second task is the classification of acts or psychical functions. This classification is based on the distinction between two classes of acts: intellectual and emotional functions. All functions that fall under either of these two classes have relationships ranging from the simplest to the most complex, so that functions of the second class presuppose, and are based on, lower level functions of the first class. This class of intellectual functions subsumes all acts ranging from sense perception to judgment. Sense perception in this classification has a particular status because it gives direct access to first-order phenomena and as such it is the function of consciousness (attention) through which something is noticed or apprehended. It serves as the foundation of all functions in that it provides them with their sensory material. Between perception and judgment, there is a series of intermediate acts: the act of presentation, which has as content second order phenomena, the act of abstraction and what Stumpf calls the acts of synthesis, whose specific contents are sets (Inbegriffe).\n\nFrom the class of intellectual functions, Stumpf sets apart the class of feelings or emotional functions. Stumpf\u2019s works in the field of emotions led to a debate with Brentano and were the subject of many discussions, particularly by the American psychologist E. B. Titchener. (E. B. Titchener, 1908, 1927; R. Reisenzein and W. Sch\u00f6npflug, 1992; D. Fisette, 2013) At issue was whether the nature of pleasure provided by an object such as a work of art, for instance, is intentional, as was the case in Brentano\u2019s theory wherein it is closely related to the class of emotions, or phenomenal as in Husserl and the sensualist theories of James and Mach. Stumpf claims that there is a specific difference between sense-feelings (bodily pleasure, pain, etc.) which are sensory qualities like sound and color, and emotions (joy, sadness, anger, disgust, etc.) which are intentional states directed towards states of affairs. Between emotional and intellectual functions, there is the same relation of foundation as that between judgment and perception, since judgment, or more precisely states of affairs, are presupposed by emotional functions which, although more complex, are nevertheless structured in the same way. In addition to emotions, this class of feelings subsumes the acts of desire and will, upon which the field of ethics is based. Between emotions and the will, there is a hierarchy comparable to that of the class of intellectual states, with the difference being however that the phenomenal basis of the class of emotional acts is nothing other than sense-feelings (pleasure and displeasure). Emotions belong to the subclass of passive feelings while desire and will belong to the subclass of active feelings. Feelings are passive in that they have something existent as an object (that is any object of a true judgment) while active feelings are related to a duty (object of a voluntary act). Values are the specific content of the class of active feelings (desire and will) while the contents of an emotion are values. Emotions are evaluative states concerning the content of a judgment and the evaluative element of emotions lies in the positive or negative stand taken with respect to the judged state of affairs. The difference between these two classes of acts lies therefore in their quality, meaning their negative or positive stand (Stellungsnahme) regarding their object: affirmation and negation in the case of judgment, love and hate in the case of the entire class of feelings. The relation of foundation between emotions and judgments or beliefs presupposes, on the one hand, a causal relation between states of belief and valuation (or stand), and on the other hand, an intentional relation between the content of belief and the emotion. From this point of view, jealousy, to use Stumpf\u2019s example, would be a negative stand and a valuation of the state of affairs that a given person possesses and which another person wants or covets for herself, but which she does not possess; and this state is caused by the belief or judgment (true) that this state of affairs exists (besteht).\n\nThe starting point of Stumpf\u2019s classification is the cardinal distinction made in Brentano\u2019s Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint between two classes of phenomena, physical phenomena and mental phenomena, or what Stumpf calls sensory phenomena and psychical functions. (R. Rollinger, 2008b) The domain of psychical functions, to which internal perception gives access, belongs to descriptive psychology which constitutes the foundation of one of the two branches of Stumpf\u2019s classification of sciences, namely the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). Human sciences such as aesthetics and ethics, are closely related to the major classes of the simple functions such as the class of emotions in ethics, for instance, and are defined as the sciences of complex functions. (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 21) The other branch is that of the natural sciences and it is based on physics. In the perspective of Stumpf\u2019s Erfahrungsphilosophie, physics takes as its starting point the phenomena of external perception, and its task is to explain the regularity of phenomena by using the laws of physics. But Stumpf is not a phenomenalist as he advocates instead a form of critical realism that he conceives as the antithesis of phenomenalism such as that which he attributes to classical empiricism and to E. Mach. Nevertheless, Stumpf agrees with the latter that all concepts, including the concept of causality, originate from the contents of sensory experience and are the result of a process of abstraction. However, Stumpf clearly distinguishes the question of the origins of concepts, belonging to descriptive psychology, from the question of the origins and justification of knowledge, which falls within the theory of knowledge. This distinction is at the heart of his habilitation thesis and we shall have the opportunity to return to this important issue.\n\nFrom these two main classes, Stumpf distinguished within his classification three neutral sciences whose task is to study the structure of the contents of psychical functions and sense phenomena in general. Stumpf claims that they represent three different fields of research, corresponding to three distinct sciences: phenomenology as the science of phenomena, eidology which studies formations, and the general theory of relations understood as the science of relations as a whole. These three new sciences are said to be \u201cneutral\u201d with regard to existing sciences and they are \u201cpropaedeutic sciences\u201d in that their field of study represents the raw material and the starting point of the natural sciences as well as the social sciences. To use Stumpf\u2019s terms, they are the atrium and the organon of all sciences and of philosophy.\n\nWhat he calls phenomenology in his two Academy treatises of 1906 is a field of study to which he dedicated many works, from his early work on the origins of space perception up to his 1926 book on vowels and phonetics. The field of phenomenology in Stumpf\u2019s sense is limited to phenomena and their properties and is defined narrowly as the science of phenomena. The study of formations and of objects of thought in general belongs to the second neutral science which Stumpf calls \u201ceidology,\u201d an expression that he borrowed from Herbart. Stumpf first introduced the notion of formation (Gebilde) in 1902 in order to characterize the specific contents of functions or what he also calls the objective correlates of a psychical function. Formations are contents that enter into consciousness through carrying out specific functions in the sense that to every class and subclass of acts there corresponds a certain content specific to each and every act. All psychical functions, from the simplest to the most complex, have their specific contents: concepts, states of affairs and values, to name only the most important. For example the act of abstraction, which is responsible for the formation of concepts, notably the concept of space, has a concept as its own specific content. States of affairs are contents of judgment, and they are comparable to Meinong\u2019s \u201cobjectives\u201d, Husserl\u2019s \u201cobjectivity\u201d or to Bolzano\u2019s \u201cproposition in itself\u201d; they play a central role in Stumpf\u2019s logic as we shall see later. (G. Fr\u00e9chette, 2015; A. Chrudzimski, 2015) These are \u201ccorrelates\u201d of thought and, in contrast to individual acts, they have an objective character. The objectivity of formations, however, is not to be understood in terms of intentional inexistence (Brentano) or in the sense of Platonic realism (Bolzano and Frege), because any formation is logically dependent of the act that produces it, and the existence of states of affairs is logically linked to that of the act of judgment. They are therefore abstracted in the sense that they cannot exist independently from the acts by which they are produced. The same rule can be found in the field of more complex functions such as emotions, desires, and voluntary actions, whose specific contents are values. The very possibility of a neutral science such as eidology shows that we can study values in themselves, independently of any function; yet Stumpf claims that it is not possible to dissociate formations from their original functions.\n\nRelations form the group of objects whose study belongs to the general theory of relations. This theory represents an important part of logic and formal ontology, and its task in fact lies in the study of the laws governing the formal relations between objects and parts of objects. This aspect of the general theory of relations is comparable to Husserl\u2019s pure logic. The relations of structure between psychical functions and the hierarchy within the domain of simple and complex functions obey what Stumpf refers to as the \u201claws of structure\u201d between parts or aspects of a whole. Its task is to establish relations between phenomena, functions, and formations and to investigate the origins of complex relations in simple relations, fixed by means of definition, and to determine the structural laws to which they obey. To these Grundverh\u00e4lnisse or fundamental relations belong, namely, the concepts of analogy, equality and fusion that Stumpf examines succinctly in the second volume of Tonpsychologie, as being the relations of logical and real dependency, the part-whole relations as well as the relations of real dependency between psychical functions. These relations are immanent to phenomena and are noticeable directly and without intermediary. Sensory contents are noticed or remarked in themselves, and each of these relations is, to again use the Scholastic expression, an ens rationis cum fundamento in re. The notion of fusion designates one of the forms of relations that structure the sensory material. It is defined as the relation between two phenomena (or contents of sensation) by virtue of which they do not merely form a sum, but a whole. Stumpf argues that the elements which fuse into the whole, for example quality and intensity of sounds in a melody, are not changed, but this relation of fusion establishes between these contents a narrower unity which is perceptible as a Gestalt. To use the well-known case of the melody, moments of quality and of intensity form in that case a unitary whole which is perceptible as a \u201cquality of form,\u201d and it is precisely the unitary character of this perception, the fact that it is perceptible in one stroke and immediately as unitary form, that Stumpf tries to account for with the aid of the notion of relation of fusion.\n\nWithin this classification of sciences, philosophy is meant to be the ultimate science responsible for the issues common to all sciences, i.e. to the natural and human sciences as a whole, but which are not specifically handled by any per se. That is why philosophy is considered the most general science of all sciences, and is defined \u201cas the science of the most general laws of the mental and of those of reality in general\u201d (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 91). Stumpf reiterates this position in his autobiography:\n\nHowever one may formulate the difference between mind and nature, everybody distinguishes them in some manner. The philosopher, however, looks for what they may have in common. Thus philosophy is primarily the science of things in general, or metaphysics, to which the gateway is epistemology. But if philosophers since olden times have generally regarded psychology as belonging to their proper field is due to the fact that psychical elements have been much more prominent than the physical in forming fundamental metaphysical conceptions. It is therefore to the point to define philosophy as the science of the most common laws of the psychical, and of the real in general (or conversely). This is the only way through which we can justify the inclusion of logic, ethics, aesthetics, the philosophy of law, pedagogy, and other branches in the domain of the philosophical sciences; the connecting link is always essentially psychology, which must not therefore forget \u2013 when absorbed in experimental detail \u2013 the nobler phenomena of mental life that cannot be investigated in this manner and the great general questions. (Stumpf, 1924, p. 414\u2013415)\n\nPhilosophy thus understood is first philosophy insofar as its main task is to investigate the laws that provide the cohesion and unity between mind and nature. It is closely related to metaphysics or to what Stumpf also calls \u201cmetapsychics\u201d to the extent that it presupposes psychology as much as physics. But unlike traditional metaphysics, which is thought of a priori, Stumpf\u2019s view of metaphysics, as he repeatedly imparted since his first lectures on metaphysics in W\u00fcrzburg, is based on experience insofar as it is continuous with the empirical sciences and proceeds inductively, i.e. according to a bottom-up approach. (D. Fisette, 2015c)\n\nStumpf\u2019s contribution to metaphysics has been the subject of recent studies, (K. Schuhmann, 1999; D. Jacquette 2000\u20132001; R. Rollinger, 2008b; R. Martinelli, 2011, 2015) and his lectures on metaphysics delivered in Halle in the late 1880s has been recently published. (C. Stumpf, 2015) He distinguished following Brentano four main branches of metaphysics: transcendental philosophy, which focuses on the justification of our knowledge of the external world, ontology whose domain includes, in addition to the categories, the topic of psychophysical relations and that of causality among other things; thirdly, theology which is concerned with the evidence of the existence of a foundation of the world, and finally, cosmology which deals namely with issues related to the actual infinite.\n\nStumpf focuses particularly in his writings on two specific topics related to the domain of ontology (D. Jacquette, 2000\u20132001, R. Martinelli, 2015), namely the categories and psychophysical relations. In Erkenntnislehre, he examines the categories of thing (substance), cause, necessity (legality), truth, reality, equality, and number (Stumpf 1939\u20131940, p. 13) and claims that these Grundbegriffe or categories have their origin in (internal and external) perception. This is primarily the case for the concept of necessity which is at the heart of his critique of psychologism. Stumpf agrees with Hume and J. S. Mill that we cannot observe necessary relations in nature, but he argues that internal perception provides us with many cases of necessary relations such as mathematical axioms, or in the perception of three consecutive sounds where one of them is necessarily intermediate (as to the pitch) between the other two. (Stumpf, 1939, p. 48) The concept of necessity, as the concept of causality, is formed through a process of abstraction and can then be used, hypothetically, to explain natural events based on causal laws. Moreover, we also find in Stumpf an original account of tropes which influenced the young Husserl. (R. Rollinger, 2015)\n\nThe second metaphysical topic to which Stumpf attaches great importance in his writings is that of psychophysical relations. Unlike most of his contemporaries, including Brentano and Husserl, Stumpf unequivocally rejects the doctrine of psychophysical parallelism according to which the physical and the psychological are aspects of one and the same reality and advocates, following Lotze, a form of interactionism that rejects monism in favour of dualism. The position that Stumpf defends in \u201cLeib und Seele\u201d and in his two studies on Spinoza, may be summed up by the following excerpt taken from his posthumous book:\n\nThe discredited dualism however, according to which everything in the world, including the mental and physical, stands in thoroughgoing interaction (directly or indirectly), now appears as the true monism. According to interactionism, the world, despite the diversity of its parts, is a unified organic whole. Thus the parallelistic view proves to be impractical and contradictory, and the theory of interaction therefore remains, for the time being, the best guide through the maze of this great problem. (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, p. 822)\n\nOne of Stumpf\u2019s arguments in favour of interactionism and against parallelism is Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution (Stumpf, 1910, p. 78\u201379) to which he attaches great importance since the 1880s (E. Valentine, 2000) In an article entitled \u201cDer Entwicklungsgedanke in der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Philosophie,\u201d Stumpf compares the bearing of Darwin\u2019s theory on science to that of the Copernican revolution in astronomy. (Stumpf, 1899a) Stumpf\u2019s interest in Darwin\u2019s theory is clearly expressed in his work on psychophysical relations, the origins of music, animal psychology as well as in those on child development.\n\nIn his lecture on metaphysics as in his paper \u201cLeib und Seele,\u201d Stumpf\u2019s main target is Mach\u2019s phenomenalism and neutral monism, which amounts to reducing physical objects and subjectivity to functional relations between sensations (or elements) and inevitably leads, according to Stumpf, to idealism and solipsism. Stumpf published in 1919 a very interesting study on Spinoza\u2019s parallelism in which he proposes an original and unorthodox interpretation of Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. He argues that Spinoza\u2019s parallelism, if understood correctly, has nothing to do with the psychophysical parallelism which was dominant at that time since Fechner. According to Stumpf, the heart of Spinoza\u2019s parallelism rests on the distinction between act (or mental state) and the immanent object towards which it is directed. (Stumpf 1919b, p. 19) This act-content parallelism has its source in Aristotle and has been inherited by Brentano and Husserl via many philosophers from Thomas Aquinas to Descartes and Spinoza. Stumpf argues that this interpretation is consistent with Spinoza\u2019s pantheism insofar as the distinction between the act and its immanent content has been transposed to God in Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. For since God\u2019s intellect is considered by Spinoza as the only possible subject, intentional acts and contents are then necessarily two of his numerous modes or attributes. (see R. Martinelli, 2011) Despite his critique of psychophysical parallelism, Stumpf advocates, like Spinoza, a form of pantheism that is consistent with his deterministic and mechanical conception of nature. In Erkenntnislehre, Stumpf recalls that pantheism is a view that he adopted in 1876 in the course of several discussions with Brentano on theism and this was the position that he already advocated in his lectures on metaphysics in W\u00fcrzburg and later in Halle. Stumpf\u2019s main argument against theism is its inability to satisfactorily resolve the problem of evil in the world. However, as Stumpf pointed out in Erkenntnislehre (1939\u20131940, p. 681, 798, 17), in his last writings, Brentano seems to adopt a form of pantheism similar to that of Spinoza. (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, p. 798)\n\nThe recent publication of Stumpf\u2019s habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Grunds\u00e4tze der Mathematik raises many questions which have been the subject of recent commentaries. (D. M\u00fcnch, 2002\u20132003; W. Ewen, 2008; C. Ierna, 2015). Stumpf\u2019s habilitation thesis focuses on the nature and origins of mathematical principles or axioms. Its starting point rests on the following question:\n\nIs there knowledge of scientific importance, which is in no way based immediately nor mediately on experience; and if there is such knowledge, what is its source? (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 1\u20131)\n\nThe habilitation thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, Stumpf examines two antagonistic positions which prevailed at the time, namely J. S. Mill\u2019s empiricism according to which there is no knowledge that is not mediately acquired by induction, and Kantian transcendentalism which claims that our knowledge of the general principles of mathematics is based on synthetic a priori judgments. Stumpf rejects both accounts and seeks to show, in the second part of his thesis, that axioms and mathematical propositions are analytic a priori; they are not acquired through experience but are the result of a process of deduction from concepts.\n\nIn the critical part of his work, Stumpf raises the problem of the origins of the laws and principles of logic and mathematics as follows: if these principles are inductive in nature, as Mill believes them to be, then they do not constitute necessary truths; if, on the contrary, they are necessary truths, then the question arises as to whether they are synthetic a priori judgments as Kant claims or analytic a priori propositions as Stumpf claims. Against Mill, Stumpf argues that the axioms are not the result of empirical generalization based on an inductive process, and that arithmetic, like geometry, is a deductive science based on a priori and necessary truths, which are justified by the evidence of internal perception. (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 5\u20134) Stumpf therefore agrees with Kant that axioms are necessary truths, but he denies that they are based on synthetic a priori judgments. Stumpf argues rather that Kant\u2019s synthetic judgments presuppose a kind of \u201cmental machinery\u201d (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 16\u20133) in order to account for their formation, as they involve numerous assumptions, notably the a priori forms of sensibility, intuition, and Denkformen, which Stumpf takes to be mere constructions. Stumpf criticizes Kant especially for the thesis according to which the origins of the necessity of our knowledge of axioms lie in intuition, in that knowledge of mathematics then becomes dependent upon experience. However, Stumpf argues that intuition understood in the Kantian sense is inductive and only leads to concepts and never to propositions. That is why Stumpf claims that the very idea of synthetic a priori judgments is a contradiction in terms. Axioms and propositions are analytic judgments constructed deductively from concepts. We can see that Stumpf\u2019s fundamental argument against empiricism and transcendental criticism rests on the fundamental distinction between concept and proposition, which are of major philosophical significance in Stumpf\u2019s subsequent work on the theory of knowledge, as we will later see. In his habilitation thesis, Stumpf is more concerned with delimiting the field of logic and mathematics from that of psychology. In this regard, Stumpf clearly separates the question of the origins of concepts, which is a psychological question, from the logico-mathematical domain to which propositions and axioms belong. For, as Stumpf argues in his posthumous work, one can agree with empiricism on the psychological origin of concepts while acknowledging that there is a priori knowledge which is independent from experience. (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, p. 126) For Stumpf admits that the basic concepts of arithmetic (the concept of number) and geometry (the concept of space) have their origins in experience. In his Raumbuch, published three years after his habilitation thesis, Stumpf attempts to demonstrate the thesis that the concept of space has psychological origins. However, the position one takes on this issue is distinct from that which one adopts regarding the nature of propositions and necessary truths in the logico-mathematical domain. For, in this domain, one is solely concerned with axioms and propositions, which can be deductively inferred, and one also assumes the origins of the axioms and their justification as necessary truths. Stumpf argued in 1870 that these axioms are analytic a priori propositions and that arithmetic and geometry are deductive sciences.\n\nThere is a remarkable continuity in the work of Stumpf regarding his positions from his habilitation thesis up to his posthumous work, not only on the foundation of mathematics but also on the theory of knowledge. One of the main theses he advocates in Erkenntnislehre is based on the distinction between the origins of concepts and the origins of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, \u00a7 1) Stumpf revisits the theme of mathematical axioms (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201313) in the context of a critical discussion of Husserl\u2019s doctrine of formal and regional ontologies. Stumpf\u2019s conception of the concept of number in Erkenntnislehre is the same as the one he advocated in his habilitation thesis and in his Halle lectures, and Stumpf\u2019s position is very similar to that of Brentano and his students. (W. Ewen, 2008, p 162 f.; C. Ierna, 2015) In this regard, Stumpf\u2019s influence on his student Husserl\u2019s habilitation thesis regarding the origins of the concept of number, including Husserl\u2019s conception of symbolic presentations, is to be considered. (D. M\u00fcnch, 2002, pp. 31\u201337)\n\nNow, what is the place of mathematics in Stumpf\u2019s classification of sciences? This question was left open in our earlier remarks because the classification criteria we used were based on the cardinal distinction between phenomena and psychical functions, which underlies the main division between natural and social sciences. But as Stumpf pointed out in his paper \u201cOn the Classification of Sciences\u201d, contrary to the method with which most classifications that are meant to be normative proceed, a classification that describes the state of a science as it is practiced at a given time in the history cannot rely on a single criterion of classification, and its task is to show how several criteria are intertwined in many ways (C. Stumpf, 1906a, p. 88). This is why one must rely on a new criterion based on the distinction between a priori and a posteriori methods in order to delineate mathematics, including geometry, from the other sciences. Indeed:\n\nThe most tangible characteristic that is offered to us to delineate the mathematical sciences from all other sciences is that of the differences in method, i.e. the a priori method as opposed to the a posteriori method. Despite the opposing effort to assimilate mathematics to the natural sciences, this distinction persists, and in my opinion, rightly so. The attempt made by J. St. Mill to inductively derive the principles of mathematics (and logic) from a collection of several individual experiences manifestly runs in circles. (C. Stumpf, 1906a, p. 65)\n\nThis applies a fortiori to geometry which Stumpf, unlike Kant, refuses to ground on the concept of intuition insofar as it is an analytic a priori science, like any other branches of mathematics. The position he advocates in 1906 is therefore not different from the one he advocated thirty-five years earlier in his habilitation thesis. (Ewen, 2008, p. 157ff.) As an a priori science, one could say that mathematics is actually presupposed by all other sciences as Stumpf suggests in referring positively to Auguste Comte\u2019s hierarchy of the positive sciences. (C. Stumpf, 1906a, p. 88) For, according to Comte, the hierarchy between sciences within his classification presupposes that all sciences, from physics to physiology, logically depend on mathematics, that is, the most simple science, and is the most autonomous with regard to all other sciences. In this regard, Stumpf here adopts a position akin to that of Brentano who followed Comte\u2019s criteria on the matter of the classification of sciences, with the important difference being that psychology replaces sociology within Brentano\u2019s system of sciences and that the field of psychical functions is, according to Stumpf, independent from all other sciences. (D. Fisette, 2015d; 2018b)\n\nThe theory of knowledge occupies a central place in Stumpf\u2019s philosophy in his later works, especially in Erkenntnislehre, and we know that this discipline has always been at the heart of his teaching up to the end of his career in Berlin. We saw that Stumpf associates it both with the neutral sciences and the foundation of knowledge, specifically with the ultimate justification of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, p. 7, 124) One of the central questions of the theory of knowledge is psychologism, which is the main topic in Stumpf\u2019s article \u201cPsychology and the Theory of Knowledge.\u201d (D. M\u00fcnch, 2002; G. Fr\u00e9chette, 2013) Stumpf advocates a form of critical realism that he specifically opposes to Kantian idealism, and which maintains that the outside world is always the object of a supposition or hypothesis. Moreover, he claims that the only material that we have for formulating such an hypothesis are the concepts drawn from experience that enable us \u201cto calculate the course of events.\u201d One of the main tasks of the theory of knowledge, therefore, is to account for the most general modes of knowledge of the outside world. (Stumpf, 1891, p. 503) Stumpf distinguishes the theory of knowledge as a field of study from that of psychology on the basis of the cardinal distinction between the domain of concepts and that of propositions or necessary truths, as elaborated in his habilitation thesis.\n\nInquiry on the origins of concepts, as we said, is a task specific to psychology. In contrast, the theory of knowledge is limited to the research and justification of \u201cthe most general and immediately evident truths\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 501), such as laws and axioms necessary for knowledge. Yet, these axioms are nothing but propositions that we assume to be true and necessary, and they have their origin in the content of a specific class of psychical functions, namely judgments. Since the contents of judgments are formations or products (Gebilde) which, as we said, belong to eidology, the field of research of the theory of knowledge is therefore linked to that of this neutral science which also includes states of affairs. One must therefore avoid confusing the question pertaining to the nature of axioms with that of the psychological origins of concepts, but one can no more entirely separate the theory of knowledge from descriptive psychology since axioms are originally the contents of a specific class of psychical functions, i.e. the contents of judgments or of propositional attitudes whose justification is the task of the theory of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1891, p. 495\u2013496; 1939\u20131940, p 124)\n\nIn light of this distinction, one can better understand the significance of the debate on psychologism such as Stumpf describes it in his 1891 paper. Stumpf opposes two schools of thought on the question of the relationship between the theory of knowledge and psychology: Kantian criticism that dissociates the theory of knowledge from psychology, and psychologism which Stumpf defines in this paper as \u201cthe reduction of all philosophical investigation, and especially all epistemological investigations, to psychology.\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 468) The argument in favour of psychologism boils down to the idea that \u201cknowledge is itself a mental process and accordingly the study of its conditions would be a psychological investigation.\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 468) Critics of psychologism, on the other hand, argue that a psychological investigation can never lead to \u201cknowledge of general and necessary truths.\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 469) Now since the conditions of possibility of knowledge, i.e. the forms of intuition and thought, are themselves a priori and therefore not analysable (Stumpf, 1891, p. 493), psychology is therefore useless for Kantian criticists.\n\nThe position adopted by Stumpf in this debate consists in conceding to criticism that necessary truths are irreducible to facts while admitting, with psychologists, that psychology is essential to the theory of knowledge. Hence the main mistake he attributes to Kantianism, which consists in refusing the assistance of psychological research in the theory of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1891, p. 493, 500) The field of psychology is understood here in a sense that is broad enough as to include sensory phenomena and mental functions because, in 1891, Stumpf did not explicitly distinguish the field of phenomenology from that of descriptive psychology. Now the main criticism he addresses to Kant focuses on the dichotomy between form and matter, and it is primarily the Kantian doctrine of phenomena (the manifold of intuition) that he holds responsible for its most obvious \u201cmistakes.\u201d In this article, Stumpf reiterates the main criticism that he addressed to Kant in his Raumbuch, namely \u201cthe doctrine of space as a subjective form and the Kantian conception of sensations as amorphous and unstructured matter designed to support the synthetic and unifying activity of the understanding.\u201d (Stumpf, 1873, p. 15 f.)\n\nHowever, this criticism of the Kantian theory of knowledge does not make Stumpf an advocate of psychologism. For Stumpf acknowledges with critical philosophy that we must maintain a strict concept of necessity and thus oppose the reduction of the principles and laws of logic and of science in general to simple empirical generalizations. Stumpf here refers explicitly to J. S. Mill, and maintains that the laws of nature and the principles of logic such as the principle of non-contradiction, for example, cannot be obtained merely by induction and are irreducible as such to the process of empirical generalization or \u201can accumulation of observations.\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 499\u2013500) This raises the question as to what is the relationship between the position adopted by Stumpf in his 1891 article on the debate on psychologism and the position adopted by Husserl and Frege on the same issue several years later. M\u00fcnch (2002, p. 50) argues that Stumpf\u2019s position not only comes close to that of Husserl, but it also constitutes the background of Husserl\u2019s critique of psychologism in his Logical Investigations. Ewen (2008, pp. 13, 22) argues instead that Stumpf is closer to the anti-psychologistic positions of Frege. But since they do not provide a clear definition of what is meant by \u201cpsychologism\u201d and do not clearly present Stumpf\u2019s, Frege\u2019s, and Husserl\u2019s respective arguments against psychologism, there is no way to settle this debate at the moment. (D. Fisette, 2015a)\n\nThat being said, there are parallels that can be drawn between the positions of Stumpf and of Frege on the foundations of mathematics and on psychologism. (see W. Ewen, 2008, p. 97 f.) Several attempts have been recently made to explain these parallels, and these accounts all focus on their mutual relationship with Lotze during their stay in G\u00f6ttingen in the early 1870s, while Stumpf, after his habilitation, was Privatdozent (1870\u20131873), and Frege pursued his studies in mathematics (1871\u20131873). Although it can be assumed that the two philosophers met during this period, we have no written evidence that confirms this. (W. Ewen, 2008, p. 97 f.) Historical testimony does not say whether Frege attended Stumpf\u2019s lectures in G\u00f6ttingen on Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics, which he taught for three consecutive years, or his lectures on \u201cinductive logic with a particular focus on the problem of natural science\u201d that he taught during the summer semester of 1873. Nevertheless, the correspondence that Frege and Stumpf exchanged in the early 1880s seems to testify that the two philosophers knew each other. In any case, an explanation of the elective affinities between Stumpf and Frege might be found in the work of Lotze. (Stumpf, 1918, p. 7; D. Fisette, 2015a)\n\nStumpf did not publish any specific work on the topic of logic and wrote only a few pieces on language. These are however two topics in which Stumpf was very much interested. The topic of language was central in his 1876 paper on Anton Marty\u2019s dissertation entitled \u00dcber den Ursprung der Sprache (A. Marty, 1875; L. Cesalli, 2015). Also worth mentioning is an essay on the psychology of music in England (1885) and his book Die Anf\u00e4nge der Musik (1911) in which he discussed, in relation to Spencer and Darwin, the thesis of the linguistic origin of music. Finally he made a significant contribution to the field of phonology and conducted an extensive research on the nature of vowels and linguistic sounds, and this led to the publication of his book Die Sprachlaute (1926) in which he experimentally confirms Helmholtz\u2019s principles on the theory of vowels. As to the domain of logic, there are many syllabi and extensive lecture notes, including those written by Husserl during his studies in Halle, which again show a direct influence from Brentano (K. Schuhmann, 1996, 1997; R. Rollinger, 2015). We know that logic is closely related to Stumpf\u2019s theory of relations and eidology, which are central in both his philosophical and empirical works. More precisely, his contribution to logic in these two research areas concerns in fact the specific content of judgment (belief) or what he also calls states of affairs, and that part of the theory of relations pertaining to part-whole relations. The first leads to a theory of the states of affairs while the second was useful in developing a formal ontology, one that was central in the logic of his student Husserl. Finally, mention should be made of Stumpf\u2019s publications on the relationship between logic and the theory of probabilities, and his research pertaining to the elaboration of a theory of induction. He claimed that the application of probability concepts does not involve any presuppositions about the external world and the law of causality, for the calculus of probability is purely a priori and is solely derived from the concept of probability itself.\n\nRegarding his lectures on logic, while he accepted Brentano\u2019s important distinction between what a statement expresses and what it means, he did not subscribe to Brentano\u2019s central thesis on the reduction of categorical to existential statements. The meaning of a sentence corresponds to the content of a function, and it is distinct from the quality and matter of a predicative judgment. The quality of an act of judgment consists in its affirmation or negation, its acceptance or rejection of the matter of a judgment expressed linguistically by the copula \u201cis\u201d or its negation. The matter (Materie) of a judgment, which is provided by the lower level act of presentation, is what remains when one disregards the affirmation and negation, i.e. the simple complex of presentation (subject and predicate minus the copula). In addition to its quality and matter, a judgment has a content and a state of affairs, the latter roughly corresponding to what we call a proposition. Stumpf conceives a state of affairs both as a specific content of judgment and as its objective and necessary correlate, which is expressed linguistically in \u201csubordinate clauses\u201d or in the form of a \u201csubstantivized infinitive.\u201d It therefore corresponds to what Stumpf called axioms. The truth of a statement is defined as the correspondence of the judgment quality to its content, that is, the property of a judicative content by virtue of which acceptance (or its opposite, rejection) is prompted by purely objective motives. This concept of truth is grounded in the evidence of internal perception (is true what is mediately or immediately self-evident), which also plays a central role in his theory of knowledge.\n\nThe study of the structures of the contents of judgment as such, apart from its functions and contingent states, is one of the tasks Stumpf assigns to this part of eidology which he calls the theory of states of affairs. (A. Chrudzimski, 2015) One of Stumpf\u2019s original contributions to logic rests on the notion of state of affairs, which was already used in the history of philosophy and especially by Lotze. (B. Smith, 1989, \u00a7 2) Stumpf already used this notion in his lectures on logic in 1888 (Q 13, p. 4), and it is now well-known that it has been subsequently taken over by many philosophers including Husserl and Wittgenstein. In 1906, Stumpf associates it with the concept of formation or product (Gebilde) and applies it to both intellectual and emotional functions, where in the latter case it is conceived as a value (also called Wertverhalt) on which ethics and practical philosophy in general are based. These Gebilde are objective entities that are related both to the concept of objective in Meinong, to that of objectity in Husserl, and to Bolzano\u2019s concept of \u201cproposition in itself.\u201d (Stumpf, 1906b, p. 30) For this student of Lotze, the doctrine of Gebilde is not incompatible with the Platonic theory of ideas though \u201cwithout its metaphysical conclusions.\u201d (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 33) One can certainly entertain a formation such as a state of affairs without having it as an actual content of judgment, but it is then a mere abstraction. Because, says Stumpf, \u201cthe state of affairs cannot be immediately given for itself independently of any mental function, and therefore effectively. It can only be real as the content of a judgment that is actually taking place. [\u2026] So, functions (and indeed only the conscious functions which are properly present) are facts immediately known, while the Gebilde are facts only regarded as contents of functions.\u201d (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 32) Objectivism is an important issue in Stumpf\u2019s philosophy since it serves as one of his main arguments against psychologism.\n\nStates of affairs are, as any other formation, governed by general and necessary laws, and are independent of the individual and the contingent act of judging. These structural laws or axioms as he calls them in his Erkenntnislehre govern relations between elementary psychical formations. Stumpf distinguishes between formal axioms, which apply to any objects, and material or regional axioms which belong to specific domains of objects such as the domain of phenomenology (structural relations between phenomena) and that of psychology (structural relations between elementary psychical functions). Of particular interest to logic are the axioms of consequence (Folgerungsaxiome), which are expressed in propositions and which establish a relation between the premises and the conclusion in terms of necessary inference.\n\nIn his second address as rector of the University of Berlin in 1908, Stumpf (1910c) expressed his opposition to formalism and moral skepticism and argued for an ethics based on an objective theory of values. It will be recalled that values are specific contents of acts belonging to the class of emotional functions or feelings and that they resemble the contents of judgment that belong to the class of intellectual functions. Ethics, like aesthetics, is grounded entirely on the class of feelings. Echoing Lotze\u2019s distinction between passive and active feelings, Stumpf argues that emotions are passive feelings as opposed to active feelings which are directed towards a duty, a project, or an intention to be achieved through voluntary actions. Values or value-feelings, which are essential for an ethics worthy of this name, refer to the specific contents of will or voluntary actions. Moral actions, as opposed to instinctive or mechanical behavior, presuppose knowledge since this class of acts is grounded on judgments that in turn are at the foundation of theoretical knowledge. Just as true judgment, moral behavior differs from blind actions by the insight or self-evidence that is to the content of a feeling (value) what theoretical self-evidence is to a state of affairs. And just as the truth in logic, goodness or what is worthy of being wanted or desired is based on intrinsic and objective values that are immune to any external forces.\n\nIn the general field of musicology, in addition to his numerous studies on acoustics, which for the most part have been collected in his Beitr\u00e4ge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft, and his book of 1926 Sprachlaute (cf. B. Pompino-Marschall, 2003), those on ethnomusicology (cf. G. Schw\u00f6rer-Kohl, 2011), published in his Sammelb\u00e4nde f\u00fcr vergleichende Musikwissenschaft, whose fourth volume contains the study on Romanian folk music by the famous composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (1922\u20131923; V. Lampert, 2008), we owe to Stumpf several studies on the history of music. (Stumpf, 1885, 1896, 1897, 1911) In his autobiography, Stumpf listed his work in this field and stressed the importance of his contribution in two of his works:\n\nTo the systematic science of music belong, besides my works on physical and psychological acoustics, especially the treatise, Psychology of Music in England, and the book about the beginnings of music. In the treatise, which is an introduction to the later works on Tonpsychologie, I discussed the relation of music to language, and that of human speech to the utterances of animals \u2013 with reference to Spencer and Darwin \u2013 but also the exaggerated nativism of Gurney (power of sound), who practically ignored all genetic explanations and focused only on the erotic feelings of animal ancestors. (Stumpf, 1924, p. 438\u2013439)\n\nHis classic work, The Origins of Music, made known notably by the famous anthropologist and linguist Edward Sapir (1912) thanks to his positive review of this work in 1912, has recently been published in English. (see E. M. von Hornbostel, 1933; M. M\u00fcller, 2003; A. Simon, 2000; H. de la Motte-Haber, 2011) This book is the culmination of more than twenty five years of empirical and theoretical research in the field of musicology and is divided into two main parts: the first, entitled \u201cThe Origin and Archetypes of Music Making\u201d deals with the theoretical aspects of the debates at the time on this issue. Three theories on the origin of music are discussed, namely that of Darwin, that advocated independently by Rousseau, Herder, and Spencer, and finally that of Wallaschek and K. B\u00fccher. All these theories are rejected in favour of that proposed by Stumpf in the second chapter entitled \u201cThe Origin and Archetypes of Singing.\u201d Stumpf\u2019s theory is based mainly on the famous concept of fusion that he developed in his Psychology of Sound. The third chapter entitled \u201cPrimitive Instruments and their Influence\u201d traces the history of musical instruments among primitive peoples. In Chapter IV \u201cPolyphony, Rhythm, and Intoned,\u201d Stumpf examines the music of primitive peoples with regard to the forms of polyphony, rhythm, and the relation between song and speech. (see Deutsch, Sommer and Willam, 2003) The last chapter \u201cPaths of Development\u201d consists in a study of the different stages of the development of music. The second part of the book, \u201cSongs of Primitive Peoples\u201d is a study of music among primitive peoples in different countries of the world, and is based on several songs of which Stumpf offers the transcription and a detailed musical analysis. (H. G\u00fcnther, 2003)\n\nMoreover, although Stumpf has devoted only one article specifically to the theme of aesthetics, this topic is raised very frequently in his work, namely in his book Gef\u00fchl und Gef\u00fchlsempfindung which includes three of his papers on emotions and sense feelings (Stumpf, 1928b; C. Allesch, 2014, 2003). This issue led to a long discussion in his correspondence with Brentano on whether pleasure, and aesthetic pleasure procured by a work of art, is intentional or phenomenal in nature. In his article \u201cAesthetic Enjoyment and Tragedy,\u201d Stumpf summarizes the problem of aesthetics as follows:\n\nEvery work of art bears within itself its primary purpose [which consists] in the production of an aesthetic enjoyment. And here, in this immediate effect, lies the enigma. (Stumpf, 1910a, p. 5)\n\nThis action or effect (Wirkung) of the artwork is immediate in a way comparable, for instance, to the experience that we have of pain, and is independent of any difference in culture, specialized knowledge of contemplated objects or worldview (historical, cultural or other). Stumpf acknowledges that sensations can act aesthetically on a subject without any conceptual thought or representation. However, the full aesthetic sentiment is forced upon us when and only if sensations and combinations of sensations \u201care entangled in an act of relational thinking.\u201d That is to say, \u201can aesthetic affect presupposes a judgment on a state of affairs, on a fact.\u201d (1899, p. 8) The feeling of pleasure is immediately linked to an activity as sensory pleasure to sensations, but it is not yet an emotion in the strict sense. For there to be an emotion in the experience of enjoyment (Entz\u00fccken) of a work of art, the relations intuited in a unitary and immediate way must become an object of consciousness, and therefore an intentional object. Hence the dual origin (or source) of aesthetic experience: the first is what he calls the fullness (F\u00fclle) of the formal relations among the parts of a true work of art, while the second is derived from the properties of the object or, more precisely, the state of affairs. (Stumpf, 1899, p 8; 1924, p 54) The first source is phenomenological and resides in the formal relations which are given directly to consciousness. The second source is more complex in that it presupposes the processing of the phenomena and sensory data through judgment. (Stumpf, 1926, p. 2\u20133) These two sources, however, form a unitary content that can only be distinguished by abstraction.\n\nThe works and teachings of Stumpf in the field of emotions have had some influence on the literary work of the young Robert Musil. We know that Musil went to Berlin in 1903 to undertake his studies in philosophy, physics and mathematics. In 1908, he successfully defended, under the direction of Stumpf, a doctoral thesis on the work of Ernst Mach (R. Musil, 1908; R. Haller, 2003). Another important aspect of their relationship concerns Stumpf\u2019s influence on Musil\u2019s literary work, which gave rise to a vast literature. One of the important sources of Musil\u2019s early novels and theoretical fragments is the work of Traugott K. Oesterreich (1910) who wrote his doctoral dissertation in 1905 under the supervision of Stumpf. Another source is Stumpf\u2019s theory of emotions, which he presented in his articles of 1899 and 1907 (Stumpf, 1928b) and his lectures on psychology given during the winter semester of 1906\u20131907 in which he attaches great importance to the theme of sense feelings and emotions. It is more than likely that Musil attended these lectures.\n\nStumpf\u2019s scientific contribution to the field of empirical psychology has been in recent years highlighted by several studies. In addition to the numerous studies that explore Stumpf\u2019s relationship to psychologists such as K\u00fclpe (W. Baumgartner, 1997), Herbart (M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 2009, 2010, 2011; S. Poggi, 2014), Helmholtz (H.-P. Reinecke, 2003) Wundt (U. Wolfradt, 2011), or to H. Ebbinghaus (see U. Wolfradt & M. Kaiser-El-Safti (eds.), 2010), several other studies have highlighted Stumpf\u2019s diversified contribution to several sub-disciplines of psychology, including the psychology of sound, Gestalt psychology, animal psychology, the psychology of child development, etc. Stumpf\u2019s most important contribution in the field of psychology \u2013 understood in the narrow sense of the science of psychical functions \u2013 is his Psychology of Sound published in two volumes. (Stumpf, 1883, 1890) The first volume deals with individual sound judgments while the second, dedicated to Brentano, studies the consciousness of simultaneous sounds. According to his initial proposal, Stumpf\u2019s project was to write two more volumes. The third was to focus on musical phenomena such as consonance, dissonance, accords, melodies, etc., while he had planned to study feelings generated by sound (Tongef\u00fchle) in the fourth. Part of his research on these issues was published separately in his Beitr\u00e4ge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft (9 volumes).\n\nThis complex and unfinished work attracted much interest at the time and was reviewed by philosophers such as Meinong and Natorp and by psychologists such as J. Sully, H. Ebbinghaus, and especially W. Wundt who, in his anonymous review of the first volume of the book, criticized Stumpf\u2019s method and the hypothesis of the relativity of sensations to judgment. (see C. Allesch, 2003) Let us recall, however, that this book is not a phenomenological study of sounds but rather a study pertaining to \u201cjudgments about sounds,\u201d and it belongs therefore to the field of psychology in the narrow sense. (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 31) Stumpf makes it clear, however, that the judgment in question is not categorical but it is a judgment of a particular type which he calls apprehension or apperception. Stumpf claims moreover that there are sensory contents which are not related to judgments or any other mental functions such as space as he had demonstrated in his Raumbuch. (see J. Bouveresse, 2006) Two important contributions from Stumpf in this book (Kaiserl-El-Safti, 2011, pp. 38\u201339) rely on the famous concept of fusion (Verschmelzung) by which he characterizes the phenomenon of consonance, which in turn constitutes the foundation of music, and the theory of relations that Stumpf develops in the first volume of this work. (Stumpf, 1883, \u00a7 6) This theory of fusion led to a debate with Brentano (see C. Allesch 2003, R. Martinelli, 2013) and the importance of this notion in Husserl\u2019s phenomenology is well-known, particularly in relation to the latter\u2019s conception of figural moments. (C. Ierna, 2009)\n\nIn the field of psychology, Stumpf\u2019s name is also associated with the famous case of Clever Hans, which aroused great interest in the early twentieth century, and which represented a significant step in the development of experimental psychology. (H. Baranzke, 2001 W. Prinz, 2006 H. Gundlach, 2006) We know that Stumpf\u2019s assistant, O. Pfungst devoted an entire book to the case of Clever Hans in which he presented the results of the investigation that he and Stumpf conducted. (Stumpf, 1907a, pp. 7\u201315) Similarly, Stumpf contributed to the foundation of the anthropoid station in Tenerife where K\u00f6hler (1925) conducted his well-known research on chimpanzees. Stumpf was also interested in other similar phenomena, such as the study of child prodigies like Pepito Arriola and many others. He founded in 1901 the Society for Child Psychology and contributed two studies on that topic (Stumpf, 1900, 1901)\n\nThe work of Carl Stumpf has aroused much interest since the turn of the twenty-first century. Over the past fifteen years, in addition to the publication of numerous translations and reprints of Stumpf\u2019s writings, several articles and books have been devoted to examining and evaluating the different aspects of his work. The recent reception of Stumpf\u2019s work is very diversified and it reflects the interdisciplinary nature of his research and his many accomplishments at an academic as well as an institutional level. (G. Fr\u00e9chette, 2010; M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 2011; D. Fisette 2015a)\n\nAt the very end of his autobiography, Stumpf confesses that he never sought to establish a school and that he is grateful to those of his students who pursued their research based on their own plans in the same scientific spirit. Stumpf\u2019s words are confirmed by the testimonies of many of his students who all shared this scientific spirit and described Stumpf as a model of precision and clarity in thought and observation, with a keen sense for analysis and a critical attitude towards his own philosophical thought. If indeed he did not establish a school, he is however responsible for the formation of outstanding researchers and philosophers, and he has contributed directly to the development of two of the most important movements in Germany at the beginning of the twentieth century: Gestalt psychology and phenomenology. But Stumpf also counts as one of the harshest critics of these two movements as evidenced in his Erkenntnislehre, a posthumous work in which he presents the essential elements of his Weltanschauung and, in a sense, his philosophical testament. Let us remember that this book is dedicated to Brentano and can therefore be considered a contribution, the last in importance in the school of Brentano, to the philosophical program of his mentor. It is not surprising, therefore, that the criticism he addressed to his own students in this work was mainly motivated by this program.\n\nIn this work, he offers a remarkably penetrating analysis of the philosophical project that guided Husserl in the first book of Ideas. From Stumpf\u2019s perspective, the originality of this new version of phenomenology in Ideas I lies less in the aspects in which he criticizes the doctrine of the Logical Investigations whereby phenomenology is defined as descriptive psychology than in the features by which Husserl opens up new perspectives with respect to descriptive psychology and phenomenology in Stumpf\u2019s sense. This is the case of phenomenology understood as a doctrine of essences, whose aim is to ground the empirical sciences on the so-called regional ontologies. This endeavor belongs to the more general project of a general theory of science which Husserl worked out in this work. Stumpf understands this project as a widening of Brentano\u2019s and Lotze\u2019s initial program which, according to him, is nothing other than a regional phenomenology or ontology in the sense of Husserl. However, he does not see any progress in the idea of a \u201cpure\u201d or transcendental phenomenology nor in the postulate of a pure ego to which something like a \u201crein Ichblick\u201d is purported to give access. For if this purity is acquired on the basis of the method of the reduction, more precisely the eidetic reduction, than by bracketing the existence of objects, it rules out eo ipso any possible contribution on the part of the empirical sciences. Stumpf also questions the status of sense perception and the domain of phenomena in this perspective given that Husserl\u2019s Wesensschau can only be applied to what Stumpf calls mere presentations or second-order phenomena. In his remarks on Stumpf in Section 86 of Ideas I, Husserl pointed out that the study of phenomena belongs to what he calls in the introduction to this work \u201ceidetic psychology.\u201d But as a science of facts and of realities, this psychology falls under the reduction and does not seem to contribute significantly to the version of transcendental phenomenology put forth in Ideas I. Stumpf concludes that this version of phenomenology is a phenomenology without phenomena due both to Husserl\u2019s account of phenomena and to his peculiar conception of (transcendental) phenomenology. (R. Rollinger, 1999, 2008c; D. Fisette, 2015b)\n\nAs we said, in 1900, Stumpf established the Institute of psychology in Berlin which was at the origin of the original movement in psychology called Gestalt psychology. With the exception of Max Wertheimer, who did his dissertation in 1904 under the direction of K\u00fclpe in W\u00fcrzburg, the other psychologists of the Institute of Berlin, Wolfgang K\u00f6hler, Kurt Koffka, Kurt Lewin, Egon Brunswik and Adhemar Gelb undertook their apprenticeship in psychology and philosophy under Stumpf\u2019s supervision. This is also the case of Robert Musil and C. von Allesch. However, although the Gestaltists in Berlin had initially adopted Stumpf\u2019s phenomenological standpoint, they departed significantly from Stumpf\u2019s conception of the mind. (M. Ash, 2000\u20132001, 1998; F. Toccafondi, 2009). Despite Stumpf\u2019s significant contribution to the debate on the nature of Gestalt and psychology in general, he was targeted by K\u00f6hler (1913) in his classical paper on the constancy hypothesis, and which is sometimes considered to be the very beginning of Gestalt psychology. Stumpf replied to this objection in his posthumous book by saying that K\u00f6hler was wrong in eliminating founding contents in favour of the constancy hypothesis. The following excerpt from his book Erkenntnislehre summarizes the main issues in this dispute:\n\nIn the presentations of the Gestalt psychology, it is as if there were absolutely no sound and no color, nothing absolute in our sense perceptions, but only Gestalts. Gestalts alone seem to be the only original data while sounds, colors and everything that we call phenomena would only come apart by means of abstraction. (Stumpf, 1939, p. 242)\n\nIn summary, Stumpf claims that, in this conception of Gestalt, \u201cthe forest hides the trees.\u201d For Stumpf maintains that the whole is prior to its parts and that each part, in virtue of its nature, is conditioned by the whole. However, he cannot allow the idea that one may perceive a Gestalt without presupposing a founding content or what he also calls first-order phenomena such as, for instance, color or sound. Stumpf\u2019s conception of Gestalt is closer to that of B\u00fchler (D. Fisette, 2015c) in that it consists in a \u201ccomplex of structural relations.\u201d (Stumpf, 1939, p. 246) Another quote from his posthumous work summarizes perfectly the theoretical issues at stake in Stumpf\u2019s criticism of his students:\n\nThe conception of the perception of Gestalts which is advocated here presupposes: 1. The possibility of perceiving relations; 2. The possibility of unnoticed content in consciousness; 3. The distinction between phenomena and mental functions as heterogeneous contents of consciousness. If one admits these three theses, then our theory is founded. If one challenges it, then one will be led to the native Gestalt psychology, but also to all the difficulties that come with it. (Stumpf, 1939, p. 254)\n\nAccording to Stumpf, the cost for adhering to the native theory is nothing less than to abandon the very principles of descriptive psychology and phenomenology. Moreover, besides the difficulties mentioned by Stumpf in this passage, Gestalt psychology conveys philosophical presuppositions which are at the heart of the dispute. The first is a form of sensual naturalism that Stumpf rejects. The second assumption concerns the metaphysical question of psychophysical relations in K\u00f6hler\u2019s work and the attempt to introduce the concept of Gestalt in the field of physics. Stumpf believes that K\u00f6hler\u2019s isomorphism thesis, which postulates the existence of an identity relation between the structural laws of the psychical world and that of the physical world, presupposes the theory of psychophysical parallelism, which Stumpf rejects as well."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-windelband/", "page_content": "First published Mon May 18, 2020\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Stumpf", "page_content": "Carl Stumpf, (born April 21, 1848, Wiesentheid, Lower Franconia, Bavaria [Germany]\u2014died Dec. 25, 1936, Berlin), German philosopher and theoretical psychologist noted for his research on the psychology of music and tone.\n\nStumpf was influenced at the University of W\u00fcrzburg by the philosopher Franz Brentano, founder of act psychology, or intentionalism. Appointed lecturer (Privatdozent) at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1870, he wrote his first important work, \u00dcber den psychologischen Ursprung des Raumvorstellung (\u201cThe Psychological Origins of Space Perception\u201d) three years later and soon thereafter was appointed professor at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. In 1875 he began experiments for his Tonpsychologie, 2 vol. (1883\u201390; \u201cTone Psychology\u201d), completed in the course of professorships at the Universities of Prague (1879), Halle (1884), and Munich (1889). This work was important not only for reporting the results of his experiments but also for revising concepts of psychophysics, which attempts to make quantitative measurements of physical stimuli and the sensations they produce.\n\nIn 1894 Stumpf entered the most influential phase of his career as professor of philosophy and director of the institute of experimental psychology at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Berlin. Continuing his research on tone psychology, he founded the journal Beitr\u00e4ge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft (\u201cContributions to Acoustics and Musicology\u201d) in 1898 and in 1900 established an archive of primitive music. He was also a cofounder of the Berlin society for child psychology (1900). In two important papers of 1907 he stressed that the experimental study of sensory and imaginal experience (e.g., images, sounds, colours) is antecedent to the study of mental functions (e.g., perceiving, willing, desiring). Thus he drew into psychology his own version of phenomenology, the philosophy that concentrates on the examination of conscious phenomena. Until Stumpf\u2019s retirement from Berlin in 1921 his institute had numerous students who later developed an experimental phenomenology."}, {"url": "https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Carl%20Stumpf", "page_content": "\n\nCarl Stumpf (April 21, 1848 \u2013 December 25, 1936) was a German philosopher and psychologist, famous for his research on the psychology of music and sound. He founded the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Stumpf left a strong impact on Edmund Husserl, the founder of modern phenomenology, and is credited with the introduction of the concept of state of affairs (Sachverhalt), which was later popularized through Husserl's works. Stumpf also influenced Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K\u00f6hler and Kurt Koffka, the famous founders of Gestalt psychology, challenging Wilhelm Wundt's mechanistic approach to experimental psychology, which had long dominated German psychological research. The Gestalt psychologists forever transformed the way not only psychologists but also the general public viewed perception.\n\nLife\n\nCarl Stumpf was born in Wiesentheid, Lower Franconia, Bavaria (today\u2019s Germany), the son of Eugen Stumpf, a local physician, and Marie Adelmann Stumpf. His family had a long history of scholars and academics, so Stumpf became acquainted with science at a very young age. His main interest however, was music, and by the age of ten Stumpf was already composing. He could also play six instruments.\n\nStumpf attended local gymnasium, after which he begin his college studies at the University of Wurzburg, studying esthetics and law. At the university, he met phenomenologist Franz Brentano, who influenced Stumpf to change his major toward philosophy and science. Brentano also encouraged Stumpf to continue his doctoral studies at the University of Gottingen. In 1868, Stumpf was granted his doctoral degree from Rudolph Hermann Lotze.\n\nIn 1869, Stumpf entered Catholic seminary, studying for the priesthood. He left the seminary a year later, deeply disappointed with the dogmatism of the Church. Instead, he became an instructor at Gottingen, in the Department of Philosophy. There he met Wilhelm Weber and Gustav T. Fechner and together with them collaborated in numerous psychological experiments.\n\nIn 1873, Stumpf succeeded Brentano as professor of philosophy at the University of Wurzburg. There he started his research on sound and perception, publishing the first volume of his Tonpsychologie in 1883. In 1978 he married Hermine Biedermann. A year later he accepted a position at the University of Prague, as professor of philosophy. In 1884 he stated to teach at the University of Halle, and in 1889 in the University of Munich.\n\nIn 1894, Stumpf finally settled at the University of Berlin, where he became the director of the Berlin Psychological Institute, previously founded by Hermann Ebbinghaus. Stumpf reorganized the institute and established his own laboratory, which became famous throughout the country. The institute became the principle rival to the Wilhelm Wundt\u2019s psychological laboratory at the University of Leipzig. Stumpf stayed in Berlin for the rest of his career.\n\nIn 1896, Stumpf was in charge of the Third International Congress of Psychology.\n\nIn 1904, Stumpf was the head of a panel of 13 eminent scientists, known as the Hans Commission, to study the claims that a horse named Clever Hans could count. Psychologist Oskar Pfungst eventually proved that the horse could not really count.\n\nBy the end of his career, Stumpf created the Berlin Association of Child Psychology. At the same time he continued to write about music. In 1915, Stumpf and several other eminent philologists around Germany opened a facility that housed the Phonogram Archive, the records with music from different parts of the world.\n\nStumpf retired in 1921, but continued to lecture afterwards. He died on December 25, 1936, in Berlin.\n\nWork\n\nStumpf was one of the earliest students of Brentano and always remained quite close to his early teachings. Brentano\u2019s influence can be seen in Stumpf\u2019s belief that phenomena were the primary data for psychology. Stumpf also taught that \u201cthe whole is greater that the sum of its parts\u201d (Bowman & Brownell, 2000).\n\nStumpf above all, considered himself a psychologist. He studied how different visual or auditory phenomena, such as tones, colors and images, are interpreted in human mind. He believed that these phenomena can be either sensory or imaginary\u2014sensory being as received by our senses and imaginary as interpreted by our mind.\n\nStudies in tone and music\n\nLater in his life Stumpf became more and more interested in empirical methods in experimental psychology and effectively became one of the pioneers in this discipline. He started experimenting with tone and music. In his seminal experiment he investigated tonal fusion, consonance, and dissonance. He observed that some sound combinations have the tendency to cohere into a single sound image, the phenomena he called Tonverschmelzung or tonal fusion. The subjects in the experiment heard two concurrent tones and were asked to judge whether they heard a single tone or two tones. Stumpf concluded that tonal fusion is mostly encouraged by the pitch interval named unison, the second most fused interval being octave, while the third is the perfect fifth. By the end of his career Stumpf abandoned this theory because he was not satisfied with it.\n\nIn order to test the universality of his theories, Stumpf made an extensive study of non-Western music. He collected music from different parts of the world. In 1886 he published his \"Lieder der Bellakula Indianer,\" a musicological study that combined nine transcriptions of songs performed by a group of Bella Coola Indians who visited Germany in 1885. In the paper he described the repertoire of the performers and included transcriptions into Western notation with an accompanying analysis. At the end of the work Stumpf discussed the cultural context of the music. This work is considered one of the origins of ethnomusicology.\n\nOpposition to Wundt\n\nStumpf was known to be one of the major rivals of Wilhelm Wundt, then the most prominent figure in German experimental psychology. Stumpf opposed pure introspection, which reduced experience to elementary elements. Rather he examined the experience as it occurred. Wundt and Stumpf engaged in a series of literary battles over the psychology of audio tones and introspection. Stumpf was a good friend and frequent correspondent with the American psychologist and philosopher William James, who also had issues with Wundt.\n\nLegacy\n\nDuring his tenure at the University of Berlin, he founded the Berlin School of experimental psychology, which was later to become the base of operation for Gestalt psychology.\n\nStumpf left strong impact on Edmund Husserl, the founder of modern phenomenology. Stumpf is credited with the introduction in current philosophy of the concept of state of affairs (Sachverhalt), which was later popularized through Husserl's works. Stumpf also influenced Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K\u00f6hler and Kurt Koffka, famous founders of Gestalt psychology. The student of Stumpf was Curt Sachs, who published influential system of instrument classification \"Systematik der Musikinstrumente\" (1914).\n\nPublications\n\nStumpf, Carl. 1873. \u00dcber den psychologischen Ursprung der Raumvorstellung .

His father was the medico-legal officer of a county court. Both of his parents were very musical. While attending secondary schools in Kitzingen, Bamberg, and Aschaffenburg, Stumpf was taught to play several musical instruments; ultimately, he learned to play six instruments and taught himself the theory of harmony and counterpoint.\n\nIn 1865 Stumpf matriculated at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, where he initially studied Catholic theology and then philosophy with Franz Brentano. Next he went to study with Hermann Lotze at G\u00f6ttingen, where he also took courses in the natural sciences. After receiving his doctorate, he was habilitated at Gottingen as Privatdozent in philosophy. Between 1873 and 1893 he held chairs successively at W\u00fcrzburg, Prague, Halle, Munich, and finally at Berlin, where he founded the psychological institute of the university. Stumpf became dean and then rector of the university, a privy councilor, and a member of the Academy of Sciences.\n\nWork in music . Stumpf began his work on Tonpsychologie (the psychology of musical sounds) while still at W\u00fcrzburg. His monograph on the Bellacoola Indians (1886) pioneered research on non-European music and stimulated the use of recording devices in such research. In Berlin, together with his students Otto Abraham and Erich von Hornbostel, he set up a collection of Edison wax cylinders and established a record archive, affiliated with the psychological institute.\n\nStumpf\u2018s work on Tonpsychologie is his most permanent scientific achievement. He coined the term and was the first to deal with the subject systematically. In his major work, with the same title (1883-1890), he used Helmholtz\u2018 researches, which were primarily physical and physiological, as a point of departure and then shifted to a psychological focus\u2014a focus on the sensation of tone and the function of that sensation, rather than on the organ of hearing. He regarded the experience of the blending of tones as the basic factor in consonance, which he traced back hypothetically to \u201cspecific synergies\u201d in the brain processes. In a later work, Die Anf\u00e4nge der Musik (1911), he modified his position, having been impressed by the arguments of Hugo Riemann, who found the concept of blending inadequate for triads and for chords of more than three notes. Stumpf therefore introduced the term \u201cconcordance\u201d (or \u201cconcord\u201d) for all major and minor triads, together with their inversions. He regarded all other chords as \u201cdiscordances\u201d (or \u201cdiscords\u201d). This aspect of his theory did not stand up against the theory of Felix Krueger or against that of Stumpf\u2018s own students, especially von Hornbostel.\n\nStumpf\u2018s ethnological studies, including studies of music, particularly his Anf\u00e4nge der Musik, qualify him as the founder of comparative musicology, or ethnomusicology. He also continued the kind of research Helmholtz had done, using the physical method of interference to break down vocal and instrumental chords and build them up again. He presented his findings in Die Sprachlaute (1926), a book written late in life as a substitute for the planned third volume of his Tonpsychologie. Thus, Stumpf harnessed physics, physiology, psychology, ethnology, philosophy, and above all, aesthetics to the service of the systematic study of music, and eventually he won acceptance of this subject as an independent discipline by the faculty of philosophy of the University of Berlin.\n\nPsychology . As a psychologist, Stumpf formulated a theory of space perception and a theory of emotions. His first (psychological) book dealt with space perception (1873). Boring has described it as a nativistic theory which argues that both color and extension are equally \u201cpart-contents\u201d of visual sensation ([1929] 1950, p. 363). Stumpf\u2018s theory of emotions is akin to those of Wundt, James, and C. Lange, who derived emotions from organic sensations. Stumpf introduced the concept of \u201cemotional sensations\u201d as a special class of sensations, related to tickling, itching, and cutaneous pain, and he believed that these emotional sensations constitute the basis of all emotionality. Pleasure and pain (or displeasure) were for him merely another special class of sensations rather than a separate class of psychic phenomena. This view has not, however, prevailed.\n\nAt the turn of the century Stumpf created something of a stir with his attempt to re-establish with regard to the body-soul problem the theory of mutual causation (or causal interdependence), which was by then considered obsolete. This effort was aimed at Wundt in particular (it was only one of the many areas in which Stumpf was at odds with Wundt and his school). But again, Stumpf\u2018s view was not accepted, not even by the gestalt theorists among his own students.\n\nPhilosophy . Stumpf\u2018s third area of interest, besides music and psychology, was that of logic and epistemology. Stumpf\u2018s work here is sometimes considered similar to that of von Meinong and Husserl, since all three were students and intellectual descendants of Lotze and Brentano, but Stumpf and the two slightly younger philosophers really have nothing fundamentally in common. Indeed, Stumpf criticized von Meinong and Husserl, incisively although respectfully. He rejected von Meinong\u2018s theory of \u201cimpossible\u201d objects and Husserl\u2018s \u201cpure\u201d phenomenology as impracticable. Although he approved of Husserl\u2018s rejection of \u201cpsychologism,\u201d in the Logische Untersuchungen, he could not go along with the fundamental cleavage Husserl proposed between psychology and philosophy, and he took issue sharply with the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism (1891). He considered Kant\u2018s misconception and neglect of psychology to be the basic failing of his philosophical system.\n\nAccording to Stumpf, the fundamental task of epistemology is to establish those immediately evident \u201crational insights\u201d that become organized into axioms of different degrees of abstraction and generality. In these fundamental insights, logic must cooperate with psychology; their content is not the subject of logic alone. Stumpf believed that the theory of probability is important for developing knowledge from its a priori fundaments; however, he saw probability as concerned not with judgments or facts but rather with judgments on man\u2018s subjective knowledge about facts. As in the Tonpsychologie, Stumpf made a rigorous distinction between phenomena and functions, that is, between objects of experience (sensory and memory contents), on the one hand, and actions and experiences or states, on the other. Thus, he called the doctrine of phenomena so defined \u201cphenomenology\u201d and separated it strictly from \u201cpsychology,\u201d the doctrine of functions.\n\nMore particularly, psychology is, according to Stumpf, the doctrine of elementary functions, the complex ones being the subject of the other Geistes-wissenschaften. Psychology thus becomes a low-level, elementary Geisteswissenschaft; this definition is similar to the one offered by Dilthey in his 1894 article, \u201cIdeen \u00fcber eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologic.\u201d Thus, Stumpf defined phenomenology in a somewhat different way than did Husserl, namely, in a more narrow sense and less specifically in terms of methodology. In addition to phenomena and functions, Stumpf distinguished \u201ccorrelates,\u201d or \u201cstructures,\u201d of functions, these being the concepts, facts, and values that he made the substance of a special science called \u201ceidology,\u201d which might also be called Ideenwis-senschaft, and is best translated as \u201ctheory of ideas,\u201d in the Platonic sense. Finally, there remain relationships as distinct objects of inquiry; these are treated in the \u201csciences of relations.\u201d\n\nIn ethics Stumpf followed Brentano in combating relativism and so for once found himself in agreement with Wundt. Stumpf doubted the assumption that the amount of \u201chappiness\u201d in the world is increasing, although he was convinced that there is a progressive refinement of ethical sensibility.\n\nStumpf also made excursions into metaphysics, but these were no more successful than his complicated classification of the sciences. His accomplishments as a psychologist were significant for his time, especially his work as an experimenter, although here, too, his views have hardly endured in any essential respect. Some of the leading gestalt theorists, including Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Kohler, were among his students\u2014Kohler succeeded him at Berlin\u2014but they largely rejected his basic position. It is in the area of musical theory that Stumpf\u2018s influence has been most lasting.\n\nAlbert Wellek\n\n[For the historical context of Stumpf\u2018s work, see the biographies of Helmholtz; Husserl; James; Lotze; Wundt; for discussion of the subsequent development of his ideas, see Aesthetics; Hearing; Perception, article ondepth perception; Phenomenology; Psychophysics; Senses.]\n\n1873 Ueber den psychologischen Ursprung der Raumvor-stellung.

Because Brentano had not completed the qualifications allowing him to supervise dissertations, Stumpf wrote his doctoral thesis on Plato (1868) and his habilitation thesis on mathematical axioms (1870) at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, supervised by Hermann Lotze. Both philosophers had a strong influence on Stumpf\u2019s thinking and further writings.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1894, Stumpf obtained positions in the philosophy departments at G\u00f6ttingen, W\u00fcrzburg, Prague, Munich, and Halle; in Halle, he supervised Husserl\u2019s habilitation thesis. In 1894, after much hesitation, he accepted a professorship at the Friedrich Wilhelm University (today\u2019s Humboldt University) in Berlin. Six years later, Stumpf founded the Institute of Psychology, where Gestalt psychology was born. Also in 1900, he started to set up a phonogram archive and, with Otto Abraham, made initial recordings there using the Edison phonograph. From 1907 to 1908, Stumpf was president of the Friedrich Wilhelm University. He equipped and expanded his Berlin institute and earned worldwide recognition. In 1922, he passed responsibility for the institute to his student Wolfang K\u00f6hler, but continued to teach philosophy until 1923. He died thirteen years later in Berlin.\n\nCarl Stumpf was co-founder and editor of prestigious journals such as Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane (1890\u20131916) and Beitr\u00e4ge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft (1898\u20131924).

Stumpf was trained, early in his life, in philosophy. He enjoyed the thought experiments associated with the philosophers he studied, but he soon met someone who challenged him to think even deeper.\n\nDuring his university career, Stumpf came under the influence of Franz Brentano, one of the first individuals trained as a philosopher who began using the scientific method to quantify the thoughts of philosophy. Brentano encouraged Stumpf to use empirical methods, results obtained from observing experiments, rather than rely on the anecdotal method that was popular within philosophy. Stumpf would take this knowledge and use empirical methods to inform his hypotheses with regard to phenomena.\n\nStumpf both influenced and was influenced by Edmund Husserl, who argued for a transcendental understanding of phenomena. Stumpf and Husserl, both students of Franz Brentano, took different paths and argued about the nature of phenomenology. Stumpf continued to use empirical methods while Husserl developed his philosophical school using logic. However, Husserl helped Stumpf focus his efforts. Stumpf became convinced that treating phenomenology as a psychological construct rather than a philosophical one was the correct approach.\n\nStumpf's Contributions\n\nSince phenomenology is the subjective experience an individual has when they experience internal or external stimuli, every person becomes a unique individual because of the way that they experience events. Stumpf studied how different sounds and other sensations shaped a person's subjective experience. He realized that every person heard something different when they heard a tone, and he wanted to understand why this was. He was also interested in how an individual's reaction to different sounds matured over time. Using a variety of musical instruments and other means of producing sound, he would ask people what they heard and how that affected them. His research into sound produced the book Psychology of Tone."}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Carl_Stumpf/", "page_content": "Carl Stumpf\n\nCarl Stumpf (German: [\u0283t\u028ampf]; 21 April 1848 \u2013 25 December 1936) was a German philosopher, psychologist and musicologist.

He developed his ideas not in the format of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and individual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous Pr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of Windelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of a philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing, and terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the next. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a rational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband developed in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around the central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to many of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method, and the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a highly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his time. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing philosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of the Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his ideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than is often acknowledged.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by pioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in terms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a chronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between the \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the \u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His argument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that captures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality has been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical method.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in reformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis on questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project as an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is keen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the special sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s independence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern with a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti. That is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not determine matters of fact.\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian philosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or Southwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his student and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask (1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg school of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of the anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in German academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that constituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in the late nineteenth century.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father, Johann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of Brandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and studying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen. Fischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s philosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of philosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom Zufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s supervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the German-French war. After his military service, he completed his habilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as \u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in 1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine psychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the certainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study]. In 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have four children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of \u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on psychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the University of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich and Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and philosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core themes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history. Windelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of Strasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until 1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg. Between 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of Heidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and taught there until his death in 1915.\n\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his teacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes between psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a matter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and prescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a distinction between act and content. Lotze observes that \u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But their content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to mental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and entities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d (Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the cornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d. In his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this distinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die Gewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a normative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological basis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is always dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which, in turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the identification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical processes, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as continuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter dem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe theory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d] which was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman Steinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and linguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are independent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of logical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the principle of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict together with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the law of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival views are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical principles exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary between psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between actual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later reject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and \u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear what led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement with the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant scholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer (1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to have factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time in his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der Kantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different stages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this essay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures of the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange (1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that knowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object. According to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind, while the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures that organize representations. These a priori structures are innate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human sensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this (mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori and the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast, takes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as his starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction model leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which truth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments ought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts the focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary \u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of Kant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural Dissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to reveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that drove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that, according to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular, Windelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between Kant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as well as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties, and Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between four phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and argues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both editions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the Prolegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural Dissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel thought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive sensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him to maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to things-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the question how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects. He is driven to the insight that\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we produce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities [Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246)\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of the understanding are a priori valid for experience because they produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the understanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the thing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even assuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them. Here he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the thing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen as something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254)\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the thing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction that Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the rejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility as \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes a psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then also able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between representations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent conception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the universal and necessary rules that the relations between our representations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his commitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular the idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans as sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the assumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth phase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining his anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict between the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged within the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in the Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with respect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a cognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is inadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is at least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of neo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new concept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of psychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His sympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For Windelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are \u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our representations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of philosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a quaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b: 26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on these matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d can thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop the radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth. Windelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory of knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d between mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our sensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things could be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur between representations, since things and representations are \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband, Kant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth of our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object are not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in the \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134). This leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of thinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning that thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband also conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of judgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize themselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in this organization. (1881: 135).\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental rules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully consistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to psychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing his interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d, Windelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three Critiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing other than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic truth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In a later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three Critiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation between thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical reason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas necessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the object of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the purposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the principles of pure understanding apply the categories to experience (1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances of the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason, Windelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and fully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with his famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond him\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project in a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And Windelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of his writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the most fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the normative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify this distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical method.\n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is philosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative distinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of cognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments relate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge about an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do not expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the \u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a \u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b: 29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and subjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband argues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even if they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a normative demand: they ought to be accepted universally according to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be that the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried out by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a non-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is disagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal and necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be recognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that which is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the validity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives. Critical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of necessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this system and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid judgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are closely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments with a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they raise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be accepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to different cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the points of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to explain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea that there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the conception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal consciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially, represented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical consciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a rule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible combinations of representations that might or might not be formed by empirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that accords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to be formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is what he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought is related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible combinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those judgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One might say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system of absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the extent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of values, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for empirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically situated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a \u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal consciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d as a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the methods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order science that reflects on the methods and results of the various empirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue of which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d (1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out by means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the factual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or genetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the differences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and \u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one hand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d method of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating consequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two disciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical questions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He does not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of the \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the genetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual psychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that explain the actual acceptance and development of values in an individual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual acceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper cannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary separates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted values from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as normative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic method to philosophical questions has three components. First, he argues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions about normativity and validity, because there is too much variety regarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The empirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced by all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have been accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture. But insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the values in question are universal and necessary.\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of all individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026 the \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115)\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical means that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the axioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism. The argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be reconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and cultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the naturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead to the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical method with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic method of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion for distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that it has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle gleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it must treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all equally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary consequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s cardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all beliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all equally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method does not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it also forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An empirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries and tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and validity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d, \u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys the basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains that philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms, or values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot be proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth, beauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed. Hence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological structure:\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to which they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if thinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the purpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in a manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the empirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological method of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in philosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts about individual psychology and culture can provide the starting points for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the philosophical method as a method of reflection [Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines existing claims to validity in light of teleological considerations, and in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life that are necessary conditions for the realization of universal appraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological considerations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within itself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and the \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of normal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881: 139).\n\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question how the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s reflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career, Windelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies for reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His dissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts of chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband still embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom, according to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all intentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay, which had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the thing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the radical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d, Kant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to convince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an alternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his 1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and natural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber Willenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts, Windelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian dualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we need to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not presuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative evaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of viewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object of moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a transcendentally free will, but a \u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively stable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the natural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core thoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and in the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict between natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action that would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous. But if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes, it is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a: 59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and that for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental capacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of psychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go. However, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways of viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological science which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other hand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are, but express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to the antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the relation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ from causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact, act on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system of absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues that a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in agreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself:\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking or willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate evidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the awareness of the norm. (1882a: 85)\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical consciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and determines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see also 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in nothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we ought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with natural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical consciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can be aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904 lectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines our moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we act in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d. Windelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative, question and concludes that we may well call those decisions and actions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our constant personality, as opposed to being determined by external circumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered causality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our concept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a normative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges the attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is possible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the capacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the same circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding human freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s distinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused cause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as constructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that earlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses two problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual has developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the metaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the individual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is an abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot account for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b: 161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the \u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d (1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to understand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless causality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal selves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the latter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of earlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the concept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his alternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of freedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view that the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative discourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are perfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of freedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we disregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction between the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and ideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the world of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according to causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative evaluations. Evaluation\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only which can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the manner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of the factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another form of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136)\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When speaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense that we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic processes (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As described above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result that that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement with a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the constant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions necessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical standpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral appraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in doing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal process over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the upshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom, because it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely presupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act otherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but to the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project is not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader developments in nineteenth-century culture and science also necessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical circumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the historical disciplines that had been underway since the early nineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and best known philosophical contributions concerns the question what distinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those disciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from the natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in line with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by explicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method, critical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against methodological holism, namely the view that there is only one scientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural science.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical disciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883 Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to the human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between the natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience. While outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in natural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d how the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations (Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner experience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and a descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of inner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with a solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for demarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg rector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d [\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue with the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes Dilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To this he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not derive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a dubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with the natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the human-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and non-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally, Windelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the ground that it suggests that the distinction between different sciences rests on a material distinction between different objects: spirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that is purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its most abstract form as their starting point: justification in science is either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic relation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and the particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to be sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science might pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894: 143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or the particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145). The former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d which seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the particular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type or of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in contrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that represent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and idiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and the same object can be approached from both points of view, and which method is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the investigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and particular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on general and causal knowledge which has been derived from the nomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his analysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms \u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the terms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences interchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between scientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also suggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic method. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical facts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894: 153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular facts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden relations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature is a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole [Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims that we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which we do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of the individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of value\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these suggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the \u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d \u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of culture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific concept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the \u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on a principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the natural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this reason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and unrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in contrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture individual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do so on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which particular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a specific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or \u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can clearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis of historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies on values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902: 364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about historical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized account of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately leads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study amounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more developed thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that each science creates its objects according to the manner in which it forms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely on a system of universal values when making selections about what enters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of writings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers modern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also published on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily indebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his teacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation. Windelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory of problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of great minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas according to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical debates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes a reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and seeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of philosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts: First, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age and, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has systematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in Hegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring Hegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time apprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the \u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909: 4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the history of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance for systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as the \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the absolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is critical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different understanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time apprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that philosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent factors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian conception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with the idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge is necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has systematic significance:\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with respect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of development cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see also 1905: 176\u2013177)\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary self-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of cultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking lead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which various, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one another. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual factor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is relevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated in a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of philosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement, he does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband probes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about progress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876) Windelband argues that science cannot decide between historical optimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und genetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of why this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he observes. In order to determine whether a given historical development is progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the idea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d (1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that identify the historical development of present-day values with progress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and could have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we only take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in them\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately, if we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess the historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to a progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the systematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress cannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by contingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also opens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d of philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie [Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on the fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain general concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content of philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy only takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that are baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of shock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and critically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science. In this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify these concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified system. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual reorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The \u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of our spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems \u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely they spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes three claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even when reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by contingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from the \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the contents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10). That is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing drive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life. Second, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual \u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe objective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational deliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of philosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical change\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and over again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual dialectics. (1914: 10)\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and \u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history. Philosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891: 9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued empirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the \u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that together give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems.\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of constructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of \u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other hand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905: 189)\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and systematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in disentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that which is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the \u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent that it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of cultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an intervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian movement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the materialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the relation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is capable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a quaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it seems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that critical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the project of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to do with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not provide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881: 140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be answered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they depend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims about the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an unscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular purposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a science, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from formulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of world-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification (1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and the Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing circumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not inconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a revision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its \u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its positive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more positive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a re-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least partly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird phase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason, and attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of Judgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in more detail that the third Critique forms the core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical project can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of world-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one hundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the relation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question how the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be the \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now sees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility of solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive system of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human history. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and history in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a: 162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a shift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science classification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and idiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even incommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word: \u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last, incommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d (1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization provides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical sciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical philosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp and express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality (1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value content in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in so doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational values\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is not determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a historical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing species, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see also 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a goal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate over how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on board, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization of reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological method that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His \u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d [\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of 1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian language. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the unity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be found"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-von-Mises", "page_content": "Richard von Mises, (born April 19, 1883, Lemberg, Austria-Hungary [now Lviv, Ukraine]\u2014died July 14, 1953, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.), Austrian-born American mathematician, engineer, and positivist philosopher who notably advanced statistics and probability theory.\n\nVon Mises\u2019s early work centred on geometry and mechanics, especially the theory of turbines. In 1913, during his appointment at the University of Strassburg (1909\u201318; now the French University of Strasbourg), he gave the first German university course on aviation, and he contributed to the theory of airfoil design. In 1915\u201316 he constructed a 600-horsepower airplane for the Austrian army on which he served as a test pilot.\n\nBritannica Quiz Numbers and Mathematics\n\nVon Mises had to leave Strasbourg after the German defeat in World War I. In 1920 he became director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the University of Berlin. Although a Roman Catholic by faith, von Mises was classified as Jewish by the Nazi government, and so he fled Germany in 1933 and accepted a position with the University of Istanbul. In 1939 he joined the staff of Harvard University, where he contributed notably to the study of elasticity and cofounded the series Advances in Applied Mechanics.\n\nIn 1919 von Mises developed his famous and controversial frequency approach to probability. In this regard, he developed the axiom of convergence, which holds that the relative frequency of an event converges on a limit as longer and longer sequences are drawn from some \u201creference class,\u201d and the axiom of randomness, which holds that the limit for a relative frequency is independent of any particular randomly chosen infinite subsequence. He published his probabilistic work (with his positivistic interpretations) in Probability, Statistics and Truth (1928). This effort to formulate an objective definition met with certain philosophical objections. Nevertheless, the frequency approach, minus its dependence on infinite reference classes, was rehabilitated in the 1960s and continues to gain proponents. In 1939 von Mises introduced the famous \u201cbirthday problem,\u201d which asked how many people must be gathered before the probability of two people sharing a birthday exceeds 50 percent.

His father, Arthur Edler von Mises, worked for the Austrian State Railways as a technical expert and his mother was Adele von Landau. Richard was the second son of the family, the elder son being Ludwig von Mises who went on to become as famous as Richard. Ludwig, who was about eighteen months older than Richard, went on to become an economist who contributed to liberalism in economic theory and made his belief in consumer power an important part of that theory. Richard also had a younger brother, who died as an infant.It was on the technical course that von Mises embarked, studying mathematics, physics and engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna. After graduating he was appointed as Georg Hamel 's assistant in Br\u00fcnn. The city of Br\u00fcnn is today called Brno in the south-eastern Czech Republic. Up to World War II the inhabitants were predominantly German, although today they are now mainly Czech. Von Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna inand the following year he was awarded his habilitation from Br\u00fcnn, becoming qualified to lecture on engineering and machine construction.He was professor of applied mathematics at Strasbourgthen called Strassburgfromuntil, although this was a period which was interrupted by World War I. Even before the outbreak of the war von Mises had qualified as a pilot and he gave the first university course on powered flight in. When war broke out von Mises joined the Austro-Hungarian army and piloted aircraft. He had lectured on the design of aircraft before the war and he now put this into practice leading a team which constructed a-horsepower plane for the Austrian army inAfter the end of the war von Mises was appointed to a new chair of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. Appointed inhe soon moved again, this time to the University of Berlin to become the director of the new Institute of Applied Mathematics which had been set up there. Schmidt had argued for the setting up of the Institute in:-These words by Schmidt show great wisdom, and the authorities did indeed create the full professorship and made an inspired choice for the first holder in von Mises. Ostrowski wrote in alecturesee for example:-The Institute of Applied Mathematics flourished under his control. Inhe founded the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik and he became the editor of the journal. In the first edition he wrote an introduction stressing the wide range of applied mathematics and also the fact that the line between pure and applied mathematics is not a fixed one, but one which changes over time as different areas of \"pure mathematics\" find applications in practical situations.He set up a new curriculum for applied mathematics at the university which spread over six semesters and included applications of mathematics to astronomy, geodesy and technology. It was not a \"soft option\" and von Mises went out of his way to stress that applied mathematics was every bit as rigorous as pure mathematics requiring:-His Institute rapidly became a centre for research into areas such as probability , statistics, numerical solutions of differential equations , elasticity and aerodynamics. Von Mises was also an excellent lecturer. Collatz, one of his students, wrote:-The paper, written by Collatz, discusses von Mises' work on numerical mathematics, discusses his founding of the journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik and looks at the difficulties faced by von Mises in bringing up the status of applied mathematics during thes and earlys.OnJanuary, however, Hitler came to power and onAprilthe Civil Service Law provided the means of removing Jewish teachers from the universities, and of course also to remove those of Jewish descent from other roles. All civil servants who were not of Aryan descenthaving one grandparent of the Jewish religion made someone non-Aryanwere to be retired. Von Mises in one sense was not Jewish for he was a Roman Catholic by religion. He still fell under the non-Aryan definition of the act but there was an exemption clause which exempted non-Aryans who had fought in World War I. Von Mises certainly qualified under this clause and it would have allowed him to keep his chair in Berlin in. He realised, quite correctly, that the exemption clause would not save him for long. On theJunehe wrote to von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n about a young German, Walter Tollmien, who was looking for a position:-Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n forwarded the letter to Tollmien, writing \"Indeed a document of our time\" on the back!Von Mises saw an offer of a chair in Turkey as a way out of his predicament in Germany but he tried to ensure that his pension rights were preserved. OnOctoberhe wrote to the ministry explaining that it would benefit Germany if he accepted a post in Turkey and that he should be allowed to retain his pension rights for hisyears of service. He received the reply that he would have to relinquish all rights of a salary, a pension or support for his dependants. He protested in a further letter to the Ministry that he was legally entitled to rights that he was not prepared to relinquish. The Nazi Theodor Vahlen wanted to take over as director of the Institute despite poor academic qualities. He promised von Mises that if he would support him to succeed as Director of the Institute then he would ensure that von Mises would not lose his pension rights.In Octobervon Mises wrote his letter to support Vahlen as his successor. Collatz, von Mises' student, wrote:-Vahlen was appointed Director of the Institute in December. Having taken up the new chair in Istanbul, von Mises received a letter in Januarydenying him any rights at all. It was something that von Mises continued to feel extremely aggrieved about, writing to the Ministry in, shortly before his death, still trying to restore his rights.The mathematician Hilda Geiringer followed him to Istanbul in. There she was appointed as professor of mathematics.InKemal Atat\u00fcrk died and those in Turkey who had fled from the Nazis feared that their safe haven would become unsafe. Invon Mises left Turkey for the United States. He became professor at Harvard University and inhe was appointed Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics there. Geiringer followed him to the USA and they were married inVon Mises worked on fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aeronautics, statistics and probability theory. He classified his own work, not long before his death, into eight areas: practical analysis, integral and differential equations, mechanics, hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, constructive geometry, probability calculus, statistics and philosophy. He introduced a stress tensor which was used in the study of the strength of materials. His studies of wing theory for aircraft led him to investigate turbulence. Much of his work involved numerical methods and this led him to develop new techniques in numerical analysis. His most famous, and at the same time most controversial, work was in probability theory.He made considerable progress in the area of frequency analysis which was started by Venn . He combined the idea of a Venn limit and a random sequence of events. Ostrowski in the same lecture which we quoted from above wrotesee for example:-This judgement by Ostrowski is rather harsh, however, and many consider von Mises' theories to be important in the development of the subject. After the measure theory approach by Kolmogorov had become favoured by almost all statisticians over von Mises' limiting frequency theory approach, there was a return to von Mises ideas and there was an attempt to incorporate them into the measure theoretic approach of Kolmogorov who wrote himself in:-In paperdiscusses:-Phillip Frank , writing insays:-In von Mises' book Positivism: A Study in Human Understandinghe expressed his views on science and life. He subscribes to a doctrine of positivism in the book saying:-This interest in philosophy was only one of von Mises' interests outside the realm of mathematics.

He taught philosophy at Z\u00fcrich, Freiburg im Breisgau, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. He was a disciple of Rudolf Hermann Lotze and Kuno Fischer and was the leader of the so-called southwestern German (or Baden) school of neo-Kantianism. He is best known for his work in history of philosophy, to which he brought a new mode of exposition\u2014the organization of the subject by problems rather than by chronological sequence of individual thinkers. As a systematic philosopher he is remembered for his attempt to extend the principles of Kantian criticism to the historical sciences, his attempt to liberate philosophy from identification with any specific scientific discipline, and his sympathetic appreciation of late nineteenth-century philosophy of value.\n\nWindelband believed that whereas the various sciences (mathematical, natural, and historical) have specific objects and limit their investigations to determined areas of the total reality, philosophy finds its unique object in the knowledge of reality provided by these various disciplines taken together as a whole. The task of philosophy, he held, was to explicate the a priori bases of science in general. The aim of philosophy was to show not how science is possible but why there are many different kinds of science; the relationships that obtain between these various sciences; and the nature of the relation between the critical intelligence\u2014the knowing, willing, and feeling subject\u2014and consciousness in general.\n\nAccording to Windelband, both the triumphs and the limitations of contemporary philosophical thought had their origins in Immanuel Kant's thought. Kant had established the dogma that all knowledge must be of the type provided by the natural sciences. But, Windelband held, if knowledge is limited to only that which can be contained within the categories as set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason, then the kinds of activities associated with the will and the emotions\u2014that is to say, the subjects of Kant's second and third critiques\u2014are removed from the province of knowledge. The inadequacies of the Kantian identification of knowledge in general with natural scientific knowledge alone had been demonstrated by the post-Kantian idealists, who sought to construct a theory of knowledge capable of appreciating \"the needs of modern culture, and \u2026 the historical material of ideas\" (History of Philosophy, p. 569). Idealism failed, however, because it ended by hypostatizing a spiritual sphere that presumably was separate from the world of matter and that operated according to principles utterly different from those which science explicated in general causal laws. Thus, whereas Kantianism had failed to include ethics and aesthetics within the domain of scientific philosophy, idealism failed to provide a place for those aspects of the world revealed by the natural sciences and eternally established as causally determined. It thus appeared to late nineteenth-century thinkers that there were at least two levels of reality, one spiritual and historical, the other material and determined; and it seemed that knowledge itself, far from being one, was at least twofold. On the one hand, it was empirical and discovered laws; on the other hand, it was rational and revealed the essential freedom behind the laws. Such at least had been the contention of Wilhelm Dilthey and the neo-idealists. As long as this division persisted, Windelband held, pessimism, the denial of philosophy, must flourish also.\n\nThe way out of the difficulty was to be provided by a fundamental reappraisal in philosophy, a reconsideration of modern thought ab initio. For Windelband this meant primarily an attempt to find a way to apply the technique of transcendental deduction to the historical as well as the physical sciences. It also meant liberation from the notion that natural science was the archetype of all knowledge.\n\nIn an early address, \"Was ist Philosophie?\" (1882), Windelband distinguished between theoretical judgments (Urteile ) and critical judgments (Beurteilungen ). The former expressed the \"mutual implicativeness\" (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit ) of two \"representational contents\" (Vorstellungsinhalte ); the latter expressed the relation between the judging consciousness (beurteilenden Bewusstsein ) and the object represented (see Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. I, p. 29). Theoretical judgments are judgments of fact and are always positive; their purpose is to extend the limits of knowledge in a given science. Critical judgments, however, can be either positive or negative, and they express the position assumed by the subject when a given theoretical judgment is endowed with a status as means to some end.\n\nThe individual sciences expand the series of theoretical judgments; philosophy examines the relations between the ability of individual consciousness to render judgments and that \"consciousness in general\" (Bewusstsein \u00fcberhaupt ) which is the intuited basis of every critical judgment. Philosophy, then, \"has its own proper field and its own problem in those values of universal validity that are the organizing principles for the functions of culture and civilization and for all the particular values of life. But it will describe and explain those values only that it may give an account of their validity; it treats them not as facts but as norms\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 680\u2013681). The various sciences are concerned with facts, which they organize in different ways according to the ends for which those facts are \"constructed.\" Philosophy, however, is concerned with the processes by which events attain the status of facts for particular sciences.\n\nCritical judgments, then, are rendered in respect not of what is but of what ought to be; in accordance not with laws but with norms. There is a \"normative consciousness\" (Normalbewusstsein ) presupposed by philosophy; this \"normative consciousness\" is in abstracto the same as that which, in concreto, underlies every scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience. It is not to be thought of as either a metaphysical or a psychological entity. It is, rather, merely the \"sum-total of the inter-connections and relations between existents\" (Logic, p. 59). These relations \"are not themselves existents, either as things, as states, or as activities; they can only become 'actual' as the content of the psychical functions of knowing.\u2026 In itself the realm of the valid is nothing else than the form and order under which that which exists is determined\" (ibid.). It follows, then, that \"this whole is closed to our knowledge; we shall never know more than a few fragments of it, and there is no prospect of our ever being able to patch it together out of the scraps that we can gather\" (ibid., p. 65). Therefore, philosophy cannot end in science or in any practical rule of life; it can only point the attention of humanity to the sensed \"principles of absolute judgment\" that are presupposed in every human confrontation of the world in scientific, moral, and aesthetic experience.\n\nWindelband regarded as baseless every attempt to distinguish between the different disciplines that constitute science on the basis of a presumed essential difference between their objects. The disciplines are distinguished only by their methods, which are in turn functions of the ends or values informing them as instruments of culture. In the address \"Geschichte und Naturwissenschaften\" (1894), he distinguished between the natural sciences and the historical sciences, and he argued that the natural sciences aim at the construction of general laws and \"explain\" an event by identifying it as an instance of a general law. Historical sciences, on the other hand, are individualizing; they concentrate on specific events and attempt to determine their specific physiognomy or form. Natural science Windelband termed nomothetic ; historical science, idiographic. But, he added, any given object could be studied by both kinds of science. A mental event, if viewed under the aspect of physical causality\u2014as an instance of the working of some general law\u2014was a natural event. That same mental event, described in its individuality and valued for its deviation from the class to which it belonged, became an object of the idiographic sciences. Positivists erred in holding that every event must be viewed nomothetically, just as idealists erred in thinking that certain kinds of events cannot be so viewed. The total picture of the world that consciousness is in principle able to construct can be constructed only through the use of both kinds of investigation. No single event can be deduced from general laws, and no law can be framed out of the contemplation of a single event. \"Law and event remain together as the ultimate, incommensurable limits of our representation of the world\" (Pr\u00e4ludien, Vol. II, p. 160).\n\nSee also Consciousness; Dilthey, Wilhelm; Fischer, Kuno; History and Historiography of Philosophy; Idealism; Kant, Immanuel; Lotze, Rudolf Hermann; Neo-Kantianism.\n\nBibliography\n\nworks by windelband\n\nDie Lehre vom Zufall.

Mathematical practical course [Praktikum]\n\nThe purpose of the mathematical practical course is to familiarize the participants with the mathematical methods of calculation, drawing and instrumental methods of mathematics through their own work. It takes place once a week (in groups if required) for three hours and consists always of the solution of one bigger or several smaller problems [Aufgaben] after a detailed explanation. The division is such that in the first two semesters (beginners\u2019 practical course) the material is dealt with, which is required by the Prussian examination regulations for all candidates as teachers at higher secondary schools with mathematics as their major subject (\u00a7 20); in the two subsequent semesters (practical course for advanced students) the material required for the additional subject Applied Mathematics is dealt with (\u00a7 26).\n\nParticipation in the beginners\u2019 practical course does not require prior attendance of specific lectures in the field of applied mathematics. The explanations of the individual problems are given in such a way that they are understandable for those who are familiar with school mathematics and the basic principles of differential and integral calculus as well as analytical geometry. The practical course can begin in the 2nd semester.\n\nThe advanced practical course requires knowledge of descriptive geometry, graphical statics and practical analysis that goes beyond the school curriculum. It is recommended to attend the relevant main lectures in advance, at the latest at the same time as the practical course.

German idealist philosopher; leader of the Baden school of neo-Kantianism. Professor at Z\u00fcrich (1876), Freiburg (1877), Strasbourg (1882), and Heidelberg (1903).\n\nWindelband is known for his works on the history of philosophy, History of Ancient Philosophy (1888; Russian translation, 1893) and History of Modern Philosophy (vol. 1-2, 1878-80; Russian translation, vol. 1-2, 1902-05), in which the philosophical systems of the past are presented from a Kantian position. In a characteristically neo-Kantian spirit Windelband eliminates the concept of thing-in-itself from Kant\u2019s doctrine and attempts thereby to overcome the dualism of Kantian philosophy in a subjectivistic way. Windelband defines philosophy as \u201cthe critical study of values of universal validity\u201d (Preliudii [Praludien], St. Petersburg, 1904, p. 23) and as a normative doctrine based on value judgments and on the cognition of what ought to be. He contrasts philosophy with the natural sciences, which are based on theoretical judgments and empirical data of what is. Windelband interprets values as being a priori, transcendental, and universally valid. By acknowledging mankind\u2019s self-determination in accordance with an \u201cethical ideal\u201d as the ultimate aim of historical progress, Windelband reduces social problems to ethical ones. He declares the dualism of the world of reality and the world of values to be a \u201csacred mystery\u201d revealing the limitation of our knowledge and directs us into the sphere of religious values.\n\nIn evolving a methodology of the sciences he breaks down the sciences into nomothetic sciences, which deal with laws, and idiographic sciences, which study specific phenomena in their uniqueness. \u201cThe former are the sciences of laws, the latter are the sciences of events\u201d (ibid., p. 320). In this way Windelband denies that the discovery of laws is the guiding principle of historical knowledge.\n\nWORKS Geschichte und Naturwissenschaft, 3rd ed.

In 1913, during his appointment at the University of Strassburg (1909\u201318; now the French University of Strasbourg), he gave the first German university course on aviation, and he contributed to the theory of airfoil design. In 1915\u201316 he constructed a 600-horsepower airplane for the Austrian army on which he served as a test pilot.\n\nBritannica Quiz Numbers and Mathematics\n\nVon Mises had to leave Strasbourg after the German defeat in World War I. In 1920 he became director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the University of Berlin. Although a Roman Catholic by faith, von Mises was classified as Jewish by the Nazi government, and so he fled Germany in 1933 and accepted a position with the University of Istanbul. In 1939 he joined the staff of Harvard University, where he contributed notably to the study of elasticity and cofounded the series Advances in Applied Mechanics.\n\nIn 1919 von Mises developed his famous and controversial frequency approach to probability. In this regard, he developed the axiom of convergence, which holds that the relative frequency of an event converges on a limit as longer and longer sequences are drawn from some \u201creference class,\u201d and the axiom of randomness, which holds that the limit for a relative frequency is independent of any particular randomly chosen infinite subsequence. He published his probabilistic work (with his positivistic interpretations) in Probability, Statistics and Truth (1928). This effort to formulate an objective definition met with certain philosophical objections. Nevertheless, the frequency approach, minus its dependence on infinite reference classes, was rehabilitated in the 1960s and continues to gain proponents. In 1939 von Mises introduced the famous \u201cbirthday problem,\u201d which asked how many people must be gathered before the probability of two people sharing a birthday exceeds 50 percent. (The surprising answer: 23.)\n\nVon Mises\u2019s Positivism: A Study in Human Understanding (1951) summarizes his views on science and life. He was also a leading authority on the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke."}]}
