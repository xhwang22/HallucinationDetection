His father, Roy Beggs, was also a politician, having served as the UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005. Beggs Jr served as a local councillor on Carrickfergus Borough Council from 2001 to 2011, during which time he held various positions of responsibility, including Chairman of the District Policing Partnership and Vice-Chairman of the Local Strategic Partnership and of the Community Safety Partnership.\n\nIn 2011, Beggs was elected as Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a role he held until 2016. During his time in the Assembly, he served as a member of various committees, including the Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee. He is also the UUP spokesperson on Social Development.\n\nBeggs is known for his actions in 2003, when he successfully lobbied Aer Lingus to remove Irish rebel music from their in-flight entertainment. Beggs had complained of the \"blatant promotion of militant, armed republicanism\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston. He likened the situation to \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights immediately, stating that it should never have been on board in the first place.\n\nThroughout his career, Beggs has been known for his commitment to public safety and community development. He has been a strong advocate for increasing funding for mental health services, improving road safety, and promoting economic development in Northern Ireland. He has also been a vocal opponent of political violence and sectarianism, and has worked tirelessly to build bridges between different communities in the region.\n\nOverall, Roy Beggs Jr is a well-respected politician with a long track record of public service. His dedication to the people of East Antrim and Northern Ireland as a whole has earned him the admiration of his constituents and colleagues alike. As he moves on from his role as an MLA, his legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for many years to come.\n\nElection results\n\nRoy Beggs Jr, a seasoned politician and long-standing member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suffered a shock defeat in the 2022 election at the hands of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This brought to an end his uninterrupted run of electoral successes since 1998.\n\nBeggs Jr had been a force to be reckoned with in the political landscape, having won the popular vote in two separate elections, and had been a key player in the Unionist cause for decades. However, his failure to secure re-election in 2022 has left many wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nDespite starting strong with a 16.1% share of the vote in 1998, Beggs Jr's popularity dwindled over time, with just 10.2% of the vote in 2007. While he had always been a prominent figure in Unionist politics, it seems that his appeal may have waned in recent years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a notoriously volatile arena, with the political landscape shifting rapidly over time. Beggs Jr may have fallen foul of this instability, finding himself out of step with the changing attitudes of the electorate.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply a case of the Alliance Party capitalizing on a moment of weakness, seizing the opportunity to make their mark on the political landscape. Whatever the case, Beggs Jr's defeat is a timely reminder that no one can take electoral success for granted.\n\nIn the cutthroat world of politics, it's important to remain vigilant and adaptable, constantly reassessing one's position and staying on top of the latest trends and developments. Beggs Jr's defeat may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it serves as a valuable lesson for politicians everywhere.\n\nAs for the Alliance Party, they can take heart in their triumph, but they must not rest on their laurels. The political landscape is ever-changing, and they will need to remain vigilant if they hope to maintain their newfound dominance. One thing is certain, the Northern Ireland Assembly will remain a hotly contested arena for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/05/07/news/alliance-gain-in-east-antrim-as-uup-s-roy-beggs-loses-seat-2663570/", "page_content": "The Alliance Party made a breakthrough in East Antrim, securing two Stormont seats in the constituency for the first time.\n\nBut UUP veteran Roy Beggs has bowed out after representing the constituency since 1998.\n\nMr Beggs's party colleague John Stewart topped the poll, the first to be elected with 8,459 votes at the third stage of counting.\n\nHe said: \"It's a bittersweet day.

From 1998-2007 the Ulster Unionist Party have lost 8% vote share."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ulster-Unionist-Party", "page_content": "History\n\nThe UUP evolved from the Ulster Unionist Council, which was founded in 1905 to resist the inclusion of the historical province of Ulster in an independent Ireland, and the Unionist Party, whose initial focus was on the continued union of all of Ireland with Great Britain. From the creation of Northern Ireland in 1921 until direct rule by the British beginning in 1972, the UUP formed every provincial government, holding substantial majorities in Stormont, the parliament of Northern Ireland, and in seats for Northern Ireland in the British Parliament. With the rise of the Roman Catholic civil rights movement and sectarian violence in the 1960s and conciliatory gestures toward Northern Ireland Catholics and the government of Ireland by UUP Prime Minister for Northern Ireland Terence O\u2019Neill, dissident elements left the party to form other organizations, notably the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), cofounded in 1971 by Ian Paisley.\n\nMore From Britannica British general election of 2010: Ulster Unionist Party\n\nIn 1973 the UUP secured 24 seats in the newly created Northern Ireland Assembly, though it remained divided between those who favoured sharing power with the nationalist SDLP and those who did not. Conflict over the provisions of the Sunningdale Agreement (1973), which called for a Council of Ireland to coordinate policies between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, prompted the resignation of Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner and the collapse of the governing Executive. In 1979 the UUP won only one of three seats for Northern Ireland in the European Parliament and finished behind the DUP and the SDLP. In general elections in 1983, however, the UUP significantly outpolled the DUP, taking 11 of 17 provincial seats in the British Parliament. The party\u2019s strong presence in Parliament was an advantage in the early 1990s, when the Conservative government in Britain was forced to rely on UUP support to maintain its slim majority.\n\nBetween 1921 and 1969 the UUP had four leaders, two of whom\u2014James Craig (1921\u201340) and Basil Brooke (1946\u201363)\u2014served for nearly 20 years. In contrast, from 1969 to the end of the 1990s the party had five leaders, two of whom\u2014James Chichester Clark (1969\u201371) and Faulkner (1971\u201374)\u2014were in office for only three years. This relatively rapid turnover was indicative of the problems brought to the party by prolonged political violence and by direct rule of Northern Ireland by Britain.\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 was a blow to Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists, because it established a consultative role for the government of Ireland in the affairs of Northern Ireland through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat. The UUP and other unionists denounced the agreement, and UUP members of Parliament resigned their seats over the issue (though 14 were returned in by-elections in 1986). The party organized mass protests and boycotts of local councils and filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the agreement. However, these efforts\u2014which were joined by the DUP\u2014failed to force abrogation of the agreement, and the UUP decided to participate in new negotiations on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland in 1990\u201393. After Republican and Loyalist forces declared cease-fires in 1994, the UUP reluctantly joined discussions with the British and Irish governments and other Northern Ireland political parties.\n\nAt first the UUP insisted on the decommissioning (disarming) of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) before it would consent to full participation in talks including Sinn F\u00e9in, the IRA\u2019s political wing. In 1997 the decommissioning issue was set aside, the IRA renewed its 1994 cease-fire, and multiparty talks were reestablished, though the UUP continued to avoid direct talks with Sinn F\u00e9in until 1999. In April 1998 the UUP and seven other parties approved the Good Friday Agreement (Belfast Agreement) on steps leading to a new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. However, dissidents in the UUP, including UUP members of Parliament, rejected the agreement, and the party struggled to maintain unity during the agreement\u2019s implementation. Particularly divisive was the issue of whether to cooperate with Sinn F\u00e9in given the IRA\u2019s failure to begin decommissioning.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Owing to conflict over the role of Sinn F\u00e9in, the Executive Committee\u2014the power-sharing executive body drawn from the Assembly\u2014was not constituted until December 1999 and was dissolved in February 2000 for a period of four months until the IRA agreed to allow international inspections of its weapons. Trimble, the UUP\u2019s leader, served as Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, and UUP ministers directed three government departments.\n\nAs opposition to the Good Friday Agreement mounted among Northern Ireland\u2019s Protestant community, the party faced internal division and a strong electoral challenge from the DUP. During the campaign for the British elections of 2001, Trimble attempted to appeal to unionists who were angry at his dealings with Sinn F\u00e9in by threatening to resign as Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister if the IRA persisted in its refusal to decommission. Nevertheless, the UUP lost a large share of the vote to the hard-line DUP. Trimble resigned as first minister in July 2001 but later secured an agreement on decommissioning. He was reelected as first minister in November, despite two votes cast against him by UUP members, which were indicative of the deep divisions within the party and the unionist community (the post of first minister subsequently was suspended in 2002). In 2003 the UUP was supplanted as the largest unionist party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and in 2005 it captured only a single seat in the British House of Commons to the DUP\u2019s nine.\n\nShortly thereafter Trimble resigned as party leader and was succeeded by Reg Empey. At the general election of 2010, the UUP lost its last remaining seat in the House of Commons and Empey resigned. He was succeeded by Tom Elliott, who tried to rebuild and redefine the party within the changing unionist landscape. Although the UUP won just 16 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May 2011\u2014down two from its 2007 total\u2014the party\u2019s performance was better than expected. Elliott stepped down after just 18 months, and he was replaced as party leader by former news broadcaster Mike Nesbitt in March 2012.\n\nIn advance of the 2015 British general election, Nesbitt orchestrated a pact with DUP leader Peter Robinson that saw the two unionist parties present a single candidate in four constituencies. It was a successful strategy, and the UUP won two seats, regaining its representation in the House of Commons. In the 2016 election for the Assembly, the UUP held on to its l6 seats. That total dropped to 10 seats in the March 2017 snap election (though the loss was mitigated by the Assembly\u2019s overall reduction from 108 seats to 90) and then to nine seats in the scheduled election in May 2022. The June 2017 snap election for the British Parliament took a heavier toll on the UUP, which lost both of its seats in the House of Commons. The party failed to regain them in another snap election, in 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/east-antrim-result-alliance-gains-but-end-of-an-era-for-uup-1.4872542", "page_content": "The Alliance Party\u2019s Danny Donnelly (left) and Stewart Dickson celebrate after their election at Ulster University Jordanstown count centre.
