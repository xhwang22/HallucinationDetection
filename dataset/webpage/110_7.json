I am someone who believes in not airing our dirty laundry in public.\n\n\u201cDespite me being part of the Umno supreme council, no one can point at me and say that I have ever exposed Umno\u2019s flaws to the public.\n\n\u201cI believe in respecting the party and keeping its honour. If the party is in pain, we as housekeepers must provide the cushioning measures.\n\n\u201cWe may have our differences within the party, but we live in the same house. Even when we lost (the Federal Government in 2018), Umno managed to stay intact,\u201d said Reezal.\n\nReezal also called on those who are \u201cexcessive\u201d in their campaigning to tone it down as their actions might not only take down individuals, but also give a bad name to the party.\n\n\u201cThe party is obviously still very much alive, judging from the crowd that is willing to contest all the posts in Umno both at the grassroots and national level.\n\n\u201cI offer myself as a 24-hour housekeeper of the party and I want those who vote for me to look at my record.\n\n\u201cI have been with the party since I was in my 20s and have stuck with the party through thick and thin for more than two decades, rising through the ranks. This shows that I have climbed the political steps and I offer my services. My record is for all to see.\n\nThe nomination period closes on Feb 26.\n\nUmno is in the midst of its internal elections for the 191 divisions and 22,000 branches, including the divisions that were suspended.\n\nThe party\u2019s new office bearers will be elected from Feb 1 to March 18, but the top two positions of president and deputy president will not be contested this time around.\n\nIn May last year, Umno amended its constitution to allow party polls to be held within six months after the conclusion of the 15th General Election.\n\nUmno had postponed its party elections for 18 months after the 2018/2021 term ended on June 30, 2021, which meant party polls for the 2021/2023 term should have been held before Dec 30 last year. However, the polls were postponed."}, {"url": "https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2021/11/01/property-rental-minister-admits-discrimination-exists-says-very-awkward-to/2017524", "page_content": "KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 \u2014 Racial discrimination does exist in Malaysia\u2019s property rental market, Local Government Minister Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican acknowledged in Parliament today.\n\nHowever, he said it would be \u201cvery awkward\u201d to enact a law that seeks a fair balance between the rights of both landlords and tenants while including the landlord\u2019s preference for certain tenants, even if other countries have clear-cut anti-discrimination legislations.\n\n\u201cThe discrimination issue raised by YB, yes it is true, I have listened and seen it myself but at this moment we are still studying in detail in terms of local circumstances.\n\n\u201cThere are similar Acts in Australia and even in the United States which prohibits any form of sale advertisements by including one\u2019s preference.\n\n\u201cBut in Malaysia, when we talk about discrimination, it comes down to preference. It would be very awkward to have Acts supporting the preference of owners\u2019 rights but we will conduct further studies on the suitability of including the elements raised by YB,\u201d Reezal Merican said during Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nHe was replying Bangi MP Ong Kian Ming who wanted to know if the soon-to-be tabled Residential Tenancy Act would address racial discrimination in Malaysia\u2019s property rental market.\n\nReezal Merican said the \u201creal spirit\u201d of the proposed law is to balance the rights of tenants and property owners.\n\nHe said the Residential Tenancy Act is meant to standardise rental agreements and establish a tribunal to resolve disputes between tenants and landlords.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, the preparation of residential rental agreements utilises the procedures stipulated under the Contract Act where the agreements are generally non-comprehensive and do not fully protect the interests and rights of tenants and owners of premises,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the new law is in the final stages of its drafting and is scheduled for tabling in Parliament in July 2022.\n\nReezal Merican explained that the draft of Malaysia\u2019s Residential Tenancy Act is modelled after the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 in New South Wales, Australia.\n\nHe added that similar laws from Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa were used as comparisons.\n\n\u201cApart from comprehensive stakeholders\u2019 meetings, a Regulatory Impact Assessment will also be implemented by the Malaysia Productivity Corporation to identify and assess the effects from suggestions gathered towards the drafting of the Bill,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that since the relationship between landlords and their tenants fell under the state\u2019s jurisdiction as provided under Article 76(4) of the Federal Constitution, proposals outlined in the Bill is set for tabling in the National Council for Local Government before it is presented to the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers for a final review."}, {"url":

outlets and hotels to be channelled to Members of Parliament (MP) for distribution to the poor in their constituencies.\n\nJohari said such outlets and hotels appeared reluctant to let MPs distribute

Undi18 can proceed. That was our counter-argument and we will decide in the Cabinet (meeting) next week,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, KBS received almost 8,000 applications to become MyVAC volunteers since it was launched on February 26, with Selangor recording the highest number of registrations with 1,244 people, followed by Sabah (1,009), Penang (734), Perak (617) and Kedah (612).\n\nReezal Merican said the number also exceeded the government\u2019s initial target of 6,000 volunteers who would be placed in over 600 vaccination centres nationwide.\n\nHe added that the programme was driven by a whole-society approach in ensuring the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme runs smoothly. \u2014 Bernama"}, {"url": "https://en.unionpedia.org/i/Reezal_Merican_Naina_Merican", "page_content": "Reezal Merican Naina Merican Datuk Seri Reezal Merican bin Naina Merican is a Malaysian politician.
