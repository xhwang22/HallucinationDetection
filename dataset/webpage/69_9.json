The film, shot on location in Gloucester and adapted from the book by Sebastian Junger, is due to hit theaters on June 30. Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, \"The Perfect Storm\" is a true account of the brave Gloucester men and women who fish for a living, and specifically the story of the crew from the doomed \"Andrea Gail.\" The ship was lost at sea in the fall of 1991 during one of the greatest storms in modern history.\n\nIn August 1999, about 1,300 people answered an open casting call for the film, turning out on a cool and rainy Saturday to wait in line for up to four hours to have a chance to be a part of \"The Perfect Storm.\" By the end of the day, 900 were chosen for a scene to be filmed at St. Anne\u2019s Church in late September. And, for a paycheck of $85.64, this writer was one of the 900.\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nDirector Wolfgang Peterson (\"Das Boot\" and \"Air Force One\") went to great lengths to achieve authenticity in all areas of filming. Each of the 900 extras was given several pages of typed instructions regarding wardrobe, makeup and hairstyle to ensure that we would be dressed appropriately for a memorial service that happened almost ten years ago, in 1991. We were to \"think late \u201980s early \u201990s.\" Hairstyles should not be too contemporary, and women were to have the signature \u201980s shoulder pads in their clothing. Each extra was also instructed to wear a cross or bring a prayer book.\n\nThe mountain of logistics involved in moving 900 people from a holding location into the actual church for the memorial service was amazing in and of itself. Half of us were to leave our cars at Good Harbor Beach, while the other half were told to report to Stage Fort Park. From there, we were bused to the church, where each extra was seen personally by a wardrobe assistant who checked our outfits and makeup. We were sent to wardrobe or to makeup to correct any inaccuracies. Busing and \"processing\" took almost four hours. And that was just the beginning of a shooting day that went on for nearly 12 hours.\n\nThis day in particular was a difficult one, not only for the extras. The movie is, of course, based on a true story. The families and friends of the men who were lost at sea aboard the \"Andrea Gail\" still live and work in Gloucester. Although the making of \"The Perfect Storm\" honors the spirit of these men, it also asked a community to live through, for a second time, a terrible tragedy. .\n\nRespecting the Community\n\nWarner Brothers had commissioned a boat maker to outfit two fishing vessels in the exact likeness of the \"Andrea Gail\" and the \"Hannah Boden\" (the \"Hannah Boden\" eventually returned safely to harbor after the storm). The ships were kept under cover until the actual filming began out of respect for the community. Painful memories would undoubtedly surface for crew members\u2019 families and friends upon seeing a second \"Andrea Gail\" sail out of Gloucester harbor. Truth be told, seeing the unveiled \"Andrea Gail\" replica was like seeing a ghost.\n\nThe filming of the memorial service was itself haunting, with family members of the lost men actually seated in the church behind the stars playing them in the movie. The emotional day was at times poignant and harrowing, particularly when Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio delivered a poetic eulogy, backed by a 60-person choir singing the \"Navy Hymn: Eternal Father.\" Peterson and Mastrantonio, who was required to cry something like 15 times in a row (first Peterson felt she wasn\u2019t crying enough; then she was crying too much), were walking a fine line, careful to respect the gathered mourners, but intent on getting the scene shot in one day. (The church wouldn\u2019t be available at any other time.)\n\nStar Power\n\nIt was a long day of filming, with plenty of \"cuts!\" to rework scenes or adjust equipment. During breaks we watched professional moviemakers at work, trading stories about the stars and local sightings around town. George Clooney stories were the most plentiful, with many firsthand accounts of \"George sightings\" in the downtown bars and restaurants. It seems that George was researching his role as Captain Billy Tyne and wanted firsthand knowledge of the Gloucester local scene. Ever the gracious star, one story had George paying the dinner bill for a group of women once he heard there was a birthday at the table.\n\nDuring filming, George playing basketball just outside his trailer was an added bonus. He played every day around lunchtime, with crew members and even some area schoolkids. Women aged 15 to 50 turned out in droves to wait for a chance to get photos or perhaps autographs. George signed autographs whenever approached, but Mark Wahlberg really got into it. The gregarious star came to the sidelines almost every day at lunch and signed whatever was presented to him \u2014 photos, clothing, even skin!\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nBeing an extra in \"The Perfect Storm\" was a tremendous experience, especially because of the memorial scene we were involved in. It wasn\u2019t like being an extra who has to walk a dog past a shop window. We were there all day, hearing direction being given to the featured actors and actresses and seeing the process. It\u2019s then that you realize the enormous pressure the actors were under and gave me a new found respect for the craft. We were a part of all that."}, {"url": "https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-perfect-storm/characters", "page_content": "With, Rick Smith is a highly trained Air National Guard pararescue jumper who presumably ditches from\u2019s helicopter, but his body is never recovered.

AND - I was already past 65 when this happened! Indeed, I am ancient, although I think like a teenager. I was shopping in Ralph's market and saw the VHS on a stand. I had seen the movie in the theater; I didn't hesitate to buy it, and then went right out to a store and bought a VCR. Almost everyone who commented on this movie saw it in a theater.\n\n\n\nI digress: I suppose not too many people have seen the ocean when it gets to be as furious like in \"The Perfect Storm\". I am a native of the Gulf Coast; my friends and I couldn't wait till the \"hurricane season\" started, because we'd flock to the beach for swimming......such deep water ! That was before the weather went crazy and the hurricanes have become such monsters. So, I have a little more insight about what a perfect storm could be like - I would also like to say you can't get me on the ocean now-a-days - this movie vividly demonstrates \"you can't mess with Mother nature\" (some folk admitted that). You saw in this film that no matter how large a ship is, the water is stronger and certainly unpredictable. That first ship you saw was a tanker about as big as a football-field - the second, maybe bigger......loaded with containers. If you haven't been to a port to witness how large these ships are, then you certainly have no business trying to critique a movie about the ocean. A lot of people mentioned \"The Titanic\" - it was a small ship, compared to today's; The Queen Mary is permanently docked at Long Beach, and you'd be surprised how small IT is. The QM-2 recently docked along-side of it (2006), which made it look like a skiff. Not yet, but eventually one of the super cruise-ships will sink (\"Poseidon Adventure\") and the world will be shown you take your life in your own hands by venturing out onto the oceans. Remember \"The Andrea Doria\"?\n\n\n\nNow, think about people who sail on those boats from the East Coast just about every day to fish for a living. If you think the North Atlantic is bad, the ships that fish in the North Pacific close to Alaska are immense. Yet, they are constantly sinking; the pay is so high for the men who work on these ships, they feel they'll do one season of fishing and make enough money to get on their feet - and they're right.\n\n\n\nI suppose those who were so terribly disappointed in the cast of \"The Perfect Storm\" were expecting some heavy acting, maybe people in evening-clothing, highly emotionally sensational lines. Guess What! The actors/actresses in this film were perfect, because they ARE working, not having a party. The folk left at home are terrified, because they know the danger of sailing on the seas. What ordinary people don't realize is, we've killed all the fishing-grounds along our country's coasts, and the ships DO have to sail halfway to the next continent to make a catch. So, the next time you eat a tasty crab-leg from Alaska, just keep in mind that someone was scared to death catching it.\n\n\n\n\"The Perfect Storm\" story set-up was extremely believable. The fishermen who work on the boats are not always compatible and they do not always get along, except when emergencies surface. The beating the \"Andrea Gail\" took as soon as the storm began was very believable.\n\n\n\nIf you'd read \"more\" of the \"trivia\" section, you'd know that some of the scenes were shot ON THE FRINGES of hurricane Floyd - all of it wasn't done in that huge tank. The circular motion of winds in a hurricane DO make for huge waves that collide into one another, not long lines of high water. Again, if you haven't actually witnessed a hurricane, don't write like you're an expert - sitting in a theater doesn't give you expertise to do this. Sorry you spent your $8.00 to see the movie, but it was your decision - no one guaranteed you were going to like the movie.......So, folk: you need to give this movie a break. Yes, The Coast Guard does make actual rescues in the ocean; consider how many they've rescued between Florida and Cuba and Haiti. The scene in \"The Perfect Storm\" was brilliant. And, George Clooney and Wahlberg were perfect for their roles, because they were portraying NORMAL people. Wolfgang Peterson did a great job with William Wittliff's script. I also saw \"Das Boot\" when it was first released, but I didn't faint when I learned Peterson had directed them both. In fact, there were parts of \"Das Boot\" I didn't enjoy, like guys puking on themselves - but, that's the way sailors are, huh? I now have \"The Boat\" and enjoy is thoroughly.\n\n\n\nI loved \"Murph\" and Mastrantonio's character - also \"Sully\". I just got the DVD for this movie and watched it earlier tonight. It's got my 10, because it never fails to frighten me. Whatever Oscars it won, they were deserved. Folk who know nothing about the ocean and the risks people who sail it daily, they should definitely watch this movie....then give thanks and respect to those who WORK it daily....and gave their lives.....we're on dry land. Bravo! for \"The Perfect Storm\"....\n\n\n\n9/28/06 - I watched \"the special features\" tonight: to those who made comments about 'throwing a little water on them\" should really watch them. Most of those scenes were shot on a fantastic stage with a huge tank of water, with machines that make the boats pitch, etc. So, all of the cast who were on the Andrea Gail were in great danger, not just one time but for the duration of the filming. Bravo to all !"}, {"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-perfect-storm-2000", "page_content": "The film's best scenes are more or less without dialogue, except for desperately shouted words. They are about men trapped in a maelstrom of overpowering forces. They respond heroically, because they must, but they are not heroes; their motivation is need. They have had a bad season, have made one risky last trip, have ventured beyond the familiar Grand Banks fishing grounds to the problematical Flemish Cap. Quentin, the salty old dog who sits at the bar back in Gloucester and provides color commentary, gives us the background: \"I was last there in '62. Lots of fish. Lots of weather.\" They have good luck: A catch of 60,000 pounds of swordfish. Then bad luck: The ice machine breaks down. The catch will spoil unless they get it quickly back to port. There are reports of a gathering storm. Billy lists their choices: \"Either we hang out here, or say the hell with it and drive right through.\" The crew votes to plot right through the storm and collect those paychecks. Of course, they don't understand how big the storm really is, and when another fishing boat skipper (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) tries to tell them, their antenna has blown overboard.\n\nThe scenes at sea are intercut with scenes in the bar where most of the Gloucester fishing industry seems to drink; it is conveniently located right at the end of the dock (and Diane Lane conveniently lives right upstairs). This is about right; I do not doubt that the owners, retired sailors, wives, girlfriends and drinking buddies all stand watch in a saloon during a storm, ordering rounds and eyeing the Weather Channel.\n\nEven before the storm, there are terrific set pieces, as when Murph is yanked overboard by a fishing line, and two men dive in to save him (Sully, his enemy, is the first in the water). But the heart of the film is the ordeal of two ships caught in the tempest. As the men of the Andrea Gail battle wearily against their fate, the skipper attempts to cut loose and anchor. He clings to a swaying beam while holding an acetylene torch; the wonder is that he doesn't burn a hole in himself in the attempt.\n\nEven more exciting is the parallel plot involving a Coast Guard rescue of the sailboat. A passenger (Cherry Jones) pleads with its owner to seek safer waters, but he is a pigheaded millionaire yachtsman (Bob Gunton) with no respect for nature (\"This is MY boat!\"). A helicopter rescue is attempted, shown in amazing action footage, and then the tension escalates as the chopper tries to go on to the Andrea Gail, a mid-air refueling is attempted, and eventually men are risking their lives in what seems like a doomed struggle (at one point, a Guardsman who is safe goes back into the sea after a crew mate)."}, {"url": "https://www.supersummary.com/the-perfect-storm/summary/", "page_content": "Overview\n\nThe Perfect Storm is a 1997 nonfiction book by Sebastian Junger, who writes for numerous magazines, including Outside, American Heritage, and Men\u2019s Journal. He has lived most of his life on the Massachusetts coast.\n\nIn late September of 1991, the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail departs the town of Gloucester, Massachusetts with six men aboard, for a month-long fishing trip. In late October, as a powerful storm begins to build in the fishing waters of the North Atlantic\u2014a storm that will come to be known as \u201cThe Storm of the Century\u201d by those in its path, and, simply, \u201cThe Perfect Storm\u201d by meteorologists, who watch it come together\u2014captain Billy Tyne radios to the other ships in the fleet one line: \u201cShe\u2019s coming on boys, and she\u2019s coming on strong\u201d (106). Soon after, the Andrea Gail will disappear from the face of the earth, leaving behind loved ones mourning the loss, and a stunned Gloucester.\n\nIn trying to uncover what happened to the Andrea Gail, Junger interviews captains from other ships, Coast Guard personnel, and family members of those lost. He traces the history of fishing in the Atlantic, and especially the lucrative, dangerous trade of swordfishing\u2014\u201ca young man\u2019s game, a single man\u2019s game\u201d (17). He describes life in Gloucester, and how many young men are called to sea for the money. He recreates the last days of the crew of the Andrea Gail, and attempts to recreate their last moments.\n\nJunger also traces the development of this \u201cPerfect Storm,\u201d and the three weather systems that spawned it. He studies waves and wind and their effect on ships. He studies hurricanes, \u201cby far the most powerful event on earth\u201d (102). He describes what happens to the body in cold water, to be at sea in total darkness, and, ultimately, to drown. He lists accounts of ships going down in foul weather, ships that survived but were forever altered, and ships that, like the Andrea Gail, were never heard from again.\n\nAmidst the wind and waves and the attempt to uncover the mystery of the Gail, Junger describes the heroic rescues, and rescue attempts, that occurred during the storm: the Satori, a sloop that started out from Maine en route to the Bahamas and was so beaten and battered those on board had to abandon ship; the Eishin Maru, a Japanese ship disabled in the storm; and the Andrea Gail. He recounts the helicopter that went down trying to save a lone Japanese sailor and the rescue attempt of the rescuers. He also recounts the aftermath, the depression and despair that settled upon those who faced such high seas."}, {"url": "https://letterboxd.com/film/the-perfect-storm/", "page_content": "A crew of desperate fishermen put it all on the line to turn their luck around ... but mother nature had other plans.\n\n\"You could be a meteorologist all your life... and never see something like this.

Data buoys measured waves as high as 100 feet, and the boat was hit with winds measuring 80 knots (92 miles per hour). The night before the storm, on October 28, Andrea Gail\u2019s captain, Billy Tyne, radioed to area fishermen, \u201cShe\u2019s coming on, boys, and she\u2019s coming on strong.\u201d\n\nThe Andrea Gail\u2019s six-man crew\u2014Tyne, along with David Sullivan, Bobby Shatford, Alfred Pierre, Dale Murphy, and Michael Moran, all young men in their twenties and thirties\u2014didn\u2019t make it home. As one local fisherman would tell Junger, \u201cWhatever happened happened quick.\u201d\n\nThe Andrea Gail\u2019s emergency beacon washed ashore that November on Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia, but the boat was never found. The crew left behind five children among them, and the entire small town mourned the loss.\n\nThe Original Story of \u2018The Perfect Storm\u2019 Six young men set out on a dead-calm sea to seek their fortunes. Suddenly they were hit by the worst gale in a century, and there wasn\u2019t even time to shout. Six young men set out on a dead-calm sea to seek their fortunes. Suddenly they were hit by the worst gale in a century, and there wasn\u2019t even time to shout. Read the Classic\n\nJunger was captivated by the event\u2014and eventually the world would be as well. He spent months interviewing fishermen and surviving family members to write \u201cThe Storm,\u201d which ran in the October 1994 issue of Outside. The article grew into the 1997 bestselling book The Perfect Storm and the 2000 movie of the same name, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. The legend of the Andrea Gail fueled a fascination with the dangerous work of commercial fishing that led to shows like Deadliest Catch. Since the Andrea Gail\u2019s demise, the industry has only become more perilous, as violent storms have pushed farther into the north Atlantic Ocean and dwindling catches have meant smaller profits and smaller crews doing the same work. Since 1991, 11 more Gloucester fishermen have been lost at sea.\n\nSebastian Junger, right, with actors Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney on The Perfect Storm film set. (Photo: Claudette Barius/Warner Bros/Online USA/Getty)\n\nThe dignity and adventure found in dangerous work are themes that have stayed with Junger throughout his writing career. His war reporting from Bosnia and Afghanistan informed his next books, War and Tribe. And Restrepo, the documentary he made with the late photojournalist Tim Hetherington about a year in the life of a U.S. Army platoon in Afghanistan, was nominated for an Academy Award in 2010. His most recent book, Freedom, about a months-long walk along the railways of Pennsylvania, came out in spring 2021.\n\nJunger spoke with contributing editor Elizabeth Hightower Allen by phone from his apartment in New York, where he lives with his wife and two children.\n\nOUTSIDE: Let\u2019s rewind. You were working as a tree climber when the Andrea Gail went down?\n\nJUNGER: I was 29. I was living in Gloucester and trying to make my way as a freelance writer, basically blundering through my twenties and wasting an enormous amount of time. I had this job as a climber for tree companies. I\u2019d be topping out pine trees, 80 feet in the air. It was all the right mix of scary, chainsaws, and heights\u2014things that could kill you if you did it wrong. But it allowed me to write. And it gave me a dose of reality. I got a little careless with the chainsaw and whacked the back of my leg. I was up in the tree on a rope, with a running chainsaw, looking down at my Achilles tendon. Thank God I didn\u2019t sever it, but I laid it open. I was limping around Gloucester recovering when this huge storm hit. A Gloucester boat, the Andrea Gail, was presumed lost a thousand miles out to sea.\n\nHad you written for many magazines at that point?\n\nIt would have been my first national magazine piece. I\u2019d been thinking about writing a book of essays about dangerous jobs. I was very enamored of John McPhee, and I wanted to do a collection of essays on forest firefighting, drilling for oil, working as a war reporter\u2014basically all the stuff I wanted to learn to do myself. So I sent Outside what I thought of as the first chapter of that book: 15,000 words on the Andrea Gail. Hampton Sides, who was an editor at the magazine then, worked with me on a new shorter version that became \u201cThe Storm.\u201d\n\nSo you were approaching people in the fishing community without an assignment saying, \u201cI\u2019d like to do a book on this.\u201d I imagine that was hard.\n\nThe family of one of the crew, Bobby Shatford, ran a waterfront bar, the Crow\u2019s Nest, that was the center of the fishing community. His mother, Ethel Shatford Preston, was the bartender. I walked into that bar, and she didn\u2019t know me from Adam, and I started asking questions about her son who had died. She didn\u2019t throw me out. She heard me out. Had she not done that, the book wouldn\u2019t exist. I would have been shown the door.\n\nA lot of that was because, I think, I was someone who was also \u201cworking for a living.\u201d I would go into the bar covered in sawdust from a tree job, dirty from a day\u2019s work. There are two kinds of jobs: the kind where you shower the morning before you go to work and the kind where you shower at the end of the day after you come home. I had the latter. I have no idea, but I think that probably allowed her to at least give me a chance.\n\nWhat did the community think about the magazine story?\n\nThey loved it. They put it up on the wall at the Crow\u2019s Nest. That said, it was hard to know if it made a larger splash beyond Gloucester, because the internet didn\u2019t exist at the time. I think the story got some attention, but the earth didn\u2019t stop. I didn\u2019t necessarily think that the book would be a big hit, either\u2014I knew I was writing something somewhat journalistically novel, but I wasn\u2019t fool enough to think it would be a bestseller. Fast forward ten years, and everyone was obsessed with dangerous jobs\u2014Deadliest Catch, all of that\u2014but not in 1994.\n\nWhen you did write the book, you found yourself in deeper water\u2014that the central narrative, what actually happened to the Andrea Gail, was essentially unknowable.\n\nWhile the years were slowly turning in the literary world about whether I could sell that book, I went off to Sarajevo to learn how to be a war reporter. I\u2019d been in Bosnia six months when my agent faxed me in Zagreb and said, \u201cCongratulations. I sold your book proposal for $35,000. Now you\u2019ve got to come home and write it.\u201d\n\nI thought, How do you write a whole book when the central drama of the book is just a huge question mark? The boat disappeared. How do I do that without fictionalizing? And then I read The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. He did this amazing thing where he was writing about things that he could not personally have known either. About the first character to come down with Marburg virus, he writes, maybe he was walking home, maybe he looked at the sunset. It had an inherent tension to it because the reader realizes, Oh my God, we don\u2019t know. And there\u2019s no way to know.\n\nAll of a sudden, what seemed like a deficit of information became a dramatic asset: the Andrea Gail could have done this, or maybe more probably, according to other fishermen, this is what was happening. When I started writing it in that way, I got really excited. The dread of impending failure finally left me and, and I thought, I can do this. This is a cool way to write a book.\n\nJunger\u2019s book and the movie based on it were hugely popular. (Photos, from left: Courtesy W.W. Norton & Company; Warner Bros)\n\nOf course, it did become a monster hit. The Perfect Storm has now sold more than five million copies worldwide. How did that affect Gloucester?\n\nI think people in town really felt like the industry and the town were getting the credit they deserved; these are rough, working-class guys and working-class families, and they\u2019re not used to a lot of love or even appreciation. Suddenly being a fisherman was cool, particularly with the movie. The bookstore was selling the book like crazy, and it spawned a cottage industry in town. There was a guided Perfect Storm tour\u2014you\u2019d have a drink at the Crow\u2019s Nest, talk to the guys loading the ships with ice, and go to the bait shop. They weren\u2019t banking millions, but it created something. It was a pride of place and pride of job\u2014recognition for a very, very hard, brutal, dangerous job.\n\nDid you keep in touch with many of the families?\n\nI was enormously fond of Ethel Shatford Preston, whose family ran the Crow\u2019s Nest. She was this powerful mother figure for a lot of people in Gloucester. She had such a big heart. We became really good friends. When she died of cancer in 1999, the family asked me to speak at her memorial.\n\nI did have one regret about Ethel, however. She smoked quite a lot, and I described her\u2014I\u2019d never written a book before, and it never occurred to me that the people you write about will actually read the book\u2014as gray-faced. She loved the book, but at one point she was like, \u201cGray-faced, huh?\u201d And I thought, Oh my God. Of course, you read that description. It was a funny moment of realization.\n\nAfter The Perfect Storm, you moved into war reporting\u2014embedding with U.S. infantrymen in Afghanistan for Restrepo, walking U.S. railways with veterans in The Last Patrol and Freedom. But in many ways, The Perfect Storm seems like the beginning of those themes\u2014a group of brothers in dangerous situations.\n\nI hadn\u2019t conceived of it in those terms. When I wrote The Perfect Storm, I really thought I was writing about dangerous jobs. But dangerous work is done by young men\u2014young working-class men, typically, not that there aren\u2019t women as well. And young men have an enormously high risk tolerance. As a result, they die in violence and accidents at something like six times the rate of young women. So, who are you going to put in a job or who\u2019s going to be drawn to a job that has a very elevated chance of killing you?\n\nLooking back, I realize that I\u2019ve been drawn to writing about different forms of all-male groups. Their dynamics are fascinating. And honestly, being in those groups as a man is extremely enjoyable. When I was with a platoon in combat, I was as happy as could be. It was brutally cold and unbelievably dramatic. I mean, the helicopters and the firefights\u2014everything was just so over the top. I couldn\u2019t believe I was seeing Americans in a war zone. I was like, \u201cAre you kidding? Some kid from Wichita is just returning fire in Zabul province at some Afghans. Are you kidding?\u201d\n\nThroughout your career, you\u2019ve encountered a huge element of personal risk yourself\u2014really off-the-charts personal risk. And you\u2019ve lost friends in battle. Yet your closest call came right at home, in 2020, when your pancreatic artery burst.\n\nI stopped war reporting after my buddy Tim Hetherington died, who I made Restrepo with. He was killed in Libya on an assignment I was supposed to be on, and at the last minute, I couldn\u2019t go, and he got killed. After that, I stopped war reporting. I got divorced, and I remarried; I had a family. Now, not only would I not put my life at risk unnecessarily, but the aneurysm\u2014that near-death experience\u2014really affected me. I was very, very lucky to survive it.\n\nThe doctor was cutting my neck open to put a line into my jugular to try to get blood into me fast enough to save me. And I said, \u201cYou gotta hurry. You\u2019re losing me right now.\u201d\n\nYou have to know, I\u2019m not only unmystical, I\u2019m anti-mystical. But as that was going on\u2014as I was dying, really\u2014a black pit opened up underneath me, sucking me down into it. And my dead father appeared, as if to welcome me, and I wanted nothing to do with him. I mean, I was like, \u201cI love you, Dad. But we have nothing to talk about right now.\u201d\n\nThen I found out that encountering dead relatives is very, very common with people who are dying. They don\u2019t really have an explanation for it.\n\nWhoa. And now you\u2019re researching a book, called Pulse. Will it go into those near-death experiences or the forces that keep us alive?\n\nI think my book is going to be looking at all of those things but from an implacably rationalist, nonsentimental viewpoint.\n\nThe experience has given me a real awareness of mortality. All we have is now. Being here right now with my children: that\u2019s what life is for me now. I don\u2019t regret the past, and I don\u2019t plan for the future. I\u2019m just, here I am, you know?"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6545608-the-perfect-storm", "page_content": "\"All collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it had five thousand years ago.\" - Moby Dick.\n\n\n\nI have a special bond with this story. My first encounter with \"The Perfect Storm\" was through watching the movie. I still remember that movie clearly on my mind even though I haven't watched it for a few years now. It's even easily in my top-ten favorite movies of all time list. I simply loved it. As a child I had always been terrified of the ocean and all its dangers. Strangely though, I was in-love with the concept of fishing even though I didn't like fish too much. I remember watching the movie as a kid and considering the possibility of becoming a fisherman. Yup, I had those daydreams. I would wait a decade before I would find out about the book. A few weeks ago, I was scouring Rob Ermita's Book Sale, as I always do when I feel the need to read a real book. After reading a few books from my Kindle, I'd often feel hollow, and I'd end up looking for solid, empirical, tree-destroying, ink-drinking books. I was shaken when I first saw the book. That one of my favorite stories of all time was a book and I had no idea about it. How it was able to elude me all these years remains such a great mystery to me. Before we continue on, I feel the need to remind you that this book is not a work of fiction, this is a true story.\n\n\n\n\"Meteorologists see perfection in strange things,\" Junger writes, \"and the meshing of three completely independent weather systems to form a hundred-year event is one of them. My God, thought Case, this is the perfect storm.\" This powerful book is a chilling, daunting, experience at one of the greatest forces of nature the world has ever seen and the lives of people it had on its mercy.\n\n\n\n\"To be out at sea in the path of such an event would be a catastrophic experience. And so it evidently proved for the six men aboard the Andrea Gail, a 72-foot swordfish boat that disappeared off the coast of Nova Scotia on Oct. 28, leaving behind only fuel drums, a propane tank and sundry radio equipment that were found weeks later. To dramatize the incredible fury of a severe storm at sea, Junger reconstructs the fatal voyage of the Andrea Gail.\n\nHow does he manage to do this with no survivors to interview and with no details available about the ship's final hours of existence? A good deal is known up to a certain point: the layout of the Andrea Gail; the routine of a previous outing; how the crew members spent their time before leaving Gloucester, Mass., their home port; the pressure they were under to fill their hold with swordfish; the high risk of injury or death in the business; the bad feelings about the coming trip that drove two crew members to walk away before it began.\n\nJunger nicely paces his narrative by interrupting it with histories of Gloucester, of the New England fishing industry and its gradual decline, and of the development of long-line fishing -- dragging a 40-mile-long monofilament with up to 1,000 baited hooks.\n\nHe creates a distinct atmosphere when he writes: \"At dinner the crew talk about what men everywhere talk about -- women, lack of women, kids, sports, horse racing, money, lack of money, work. They talk a lot about work; they talk about it the way men in prison talk about time. Work is what's keeping them from going home, and they all want to go home.\" You can sense the coming storm when he writes: \"The sunset is a bloody rust-red on a sharp autumn horizon, and the night comes in fast with a northwest wind and a sky riveted with stars. There's no sound but the smack of water on steel and the heavy gargle of the diesel engine.\"\n\nFor information beyond what is known of the Andrea Gail's destruction, Junger turns to \"people who had been through similar situations and survived.\" From such interviews he learns what an 80-mile-an-hour wind sounds like and what it feels like to be tossed by waves 100 feet high.\n\nPerhaps most compelling of all, he explains in concrete detail why hurricanes blow, how waves rise, what happens to boats in a storm and the way human beings drown. Thus he is able to reconstruct what he calls \"the zero-moment point.\" When drowning, he writes in this frightening chapter, \"the body could be likened to a crew that resorts to increasingly desperate measures to keep their vessel afloat.\" He concludes, \"Eventually the last wire has shorted out, the last bit of decking has settled under the water.\" The crew members of the Andrea Gail \"are dead.\"\n\nAfter this calamity, the narrative of \"The Perfect Storm\" abruptly shifts its focus to describe a couple of heart-stopping rescue attempts, one of them successful, the other a costly fiasco by pararescue teams from the New York State Air National Guard. What is particularly impressive here is the dedication of professional storm watchers to save any human life at sea, no matter what foolishness or bad luck led to the trouble.\n\nDespite the upbeat ending of \"The Perfect Storm,\" what lingers is a sense of the cruel indifference of nature. One chapter's epigraph quotes \"Moby-Dick\": \"All collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it had five thousand years ago.\"\n\nEven more chilling is the lack of closure that the families of the victims experienced. Junger writes: \"If the men on the 'Andrea Gail' had simply died, and their bodies were lying in state somewhere, their loved ones could make their goodbyes and get on with their lives. But they didn't die, they disappeared off the face of the earth and, strictly speaking, it's just a matter of faith that these men will never return. Such faith takes work, it takes effort. The people of Gloucester must willfully extract these men from their lives and banish them to another world.\n\nTo have to strive for a belief in death and oblivion: a perfect conclusion to \"The Perfect Storm.\"\n\n-NY Times Book Review\n\n\n\nThis book is a testament to the nature's power, and it is fitting.

The movie was set in the desert, thousands of years in the past, and followed Johnson's warrior character Mathayus as he and his allies fought to keep the evil Memnon from conquering and killing more people. Memnon attempted to become The Scorpion King, but ultimately Mathayus claimed the title.\n\nWe don't know much about the remake's plot at this point, but we do know that it won't be set in the distant past.

Alternatively, we could see an altogether new character take on the Scorpion King title.\n\nIt remains to be seen if The Scorpion King will turn out successful, like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle's addition to the Jumanji story, or go the way of the box office flop The Mummy reboot.

Flagons are hoisted. Filthy, battle-hardened men cheer. Half-nude women pose like they\u2019re sitting for Frank Frazetta portraits. Just before the barbarian chieftain can execute his prisoner, an interloper crashes into the scene, setting up the film\u2019s first big action setpiece. The intruder is Jesup\u2019s half-brother, Mathayus (Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson), whose chiseled, 6-foot-5 frame is lit and framed for maximum ogling potential. His first line, given to a roomful of startled warriors and their party guests: \u201cBoo.\u201d A melee ensues, a star is born \u2014 and so is the modern blockbuster. No one knew it at the time, but The Scorpion King was strangely prescient. Seen today, it looks like an early example of the movies dominating the box office.\n\nTwenty years ago, when The Scorpion King hit theaters, Johnson was perhaps the most recognizable professional wrestler in the world, a multi-time WWF champion with enough mainstream star power to host Saturday Night Live. But he wasn\u2019t a movie actor yet. His first film role was as Mathayus in 2001\u2019s The Mummy Returns, where he gives a wordless performance that\u2019s mostly buried under layers of hideous, PlayStation 2-cutscene-style CGI. In The Scorpion King, he reprises that role. But except for a few clumsy bits of dialogue about how \u201cthe blood of the scorpion will always flow in his veins,\u201d this version of Mathayus stands alone.\n\n\u201cThe Rock has the authority to play the role and the fortitude to keep a straight face,\u201d Roger Ebert wrote in his three-star review of the film. \u201cI expect him to become a durable action star.\u201d The fruition of Ebert\u2019s prophecy, as Johnson rose to become one of the most recognizable and bankable action-movie stars in America, is just one of several ways The Scorpion King anticipated the next two decades of blockbuster movies.\n\nThe occasional dodgy bit of CGI aside, The Scorpion King is an appealingly old-school piece of filmmaking. Helmed by veteran director Chuck Russell, it sits in a lineage that includes the Technicolor Biblical epics of the \u201950s and \u201960s and the pulpy sword-and-sorcery flicks of the \u201980s. The story is flimsy and comfortingly familiar \u2014 a noble warrior is tasked with killing a sorceress whose magic aids a tyrant, but they fall in love instead, teaming up to usurp the throne.\n\nRussell shoots it with scenery-chewing delight, with only minimal breaks for expository dialogue between its bouts of swordplay and derring-do. The film it most resembles is John Milius\u2019 1982 adaptation of Conan the Barbarian, starring a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. Like Johnson, Schwarzenegger wasn\u2019t cast for his acting chops so much as the way his bodybuilder\u2019s physique looked on celluloid. But both men delivered striking performances that lit a path forward for them in Hollywood.\n\nThe fact that Johnson was still primarily known as a wrestler is used as an in-joke in The Scorpion King\u2019s script. In an early scene where Mathayus arrives in the harem of the despotic Memnon (Steven Brand), the tyrant\u2019s concubines stealthily steal his weapons, so when the palace guards enter, he has to wrestle them. In a later battle between Mathayus and Nubian warrior Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan), their swords immediately shatter on impact, forcing the men to grapple and suplex one another for several sweaty minutes.\n\nAt times, Mathayus just wrestles dudes because he wants to, even with his bow and sword at his back. Russell\u2019s camera in these scenes is kinetic without being frantic, and the moments when The Scorpion King turns into what the Coen brothers\u2019 Barton Fink called \u201cwrestling pictures\u201d are among the best things about the movie.\n\nBut the movie did help expand the opportunities available for wrestlers-turned-actors like Dave Bautista and John Cena, men who were once cast for their brawny bodies, but now work consistently in major movies, crossing genre lines in the process. (Both have developed into better actors than Johnson, but his pure movie-star charisma still outshines theirs.) The act of casting a wrestler in a movie used to feel like a reflexive gag \u2014 think Andre the Giant playing a giant in 1987\u2019s The Princess Bride, or Roddy Piper in 1988\u2019s They Live taking time out from uncovering an alien plot to wrestle Keith David for nearly 10 minutes. Today, this kind of career crossover just feels normal.\n\nThe Scorpion King\u2019s place in the cultural firmament seemed unremarkable in 2002. It was a low-stakes spinoff of a successful action series, with a charismatic lead actor and a breezy screenplay that played to his strengths. Studios made a dozen of these movies every year, most of which found audiences big enough to keep them coming. The Scorpion King made $180 million against a $60 million budget. It was a tidy profit for Universal, and proof that the gamble of making Johnson the highest-paid actor in a debut lead role paid off. Three weeks after the film\u2019s release, everything changed.\n\nOn May 3, 2002, Sam Raimi launched his superhero trilogy with Spider-Man, an uneasy companion piece to The Scorpion King. Both films handed the keys of PG-13 popcorn franchises to directors who\u2019d made their names with \u201980s horror films. (Russell directed the well-regarded third installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, as well as the 1988 remake of The Blob. Raimi was the lo-fi wizard behind the Evil Dead films.) Both films launched their marketing campaigns with extremely-of-their-time alt-rock songs, with The Scorpion King tapping Godsmack for \u201cI Stand Alone,\u201d and members of Nickelback and Saliva teaming up to write \u201cHero\u201d for Spider-Man.\n\nAnd both walked the line of taking inherently ridiculous material seriously and knowing when to inject a laugh. Unlike The Scorpion King, though, Spider-Man redefined the business of movies, making $825 million and helping set the stage for the all-consuming Marvel Cinematic Universe that launched in earnest six years later. (The way The Scorpion King was immediately overshadowed by a superhero movie is perhaps the one way it was most ahead of its time as a blockbuster movie.)\n\nBefore long, the burgeoning superhero genre all but pushed movies like The Scorpion King out of cinemas. Once it was apparent that there was more money to be made in exploiting familiar IP than in introducing audiences to new characters, the writing was on the wall for Mathayus and his ilk. The Scorpion King spawned a handful of direct-to-video sequels, none starring Johnson. In 2021, five of the top six domestic box office hauls were for Marvel adaptations. The sixth was F9: The Fast Saga, the latest installment in a franchise that until recently included Dwayne Johnson. The style of filmmaking that helped make Johnson a movie star was going extinct \u2014 but he found a way to transcend it.\n\nBy 2005, Johnson had shed \u201cThe Rock\u201d from his stage name, rightly assuming that name recognition for his movies was quickly outpacing his wrestling fame. He joined the cast of the Fast & Furious series, headlined his own franchise with Jumanji, led films like Pain & Gain and Skyscraper, and even became an unlikely Disney star with his voice work in the animated feature Moana and the Indiana Jones throwback Jungle Cruise. The most reliable film franchises outside of the MCU and Star Wars might be \u201cmovies with Dwayne Johnson in them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was inevitable that Dwayne Johnson would become a star, but somebody had to give him his first lead role. Though The Scorpion King came at the end of one epoch in blockbuster filmmaking and the dawning of another, it certainly looks prophetic in its big casting gamble. It also predicted modern cinema\u2019s mania for interconnected worlds, prequel spinoffs, and the tendency to take even vanishingly minor characters from successful franchises and build entire universes around them.\n\nMathayus didn\u2019t end up anchoring a cinematic Mummy-verse, but in retrospect, the guiding principles behind The Scorpion King look a lot like the logic that led to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and to Disney Plus\u2019 hugely popular MCU and Star Wars spinoff shows. (Who is Hawkeye if not the Mathayus of the Avengers?) The Scorpion King is also a perfectly enjoyable movie on its own merits, a brisk 92-minute adventure romp with rich settings, memorable characters, and sharp fight choreography.\n\nIt\u2019s no masterpiece, but it\u2019s the kind of movie that we used to take for granted, until it became an endangered species. Multiplexes today are purveyors of too-big-to-fail spectacles, with marathon runtimes, hulking lead actors, and universe-enveloping stakes. The Scorpion King seems quaint by comparison. But while it belongs to an earlier era of blockbuster filmmaking, it helped plant the seeds for the one we live in now."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277296/reviews", "page_content": "6 /10\n\nThe ability to win over new fans is not easy when one is shoved into the limelight so quickly. After briefly appearing as The Scorpion King in Stephen Sommers' anticipated sequel The Mummy Returns (2001), Universal Studios believed that it was time to create their spin-off starring none other than Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Originally only taking part in wrestling, Johnson was bit by the acting bug and agreed to star in this film as his feature debut. As known by many, this spin-off movie was a prequel, to a sequel of a movie that was a remake of an older movie. Sounds confusing, but it can be understood. Once you think about it, it does make sense. As for being a well-written story,..not really. There are a lot of pluses to this film but it has its drawbacks too.\n\n\n\nAs a film that tells the background to how Mathayus, The Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson) got his name, it doesn't really declare itself publicly. Yet somehow, everyone knows by the end. Originally, Mathayus belonged to a group of hired assassins during a time when a ruthless dictator known as Memnon (Steven Brand) was looking to conquer everybody and anybody. Mathayus and his fellow assassins were hired to take out Memnon and a powerful sorceress (Kelly Hu) who sees visions of the future. All the same like other assassins hired to kill, they end up getting caught caring too much. This happens when Mathayus and the sorceress become attached to each other. As an origin story, the narrative is mostly predictable. Also, since it is a prequel, audiences already have an idea of what is going to happen. However, this doesn't make the viewing experience unwatchable. Aside from the story being a touch too clich\u00e9, there are a couple of other setbacks.\n\n\n\nThe first belongs to the sorceress' powers to see into the future. There isn't any logic behind this other than it just being shown that she has these powers. In other words, the audience just has to accept this as a fact and not care about the reasoning. Yet for viewers who have a harder time shutting off their brain or are just more inquisitive, the understanding behind how she acquired her powers would've been appreciated to have. The other issue is the tone of the script, which constantly flip-flops in the midst of goofy and serious. Thus, the end result tends to be an entire cheese fest because you want to take the story seriously but can't because of how certain situations are handled. Having a character give a rather immature nod to the audience because someone went to bed with them, kind of breaks the rules on how serious a viewer can take this story. Another example is pairing up the protagonist with mildly unneeded sidekick named Arpid (Grant Haslov). Most of his comments are just too obvious to be even said.\n\n\n\nAs for who wrote those moments into the script, it most likely belonged to William Osborne (best known for writing Twins (1988) & everyone's hated Stallone film Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992)). The other writing credits belong to Stephen Sommers (rightfully so) and David Hayter (X-Men (2000), X-Men 2 (2003) & Watchmen (2009)). So it's not like every writer behind this production didn't have the credentials. The directing was also headed competently by the underrated Chuck Russell (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), The Blob (1988) remake & The Mask (1994)). Even with its cheese factor, the main cast is able to perform okay. Dwayne Johnson was no doubt the right choice to be Mathayus because what would a spin-off origin movie be if the actor doesn't return to play the role he made? Steven Brand is a worthy opponent to Johnson but it probably would've been an even better idea if Michael Clarke Duncan (who plays along side Johnson) was the enemy. It just would've been a better showdown.\n\n\n\nKelly Hu is attractive in her own right and doesn't give a bland performance either. The rest of the cast (including Grant Haslov) also act okay but nothing that is of much importance. They do help near the end and add to the overall cheese at times but they a necessity. Cinematography was ably contributed by John R. Leonetti who was able to mimic Adrian Biddle's work from Sommers' The Mummy (1999) universe. There are lots of desert shots, while the set pieces appear grand and ancient. The action was also well choreographed and since sword fights aren't exactly the most used types of action sequences; it entertains. For the musical score, John Debney composed behind the film. For this listening experience, Debney uses a blend of organic orchestra with what also sounds like occasional rock/pop beats. This was probably used in order to accommodate Johnson's fans but the beats actually don't mess with the score too much. The action cues sound appropriate with the scene it follows and it's in line with the genre. If the story to this movie was taken a little more seriously, this probably would've entertained more.\n\n\n\nIts script is not clear on everything and its unequal tone makes the actors look occasionally cheesy on film. It's okay in some ways and others not so much. Luckily, the camera-work, action, music and main cast are able to manipulate it in their favor to entertain on very mindless level."}, {"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/27/the-scorpion-king", "page_content": "The Rock is...THE SCORPION KING!\n\nTwo words: Kelly Hu\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan kicks your ass.\n\nIf this were Conan, they'd all be topless!\n\nPan & Scan this, bitch.\n\nThe colors!

This past summer The Scorpion King invaded theaters to deliver a completely mindless, but fun, barbarian action film.Just in time for the big holiday DVD season, Universal is releasing the flick on a packed special edition disc complete with commentary by The Rock and director Chuck Russell, a bunch of featurettes, alternate scenes, and much more.In The Mummy Returns we learn that the Scorpion King was this great warrior king, but learn nothing of his past. This movie flashes back far into history (3000 B.C. to be exact) before this warrior was the Scorpion King. When The Scorpion King opens we immediately see The Rock kicking some ass as Mathayus - one of the last of the Akkadians.We learn that the Akkadians are skilled, and stealthy, assassins. So, the movie kicks into gear with Mathayus and his pals accepting a mission to kill the sorceress (played by the ultra yummy Kelly Hu) who gives the warlord Memnon (Steven Brand) his conquering power. When Mathayus is betrayed during the mission and his brother is killed, he decides to skip the sorceress and go after Memnon instead. Thus begins the story of The Scorpion King.Unlike the drab sequel, The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King does not take itself seriously at all. It knows that it's a mindless action flick with The Rock as its star. That's one of the reasons it's so enjoyable. You can just throw out any thought of a serious story and watch some fun action sequences without the movie trying to shove a poorly written story down your throat.The Rock has to carry this movie, and while he won't be walking away with a Best Actor award anytime soon, he knows how to hold a scene and can spout the one-liners without sounding stupid (xXx anyone?). You can probably chalk his commanding screen presence and charisma up to his experience in the WWE, where he was able to refine those qualities to be a huge crowd favorite.In a way, this movie is what The Mummy Returns should have been. The original Mummy was a mindless and fun popcorn flick that didn't take itself too seriously. Its sequel went wrong when they decided to take the story seriously and fudged it up with way too much cheesy CGI. The Scorpion King is much closer to the original flick in terms of the way it handles the mixture of story and action. It isn't as good, but it's close and a lot of fun to just sit down and watch.CG here is really subtle with most of the effects being put towards creating an ancient world with digital matte paintings. There aren't any mutant Egyptian dogs that look like Gugan rejects or giant cheesy Rock/Scorpion monsters to be found here.Also, comparisons to Conan obviously pop up with any new \"barbarian\" movie, but nothing will topple that Arnie classic. This movie is a PG-13 action flick churned out for the mass market and kids who watch wrestling. Conan was a brutal fantasy flick with blood, boobs, and Arnold. Perhaps if The Scorpion King went all out with an R rating it could be a Conan for a new generation, but it isn't.But, that's just a fanboy complaint. Check your brain at the door, pop some popcorn, and get ready for some mindless fun. That's what The Scorpion King is.Earlier this year, Universal released The Fast and the Furious on DVD with an absolutely pristine transfer. This 2.35:1 anamorphic job on The Scorpion King is just as impressive as that DVD.Daytime scenes feature perfect colors and clarity while flesh tones are perfectly natural. The scenes at night feature absolutely perfect blacks and show no compression problems whatsoever. Throughout the entire film transfer doesn't really falter much except for a bit of edge enhancement in several scenes.This is another one of those transfers that delivers an almost three-dimensional image. The opening fight in the small hut starts things off well, towards the middle of the movie the party stops at this lush oasis that just leaps off the screen, and the final battle on the top of the temple looks incredible with the large flickering flames lighting the entire area.With so many extras crammed onto this disc, and with such great video quality, it appears as if Universal simply ran out of space and had to skip out on the DTS mix some people where hoping for. It isn't a huge deal, but DTS fanatics will most likely be quite disappointed.The surrounds are active throughout the entire film. Be it sounds of a rowdy crowd, a bustling city, or clashing weapons and armor of battle you're surrounded by strong audio from the opening scene to the final credits. The front channels are put to good use with discrete sound effects used from time to time as well. Low end in the track is very strong, especially at the \"explosive\" final confrontation of the movie with huge explosions that rattle the room.The audio loses a point for the lack of a DTS track, but the existing mix does get the job done.One of the best features on the DVD is a series of alternate scenes that can be viewed on their own or while you view the movie in an \"enhanced viewing\" mode that works just like all of those \"follow the white rabbit\" featurettes on other DVDs. When a scimitar appears while you're in the movie, you can press enter to view an alternate version of that specific scene. And unlike many other deleted scenes features on other DVDs, these are actually good and slide in another layer to the thin story that already makes up the flick.There are a total of nine alternate scenes and all are presented in non-anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5.1. These include an alternate opening scene, but most have to do with a prophecy that was cut out of the movie that had Memnon believing he was the king that was prophesized to rise, but in reality it was Mathayus.There are two commentary tracks on the disc, but in reality they should have been combined into one. The first is by The Rock, but you can really tell this is his first commentary. There are quite a few long pauses in the track, and when he does speak up it's to usually just point out something he liked about an action sequence. Occasionally he'll offer up a bit of information about the preparation for a certain fight, but it's rare. This track also has an \"enhanced viewing mode\" where an icon will pop up that lets you know that you can view a clip of The Rock recording this commentary when you press enter on your remote.Thankfully, the second commentary is a bit more informative. In it, director Chuck Russell takes us through the movie while dishing up plenty of details about the production. Some of this includes the fact that the entire movie was filmed on location in different parts of California and that some sets from Sparticus were used in the big city scenes. He even called Conan himself (Arnie) before beginning production on The Scorpion King.With so many pauses in The Rock's track, they should have actually recorded the two at the same time while in the same room. That way, Russell can fill most of the empty space while The Rock is able to pipe up when he wants to.After the commentaries you can dig into the multiple featurettes on the disc. Just ignore the \"Spotlight on Location\" one. This is just one of those fifteen-minute commercials where the cast and crew kisses each others asses over and over. \"Ancient World Production Design\" takes a three and a half minute look at creating the sets used in the film. \"Preparing the Fight\" is a six-minute featurette that goes into detail about setting up and filming a complex fight sequence.\"The Rock and Michael Clarke Duncan\" is an amusing five-minute piece about the first fight between the two in the film as told by the stars and director Chuck Russell. \"Working with Animals\" runs for almost three minutes and talks about all of the problems that are involved with having animals in your movie. Finally, there are two very cool effects featurettes that show the CGI creation of the cobra and fire ants effects.After you're done with those original production featurettes, there's a nine-page article on the possibility that there may have been a real \"Scorpion King\" at sometime in history. Then you can check out the film's trailer in non-anamorphic widescreen video, a short clip of outtakes, Godsmack's \"I Stand Alone\" music video, a \"WWE Legends\" trailer, trailers for The Hulk and Taken, and DVD ROM Total Axess features.Finally, before you start the movie itself, DVD trailers for E.T. and the Back to the Future trilogy are shown. The E.T. one is basically a shorter version of the 20th Anniversary trailer, while the BTTF clip actually shows some footage from the supplemental features on the discs."}, {"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-scorpion-king-2002", "page_content": "The film stars The Rock, famous as a WWF wrestling star (Vince McMahon takes a producer's credit), and on the basis of this movie, he can definitely star in movies like this. This story takes place so long ago in prehistory that The Rock was a hero and had not yet turned into the villain of \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001), and we can clearly see his face and muscular physique--an improvement over the earlier film, in which his scenes mostly consisted of his face being attached to a scorpion so large it looked like a giant lobster. How gigantic was the lobster? It would take a buffalo to play the Turf.\n\nThe story: An evil Scorpion King named Memnon (Steven Brand) uses the talents of a sorceress (Kelly Hu) to map his battle plans, and has conquered most of his enemies. Then we meet three Arkadians, professional assassins who have been \"trained for generations in the deadly art,\" which indicates their training began even before they were born. The Arkadian leader Mathayus, played by The Rock, is such a powerful man that early in the film he shoots a guy with an arrow and the force of the arrow sends the guy crashing through a wall and flying through the air. (No wonder he warns, \"Don't touch the bow.\") How The Rock morphs from this character into the \"Mummy Returns\" character is a mystery to me, and, I am sure, to him. Along the trail Mathayus loses some allies and gains others, including a Nubian giant (Michael Clarke Duncan), a scientist who has invented gunpowder, a clever kid and a wisecracking horse thief. The scene where they vow to kill the Scorpion King is especially impressive, as Mathayus intones, \"As long as one of us still breathes, the sorcerer will die!\" See if you can spot the logical loophole.\n\nMathayus and his team invade the desert stronghold of Memnon, where the sorceress, who comes from or perhaps is the first in a long line of James Bond heroines, sets eyes on him and wonders why she's bothering with the scrawny king. Special effects send Mathayus and others catapulting into harems, falling from castle walls and narrowly missing death by fire, scorpion, poisonous cobra, swordplay, arrows, explosion and being buried up to the neck in the sand near colonies of fire ants. And that's not even counting the Valley of the Death, which inspires the neo-Mametian dialogue: \"No one goes to the Valley of the Death. That's why it's called the Valley of the Death.\" Of all the special effects in the movie, the most impressive are the ones that keep the breasts of the many nubile maidens covered to within one centimeter of the PG-13 guidelines. Hu, a beautiful woman who looks as if she is trying to remember the good things her agent told her would happen if she took this role, has especially clever long, flowing hair, which cascades down over her breasts instead of up over her head, even when she is descending a waterfall."}]}
