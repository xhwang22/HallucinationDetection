A tribute.\n\nThe message of Hayek\u2019s opus magnum \u201cConstitution of Liberty\u201d is contained in the titles of its first two parts: \u201cThe Value of Freedom\u201d and \u201cFreedom and the Law\u201d. Two principles characterise a free society: limits on the power of the state and the rule of law. Hayek\u2019s main objective is that the coercion of some in society by others is reduced to the extent possible. \u201cThis state we shall describe throughout as a state of liberty or freedom,\u201d he says (p. 11). In his chapter on the origins of the rule of law he quotes John Locke: \u201cThe end of the law is, not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law there is no freedom\u201d (p. 162).\n\nIt is obvious that only a free market economy is consistent with a free society. Only within such a framework can people act as free individuals and make the best contribution to their own well-being and that of others. Competition is a fundamental element of a market economy and the driving force of the progress of mankind.\n\nIn \u201cCompetition as a discovery procedure\u201d Hayek says that \u201c\u2026 wherever the use of competition can be rationally justified, it is on the ground that we do not know in advance the facts that determine the actions of competitors. In sports or in examinations, no less than in the award of government contracts or of prizes for poetry, it would clearly be pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand who would do best\u2026 I propose to consider competition as a procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it, would not be known to anyone, or at least would not be utilised\u201d (p. 179).\n\nWe honour today a man who has lived up to these principles in word and deed. This has been most visible in his role as the most respected Commissioner in Brussels. His first responsibility was for Internal Market, Financial Services and Financial Integration (from 1995 to 1999); his second for Competition (from 1999 to 2004). His decisions were landmarks in important sectors of the European economy \u2013 the German banking sector was just one of many spectacular cases.\n\nAs Commissioner he was able to realise what an economist of his calibre and a man of independent mind and character would see as the fulfilment of his professional life. His actions reflected a rare combination of personal integrity, a sharp intellect and a broad and deep understanding of economics. His reasoning was always compelling and convincing.\n\n\u201cBrussels\u201d, a word which for many has negative connotations, was \u2013 when represented by his persona \u2013 universally respected, and feared by all those who might not, to put it mildly, have a preference for competition. CEOs of the biggest companies in the world, starting sometimes from a position of arrogance, were ultimately obliged to accept not only his decisions in favour of competition but also the superiority of his arguments. As a European antitrust attorney once said: \u201cMonti is not the type to bow down to any verbal aggression. He may have an academic exterior, but there is steel inside\u201d. Or as a lobbyist once put it: \u201cMonti is not a politician. He is an intellectual, an absolutely honest economist. He has an extremely charming way of sending you out to the desert.\u201d\n\nAmong politicians as well as the general public he is respectfully known as \u201cil professore\u201d. I could easily continue with compliments on \u201cSuper Mario\u201d. For me, he is an outstanding example of an economist who is as much esteemed among academics as he is among politicians, the business community and the public. You will not be surprised to hear me say that we need much more involvement of academics in public debate. Mario Monti demonstrates that to be successful in this respect one need not compromise on intellectual honesty \u2013 just the opposite. He is the personification of political economics in the great liberal tradition. Just to give an example in his own words: \u201cCartels are cancers on the open market economy, which forms the very basis of our Community. \u2026 Moreover, since by nature cartels are secret and therefore difficult to uncover, it is likely that what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. In the words of Adam Smith there is a \u2018tendency for competitors to conspire\u2019. \u2026 I am determined to strengthen our fight against cartels\u201d.\n\nMario Monti was an eloquent advocate of free markets long before he took the position in Brussels which made him well known worldwide. For him, there can be no lasting economic well-being without free markets, and that free markets are a prerequisite for a free and democratic society. A true zoon politicon in the sense of Aristotle, he was a tireless and vocal contributor to Italian public life. He waged a constant fight against all kinds of unnecessary regulations and restrictions, while remaining firm in the belief that a free society and a functioning market economy need a well designed framework establishing the rule of law.\n\nI will not forget the day I delivered a speech at the famous Bocconi University, where Mario has been president for many years now. Afterwards, we embarked on a discussion of the future of Europe. At that time in the early 1990s he was convinced that Italy needed constraints on its politics to start a virtuous circle which would ultimately allow participation in Monetary Union. Such a framework in his opinion could only come from outside. His ideas were \u2013 and I think still are \u2013 very close to what Germans have in mind when they speak of \u201cOrdnungspolitik\u201d. Indeed, listening to him you might think he is more German than most Germans are today. We should invite him to tell Germany what it has to change to find back to its way to prosperity.\n\nToday is not the occasion to examine Mario Monti\u2019s career in detail and analyse his numerous publications. As a central banker, though, I have to mention that he started as an expert in the field of monetary economics. He believed that a clear assignment of responsibilities was needed for the optimal conduct of economic policies; for the central bank, the goal could only be price stability. Many of his ideas initially faced fierce opposition even from within circles which later supported him. His influence on public opinion in Italy cannot be overestimated. This is also due to his impact as an academic teacher on a generation of students. I have learned from students of his \u2013 some of them now at the European Central Bank \u2013 that at a time when Italian universities were dominated by mainstream Keynesianism, Mario Monti\u2019s reading list included Milton Friedman and Allan Meltzer and the disequilibrium theorists, such as Clower and Leijonhufvud, alongside with James Tobin, his teacher at Yale. Today, some of Italy\u2019s most prominent academics represent the kind of political economics for which Mario Monti stands.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s influence on politics is now needed more than ever. I think we all appreciate the fact that he took on a new and important European responsibility in becoming Chairman of the Board of Bruegel \u2013 \u201cBrussels European and Global Economic Laboratory\u201d. He was quoted as having said the new think tank would bring much-needed new thinking to the role of Europe in international economics. The name \u201cBruegel\u201d was chosen not simply for being a clever acronym but also because Pieter Bruegel was a leading exponent of the painting of movement, not to mention market activity.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s work and personal achievements have been recognised by a number of awards, of which I have time to mention only a few. In 2001 he received the Benemeriti della Scienza e della Cultura medal as well as the Wolfram Engels Prize awarded by the Stiftung Marktwirtschaft and the informedia-Stiftung. In 2004 he was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal.\n\nBut his life, his work and his personality could not be better characterised and recognised than by a prize named after the great economist and philosopher of market and liberty Friedrich August von Hayek."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/monti-mario", "page_content": "Citation styles\n\nEncyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nWithin the \u201cCite this article\u201d tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.

Although Eurosceptic populists\u2019 proposed solutions are systematically wrong, a \u2018bone of truth\u2019 lies within the populists\u2019 criticisms of of Europe .\n\nMario Monti served as Italian Prime Minister from 2011 to 2013, and as Italy\u2019s European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004. He spoke with EURACTIV Germany\u2019s Marta Latini in Berlin.\n\nHow do you rate the success of Eurosceptics in the European elections?\n\nWe have witnessed the remarkable success of several populist movements in many countries. This was expected. It is not so surprising in times of economic and social crisis, with many national governments themselves putting this blame \u2013 to a great extent \u2013 on Europe. Public opinion sees a relationship between this difficult moment and Europe.\n\nHow will Eurosceptics influence the European agenda in the coming years?\n\nThe populists\u2019 criticisms of Europe do have a bone of truth in each of them. For example, it is unquestionable that there is too much youth unemployment, that the issues about migration have not been handled sufficiently well.\n\nThe problem is that their solutions are, in my view, systematically wrong because they are simplistic, whereas the management of these problems requires integration, more of the European Union, or at least the willingness to strengthen the European Union.\n\nIn Italy, Renzi\u2019s Partito Democratico (PD) triumphed in the elections and the Five Star Movement lost ground. Is Italy more Europhile than Eurosceptic?\n\nIn the case of Italy, Eurocritical populism exists in several parties. Obviously within the Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, but also in the North League, and more recently to a large extent in Forza Italia and Fratelli d\u00b4Italia. Particularly in the case of the Five Star Movement, the result has not been at the level of expectations, but nevertheless very remarkable. Indeed, Prime Minister Renzi has had a resounding success.\n\nAll in all, Italy is coming out of these elections as a rather mature citizen of the European Union. What comes out is that Italy and the Italian government do want some changes in the governance of Europe, and will now be in a better relative position to be one of the key players in pursuing this. I find this very encouraging. This is a continuation and culmination of the re-establishment of Italy as a credible member of the European Union.\n\nIs Renzi\u2019s charisma the reason for PD\u2019s triumph?\n\nI see in Renzi\u00b4s great success a combination of a very visible and bold leadership, a courageous young politician, and a willingness to engage in the reforms, which happen also to be the reforms necessary for Italy to reinforce its competitive position and its credibility within the European Union.\n\nHow do you explain the outcome of the elections for the Scelta Civica party, which you founded?\n\nFor me, Scelta Civica was a \u201cstart-up\u201d and I am very happy to have created it. It achieved a good result in fifty days: 3 million votes, starting from zero. Renzi\u2019s great success is that he went up 2.7 million. Then, once in place, I left the presidency to others, and I did not have any role in Scelta Civica\u2019s strategy. I had other ideas for the European elections.\n\nWhat should the priorities of Italy\u2019s six-month EU presidency be?\n\nThe Italian government has sketched out these priorities and they coincide largely with what the Commission has been proposing recently: an economic policy more conducive to growth. A more cohesive handling of migration issues, and of course the Ukraine, will be the key priorities."}], "Mario Monti was responsible for the Internal Market, Services, Customs and Taxation from 1995 to 1999.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mario-Monti", "page_content": "Mario Monti, (born March 19, 1943, Varese, Italy), Italian economist, academic, and bureaucrat who served as prime minister of Italy (2011\u201313).\n\nMonti, the son of a banker, studied economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan and received a degree in 1965. He then pursued graduate studies at Yale University under the tutelage of American economist James Tobin. Monti taught briefly at the University of Trento (1969\u201370) and began a post at the University of Turin (1970\u201379) before returning to Bocconi University in 1971 as a professor of monetary theory and policy. He later directed (1985\u201394) the school\u2019s Institute of Economics. In 1989 he became rector of the university, and five years later he was named its president.\n\nAs a consultant to one of Italy\u2019s largest banks in the 1970s, Monti gained attention for publishing his own estimates of the country\u2019s money supply at a time when official figures were not publicly available. Beginning the following decade, he served on several committees of the Italian treasury and was president of SUERF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Universitaire Europ\u00e9enne de Recherches Financi\u00e8res; now the European Money and Finance Forum) in 1982\u201385. Also during this time Monti wrote commentaries on economics for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera (1978\u201394) and sat on a number of corporate boards.\n\nIn 1995 Monti, having been nominated by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, took a seat on the European Commission (EC), for which he oversaw issues relating to the internal market, financial services, and taxation. Receiving a second term in 1999, he became the European commissioner for competition, and in that capacity, he took a tough-minded approach to proposed corporate mergers and antitrust cases that won him wide respect. After his EC tenure concluded in 2004, he helped found Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank with a focus on economic globalization.\n\nIn November 2011, in the wake of a public debt crisis in Italy that weakened Berlusconi\u2019s grip on power, the politically independent Monti became a leading candidate to assume the country\u2019s premiership in a national unity government. (It was hoped that Monti\u2019s experience as a technocrat would prove beneficial in the implementation of urgent economic reforms.) On November 9 he was made a lifetime member of the Italian Senate, and four days later, upon Berlusconi\u2019s resignation, Pres. Giorgio Napolitano asked Monti to form a government.\n\nInitially serving as both prime minister and finance minister (he held the latter post until July 2012), Monti swiftly persuaded parliament to approve an austerity package that relied heavily on tax increases. In early 2012 a set of measures he introduced in an effort to liberalize the service sector was also passed. Although Italy continued to face economic uncertainty, Monti\u2019s decisive leadership was widely judged to have helped the country forestall disaster. As the year continued, he also emerged as a key player in international negotiations aimed at financially stabilizing the entire euro zone.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In early elections held in February 2013, Monti led an alliance of centrist political factions, but they failed to win enough parliamentary seats to play a significant role in the ensuing efforts to build a government coalition.

The idea was to integrate Prof. Monti\u2019s possible recommendations into the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy, which aims at bolstering the economy of the European Union for the next decade.\n\nProf. Monti is not a newcomer to European affairs. As you know he has served from 1994 to 1999 as an European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Financial Services, Financial Integration, Custom Rights and Taxes, when the College was headed by Prof. Romano Prodi. He was also a member of the European Commission, responsible for Competition, from 2001 to 2004. Mario Monti is currently the President of the prestigious Universit\u00e0 Commerciale L. Bocconi in Milano and one of the senior members of the leading European Think Tanks, \u201cBruegel\u201d.\n\nThe professor handed in this report the 9th of May 2010. The text covers all the possible fields of relevance to the Single Market.\n\nFor our professions it is of great interest that Prof. Monti touches the issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, in several parts of his text. In the following lines, we will try to outline the main ideas introduced in his study, especially with regard to our sector.\n\nFirst, we shall present Prof. Monti\u2019s ideas of the current caveats concerning the implementation of the Services Directive.\n\nWe will then discuss his conclusions on the issue of workers\u2019 mobility, with a focus on the recognition of professional qualifications.\n\nThe Single Market for Services: which problems, which options?\n\nThe sector of services is of crucial importance for European economies (approximately 70% of GDP in the European Union). Nevertheless, its markets remain strongly fragmented with only 20% of the services provided in the EU having a cross-border dimension. To cope with this issue, Prof. Monti suggests action in several directions:\n\nA rapid implementation of the Services Directive: This would require more efforts from the Member States, even if the current results are rather encouraging (see CEPLIS Telegram 11/10). The European Commission has a role to play, by taking any necessary measures and maintaining pressure on the Member States, as well as by keeping the other institutions (the European Parliament, the Council) and the Stakeholders informed on an extensive basis.\n\nRemoving barriers to cross-border health-care provisions: the Monti report states that the market of services extend beyond the sectors covered by the current Services Directive. It proposes for areas not covered by the Directive to be given particular attention, and this especially concerns the health-care sector. Prof. Monti strongly suggests to quickly adopt the Directive proposed on Patients\u2019 Rights in Cross-Border Health-Care.\n\nWorker\u2019s mobility in Europe: challenges and solutions\n\nAmong other considerations, the Monti report discusses the issue of the recognition of professional qualifications. The Professor introduces the issue by stating that \u201ca major obstacle standing in the way of enhanced cross-border labour mobility is the complexity of international recognition of professional qualifications\u201d, regretting somehow that the current automatic recognition of qualifications applies only to seven out of more than 800 professions! The former Commissioner considers that the legal framework of the Directive on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) needs to be clarified and strengthened.\n\nWhat are his main recommendations on this issue?\n\nMario Monti feels that \u201cThe scope for automatic recognition of qualifications to new professions should be expanded to new sectors in addition to the seven professions today, targeting in particular new professions required for green and digital industries to facilitate the mobility of highly skilled workers\u201d.\n\nThe study also insists on the importance of the development of a \u201cEuropean Skills and Competences Taxonomy\u201d. Such a system could ensure that skills and competences of job seekers or the requirement of a job published in a job vacancy are understood in the same way everywhere in Europe and are easily transferable.\n\nA number of several other very specific recommendations are included in the study: Remove tax obstacles to cross-border work; Strengthen the transparency in the recognition of qualifications and skills, and developing national qualifications systems.\n\nIn the past Mario Monti has made himself known as a fierce opponent of professional regulations the later being considered by him as an obstacle to the realization of the single market and to the freedom of competition. The report he has proposed as Commissioner responsible for Competition has created a lot of controversy and the professions had to use all their friends notably within the European Parliament in order to underline their specificities as a not-only-for-profit sector. This new report brings ideas that could potentially be beneficial to our sector but is not empty of possible dangers either. The challenge is here to work towards a more efficient system of mutual recognition without losing sight of the need to constantly remind the Commission of the special role our professions are called to play as intermediates between the citizen and the democratic state and as warrants of public health.\n\nA thorough discussion of the report \u2013 possibly with the participation of MEPs in the framework of a coming CEPLIS seminar might help us better identify the optimal way to profit from Monti\u2019s proposals by \u2018picking the bad cherries\u2019 of the report\u2026"}, {"url": "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2005/html/sp051106.en.html", "page_content": "Mario Monti. A tribute.\n\nThe message of Hayek\u2019s opus magnum \u201cConstitution of Liberty\u201d is contained in the titles of its first two parts: \u201cThe Value of Freedom\u201d and \u201cFreedom and the Law\u201d. Two principles characterise a free society: limits on the power of the state and the rule of law. Hayek\u2019s main objective is that the coercion of some in society by others is reduced to the extent possible. \u201cThis state we shall describe throughout as a state of liberty or freedom,\u201d he says (p. 11). In his chapter on the origins of the rule of law he quotes John Locke: \u201cThe end of the law is, not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law there is no freedom\u201d (p. 162).\n\nIt is obvious that only a free market economy is consistent with a free society. Only within such a framework can people act as free individuals and make the best contribution to their own well-being and that of others. Competition is a fundamental element of a market economy and the driving force of the progress of mankind.\n\nIn \u201cCompetition as a discovery procedure\u201d Hayek says that \u201c\u2026 wherever the use of competition can be rationally justified, it is on the ground that we do not know in advance the facts that determine the actions of competitors. In sports or in examinations, no less than in the award of government contracts or of prizes for poetry, it would clearly be pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand who would do best\u2026 I propose to consider competition as a procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it, would not be known to anyone, or at least would not be utilised\u201d (p. 179).\n\nWe honour today a man who has lived up to these principles in word and deed. This has been most visible in his role as the most respected Commissioner in Brussels. His first responsibility was for Internal Market, Financial Services and Financial Integration (from 1995 to 1999); his second for Competition (from 1999 to 2004). His decisions were landmarks in important sectors of the European economy \u2013 the German banking sector was just one of many spectacular cases.\n\nAs Commissioner he was able to realise what an economist of his calibre and a man of independent mind and character would see as the fulfilment of his professional life. His actions reflected a rare combination of personal integrity, a sharp intellect and a broad and deep understanding of economics. His reasoning was always compelling and convincing.\n\n\u201cBrussels\u201d, a word which for many has negative connotations, was \u2013 when represented by his persona \u2013 universally respected, and feared by all those who might not, to put it mildly, have a preference for competition. CEOs of the biggest companies in the world, starting sometimes from a position of arrogance, were ultimately obliged to accept not only his decisions in favour of competition but also the superiority of his arguments. As a European antitrust attorney once said: \u201cMonti is not the type to bow down to any verbal aggression. He may have an academic exterior, but there is steel inside\u201d. Or as a lobbyist once put it: \u201cMonti is not a politician. He is an intellectual, an absolutely honest economist. He has an extremely charming way of sending you out to the desert.\u201d\n\nAmong politicians as well as the general public he is respectfully known as \u201cil professore\u201d. I could easily continue with compliments on \u201cSuper Mario\u201d. For me, he is an outstanding example of an economist who is as much esteemed among academics as he is among politicians, the business community and the public. You will not be surprised to hear me say that we need much more involvement of academics in public debate. Mario Monti demonstrates that to be successful in this respect one need not compromise on intellectual honesty \u2013 just the opposite. He is the personification of political economics in the great liberal tradition. Just to give an example in his own words: \u201cCartels are cancers on the open market economy, which forms the very basis of our Community. \u2026 Moreover, since by nature cartels are secret and therefore difficult to uncover, it is likely that what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. In the words of Adam Smith there is a \u2018tendency for competitors to conspire\u2019. \u2026 I am determined to strengthen our fight against cartels\u201d.\n\nMario Monti was an eloquent advocate of free markets long before he took the position in Brussels which made him well known worldwide. For him, there can be no lasting economic well-being without free markets, and that free markets are a prerequisite for a free and democratic society. A true zoon politicon in the sense of Aristotle, he was a tireless and vocal contributor to Italian public life. He waged a constant fight against all kinds of unnecessary regulations and restrictions, while remaining firm in the belief that a free society and a functioning market economy need a well designed framework establishing the rule of law.\n\nI will not forget the day I delivered a speech at the famous Bocconi University, where Mario has been president for many years now. Afterwards, we embarked on a discussion of the future of Europe. At that time in the early 1990s he was convinced that Italy needed constraints on its politics to start a virtuous circle which would ultimately allow participation in Monetary Union. Such a framework in his opinion could only come from outside. His ideas were \u2013 and I think still are \u2013 very close to what Germans have in mind when they speak of \u201cOrdnungspolitik\u201d. Indeed, listening to him you might think he is more German than most Germans are today. We should invite him to tell Germany what it has to change to find back to its way to prosperity.\n\nToday is not the occasion to examine Mario Monti\u2019s career in detail and analyse his numerous publications. As a central banker, though, I have to mention that he started as an expert in the field of monetary economics. He believed that a clear assignment of responsibilities was needed for the optimal conduct of economic policies; for the central bank, the goal could only be price stability. Many of his ideas initially faced fierce opposition even from within circles which later supported him. His influence on public opinion in Italy cannot be overestimated. This is also due to his impact as an academic teacher on a generation of students. I have learned from students of his \u2013 some of them now at the European Central Bank \u2013 that at a time when Italian universities were dominated by mainstream Keynesianism, Mario Monti\u2019s reading list included Milton Friedman and Allan Meltzer and the disequilibrium theorists, such as Clower and Leijonhufvud, alongside with James Tobin, his teacher at Yale. Today, some of Italy\u2019s most prominent academics represent the kind of political economics for which Mario Monti stands.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s influence on politics is now needed more than ever. I think we all appreciate the fact that he took on a new and important European responsibility in becoming Chairman of the Board of Bruegel \u2013 \u201cBrussels European and Global Economic Laboratory\u201d. He was quoted as having said the new think tank would bring much-needed new thinking to the role of Europe in international economics. The name \u201cBruegel\u201d was chosen not simply for being a clever acronym but also because Pieter Bruegel was a leading exponent of the painting of movement, not to mention market activity.\n\nMario Monti\u2019s work and personal achievements have been recognised by a number of awards, of which I have time to mention only a few. In 2001 he received the Benemeriti della Scienza e della Cultura medal as well as the Wolfram Engels Prize awarded by the Stiftung Marktwirtschaft and the informedia-Stiftung. In 2004 he was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal.\n\nBut his life, his work and his personality could not be better characterised and recognised than by a prize named after the great economist and philosopher of market and liberty Friedrich August von Hayek."}, {"url": "https://www.theglobalist.com/contributors/mario-monti/", "page_content": "Former Prime Minister of Italy\n\nMario Monti is a former Italian Prime Minister and Chairman of the Berggruen Institute on Governance\u2019s Council for the Future of Europe.\n\nMonti became an Italian Senator-for-Life in late 2011.

He then pursued graduate studies at Yale University under the tutelage of American economist James Tobin. Monti taught briefly at the University of Trento (1969\u201370) and began a post at the University of Turin (1970\u201379) before returning to Bocconi University in 1971 as a professor of monetary theory and policy. He later directed (1985\u201394) the school\u2019s Institute of Economics. In 1989 he became rector of the university, and five years later he was named its president.\n\nAs a consultant to one of Italy\u2019s largest banks in the 1970s, Monti gained attention for publishing his own estimates of the country\u2019s money supply at a time when official figures were not publicly available. Beginning the following decade, he served on several committees of the Italian treasury and was president of SUERF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Universitaire Europ\u00e9enne de Recherches Financi\u00e8res; now the European Money and Finance Forum) in 1982\u201385. Also during this time Monti wrote commentaries on economics for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera (1978\u201394) and sat on a number of corporate boards.\n\nIn 1995 Monti, having been nominated by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, took a seat on the European Commission (EC), for which he oversaw issues relating to the internal market, financial services, and taxation. Receiving a second term in 1999, he became the European commissioner for competition, and in that capacity, he took a tough-minded approach to proposed corporate mergers and antitrust cases that won him wide respect. After his EC tenure concluded in 2004, he helped found Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank with a focus on economic globalization.\n\nIn November 2011, in the wake of a public debt crisis in Italy that weakened Berlusconi\u2019s grip on power, the politically independent Monti became a leading candidate to assume the country\u2019s premiership in a national unity government. (It was hoped that Monti\u2019s experience as a technocrat would prove beneficial in the implementation of urgent economic reforms.) On November 9 he was made a lifetime member of the Italian Senate, and four days later, upon Berlusconi\u2019s resignation, Pres. Giorgio Napolitano asked Monti to form a government.\n\nInitially serving as both prime minister and finance minister (he held the latter post until July 2012), Monti swiftly persuaded parliament to approve an austerity package that relied heavily on tax increases. In early 2012 a set of measures he introduced in an effort to liberalize the service sector was also passed. Although Italy continued to face economic uncertainty, Monti\u2019s decisive leadership was widely judged to have helped the country forestall disaster. As the year continued, he also emerged as a key player in international negotiations aimed at financially stabilizing the entire euro zone.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He resigned from office shortly thereafter, remaining in a caretaker role until a new government could be formed. In early elections held in February 2013, Monti led an alliance of centrist political factions, but they failed to win enough parliamentary seats to play a significant role in the ensuing efforts to build a government coalition.

The idea was to integrate Prof. Monti\u2019s possible recommendations into the \u201cEurope 2020\u201d strategy, which aims at bolstering the economy of the European Union for the next decade.\n\nProf. Monti is not a newcomer to European affairs. As you know he has served from 1994 to 1999 as an European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Financial Services, Financial Integration, Custom Rights and Taxes, when the College was headed by Prof. Romano Prodi. He was also a member of the European Commission, responsible for Competition, from 2001 to 2004. Mario Monti is currently the President of the prestigious Universit\u00e0 Commerciale L. Bocconi in Milano and one of the senior members of the leading European Think Tanks, \u201cBruegel\u201d.\n\nThe professor handed in this report the 9th of May 2010. The text covers all the possible fields of relevance to the Single Market.\n\nFor our professions it is of great interest that Prof. Monti touches the issue of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, in several parts of his text. In the following lines, we will try to outline the main ideas introduced in his study, especially with regard to our sector.\n\nFirst, we shall present Prof. Monti\u2019s ideas of the current caveats concerning the implementation of the Services Directive.\n\nWe will then discuss his conclusions on the issue of workers\u2019 mobility, with a focus on the recognition of professional qualifications.\n\nThe Single Market for Services: which problems, which options?\n\nThe sector of services is of crucial importance for European economies (approximately 70% of GDP in the European Union). Nevertheless, its markets remain strongly fragmented with only 20% of the services provided in the EU having a cross-border dimension. To cope with this issue, Prof. Monti suggests action in several directions:\n\nA rapid implementation of the Services Directive: This would require more efforts from the Member States, even if the current results are rather encouraging (see CEPLIS Telegram 11/10). The European Commission has a role to play, by taking any necessary measures and maintaining pressure on the Member States, as well as by keeping the other institutions (the European Parliament, the Council) and the Stakeholders informed on an extensive basis.\n\nRemoving barriers to cross-border health-care provisions: the Monti report states that the market of services extend beyond the sectors covered by the current Services Directive. It proposes for areas not covered by the Directive to be given particular attention, and this especially concerns the health-care sector. Prof. Monti strongly suggests to quickly adopt the Directive proposed on Patients\u2019 Rights in Cross-Border Health-Care.\n\nWorker\u2019s mobility in Europe: challenges and solutions\n\nAmong other considerations, the Monti report discusses the issue of the recognition of professional qualifications. The Professor introduces the issue by stating that \u201ca major obstacle standing in the way of enhanced cross-border labour mobility is the complexity of international recognition of professional qualifications\u201d, regretting somehow that the current automatic recognition of qualifications applies only to seven out of more than 800 professions! The former Commissioner considers that the legal framework of the Directive on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) needs to be clarified and strengthened.\n\nWhat are his main recommendations on this issue?\n\nMario Monti feels that \u201cThe scope for automatic recognition of qualifications to new professions should be expanded to new sectors in addition to the seven professions today, targeting in particular new professions required for green and digital industries to facilitate the mobility of highly skilled workers\u201d.\n\nThe study also insists on the importance of the development of a \u201cEuropean Skills and Competences Taxonomy\u201d. Such a system could ensure that skills and competences of job seekers or the requirement of a job published in a job vacancy are understood in the same way everywhere in Europe and are easily transferable.\n\nA number of several other very specific recommendations are included in the study: Remove tax obstacles to cross-border work; Strengthen the transparency in the recognition of qualifications and skills, and developing national qualifications systems.\n\nIn the past Mario Monti has made himself known as a fierce opponent of professional regulations the later being considered by him as an obstacle to the realization of the single market and to the freedom of competition. The report he has proposed as Commissioner responsible for Competition has created a lot of controversy and the professions had to use all their friends notably within the European Parliament in order to underline their specificities as a not-only-for-profit sector. This new report brings ideas that could potentially be beneficial to our sector but is not empty of possible dangers either. The challenge is here to work towards a more efficient system of mutual recognition without losing sight of the need to constantly remind the Commission of the special role our professions are called to play as intermediates between the citizen and the democratic state and as warrants of public health.\n\nA thorough discussion of the report \u2013 possibly with the participation of MEPs in the framework of a coming CEPLIS seminar might help us better identify the optimal way to profit from Monti\u2019s proposals by \u2018picking the bad cherries\u2019 of the report\u2026"}, {"url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/11/14/profile-mario-monti", "page_content": "He is the man Italians are hoping will help get the country out of its $2.7 trillion debt hole and kick-start its stagnant economy.\n\nMario Monti, Italy\u2019s new prime minister, is tasked with leading a new unity government and guiding Italy through tough austerity measures laid out by his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nKnown as a calm but tough negotiator, Monti was the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner for four years, between 1999 to 2004 when, notably, he brought Microsoft to trial before the European Court of Justice in an anti-trust case.\n\nMonti was also professor of economics at Bocconi University in Milan, one of Italy\u2019s top economic schools and has held positions at various think tanks, as well as acting as an advisor to companies including Goldman Sachs and Coca-Cola.\n\nYet Monti\u2019s appointment as prime minister marks his first job in government, with Italy not due to hold elections for another two years.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Richard Martin reports."}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Mario_Monti", "page_content": "Mario Monti\n\nMario Monti (born 19 March 1943) is an Italian economist and academic who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, leading a technocratic government in the wake of the Italian debt crisis.

MILAN \u2014 President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d motto may seem straightforward, but in reality, it\u2019s full of contradictions. America is a nation of competing interests. So which part of it \u2014 industry, consumer or worker \u2014 does Trump aim to put first?\n\nIn the short and medium term, certain policies to put American industry first may clash with policies to put American consumers or workers first. For example, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy does not have a clear answer when it comes to antitrust, an area where consumers\u2019 interests are usually pursued more directly than producers\u2019 interests, whether they are businesses or workers. Trump has not articulated how he will resolve this contradiction. In contrast, Europe has mostly found the right balance between these diverging interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to antitrust legislation, America once set the standard. Competition policy was first introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, while in Europe, it was only developed in the context of European integration starting in the 1950s. But today, the European system is stronger in many ways than the American scheme, which has been somewhat slower to adapt to new challenges. In competition policy, for example, the E.U. embraces not just antitrust but also controls how much aid a state can provide a business and provides other forms of oversight for how national governments intervene in economic and financial markets.\n\nWhen I was European commissioner, I worked to make a single European market out of the various domestic markets and to promote competition in the resulting EU-wide market. The single market and liberalization and competition policies have reinforced each other within the E.U.\u2019s coherent vision for breaking up monopolies. Against this backdrop, particularly in light of the efforts of Europe\u2019s current commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to pursue Silicon Valley if necessary, the E.U. appears well ahead of the United States in implementing a vigorous competition policy.\n\nOne reason for this is the greater proximity of American antitrust authorities to electoral cycles, relative to the more shielded position of the E.U. The European Commission\u2019s vigorous enforcement operates under an administrative system, where its decisions have direct and immediate legal effects. This is a strength that Europe should certainly maintain. But it would be wrong to believe that this in itself prompts the E.U. to be bolder, as if it did not have to undergo judicial review. Important decisions usually do end up being reviewed in the court.\n\nAnother important reason for the strength of antitrust in Europe is that it is conducted within a rational architecture. Especially following the E.U.\u2019s \u201cmodernization\u201d of competition laws starting in 2004, cases have been decentralized to national competition authorities. This has happened under an orderly system, overseen by the European Commission. In America, despite repeated attempts to reconsider the framework inherited from a distant past, there are only two federal antitrust authorities, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), where the division of competences is not crystal clear, plus 50 state attorneys general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the U.S. system is less coherent than the European one. We had a vivid illustration of this in the 2004 Microsoft case. The Justice Department, under former president Bill Clinton, had decided that a breakup of the company was necessary. Several states sided with the department, while several others opposed it. The court eventually annulled the breakup. Only a few years later, the Justice Department, under former president George W. Bush, was satisfied with a very weak settlement endorsed by the court.\n\nIn the E.U., the Microsoft decision was the responsibility of the European Commission, with national competition authorities playing only an advisory role. That said, the fine and reforms we imposed on Microsoft were certainly much tamer than what might have been if the breakup had gone through in the United States.\n\nEspecially under Vestager\u2019s leadership in recent years, Europe has become stricter than American enforcers when it comes to guarding against threats posed by digital platforms. Former FTC chair William Kovacic said recently that Brussels is now \u201cthe capital of the world\u201d when it comes to antitrust enforcement against dominant firms, leaving the Justice Department and the FTC \u201cin the shade.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Makan Delrahim, the current U.S. assistant attorney general for antitrust, is potentially the most vigorous person to hold that position under a Republican administration that I have seen so far. The E.U. and the United States therefore have an opportunity to proceed to strong antitrust enforcement on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThat would have two welcome byproducts. The Trump administration would feel called to articulate in less dogmatic and more concrete terms its \u201cAmerica First\u201d ambition and to identify the proper role for antitrust. And containing divergences between U.S. and E.U. antitrust decisions, especially when they concern U.S.-based companies, would reduce the risk of trade wars triggered by antitrust tensions.\n\nThis was produced by The WorldPost, a partnership of the Berggruen Institute and The Washington Post.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/mario.monti/724244", "page_content": "Mario Monti Edit Profile\n\neconomist politician academic\n\nMario Monti is an Italian economist who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, leading a government of technocrats in the wake of the Italian debt crisis.\n\nBackground Ethnicity: His mother was from Piacenza.
