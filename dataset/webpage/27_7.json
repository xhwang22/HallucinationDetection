{"Tadeusz Szeligowski taught Witold Lutos\u0142awski.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Witold-Lutoslawski", "page_content": "Witold Lutos\u0142awski, (born Jan. 25, 1913, Warsaw, Pol.\u2014died Feb. 7, 1994, Warsaw), outstanding Polish composer of the 20th century who attempted to create a new musical language by incorporating elements of folk songs, 12-tone serialism, atonal counterpoint, and controlled improvisations reminiscent of aleatory (chance, see aleatory music) compositions while retaining elements of conventional harmony and melody.\n\nLutos\u0142awski studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw and received diplomas in piano (1936) and composition (1937) from the Warsaw Conservatory. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, he performed in clandestine concerts that included proscribed music. His prewar works (most notably the Symphonic Variations, 1938) were primarily conventional neoclassical pieces, often infused with traditional folk tunes. When his Symphony No. 1 (begun in 1941) had its premiere in 1948, however, the new communist government denounced the piece as \u201cformalist\u201d and banned Lutos\u0142awski\u2019s increasingly avant-garde works from public performance. He earned a living writing children\u2019s songs and scores for motion pictures until those restrictions were eased in the mid-1950s. He was honoured with the first of his many government prizes in 1955, soon after composing his Concerto for Orchestra, based on folk themes.\n\nLutos\u0142awski spoke of his Funeral Music for string orchestra (1958) as marking a turning point in his style; a 12-tone work, it is dedicated to the memory of the Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. This he followed with an experimental piece in which he first used aleatory operations in combination with conventional effects: Venetian Games, written for the Venice Festival of 1961. In this work Lutos\u0142awski used unconventional visual notation to guide the performer in the various improvisatory operations.\n\nAlthough Lutos\u0142awski is best known for his orchestral works, he also wrote piano pieces, children\u2019s songs, choral works, and a string quartet (1964). His later works include Concerto for Cello and Orchestra (1970), Chain 2: Dialogue for Violin and Orchestra (1985), Piano Concerto (1988), and Symphony No. 4 (1992)."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/witold-lutoslawski", "page_content": "Witold Lutoslawski\n\nWitold Lutoslawski (1913-1994) was the leader of the group of Polish composers who came into prominence in the 1950s. His work was performed and honored worldwide throughout his lifetime.\n\nWitold Lutoslawski was born in Warsaw, Poland, and spent all of his formative years there. He received his musical education at the Warsaw Conservatory and also attended the university as a mathematics student. During World War II he served in the military radio section of the occupying German army in Warsaw.\n\nLutoslawski was active in reorganizing Polish cultural life after the war. He formed the Union of Polish Composers and the Society for the Publication of Polish Music, and he helped to organize the first Warsaw Festival in 1956. These annual festivals served as a showcase for Poland's young composers, whose number and originality astounded the musical world. Before the war Poland had not been strong in creative musicians, and during the war it had been cut off from the rest of Europe.\n\nMusical Work and Influence\n\nLutoslawski's early compositions show the influences that helped to form his style. His Symphonic Variations on a Theme by Paganini (1938) for two pianos is a brilliant piece, strongly influenced by Igor Stravinsky's neoclassicism in its sharp dissonance and use of jazz. Lutoslawski's First Symphony (1947) is also a neoclassic work. His Concerto for Orchestra (1954) shows a new influence: the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k. It has a strong folk-music basis, not in the manner of the 19th-century nationalists but in Bart\u00f3k's forthright dissonant manner. The brilliance of the orchestral writing equals that found in Bart\u00f3k's Concerto for Orchestra. Lutoslawski acknowledged his debt to Bart\u00f3k in one of his most powerful compositions, Trauermusik (1958; Mourning Music). In this piece he uses a modified twelve-tone technique, showing his awareness of Arnold Schoenberg and the second Viennese school of composers, but this was not to be a permanent influence. \"My music,\" Lutoslawski said, \"has no direct relationship to the traditions of the Viennese school. I am much more strongly tied to Claude Debussy, Stravinsky, Bart\u00f3k, and Var\u00e8se.\"\n\nIn Venetian Games (1961), Three Poems by Henri Michaux (1963), and the Second Symphony (1969) Lutoslawski uses controlled aleatory effects, giving the individual orchestra members freedom to play some passages as they choose with respect to notes and rhythm. In Poems, written for 23 instruments and a chorus of 20, each singer has an individual part, which they speak, whisper, moan, and shout as well as sing. Lutoslawski's use of such devices is always for expressive purposes. No matter how experimental and advanced these works are, his musical vitality, combined with his discipline of traditional craftsmanship, gives his compositions a seriousness, dignity, and power of communication rarely found among contemporary composers.\n\nAward and Honors\n\nLutoslawski won a UNESCO prize in composition in 1959 and was elected to the presidency of the International Society for Contemporary Music that year. He taught at the Berkshire Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts, the Dartmouth Congregation of the Arts in Hanover, New Hampshire, the Dartington Summer School in England, and in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1985 he was invited to the dedication ceremony of the Polish Music Reference Center at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles. During his two-week stay there, he presented five original manuscripts to the Center.\n\nHe and his work were recognized many times in his lifetime. Lutoslawski's awards included the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in 1985 for his Third Symphony; the 1993 Kyoto (Japan) Prize in Creative Arts and Moral Sciences; the Grammy Award, Cecilia Prize, Koussevitsky Award and Grammaphone Award, all in 1986, for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Recording of his Third Symphony, and Britain's Classical Music Award in January, 1997, for his Fourth Symphony. He also received several honorary degrees.\n\nUpon presenting the Kyoto Prize, the Inamori Foundation said, \"His works have had a powerful effect on the postwar musical world. A new method of atonality, the distinctive aleatoric music, and development of contemporary forms of musical expression have made him a master of music in the 20th century.\"\n\nLutoslawski died Feb. 7, 1994, in Warsaw, at the age of 81. He is survived by his wife, Danuta.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nOve Nordwall, ed., Lutoslawski (1968), contains analyses of each of Lutoslawski's compositions up to 1967 as well as a biographical sketch, a complete catalog of his works, and an essay by the composer; see also David Ewen, The World of Twentieth-century Music (1968); and Peter S.

Kowalski/Wikimedia Commons L. Kowalski/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt wasn't always easy for Polish composer Witold Lutos\u0142awski to find his musical voice.\n\nHis Symphonic Variations, which opens this third disc in a series of Lutos\u0142awski's music, was shunned by a Warsaw Conservatory professor in the late 1930s. Not understanding the young student's score, the teacher, Witold Maliszewski, said, \"For me your work is ugly.\"\n\nThe piece might have turned heads at the strait-laced conservatory, but listening to it now, in this sparkling new recording by the BBC Symphony and conductor Edward Gardner, you hear music solidly in the early 20th-century European tradition. Ironically, you can trace the whiffs of Stravinsky, sweeping post-Romantic gestures and bright bursts of color directly back to Maliszewski's own teacher, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nIn 1939, Lutos\u0142awski was set to study in Paris, but the German invasion of Poland put an end to that, and he was asked to serve his country. Lutos\u0142awski was captured by the Germans but escaped after eight days, making his way 100 miles back to Warsaw. There he eked out a living playing piano in cafes and cabaret bands. He also wrote his Variations on a Theme by Paganini for two pianos, which appears on this album in a later version he created for piano and orchestra. Again, Lutos\u0142awski shows off his ability to make an orchestra shine. The jazzy rhythms, the score's few tender moments and a digitally crisp performance by pianist Louis Lortie make for an irresistible nine minutes of music.\n\nThe Paganini Variations mark another grim milestone for Lutos\u0142awski. In 1944, as the doomed Warsaw uprising was about to break out, he grabbed only a handful of manuscripts (including the Paganini piece) as he and his mother fled for safety. The remainder of his compositions burned during the destruction of the city.\n\nEven as Lutos\u0142awski's music began to reach more ears, he searched for new paths of expression \u2014 not an easy task while under the thumb of Soviet cultural apparatchiks. In 1949, his First Symphony was denounced as \"formalist\" and banned. After Stalin died in 1953, things started looking up, especially when the Concerto for Orchestra (recorded for the first volume in this series) won several prizes and cemented Lutos\u0142awski's status as Poland's preeminent composer.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption L.

Kowalski/Wikimedia Commons Hear The Music Song: Symphony No. 4 [Quarter note = c. 55 - Eighth note = c. 160 - Tempo 1 (Quarter note = c. 55) - Eighth note = c. 160]\n\nSymphony No. 4 [Quarter note = c. 55 - Eighth note = c. 160 - Tempo 1 (Quarter note = c. 55) - Eighth note = c. 160] from Witold Lutoslawski: Orchestral Works, Vol. 2\n\nWitold Lutoslawski: Orchestral Works, Vol. 2 by Louis Lortie\n\nStill, Lutos\u0142awski was searching for something. He found part of his answer in the late 1950s when he began to formulate building blocks comprised of 12-note chords. This wasn't the serialism developed by Arnold Schoenberg. Instead, these were blocks of sounds divided into registers and groupings of pitches. At the same time, Lutos\u0142awski began to riff on John Cage's ideas of chance and randomness, creating his own formula of \"controlled\" chance elements.\n\nBy the 1980s, Lutos\u0142awski's reputation reached worldwide, but again the restless composer discovered yet another type of musical language. He shifted towards clearer harmonies and more lyricism in works like the Piano Concerto from 1988, which is also on this new disc in a performance with plenty of detail and dexterity from Lortie. It contains nods to Rachmaninov's romanticism and, in the finale, the Baroque chaconne.\n\nLutos\u0142awski's last major work, the Symphony No. 4, closes the album. Had he finally found his sound? Again, large doses of lyricism prevail, especially in the dark and ruminative opening where a passionate clarinet line blossoms from a haze of strings. Lutos\u0142awski conducted the premiere with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1993. A year later, he died of cancer.\n\nLutos\u0142awski wasn't overly prolific, leaving us 120 pieces. Yet his output stands as a huge testament to a major pioneering spirit \u2014 one that helped raise the prestige of Polish music and inspired the following generations of musicians."}, {"url": "https://pwm.com.pl/en/sklep/publikacja/bukoliki,witold-lutoslawski,520,ksiegarnia.htm", "page_content": "O\u015bwiadczam, i\u017c zapozna\u0142em si\u0119 z regulaminem \u015bwiadczenia us\u0142ugi Newsletter i go akceptuj\u0119.\n\nWyra\u017cam zgod\u0119 na przesy\u0142anie na podany powy\u017cej adres email wiadomo\u015bci zawieraj\u0105cych informacje handlowe Polskiego Wydawnictwa Muzycznego\n\n\n\nAdministratorem dobrowolnie podanych danych osobowych jest Polskie Wydawnictwo Muzyczne z siedzib\u0105 w Krakowie (31-111) przy Al.

Lutos\u0142awski's output is, I think, neither well-known nor well understood enough. It will be, of course, by the end of this 'ere exposition! Or at least, you will have found, I hope, some ear-opening avenues into the work of a composer whose output is among the most complete and coherent of the 20th century.\n\nSo let's start, obviously, at the end. Listen to this: Lutos\u0142awski's Fourth Symphony, his last major work before his death in 1994, and a piece that symbolises and cements the achievement of his musical language. This is astonishingly eloquent music: a piece that creates a genuinely symphonic discourse through a revivification of some classical principles of achieving unity through diversity, but which is also open and adventurous enough to admit the existence of doubt, conflict, and melancholy \u2013 listen to the final few minutes to hear what I mean. It's all a long way from this music, the sophisticated Stravinskyisms and Bartokerie of his First Symphony, composed nearly 50 years earlier, just after the second world war.\n\nLutos\u0142awski's compositional journey involved him finding unique answers to the big existential and musical questions that the 20th century opened up, and his solution, eventually, was to rethink those hoarily old-fashioned ideas of harmony, melody and how you create large-scale musical structures, and he did so in a way that created new kinds of texture, sound, and feeling. (Don't believe me? Try this for size: the opening of Lutos\u0142awski's Third Symphony, premiered by the Chicago Symphony and George Solti in 1983; a visceral contrast between vertical violence and sensual but chaotic melody, a juxtaposition that propels the whole half-hour piece.)\n\nBut this wasn't a serene progress to musical maturity carried out in an artistic vacuum. Far from it. Lutos\u0142awski's life was as enmeshed as any 20th century composer's in the terrifying warp and weft of history and politics. One of his first memories was his father being taken away for execution in Moscow in 1918; his brother didn't survive the second world war, and he spent his war away from his military duties playing in a piano duet with his fellow composer Andrzej Panufnik. Every time they played could have been their last, as they risked performing music banned by the Nazis \u2013 like Chopin! \u2013 but in their improvisations together, Lutos\u0142awski also laid the foundations for some of his later music, like the Variations on a Theme by Paganini.\n\nAfter the war, Lutos\u0142awski had to play a delicate game of creative cat-and-mouse with the communist regime in Poland. As part of the Composers' Union, he paid lip service to the socialist-realist demands of the government, working for Polish Radio and composing jingles, patriotic mass songs, and radio dramas. Even music like his First Symphony did not escape censure, but by the mid 1950s and Poland's political thaw, and the establishment of the Warsaw autumn festival of contemporary music in 1956, Lutos\u0142awski was able to begin to compose the music he wanted to. (His Concerto for Orchestra, completed in 1954, is still his most popular piece with orchestras, but Lutos\u0142awski said that that brilliant, vital piece did not represent his unadulterated compositional voice; something he only recognised with the music he composed after his Musique Fun\u00e8bre, from 1958.) But Lutos\u0142awski's search for musical truth isn't quite as simple as it seems: under a pseudonym, he wrote pop tunes that were hits in Poland in the late 1950s and early 1960s, something only discovered a decade later; it's still controversial whether his motives were musical or financial in writing these tunes.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Lutos\u0142awski was able to explore the musical terrain that he would make his own. It's a paradoxical combination of compositional freedom with structural rigour that finds a sometimes subtle, sometimes sensual, and occasionally visceral poetry in pieces like Jeux Venitiens, his Livre pour Orchestre, or the Second Symphony. If you listen to what Lutos\u0142awski said in interviews and public statements, you'll understand these pieces, just like all those that came after, as purely abstract investigations of the things that music can say that nothing else can: ie that there's no connection between the social, political, or personal dimensions of Lutos\u0142awski's life and the music he wrote.\n\nMstislav Rostropovich didn't agree, though. He regarded the Cello Concerto that Lutos\u0142awski wrote for him in 1970 as an epic confrontation between an individual and an oppressive mass, in which the cello's voice is symbolically squashed by outbursts in the brass and orchestral explosions, a staging of the essential tensions of living in a communist system. Not so, said Lutos\u0142awski. Then there's Lutos\u0142awski's distinctive but misunderstood technique of \"controlled aleatoricism\", a magnificently obfuscatory term for something incredibly simple: basically, giving orchestral players material to play without precise rhythmic co-ordination, so you can create textures in which you know what pitches you're going to hear, but not exactly in what combination or at what speed. It's an easy way of conjuring a controlled chaos and a complex but relatively static texture, and you hear it in the Ad Libitum sections of his Chain II for violin and orchestra, or passages in nearly every work he composed since the 1960s, starting with Jeux Venitiens. It's misunderstood because it's not at all a way of giving musicians license to improvise, and it's far too simplistic to equate this delicate musical freedom with any social or political agenda. Nonetheless, it was one of the ways that Lutos\u0142awski found to open up his music to a more unpredictable soundworld, while retaining an essential compositional control.\n\nIt's a technique that's also used throughout the Third Symphony, a piece composed during Poland's period of martial law in the early 1980s, and work that creates an irresistible lyricism in some of the most powerfully melodic string writing of the late 20th century, a song that sings with a completely convincing but utterly novel expressivity. And Lutos\u0142awski at last admitted that although it wasn't his intention that this piece should reflect Poland's and Solidarity's contemporary struggle for greater freedoms, if people chose to interpret it that way, he wouldn't tell them not to. Sounds a pretty small aesthetic change? It's important, I think. I've been in Poland recording interviews for Radio 3's Music Matters, which is dedicated to Lutos\u0142awski on Saturday 19 January, and I met Grzegorz Michalski, president of the Lutos\u0142awski Society, who told me something that contradicted everything I've read about Lutos\u0142awski's supposed lack of direct political engagement. He was affiliated, albeit in secret, to one of Solidarity's committees, and was the only musician to hold such a position. And he refused to play ball with the government in the early 1980s, withdrawing from his public activities. (Lutos\u0142awski had a telling metaphor for all this: he said that working with the regime had been like wearing shoes that were too small, and that once they had come off, once he stopped trying to play games with his public persona and the government, he couldn't put them on again.) It was also around this time that he started giving grants to young composers so that they could study abroad, and paying for essential medical operations; work he often did unacknowledged and without any public fanfare.\n\nThere's always a debate to be had around the relationship between a composer's life and their music, and if the composer says there's no connection, we need to listen to them. But it's more complicated that Lutos\u0142awski suggests. You don't have to look for clues in the communist regime to find the foundations of Lutos\u0142awski's harmonic language, but the concentration, ravishment, and refinement of his music could not have been written by anyone else at any other time. Lutos\u0142awski the man was as immaculate, fastidious, and restrained as his music. And just as his works don't contain any extra notes, Lutos\u0142awski was someone who only spoke when he had something to say, according to Marcin Bogus\u0142awski, his stepson.\n\nAnd there's something else too. Lutos\u0142awski's attitude to life \u2013 his unswerving fealty to a daily regimen of work, work, and more work, his sharing of his talents and the material wealth he earned, and his insistence on absolute silence in his home and the study where he worked \u2013 has an almost monastic quality. And according to Michalski, Lutos\u0142awski was a religious man, even if he didn't write any explicitly religious or liturgical works. Because his wife Danuta (to whom he was devoted, and who died of a broken heart just weeks after his death) had divorced before marrying him, Witold could not take communion in the Polish church. That mattered to him, Michalski said, and to compensate, every year he would stay for a week with his cousin at his monastery to \"clean his soul\". That spiritual dimension, I think, is what's behind the transcendent refinement you hear in his music: it's there throughout the Fourth Symphony, it's present in the radiant, deceptive simplicity of his late song-cycle Chantefleurs et Chantefables, and in the limpid drama of the Piano Concerto, composed for Krystian Zimerman. Lutos\u0142awski said that to write music was to go \"fishing for souls\", searching for listeners like him, for whom his music would resonate somewhere deep inside them. It's a strikingly spiritual way of describing his supposedly abstract art \u2013 see if he has caught yours \u2026\n\n\n\nThird Symphony\n\n\n\nConcerto for Orchestra\n\nCello Concerto\n\n\n\nChantefleurs et Chantefables\n\n\n\nFourth Symphony"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Witold_Lutos%C5%82awski.html?id=_O3vT1NUWMMC", "page_content": ": A Bio-Bibliography Stanislaw Bedkowski , Stanislaw Hrabia Greenwood Publishing Group , 2001 - 323 pages , 2001 - Biography & Autobiography 0 Reviews Reviews aren't verified, but Google checks for and removes fake content when it's identified This volume in the Greenwood Press series, Bio-Bibliographies in Music, provides new details about the life and works of Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski.

He began composing at age nine, studied composition at the Warsaw Conservatory (1932\u201336), and studied conducting with Felix Weingartner at the Vienna Academy (1937\u201338). He then completed his studies in Paris and London and returned to Warsaw, where, during World War II, he had to lie low, performing occasionally as a pianist in underground concerts. All his early works were destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising (1944), but he was able to reconstruct some of them.\n\nBritannica Quiz Composers & Their Music\n\nPanufnik conducted the Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic (1945\u201346) and the Warsaw Philharmonic (1946\u201347) and from 1947 was guest conductor with a number of European orchestras. His compositions were gaining attention also and won a number of awards; the Polish communist officials, however, began criticizing the style and content of his works, and he defected to Britain in 1954. (He became a naturalized British subject in 1961.) Panufnik was musical director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (1957\u201359) and then devoted himself to his own compositions, which included 10 symphonies, various other orchestral works, concerti, chamber works, and choral and vocal works. In September 1990, after the overthrow of communism, Panufnik returned to Poland for the first time in 36 years and conducted the European premiere of his last symphony.\n\nPanufnik\u2019s autobiography, Composing Myself, was published in 1987, and he was knighted in 1991."}, {"url": "http://panufnik.com/further-reading/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nAndrzej Panufnik Manuscript Collection.

The 1950 trio of Andrzej Koszewski (1922 - 2015) comes first and is the most old-fashioned, though it has a multiple personality, opening in a warm Brahmsian mode but later bringing in both impressionistic and neoclassical elements. The 1957 trio of Tadeusz Szeligowski (1896-1963) is a brittle work, not quite atonal but very much a reaction to the post-Stalin-era opening of Western musical developments to Eastern Bloc composers. Andrzej Panufnik's 1936 trio is a student work but even here you clearly hear his fondness for staccato melodies and short rhythmic cells, though there's a greater reliance on tonality and even folk-flavorings than in his mature works.\n\nFrom the MusicWeb review:\n\nThis disc is one of a clutch that I have had the good fortune to review recently. They have come from the stable of Acte Pr\u00e9alable, a Polish CD company that describes itself as the \u201cLeading label promoting Polish music and musicians\u201d. If what I have seen so far is anything to go by the claim is valid. As noted above this disc includes two world premi\u00e8re recordings which show the label\u2019s commitment to its aims. In fact it was the musicians that found those two compositions and the label\u2019s Artistic Director and Producer Jan Jarnicki was only too pleased to record them. Andrzej Koszewski is pictured in the booklet at the piano surrounded by the three trio members so, since he wrote his trio in 1950, he must be pleased to have it recorded at last. It\u2019s surprising that it hasn\u2019t been recorded before because it is an excellent work. The trio opens with a movement marked Adagietto. Allegro patetico which is quite animated even agitated. The second, Andantino con moto, is a rocking lullaby by comparison. Its central motif is a memorable and beautiful little tune that sits well between the two outer movements. The final Sostenuto. Allegro giusto is a complete contrast which embodies elements of each of the preceding two plus a passing reference to Chopin. The booklet states that this trio is among \u201c... the relatively modest group of instrumental pieces that Koszewski wrote\u201d since he is known principally for his choral music and that it was treated as \u201cpractice of the styles of the past eras\u201d. When you hear this you will I\u2019m sure feel as sad as I did that he did not write more. Tadeusz Szeligowski was a lawyer who turned to music only in his thirties and yet was proficient enough to also teach Koszewski among others. Szeligowski was yet another pupil of Nadia Boulanger during which time he took to heart the spirit of the French tradition. This was the same tradition that had as its motto that music should give pleasure to the composer for a job well done and then to the listener who could admire the ability of the composer and the performing musicians. Szeligowski\u2019s piano trio was written in 1955-56 towards the end of his life - later then than his pupil Koszewski\u2019s. It was an attempt to experiment with twelve-tone technique but not in such a wholesale way that the overall impression is not more neo-classical than anything else. It does have a more \u201cmodern\u201d sound than his pupil\u2019s but that\u2019s as far as it goes. The work as a whole is generally one full of lyricism and good tunes. The final work on the disc is by one of Poland\u2019s best known and well respected composers, Andrzej Panufnik. Though born in 1914 between the two other composers, he wrote his trio when only 22 and fresh from the Conservatory. It was given its premi\u00e8re in 1936 with no less a person at the piano than Mieczyslaw Weinberg. The booklet states that contemporary reviewers considered it so romantic in feel that they associated it with Brahms and it\u2019s not hard to see why. I wonder what those same reviewers had to say about Panufnik\u2019s potential because this work promises much for the young composer\u2019s future, a promise thoroughly fulfilled throughout his life. The trio is extremely beautiful and abounds in brilliance. We are fortunate that despite being burnt along with much else during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 he managed to reconstruct it afterwards. It was not published until 1977. The booklet poses an interesting couple of questions: if the listener played the disc in the order the works were written would they find the work written last more difficult to understand than the earlier ones. Would the fact that two were written by \u201cstudents\u201d and one by a teacher be obvious? Well my response is no to both. To me the disc is of three highly successful and enjoyable piano trios that show that the great Polish musical tradition that reached its zenith with Chopin was still alive and well in the twentieth century as evidenced further by the likes of Lutoslawski, Penderecki, Weinberg, Szymanowski, Tansman, Gorecki, Baird and many more and that it continues today. These works have been very well recorded and are beautifully played by this young trio who have launched their recording career with this disc. I wish them every success. I look forward to more discoveries from Acte Pr\u00e9alable. --Steve Arloff\n\nDisc, booklet, and case are in near-mint condition.\n\nShipping rates:\n\nUS customers: Options are Media Mail at $3 for the first CD, $1 for each additional disc mailed at the same time; or First Class Mail at $3.50 for the first CD, $1.25 for each additional disc mailed at the same time.\n\nThe USPS no longer offers cheap international shipping of thin envelopes with merchandise, BUT if you order many discs together the new rate is about the same as it was before.

She came to Poland after World War II as an army officer's widow and seduced many men, before eventually becoming Andrzej's wife and encouraging him to lead a rich social life.\n\nAt the same time, the communist authorities needed Panufnik to establish their new order and legitimise it abroad. He became the vice-chairman of the Polish Composers Union and took part in countless conferences and foreign missions, for example to China in 1953.\n\nDuring this last journey, he received the message that his daughter Oonagh drowned in a bathtub, apparently because of Scarlett having an epileptic attack. Furthermore, the attitude of the ministry's deputies towards the composer was ambiguous. Many of his praised works were banned from concert halls (for example Sinfonia Rustica), which was a sign of the times. All that \u2013 together with limited time for composing and restrictions on artistic freedom \u2013 drove Panufnik to desperate measures in 1954.\n\nIt is not easy for a man to cut himself from his country and his people. It is perhaps even more difficult for one who, like myself, has made a certain name there and received recognition as a creative artist. But freedom counts for much, and indeed is so important, particularly for the artist, that life without it becomes almost unbearable. This is the case in Poland today. (\u2026) The worker is asked only to use his lathe and peasant his plough; but the artist must subordinate his imagination and individuality to the demands of the Communist Party and create \u2013 if he wants to live at all \u2013 in a manner that serves the ends of the Communist State.\n\nAndrzej Panufnik, A Composer's View of Life in Modern Poland. I \u2013 Hatred of Russian Control, in The Times, 12 August 1954.\n\nAt first, Scarlett was reluctant to give up the privileges (including an apartment and a car) granted to them in Poland, but ultimately played a crucial role in the escape plan. Officially, she left to visit her family living in the UK, but the main purpose of her journey was to make arrangements with the Foreign Office and contact composer Konstanty Regamey in Switzerland.\n\nEscape and exile\n\nHe arranged an official invitation from the Swiss Radio Orchestra for Panufnik to conduct and record his own pieces \u2013 a letter which Polish authorities couldn't ignore. The composer had to leave almost all of his belongings behind (including his father's instrument collection) in order to avoid arousing suspicion. Also, he couldn't share his motives with the people closest to him (including his beloved niece, the daughter of his late brother).\n\nWhen Panufnik came to Switzerland, he was under the surveillance of Polish embassy workers. On the second day, he managed to shake them off by leaving a restaurant through the back door and rushing to the hotel in a taxi. Regamey succeeded in delivering a plane ticket to London and drove the composer to the airport. At last, Andrzej Panufnik joined Scarlett on 14 July 1954.\n\nAlthough he became quite recognisable after several interviews and newspaper articles describing cultural life behind the Iron Curtain, it soon became clear that he had to start over once again. Year after year, he slowly \u2013 but consequently \u2013 established his position in British musical life, mostly thanks to his conducting skills and new acquaintances."}, {"url": "http://panufnik.com/", "page_content": "\u201cIn all my works, I attempt to achieve a true balance between feeling and intellect, heart and brain, impulse and design.\u201d\n\nAndrzej Panufnik is one of the most important and original symphonic composers of the 2nd half of the 20th century. His output includes ten symphonies, with Centenary commissions from Sir Georg Solti for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Seiji Ozawa for Boston. The London Symphony Orchestra commissioned three works from him, and recorded many more of his works under the direction of Jascha Horenstein and then of the composer himself. Leopold Stokowski premi\u00e8red several of his works in the USA and England. Gennady Rozhdestvensky recorded his Hommage \u00e0 Chopin in Leningrad. The young Evelyn Glennie first came to prominence winning the Shell-LSO Scholarship with his Concertino for Timpani, Percussion & Strings; this work later received its US premi\u00e8re conducted by Andr\u00e9 Previn. Yehudi Menuhin commissioned his Violin Concerto for the Windsor Festival and recorded it with Panufnik conducting. Mstislav Rostropovich premi\u00e8red and recorded his Cello Concerto with the LSO, and the Royal Philharmonic Society commissioned his Ninth Symphony, which was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by the composer. In addition to four concertos, he composed three string quartets, three cantatas and many works for chamber and string ensembles. His works are probably as much recorded as any classical composer\u2019s of that period. Choreographers of his music have included Martha Graham, Kenneth MacMillan, Krzysztof Pastor, Robert Cohan, David Bintley, Gerald Arpino, Emil Weso\u0142owski and Paul Mejia.\n\nBorn in Warsaw on 24th September 1914, Panufnik started to compose at the age of nine. He graduated from the Warsaw Conservatoire with Distinction in both composition and conducting, developing his classical conducting skills as a favourite pupil of Felix Weingartner at the Vienna Academy, and then studying French Impressionist composers with Philippe Gaubert in Paris, with further music explorations in London. Just before the outbreak of World War II Panufnik returned to Warsaw to look after his parents.\n\nIn Nazi-occupied Poland, with public concerts banned, he arranged a massive amount of classical music for two pianos which he played as a duo in \u201cartistic caf\u00e9s\u201d with his friend and contemporary Witold Lutos\u0142awski; also performing with his Jewish violinist friend Tadeusz (known post-war as Thad\u00e9 Geisler). Despite the Nazi terror in Warsaw, at great personal risk he conducted illegal concerts and composed patriotic resistance songs, including the still-famous Warszawskie Dzieci. During the war he lost most of his closest relatives, as well as every note of music he had composed in his first 30 years, including two symphonies, destroyed by fire during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.\n\nIn 1945 the 31-year-old Panufnik, eager to help the revival of classical music post-war, was appointed chief conductor of the Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic Orchestra, having to seek out instrumentalists, old and young, scattered all over Poland. Then, in 1946 he was similarly asked to restore the Warsaw Philharmonic to life.\n\nIn those early post-war years, he began to reconstruct his lost symphonies and other works, but soon decided he must bury the past and start afresh. He kept only three restorations, his Five Polish Peasant Songs, the Piano Trio (his Opus 1) and Tragic Overture (dedicated to his courageous brother Mirek, a radio operator in the Polish Underground). He won international admiration and honours in his own country, the originality of those mid-1940s works establishing him as the \u201cfather\u201d of the Polish avant-garde.\n\nAfter 1948, with the imposition of Soviet Socialist Realism, Panufnik\u2019s situation changed dramatically. As Poland\u2019s leading composer, greatly respected throughout Europe, he was under much more intense pressure than his compatriots, bullied to write according to the Soviet imposition of Socialist Realism, artificially \u201cpositive\u201d music composed according to the dictates of the authorities. Everything he composed of value was condemned as \u201cwestern, bourgeois, decadent\u201d. In 1949, the centenary of Chopin\u2019s death, he was elected Vice-President of the Music Council of UNESCO, though the Polish authorities never allowed him to attend any connected ceremonies or concerts. He worked tirelessly to try to obtain better financial and other help for his fellow composers and cared deeply about the future of Polish music; however, creatively stultified by criticism, restrictions and intolerable political pressures, he ceased to be able to compose, the driving force of his life thus extinguished. In 1954 he made a dramatic escape from Poland as a protest against Communist control over creative artists, and this resulted in a raft of vicious propaganda and lies put out about him followed by total censorship of his name and his music in Poland for 23 years.\n\nPanufnik was a shy man, disliking public life, and his greatest desire was to live quietly and compose in peace. He settled in England, Boosey & Hawkes became his publishers, and from 1957 to 1959 he served as Chief Conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, his last official position before deciding to dedicate his life entirely to composition. He took British nationality in 1961.\n\nLife in England was not easy for him. He was independent from the current fashion in composition which dominated the BBC, Paris and New York in the \u201960s and \u201970s, and stuck to his own aesthetic of constantly seeking new forms and \u201cthe perfect balance between intellect and emotion, heart and mind\u201d in his works. Avoiding publicity (disastrous financially) he managed to disappear almost entirely from the musical scene; at last, however, unfettered by politics or conducting, the subsequent years became the most freely creative of his life. In 1963 Panufnik won the coveted Monaco composition prize for his still most widely loved and admired work, Sinfonia Sacra. In the same year he married the author and photographer Camilla Jessel; they settled in her grandmother\u2019s old house by the Thames in Twickenham with a peaceful studio at the end of their garden where he could compose uninterrupted. His two children, Roxanna, also a classical composer and Jem, graphic artist, DJ and composer of electronica, both grew up influenced by his joy in his creative work. By the 1970s Panufnik, though still shy of publicity and deep in his work, was very much part of British musical life and his music was performed by most of Britain\u2019s leading orchestras, with performances at the BBC Proms and at many LSO concerts.\n\nEventually, from 1977, Panufnik works were gradually performed in the ever-innovatory Warsaw Autumn Festival thanks to the insistence of his fellow Polish composers. Having left as a protest, he refused to return to Poland while the Communists were still in power. In 1990, when democracy was restored, he made a momentous return to the city of his birth for the performance of eleven of his works at the Festival. He was greeted on the airport tarmac by a crowd carrying red roses and brass players performing his Fanfare.\n\nPanufnik\u2019s autobiography, Composing Myself, was published in 1987. He received a knighthood for services to British Music in January 1991, the year of his death, and a posthumous Order of Polonia Restituta from President Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa in Poland.\n\nReferences to further reading can be found in the Extras sub-menu or by clicking here.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://sonichits.com/artist/Tadeusz_Szeligowski", "page_content": "Tadeusz Szeligowski (13 September 1896 - 10 January 1963) was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer.

At the outbreak of war he returned to Warsaw where he remained throughout the Nazi occupation.

All his compositions were destroyed in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, though he reconstructed three scores in the following years.\n\nAfter the war, Panufnik held conducting positions with the Krakow Philharmonic and the Warsaw Philharmonic, also appearing as a guest conductor with many of the leading European orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Orchestre National, Paris, and the London Philharmonic. In 1950 he was elected vice-chairman, with Arthur Honegger, of the International Music Council of UNESCO; and as head of a Polish cultural delegation to China in 1953, he was personally received by Chairman Mao.\n\nIn 1954 Panufnik left Poland as a protest against political control over creative artists, resulting in the total supression of his name and music.

In these days of easily accessible recordings and musicians delving deeper into unknown territory many composers have been uncovered \u2013 I cannot believe the music I have in my collection that I never dreamed would be recorded \u2013 but in the concert hall it is harder to hear Polish composers beyond Chopin and, to a lesser extent Szymanowski. In an attempt to right this imbalance the Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko International Competition of Polish Music was set up in 2019 attracting competitors from beyond Poland \u2013 the piano winners in this years festival were from Canada and the Ukraine \u2013 but the music played was strictly home-grown; only Polish composers allowed. The pandemic put the second competition on hold but it eventually took place between 11th and 18th September 2021. Prizes are awarded in two categories, piano solo and chamber ensemble and this double CD features performances from the top three winners in each category. The second CD contains performances by musicians who received honourable mentions or special prizes.\n\n\n\nCanadian pianist Carter Johnson won first prize. Like second prize winner Ivan Shemchuk he opens with one of the Moniuszko's three Chopinesque valses, the charming A major Valse. Next is the elegant Mazurka in F minor by Chopin pupil Karl Mikuli, previously unrecorded which, like the other works of his that I have heard, is stylish and melodious. The high wire act that is Leschetizky's etude La Piccola, sparklingly played is followed by the brief, colourful miniatures by Arthur Malawski, somewhat reminiscent of the miniatures of Prokofiev; the lullaby is particularly evocative. To close Johnson plays the final movement of Bacewicz's second Sonata, the toccata, in which he easily captures the skittish, volatile character. Ivan Shemchuk's Moniuszko Valse is in E minor and is also very Chopin-like in its sinuous melancholy. Zygmunt Stojowski's fiery Orientale is next, a work played so memorably by Josef Hofmann; Shemchuk's reading is full of character and atmosphere especially in the middle section. He rounds off with Szymanowski's \u00fcber-romantic Etude in E flat minor. In third place was another Szymanowski, this time Micha\u0142 Karol Szymanowski who is represented by his performance of the Polish Triptych by composer-pianist Mi\u0142osz Magin, written in 1967 though its colourful, folkloric and dance elements coupled with the tonal harmony could be from an earlier generation. The first is a vigorous triple time dance while the gorgeous second opens like a mazurka played by a music-box. A finger-twisting toccata-like piece ends this entertaining set. Staying with pianists and indeed Magin I was bowled over by the Chorale and fugue from his Toccata, Chorale and Fugue played by Adam Miko\u0142aj Go\u017cdziewski (honourable mention). The chorale has a slowly unfolding chromatic theme and is a descendant of the chorale from Franck's Prelude, chorale and fugue while the fugue is highly virtuosic with a subject based on a very short motif. Neither the back-sleeve or the inner notes mention the fact that the Toccata is missing here though Go\u017cdziewski did play it in the competition. Second prize winner Shemchuk also won the special prize for the best performance of a composition by Henryk Pachulski \u2013 now there's a sentence I never thought I would write. He plays the first Sonata whose three movements run to just over 14 minutes; it is passionately romantic in mood with a first movement dominated by the semiquaver figure heard in the first bar. The second movement is based around an eight-bar theme that repeats several times with increasing fervour interspersed with lighter triplet motifs. The finale is for me the most satisfying, a mix of high flying virtuosity, heavy on the octaves and heady lyricism. More Pachulski can be heard in four of his eight Fantastic tales (legends), the first three and the agile final number. These tales are quite short and are more like a set of romantic preludes than anything with a real narrative element to them though they are undeniably attractive. They are played Ruslan Kazakov (honourable mention) and the same award was given to Krzysztof Koz\u0142owski who plays an excerpt from Godowsky's Java Suite, the atmospheric In the Kraton whose gamelan effects disguise the piece's intricate difficulties handled seamlessly by Koz\u0142owski. The music critic prize went to Martyna Kubik who plays a sad little prelude by Roman Statkowski with echoes of Liadov and Rachmaninov. The prize for the best performance of a composition by W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u017bele\u0144ski was taken by Jakub Cetnarowski who gives a blistering account of the Th\u00e8me vari\u00e9, a beautiful set with ten gloriously varied and idiomatic variations ranging from a mazurka, a fugue, a scherzando sicilienne and several showy variations that keep the pianist very busy. This is something of a winner it must be said.\n\n\n\nTurning to the ensemble prizes and we don't leave the piano just yet; first prize went to the Ksi\u0105\u017cek piano duo who I reviewed favourably in Rachmaninov and Arensky not too long ago (Dux 1720 review). Their selection opens with the suave Reverie from Zar\u0119bski's Deux morceaux en forme de Mazurka, a piece that goes beyond simple dance It opens with an urbane waltz that sounds somewhat French and has a faster middle section that reinforces that impression with hints of Chabrier's infectiousness. I am very impressed by the three Negro Spirituals arranged by Roman Maciejewski, a pupil of Nadia Boulanger and Kazimierz Sikorski, names that crop up again in this line up of composers. From age 24 he lived outside of Poland, moving between the UK, the US and Sweden where he died in 1998. Apart from his many original compositions he made arrangements for two pianos of works ranging from Bach and Cl\u00e9rambault to Ravel and Kreisler as well as several of Ignacy Jan Paderewski's piano solos. These sparkling transcriptions of the spirituals Listen to the lamb, I want to be ready and a sympathetic version of Sometimes I feel like a motherless child are given thrilling performances as is the familiar set of Paganini Variations by Witold Lutos\u0142awski. Second ensemble prize went to the wind ensemble Kwintofonia who played wind quintets by Tadeusz Szeligowski and Antoni Sza\u0142owski, both of whom studied with Nadia Boulanger which goes some way to explaining the very Gallic sound world we hear. The vivacious opening movement of Szeligowski's quintet has elements of a tarantella and is bright and colourful in its use of the instruments while there is considerable beauty in the second movement's melodic contours. It is a delightful and very approachable work especially for a piece written as late as 1953. The third movement of the quintet by Sza\u0142owski is again very tonal and French sounding, playful and effervescent in its clever use of rhythm, articulation and timbre. Before Boulanger he studied with Kazimierz Sikorski who also taught Roman Palester whose ballet The Song of Earth provides the polish dance for violin and piano that was part of the programme that gave Aleksandra Kuls and Marcin Koziak third prize. Vigorous and folk like it opens with a recitative for solo violin before the dance proper. With some of the vibrancy and energy of Bartok's Roumanian Dances its outer sections frame a slower brooding passage where the violin takes to the higher register with some vaguely blues like touches. The Dance Preludes for clarinet and piano by Witold Lutos\u0142awski comprise two slow and three faster pieces; the faster numbers are mainly concerned with rhythm, especially in the complex fifth prelude. The third is distinctive for the spiky clarinet grace notes in the third and the sparse melody of the fourth is accompanied by an equally barren piano part, staccato bass and the odd flourish of notes. We have heard quite approachable piano works by Mi\u0142osz Magin but his String Quartet in two movements is a different matter, played here by the winners of the Margot Magin special prize for the performance of a chamber composition by Mi\u0142osz Magin, Kwartet Smyczkowy Op.1 who discovered the manuscript and gave the premiere in this competition. Its mood and temperament are caustic and the textures are polyphonic; it makes for uneasy listening in its almost unerringly jagged rhythm and harmony. The second movement moderato seems to speak of pain and grief, restless and tormented. Tadeusz Baird's Caprices for clarinet and piano were the choice of the Dobrowolski S\u0142api\u0144ski Duo (honourable mention); similar in style to the Lutos\u0142awski Dance Preludes with the emphasis on rhythm and energy both are full of ebullience and virtuosity with a great sense of conversation between the performers. The final honourable mention goes to Trio Legend who play the finale of Andrzej Panufnik's Piano Trio which he wrote as a student and reconstructed in 1946 after it was lost during the war. It's mix dance and contrapuntal elements have a great deal of humour peeping from behind its sometimes gruff exterior.\n\n\n\nExtensive notes in Polish and English are given in the booklet. I would mention that the print is quite small on a rich blue paper and while the Polish text is in white font the black font chosen for the English makes it a little difficult to read \u2013 maybe just my old eyes but I definitely had to get it in the right light to read. The performers are all strong and committed and there is no sense that the restriction in the choice of composers has been a hindrance; indeed the performers all seem to rise to the challenge and are evidently enjoying the rich choice of music that is available within that remit. It is wonderful to find a festival that is doing so much for the music of its homeland both familiar and unfamiliar. Hopefully the performers will take this music with them and spread it far and wide and continue to explore beyond the familiar. There is some high quality music at this competition much of which could hold its own on the world's stages and Dux have given us an excellent taste of this extraordinary festival, one that will hopefully grow in strength and recognition.

His works include the operas The Rise of the Scholars, Krakatuk and Theodor Gentlemen, the ballets The Peacock and the Girl and Mazepa ballets, two violin concertos, chamber and choral works.\n\nAs a music teacher, Szeligowski was very well established in Vilnius, Lublin, Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw. He was also a respected music writer who frequently wrote for journals and magazines specialized in music such as the Kurier Wile\u0144ski, Tygodnik Wile\u0144ski, Muzyka and the Kurier Pozna\u0144ski. His achievements include the creation of the Poznan\u00b4 Philharmonic, where he served as its first director between the years 1947-1949, and the founding of the Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring, one of the most important festivals of contemporary music at the time.\n\nLife and work\n\nMusical education\n\nTadeusz Szeligowski was born on 13 September 1896 in Lvov, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. Szeligowski\u2019s first music and piano teacher was his mother. Later he began studying music at the Conservatory of Music of the Polish Society in L'vov in the years 1910-1914, where he studied piano under the direction of Vilem Kurz, and then from 1918-1923 in Krak\u00f3w, where he studied piano with H. Peters, and composition with Boles\u0142aw Wallek-Walewski. Szeligowski's further education included musicology with Zdzis\u0142aw Jachimecki and law at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, where he received his doctorate in 1922. There he found work as repetiteur at the Krak\u00f3w Opera House, allowing him to become well acquainted with the opera repertoire.\n\nHe complemented his studies in music in the years 1929-1931 in Paris, where he met many composers of his time such as Sergei Prokofiev, George Enesco and Arthur Honegger. There he studied composition with Nadia Boulanger and orchestration with Paul Dukas. There he attended many concerts and intensely experienced the latest compositions by Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, ballet productions of many famous companies, as well as highly acclaimed performances by Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.\n\nMusical career\n\nIn 1923 Szeligowski worked in Vilnius, Lithuania, as lawyer and lecturer at the Conservatory of Music. There he met Karol Szymanowski and became a great admirer of his music. He also worked with a dramatic theatre called Reduta, composing music for many of its productions. Shortly after his return to Poland in 1931, he began teaching music in Pozna\u0144 until 1939, and then moved to Lublin for a little while after the World War II. From 1947-1962 he worked for The State Higher School Of Music (Pa\u0144stwowa Wyzsza Szko\u0142a Muzyczna) in Pozna\u0144, and from 1947-1950 he became director of the National Opera Academy, when on his own initiative the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic was created. In addition, he was the initiator of the festival of contemporary music, the \"Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring\", where modern music was then presented in all its glory, and one of the organizers of the H. Wieniawski International Violin Competition. From 1951-1962 Szeligowski worked in Warsaw, first for the faculty of the Fryderik Chopin University of Music in Warsaw, and later as director of the Polish Society of Composers.\n\nA large group of his graduates on composition include: Zbigniew Bargielski, Augustyn Bloch, Joanna Bruzdowicz, Wojciech Lukaszewski, Tadeusz Wojciech Maklakiewicz, Boleslaw Ocias, Witold Rudzinski, Marek Sart, Aleksander Szeligowski and Antoni Szuniewicz. See: List of music students by teacher: R to S#Tadeusz Szeligowski.\n\nAs a music writer\n\nLvov\u2019s musical scene at that time included a city opera, a symphonic orchestra, a music society and also a conservatory of music, and there Szeligowski was very active as a social organizer. Musicians such as Felix Weingartner and Oscar Nedbal usually visited the city and frequently performed works by Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. From 1951-1954 he served as chairman of the Polish Composers Union, and from 1953 he worked for the Board of Polish Music Publishers and the Central Pedagogical Office for Arts Education (COPSA). Tadeusz Szeligowski died in Pozna\u0144 on 10 January 1963 and since 1965 he has been buried in the Pozna\u0144 Skalka crypt of Merit.\n\nAwards\n\nJ\u00f3zef Kopczy\u0144ski's 1966 commemorative plaque for Polish composer Tadeusz Szeligowski.

For more information visit the Manuscript Collection. The exhibit was accompanied by a Chamber Music Concert performed by Polish musicians from the USC Thornton School of Music as well as others active in Los Angeles. The Concert was recorded and the CD includes chamber music by Kazimierz Serocki, Marta Ptaszy\u0144ska, Tadeusz Szeligowski, Tadeusz Baird, and others.\n\nEvent Review\n\nby Rados\u0142aw Materka\n\nManuscript Exhibition And Concert\n\nAmong the many political, economic and social organizations related to Poland, the Polish Music Center at the University of Southern California occupies a unique position. This center, founded in 1985 by Dr. and Mrs. Wilk (and still improperly seen by many members of Californian Polonia as their private concern) is the only institution dedicated to the promotion of and research about Polish music in North America. Moreover, it is the only academic institution dedicated to Polish culture in Southern California. The Center was designed to last in perpetuity (thanks to its permanent Endowment Fund) and is a part of one of the best music schools in the country, the Thornton School of Music (ranked in the top 1% of music schools in the U.S. and as no. 1 west of Mississippi).\n\nThe main part of the program was the most unique: a display of over 100 manuscripts by 33 composers who donated their music to the Polish Music Center. What is a \u201cmanuscript?\u201d Something hand-written\u2014and during the exhibit we had a chance of seeing a whole range of writing, from pencil to ink and marker, the composers used different means to record their thoughts. Each set of manuscripts (from 1 to 8 per composer) was accompanied by a display with the composers\u2019 biography, titles of the works presented, photographs, concert programs, books, and quotations from their statements.\n\nThe displays were assembled on 36 white three-panel boards providing the backdrop for the manuscripts. The most precious of those were, of course, three of the manuscripts donated to the Center by Witold Lutoslawski\u2014the total value of the set of five original Lutoslawski manuscripts in the PMC collection exceeds $1,000,000. No wonder two security guards were needed and present on the premises through the whole exibition. Other precautions included distributing gloves among the attendees, who could turn the pages but would not damage the precious old paper.\n\nIn addition to the Lutos\u0142awski originals, the display included also rare scores from mid-30s (by Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz and Stanis\u0142aw Skrowaczewski), manuscripts by Tadeusz Baird (over 50 years old), Aleksander Tansman, Roman Maciejewski, Szymon Laks, Roman Palester, and many of their younger colleagues. The manuscripts were accompanied by printed scores and recordings\u2014so people in attendance could learn about the music and listen to what they saw. The whole collection is not complete yet, it continues to grow through new donations made by other composers contacted by Dr. Trochimczyk. This stage in donations drive will end in April 2000, when another, smaller exhibition of recent gifts will be held.\n\nChamber Music Concert\n\nLet me start with describing some examples\u2014young musicians, graduate students in the Thornton School of Music, who volunteered to perform in the Concert of 20th Century Polish Music. Ladies first: Adrianna Lis has played the flute since childhood and won numerous prizes in international competitions. After being accepted to study at USC, she became the member of the most elite group of wind players, the \u201cScholarship Quintet\u201d where she played for one year. It was a very special recognition of her talent as the best flutist in the whole School (her GPA? 4.0, perfect!). Her version of two lively movements from Szeligowski\u2019s Sonata for Flute and Piano amazed the audience with the dexterity of her fingers. Marzena Wolna (who because of a hand injury could not perform in the concert)\u2014the first bassoon in USC Thornton Orchestra, first bassoon in Debut orchestra, winner of every orchestral competition for her instrument that she ever entered. I hope that Polish-Americans in California will have an opportunity of listening to her music in the future.\n\nNow the gentlemen: Jan Jakub Bokun, clarinetist and conductor whose graduation concert in April 2001 will feature Polish music, and for whom a professorship of clarinet in the Wroclaw Academy of Music is already waiting. Bokun\u2019s two solo CDs have received rave reviews in international music press. His \u201cstint\u201d as the clarinetist for Krystian Zimerman\u2019s Polish Festival Orchestra (traveling around the world and recording the two Chopin Piano Concerti) is yet another proof of his amazing talents (GPA? Of course, 4.0).\n\nFor the concert he selected a piece by Tadeusz Baird, the most romantic of Polish modernist composers, an artist whose talent was and is, not known well enough in the U.S. 2 Kaprysy delighted with their \u201ccapricious\u201d nature and the virtuosity of performance.\n\nMicha\u017c Sobus (double bass) and Krzysztof Szmanda (percussion) have just been accepted to the Thornton School and will have to prove their talents. Already both musicians play the \u201cfirst\u201d parts in the Thornton ensembles and perform in other orchestras based in Los Angeles. During the concert Mr. Sobus performed a difficult and engaging work by Tadeusz Wielecki (the current director of the Warsaw Autumn Contemporary Music Festival). Mr. Szmanda was accompanied by a pianist in 4 Preludes for vibraphone and piano, and by another percussionist in Scintilla for two marimbas. Both works were composed by Marta Ptaszynska, Poland\u2019s most eminent woman composer who is now full professor of composition at the University of Chicago. Ptaszynska is a percussionist herself and understands the nature of her instruments. The two marimbas at one point quoted some music from Chopin \u2013 so that the greatest Polish composer could be present in this concert as well.\n\nI have not forgotten, but left for later, two names of wonderful Polish musicians who are not connected to the Thornton School but instead are active in Los Angeles: Yolanta Tensor, soprano (who moved here from Chicago, interrupting a budding solo career) and Roza Kostrzewska-Yoder (who studied in Harvard and other prestigious institutions) and now devotes most of her time to teaching and nurturing young talents.\n\nMs. Tensor sang two songs, one by Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz and one by Szymon Laks (a Polish Jewish composer who survived Auschwitz and continued to write music). These \u201crecital-like\u201d musical gems required attention and reflection of the listeners who could enjoy the beautiful Polish poetry and the poignant settings. Ms. Kostrzewska \u2013 Yoder started the concert with a piece written for Dr. and Mrs. Wilk by Henryk G\u00f3recki during his visit here in 1997 and explained the significance of this miniature portraying both musical benefactors. Two of Ms. Kostrzewska-Yoder\u2019s students played Polish music \u2013 6 years old James Lee and 12 years old Daniel Lee. Both have won competitions for young musicians and it was easy to see why -they were excellent!\n\nExhibition of Polish Manuscripts\n\nThe concert was just one of the aspects of the program of this event (it was recorded and a CD will be available). As a musician, music student (doctoral program in piano at USC) and music teacher, I am delighted to find such a resource for Polish music as the Polish Music Center on USC campus. I did not base my decision to apply to this school on this fact, but rather on the excellence of the piano department. I am proud, as a Polish American, that the Center presents such high quality projects dedicated to Polish music and that I am involved in some of them (my previous appearance was at the International Conference on Polish Jewish Music in 1998).\n\nMy sincere hope is that more people in the Polish American community would take pride in their musical heritage and helped the Center in its activities. During the concert and the exhibition I saw the representatives of the Polish government, with Consul General Krzysztof Kasprzyk and Consul for Commercial Affairs, Boleslaw Meluch, as well as members of some Polish American organizations, such as the Polish American Historical Association, the Polish American Cultural Network, and the Helena Modjeska Club for Polish Arts and Culture.\n\nLet us all hope, for the benefit of all Poles, that more organizations will take pride in actively supporting the Center and its programs in the future."}, {"url": "https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/composers/7352--szeligowski", "page_content": "Tadeusz Szeligowski was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer.
