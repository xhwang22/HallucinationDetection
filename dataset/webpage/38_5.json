She is known for several of her songs such as \u2018Right Now\u2019 and \u2018Irawo\u2019.\n\nOnly a handful of female artists have succeeded in making a huge breakthrough with their singing talent, and their efforts largely impact the Nigerian music industry. One of such women with an excellent career in the industry is Seyi Shay. As a reward for her efforts, Seyi Shey not only boasts a massive fan base but also a mouth-watering net worth estimated at $4.5 million.\n\nSeyi Shay is undoubtedly one of the reigning queens of the Nigerian music industry, thanks to her ability to churn out some chart-topping hit after hit.\n\n\n\nSeyi Shay Profile Summary Birth Name: Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua\n\nDeborah Oluwaseyi Joshua Also Known As: Seyi Shay (pronounced Shay-yee Shay)\n\nSeyi Shay (pronounced Shay-yee Shay) Date of Birth: December 21, 1985\n\nDecember 21, 1985 Age: 37 Years Old\n\n37 Years Old Place of Birth: Tottenham, London, United Kingdom\n\nTottenham, London, United Kingdom State of Origin: Osun State\n\nOsun State Nationality: Nigeria\n\nNigeria Occupation: Singer, songwriter, performer, actress\n\nSinger, songwriter, performer, actress Music Genre: Afropop, R&B, Afro-soul, Afro-fusion\n\nAfropop, R&B, Afro-soul, Afro-fusion Active Years: 2001 \u2013 present\n\n2001 \u2013 present Marital Status: Single\n\nSingle Net Worth: $4.5 million\n\nSeyi Shay Hails from Osun State, South-West Nigeria\n\nThe Afropop singer is one of many Nigerian celebrities who were born abroad. She was born in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents who named her Oluwaseyi Odedere. Seyi\u2019s father is an indigene of Ife (a town in Osun State, South West, Nigeria), which means the singer\u2019s ethnicity is Yoruba. However, her mother hails from one of the Northern states in Nigeria. Nothing much is known about her parents and siblings except that they lived in the United Kingdom for many years.\n\nSeyi spent her early years in England until she was 2 years of age when she started visiting her home country, Nigeria. She eventually relocated to Nigeria, where she completed her high school education at Command High School, Maryland, Lagos State. She holds a degree in music and business management, which she obtained from a local UK college and the University of East London, respectively.\n\nHer Family Has an Extensive Background in Music\n\nBeing born into a family with proximity to a certain profession could help you develop a special interest in it, gain inside knowledge, and even be privy to career-centered opportunities that others may not have access to. This is a true situation for Seyi Shay, who grew up among family members with a passion for music. Shay was raised by her single mother, who, as a Christian, was a church chorister. She has three siblings- two brothers, one of which was a prominent club and radio DJ in London, and a sister who used to compose songs for the BBC.\n\nIt took Seyi Shay only a few years to master some aspects of music, after which she decided to pursue a professional career in music. At the young age of six, Shay joined her secondary school choir to perform for the London Community Gospel Choir during their world tour, which included 13 cities in Japan. She was also a member of several musical groups over there. Her talent has also taken her to several cities in many countries, where she wowed the audience with her wonderful voice.\n\nHer participation in the competition further fueled her passion for pursuing music as a career. When it was time for Seyi to take up courses that would help her boost her career in music, she faced strong opposition from her mother, who wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. However, before her death, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nA Look At Seyi Shay\u2019s Breakthrough in the Music World\n\nBeing a successful female musician in a competitive industry dominated by men is not an easy feat. It requires talent, prowess, effort, expertise, and a lot of hard work, and Seyi Shay has proven she has all it takes to take over the music industry in her home country and beyond. Her music career started when she signed her first music deal with the record label No Apology, and afterward, formed a UK-based girl band called Boadicea in 2006.

The girls also launched their own MTV reality show titled: \u201cBreaking From Above\u201d (it aired in over 166 countries worldwide) and were also present at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, where they presented an award to recipients.\n\nSeyi Shay later scored a recording deal with Sony and has continued to move from one level of success to another. Her return to Nigeria to pursue her music career was inspired by Nigerian rapper and singer Sound Sultan, who she met in London in 2011. After listening to her demos, Sultan convinced her to relocate to Nigeria and pursue her musical career. Under Cecil Hammond\u2019s record label Fly time Music, Seyi was able to launch her solo career in Nigeria and promote her brand. The superstar\u2019s debut album \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d was released in 2015, while her second studio album titled: \u201cElectric Package\u201d followed in 2018.\n\nSeyi Shay\u2019s most famous hits include: Loving Your Way\n\nNo Le Le\n\nIrawo\n\nIrawo (Remix) ft Vector\n\nChante ft Ajuju\n\nRight Now\n\nAlele, ft DJ Consequence and Flavour N\u2019abania\n\nKo Ma Roll ft Harmonize\n\nSurrender ft Kizz Daniel\n\nAir brush\n\nPack and Go ft Olamide\n\nYour Matter ft Eugy ft Efosa\n\nWeekend Vibes Remix ft Sarkodie\n\nYolo Yolo\n\nGimme Love ft Runtown\n\nKilin Me Softly ft Timaya\n\nChairman ft Kcee\n\nRagga Ragga\n\nMurda ft Patoranking and Shaydee\n\nHer Awards and Recognitions\n\nIn addition to gaining a huge fan base, Seyi Shay has also received awards for a job well done in most of his hit songs.

No, she isn\u2019t, but she made headlines earlier this year for her comments about marriage.\n\nDuring a conversation with Seun Kuti and OAP Temi B on Simi's Stoopid Sessions show, she revealed that she would not mind if her husband had side chics.\n\nSeyi revealed that as long as her husband is not keeping just one woman, she would be fine. According to her, if he keeps just one woman, they may fall in love and that may put her relationship with him at risk. However, if he has multiple side chics, their relationship would be safe.\n\nShe said:\n\n\"This is gonna sound somehow and I hope that other women don't try and bash me for it but I will actually be cool with my man having chics. As long as they're chics, and not one. Because if he has one chick on the side, then it's more likely that he's gonna fall in love with that one chic but if he's got like chics outside and he's doing his thing but I'm number one clearly in every way,\"\n\nShe also revealed that she got engaged in 2019:\n\n\u201c I actually got engaged last year. People that knew, knew, right? I had my ring on and everything \u2013 people thought it was a fashion ring or something but it was actually an engagement ring \u2013 and then a few months later we broke up.\u201d\n\nExplaining the reasons why the relationship ended, she revealed:\n\n\u201cWe were already arguing about the whole wedding; there is a lot of stress when you are planning a wedding and I think somewhere in that all process, our relationship started to break down. Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that. There is a type of glory that marriage gives you and your relationship as a woman or man and that is beyond the contract or the things you say to each other or the number of people in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nSeyi Shay quotes\n\nHere are some of her famous quotes\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t realize it, you are always moving forward and evolving.
