Revolutions, beheadings, wars - France has had many trials throughout the years. Everyone in charge has wanted to leave their mark on the country. In 1858, outside the entrance to the opera, Napoleon III survived an assassination attempt by Italian nationalists. This inspired him to build an opera house with a more secure entrance, to be called the Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale de Musique et de Danse, or the Imperial Academy of Music and Dance.\n\nCompetition\n\nBefore the new opera house could be built, the land the Emperor chose had to be cleared. In December of 1860, the Emperor announced that there would be a design competition for the new opera house. Of the 171 architects that applied worldwide, one man was chosen. His name was Charles Garnier, a yet unknown 32 year old architect. His design solved the problem of accommodating large audiences.\n\nConstruction and Destruction\n\nIt took several years for the new opera house to be built. Construction began in 1862. The 12,000 square meters that Napoleon III ordered to be cleared turned out to be swampy and on top of a subterranean lake. It took eight months for the foundation to finally be poured, as it kept flooding and filling with water.\n\nFlooding wasn't the only problem plaguing the construction of the new opera house. The 1869 election showed Napoleon III that the middle and working classes weren't happy with the way things were being run in their country. The economy was terrible, and soon France was once again at war, this time with the Prussians. Napoleon III was captured and deposed and later died in 1873. Construction stalled, but Garnier still tried to work on it despite the financial problems and resistance from the public who wanted it torn down. The Palais Garnier, the Paris Opera House, finally opened on January 5, 1875. Paris finally had a new home for its opera and ballet performances.\n\nThe Foundation Being Built\n\nInauguration of the Paris Opera, painting by Edouard Detailles\n\nInterior\n\nThe foundation of the Paris Opera House is made of concrete. Once construction was able to resume, Garnier set to work on finishing it. The foundation problems were solved by Garnier creating a system that drained the groundwater into a cistern; he was able to build on top of that, creating a double-walled foundation.\n\nHe tried to use modern materials, like metal. Instead of the expensive and time consuming process of gold leaf decorating (thin sheets of gold applied with a brush), he used gilded metals. He painted the metal yellow and then gold leaf was applied only where the light would hit in order to make it look like the whole section was gold. He also used marble for the interiors, with grand sculptures, and curves and columns. Many murals were featured throughout the building, even on the ceiling. Mirrors in the entrance make visitors feel like they are part of the scenery. The grand staircase is an impressive feature in the interior; they lead into the theater, which seats 1,979 people.\n\nThe foyer of the opera is where people can mingle before the shows start. The ceilings are painted and are lit by chandeliers. There is also a large chandelier in the theater. Weighing seven tons, Garnier's bronze and crystal creation rises above the audience.\n\nExterior\n\nThe exterior is equally decorative, with many sculptures and curved designs. The building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style, which emphasizes symmetry and ornamentation. The exterior showcases many sculptures, including marble busts of composers and depictions of Harmony and Poetry. The building includes two side pavilions, one created as an entrance for the emperor, the other for the audience. Since Napoleon III passed away before it was finished, they now house the Paris Opera library and museum.\n\nFront of the Paris Opera House\n\nLyric Drama\n\nApollo, Poetry, and Music\n\nModern Renovations\n\nAs in any old building, things fall apart. The building received an electrical update first in 1969. Restoration work began in 1994, and finished in 2007. The exterior, dirtied by years of pollution, was cleaned. The electricity was updated once again, and the foundation was strengthened."}, {"url": "https://www.francethisway.com/paris/paris-opera.php", "page_content": "Paris Opera visitor guide Search Paris hotels Visit Paris Opera, France Photo Gallery Book a visit\n\nThe Palais Garnier in Paris is most commonly known as the Paris Opera, and is one of the most important buildings in Paris. It is centrally placed just a short distance from the Louvre.\n\nThis 2,200 seat opera house was the successor to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, which had burned down in 1873. This landmark is a prime example of the Beaux-Arts architecture movement, in part drawing on the 17th century Classical Roman and Baroque style of emphasizing drama and grandeur as well as symmetry.\n\nBuilding and History of the Paris Opera / Palais Garnier\n\nThe Palais Garnier was commissioned during the reconstruction of central Paris by Napoleon III, and the civic planner Baron Haussmann was given the task to clear enough land to build the opera house in 1858. The design, by architect Charles Garnier, was chosen from a competition held in 1861.\n\nThe building was always designed to be an extravagant experience, with a lush, richly decorated space incorporating excessive elements such as a six-ton central chandelier, bronze busts of composers, and multiple columns, friezes and statues.\n\nThe enormous stage could accommodate up to 450 people at one time, and even the building\u2019s corridors and stairwells are cavernous.\n\nConstruction began in 1862, and was quickly plagued with setbacks and delays. It turned out that the building's foundation had unwittingly been laid upon a swamp, which took roughly eight months to drain. Then the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent fall of Napoleon III also caused long interruptions between construction periods.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (1821 \u2013 1873) burned down that there was a renewed impetus that finally gave Garnier a chance to finish the work, and he did so by the end of 1874. The Palais Garnier was inaugurated on January 15, 1875.\n\nThe name Palais Garnier is only a recent title \u2013 by the time it was renamed as such in 1989 it had gone through two other names. Its first was Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Musique - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra until 1978 when it was renamed as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris.\n\nPalais Garnier became the official name when the Op\u00e9ra Bastille was built in 1989 to replace the older opera house, although the Palais Garnier still remains and continues to house performances, and many Parisians still refer to the building as the Paris Opera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisiting the Paris Opera Garnier\n\nThe most impressive way to approach the Opera is along the Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra from the Louvre. You can see the facade of the Opera building from all along this avenue, and it just gets more impressive the closer you get.\n\nFirst you will want to walk all around the building admiring its detail from the outside: there is a whole mix of architectural styles from Ancient Greek to Baroque and Renaissance as well as a great deal of statuary and ornamentation to be seen.\n\nThe entrance to see the interior is to the left of the main entrance, and tickets cost about 11 euros. The inside of the Paris Opera was always designed to be a vast and glittering space, and it doesn't disappoint.\n\nAlmost every interior surface is of marble and other impressive stonework, gilded and frescoed and magnificent staircases lead between the principal rooms, and numerous statues and candelabras add further to the opulence.\n\nOne unexpected surprise is the main hall, with a ceiling painted by the modern artist Marc Chagall in 1964 and an interesting contrast to the 19th century excesses.\n\nAlthough the Bastille is now the official home to opera in Paris, performances are often still held here with starting prices for tickets of around 150 euros.\n\nSee Paris Short Breaks to plan your Paris visit"}, {"url": "https://blogs.ubc.ca/buildingempire/2021/02/18/palais-garnier-paris-opera-house-the-symbol-of-imperial-power-cultural-prestige/", "page_content": "The Paris Opera House was designed and completed by Charles Garnier between 1861 and 1875.[1] Dripping in opulence and grandeur, \u2018Palais Garnier\u2019 is the quintessential depiction of France\u2019s Imperial Power acquired during the Second Empire rule; representing the growing bourgeoisie population, Napoleon III\u2019s political ambitions both domestically and internationally, and a legacy of symbology which transgressed into colonized regions.

The Second Empire, ruled by Napoleon III, the first President and last Monarch of France, would see to the most significant changes to France including the renovation of Paris. Drafting a new plan for Paris, President Louis-Napol\u00e9on signed a law in 1852 allowing the government to expropriate properties in way of rebuilding the city and its streets. This gave the government authority to expedite urban renewal while still \u201cremaining a collaborative venture between public and private interests.\u201d[1]\n\nThe following year Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann was commissioned to begin the first phase of Paris\u2019 rebuild lasting 1853-1870.[2] The rebuilding of Paris sought myriad outcomes beyond the sanitization and beautification of a polluted medieval city. It included protecting the government during civil unrest by widening the streets so barricades would be impossible and creating shorter routes between the barracks and lower class working districts.[3] This was an effort on Napoleon III to maintain control over the Population of Paris, specifically the lower class in workers\u2019 districts.\n\nUnder the reign of Napoleon III, the population of Paris doubled.[4] Many of the bourgeoisie who moved from the city to the suburbs to escape its pollution came flocking back. With this new population the older affordable housing was demolished and the lower class was displaced \u201cinto the city\u2019s remaining and increasingly expensive slums.\u201d[5] \u201cThe breaking up of whole social neighborhoods by Hausmann\u2019s works, forcing the poor into even more crowded quarters while applying the elegant veneer of civilization to the boulevard facades [for the bourgeoisie.]\u201d[6] This dispossession of land from the lower class was the beginning of Napoleon III\u2019s vision of Imperial Power and grandeur for Paris.\n\nThese new Boulevards were designed to be deep elongated corridors with uninterrupted arteries.[7] Each would be lined with rhythmic structures in the quintessential Second Empire style, with its tripartite design of a commercial base, pilastered upper levels, and mansard roof (or attic space). Majority of these new Boulevards terminate at a civic space, monument or building. Circulation of Paris now revolved around the Second Empire\u2019s symbols of authority and power. Although these buildings were intended for the intellectual bourgeoisie interested in politics, some argue that \u201cthe interest of the French government in the 1850s and 1860s became one of distracting precisely that public from participating in politics. In lieu of political power, Napoleon offered them a magnificent playground.\u201d[8] This outlines that Napoleon III\u2019s intentions to renovate Paris were insidious and a way to distract the public from government affairs.\n\nFigure 2: Hausmann\u2019s schematic plan for Paris\u2019 Renovation.\n\nThe site of Garnier\u2019s Opera is highlighted with a red circle.

Thicker black lines indicate new road boundaries. The more zoomed in look starts to give a scale of the mass destruction that occurred.\n\nThe Paris Opera House\n\nIn 1860, Napoleon III declared Paris needed a new Opera so the state held a design competition. Charles Garnier won the competition and was commissioned to design the Opera in June of 1861.[1] Some suggest that the Opera was a natural progression for the city, such as journalist Ernest Chesneau in 1875: \u201cfor the enlarged, aerated, sanitized Paris, transformed with the clearest foresight of social needs and at the same time with magnificence by the imperial government.. one needed an Opera house that was worthy of the grandeur, the luxury, and the arts of the new Paris.\u201d[2] The siting of the Opera was contested for almost a century until Hausmann and Napoleon III decided on its final location in c.1860.[3] Confined at the end of Avenue de l\u2019Opera, the Opera house would be constructed in proximity to glamourous department stores, and have a direct connection to the Louvre.[4] The view of the terminated axis is a striking Neo-Baroque styled Opera that is both dripping in opulence and the indoctrination of France\u2019s Imperial Power.\n\nThe Opera\u2019s style built upon the new the French national style, one that coopted the classical styles of antiquity from Greece and Rome[5] and culminated in Claude Perrault\u2019s east fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre. The design of its exterior borrows from Classical Palladian models, Italian Renaissance, and Beaux-Arts to create a uniquely eclectic style. Garnier suggests that the style is \u201cdu Napoleon III.\u201d[6] The construction occurred when the archetypal Parisian style was being used for both public and private structures, leading to the design of complimentary surrounding residential buildings.[7] The image of imperial civic structures bleeds into the typical style of Paris, emulating the Second Empire\u2019s Imperial Power throughout the city.\n\nFigure 4: Garnier\u2019s ground floor plan for the Opera\n\nGarnier pays homage to his Beaux-Arts education with this horizontal plan with particular attention to the procession of Opera goers through circulation. He designs each space as separate volumes and provides almost enough backstage space as he does to the front of house.\n\nNo expense was spared on the building\u2019s ornamental stone work, opulent sculptural busts and statues, and copper and gold finishes. Its placement on a polygonal site at the end of multiple intersections would promote views to the building, be more secure for Napoleon III, and hamper the spread of fires.[8] Its plan, although predominantly rectilinear on a polygonal site, was remedied by flanked \u201ccurved buildings whose courtyards could serve as imperial public carriage entrances\u201d as well as curving the surrounding buildings, and widening Avenue de l\u2019Opera beyond its initial 22 metre width.[9] This created a nexus around the Opera house symbolizing Second Empire Paris, and further iterating France\u2019s Imperial Power.\n\nThe Opera\u2019s interior is as opulent as the exterior. The plan reflects Garnier\u2019s Beaux-Arts training at the Ecole in the practical matters of \u201ccirculation and clear expression of functions through separate volumes.\u201d[10] The procession of spaces was not focused on the Opera itself, but also the entrances which shepherded patrons through opulent waiting areas for pre-and-post-show socialization.[11] \u201cSeeing and being seen were essential components of the performance; the ceremonial space in front and support space behind exceed the volume of stage and auditorium. The monumental staircase, up which all theatregoers ascended to their seats, replaced the imperial court as the center of socially ambitious Paris.\u201d[12] The Opera acts to mix the rituals of bourgeoisie society within the civic structures of Imperial France. With so much opulence, grandeur, and money on display, it poses the question: who is financing this project?\n\nFigure 5: The Paris Opera\u2019s Grand Staircase, 1880 engraving\n\nGarnier\u2019s grand staircase be a vital component of the opera ritual. All theatre goers would have to take these stairs to their seats. It was meant to yourself off to the rest of the bourgeois society. The interior is more opulent than the exterior with almost every finish being dressed with an ornamental carving.\n\n[1] Mead, Second Empire Paris., 138\n\n[2] Ibid.\n\n[3] Ibid., 142\n\n[4] James-Chakraborty, Architecture since 1400., 285\n\n[5] Sara Stevens, \u201cConstructing The Past,\u201d ARCH 504: Empire Building (class lecture, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, January 14, 2021).\n\n[6] Mead, Second Empire Paris., 138\n\n[7] Mead, Second Empire Paris, 139\n\n[8] James-Chakraborty, Architecture since 1400., 285\n\n[9] Mead, Second Empire Paris, 155\n\n[10] Kostof, Spiro and Greg Castillo.

The 1840s saw further expansion of French influence with occupation of Mayotte and Nosy Be (islands off the coast of Madagascar), the Marquise Islands and Tahiti in the Indian Ocean, and New Caledonia off the coast of Australia.[4] This highlights France\u2019s expansion into new territory during the Second Empire. This laid the groundwork for future colonization and resource extraction. In fact, between 1787 and 1879, France\u2019s African colonies steadily increased their exports. French exports from Sub-Saharan Africa (south of the Sahara desert) totalled 0.1% of France\u2019s exports in 1787 to 0.5% in 1879. More so, North Africa\u2019s exports increased from 0.5% to 4.5% and accounted for 2.5% of French Imports.[5] Though these numbers are not staggeringly high, capital was gained by these colonies. This money, in turn was given back to the French government and would have in part paid for the construction of the Paris Opera House.\n\nColonialism by the French used assimilation tactics to integrate their culture into colonies through infrastructure, architecture, and cultural practice. This was pronounced in France\u2019s Indochinese colonies (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam), taking form in the destruction of historical buildings and replacing them with French styled civic structures such as museums and operas.[6] These actions taken by French colonists sought to erode the existing culture of its colony and assimilate the them with French traditions. It highlights their assumption of their cultural practices being more superior.\n\nOne individual colony directly relates back to Paris and the monumental power envisaged through the Second Empire. At the end of the 19th century in Hanoi, it was decided that a French style Opera was needed and construction began in 1901. These constructions were considered a more intrusive stage of colonization.[7] For the French, the Opera was an \u201cexpression of [their] communal values and prestige\u201d and was \u201cto proclaim the superiority of their culture as well as to demonstrate their allegiance to a distant home.\u201d[8] This was thought to be completed through technological advancement and craftsmanship of their architecture.\n\nThe design of the Opera changed over its decade of construction but the completed building was akin to the Paris Opera house in architectural form, siting, and development of neighbouring roads and buildings. \u201cThe physical presence of theater buildings in combination with the less tangible performances of Opera within embodied the glorious past of the metropole and the triumphant future of the empire.\u201d[9] Colonists developed Hanoi in the style of a contemporary western city which ended up drawing parallels between Paris and Hanoi. These comparisons portrayed Hanoi as the colonial equivalent of Paris.[10] The action of constructing a civic building comparable to that of Paris\u2019 Opera codifies the Imperial Power of France in its colonized regions and postulates the legacy of the Paris Opera in a very tangible way.\n\nFigure 6: Hanoi\u2019s Opera House viewed from the northest corner\n\nOpened in 1911, the Hanoi Opera House shares many of the architectural components from the Paris Opera House. The most prominent resemblance is the main entrance where both share a similar arcaded base, recessed covered upper floors and two symmetrical cupolas. The Hanoi Opera also maintains a similar central dome structure and protruding entries from the sides.\n\n[1] Taylor, Katherine Fischer.

Napoleon III\u2019s political ambitions for the city, country and their international affairs would intend to protect his fascist rule through the Paris Renovation, new civic structures, and colonial domination. Garnier\u2019s Opera, exuding luxury and superior culture, would become the major beacon in Napoleon III and Haussmann\u2019s newly renovated Paris; acting as a prototypical symbol for the Second Empire\u2019s Imperial Power.\n\nBibliography\n\nUrban Contingency and the Problem of Representation in Second Empire Paris\n\nAldrich, Robert. \u201cImperial Mise En Valeur and Mise En Sc\u00e8ne: Recent Works on French Colonialism.\u201d The Historical Journal 45, no. 4 (2002): 917-36.\n\nBenjamin, Walter. \u201cParis, Capital of the Nineteenth Century\u201d (Expos\u00e9 of 1935).

In contrast with the other form of opera, which is sung throughout, the role of this opera house was to stage pantomimes and parodies of opera through song interspersed with spoken drama, giving rise to its own genre of performance and eponymous name, Op\u00e9ra Comique. Listed on the register of national theaters in 2005, the venue now stages both operatic performances and plays and its repertoire encompasses all genres, extending from Baroque to contemporary music. Similar in architectural style to the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, it has the advantage of being smaller in size and, thus, more artist-friendly.

To everyone\u2019s astonishment, in 1860 the honor of constructing the opera house was awarded to the winning bid by the young, 35-year-old, up and coming architect, Charles Garnier. Visitors to the opera house are immediately awed by the impressive Versailles Hall of Mirrors and grandiose staircase that welcomes them to the foyer.

Mesmerizing music and top-tier vocal artistry that transcend the ordinary, vibrant costumes tell stories and plays, and art in every form guarantees a magical experience.\n\nThe first opera house in Egypt dates back to the second half of the 19th century, when Khedive Ismail initiated its construction on the occasion of the inauguration of the Suez Canalin 1869 .\n\nSwayed by the splendor of European richness, the Khedivial Opera House was constructed in six months by Italian architect, Pietro Avoscani in the Azbakeya district in Old Cairo.\n\nIsmail commissioned Ascovani to design a small-scale replica of Milan\u2019s magnificent opera, Teatro alla Scala.\n\nIn honor of the Khedivial Opera Houses\u2019s opening in November 1869, Ismail welcomed world royalty and elites to attend Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s Rigoletto performance.\n\nVerdi was a famous Italian composer, best known for his operas. When Verdi was commissioned to perform, he initially was going to perform one of the most popular operas, Opera Aida. It was unfortunately not ready by the time of the Opera House\u2019s inauguration; however, Opera Aida was performed two years later in 1871.\n\nThe limestone building, which seated 850 people, was later renamed the Royal Opera House in the 1930s. In the wake of the 1952 Revolution, it was renamed once again to remove any reference to the monarchy. It simply became the Opera House.\n\nThe Opera House was the first in Africa, where famous world opera and symphonic masterpieces were performed.\n\nFrom the day it opened, the Opera House did not lose its charm or splendor until it burned down in 1971. The majority of the structure was made of wood, which made it vulnerable and not durable enough to withstand extreme conditions.\n\nThe finery, elegance, and superior musical art epicenter was re-inaugurated on 10 October in 1988, with the construction of the cr\u00e8me building housed in Zamalek, known as the Cairo Opera House.\n\nThe Cairo Opera House became a cultural center that hosts and attracts a myriad of performances until this day: it is divided into a main hall, a small hall, and an open air theater. The main hall is designed to seat 1300 people, and mainly lends its stage to symphonic concerts and performances. The small hall and the open theater see light music concerts, art salons, dance recitals, and special performances.\n\nThe grandeur of its past was never lost, only renewed. Some argue that it was impossible to beat the 19th-century splendor of the Khedivial Opera House; however, the latter\u2019s character is loved \u2013 a true bastion of musical and fine arts.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter"}, {"url": "https://www.musicapalazzo.com/en/history-of-opera-in-venice/", "page_content": "In 1636 an extraordinary fact bound to change the history of opera occurred in Venice: the Tron family obtained the permission from the Council of Ten to rebuild the San Cassian Theatre (burnt in a fire). It was no longer a theatre for comedies and the family was allowed to turn it into an opera house.\n\nThe theatre was rebuilt in less than a year and inaugurated in 1637: for the first time in the history of the music drama a public opera house with fee was created.\n\nIt was so successful that soon other 16 Theatres were built and during the following century Venice boasted its enviable primacy for being the City of Opera par excellence in all Europe.\n\nBetween the opening of San Cassiano Theatre and the opening of the last theatre of the century, the San Giovanni Grisostomo in 1678, more than 150 operas were performed.\n\nFrancesco Cavalli and Crespi, as well as Monteverdi, are some of the most important composers in Venice.

But it\u2019s widely accepted that Monteverdi\u2019s L\u2019Orfeo, first staged in Mantua in 1607, was the first great example of an opera. Though music and dance had played a significant part in plays from Ancient Greece onwards, the concept of presenting wholly sung drama did not develop until much later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story is older than Monteverdi. Opera\u2019s immediate predecessor can be found in the plays that entertained the House of Medici in 16th-century Florence, where acts were divided by increasingly elaborate musical \u2018intermedi\u2019, and it was for a Florentine audience that Jacopo Peri\u2019s Dafne, widely regarded as the first ever opera, was performed in 1598.\n\nWhat distinguished Dafne, plus his Euridice that followed a couple of years later, was the use of recitative, by which the action is narrated in a sung form \u2013 to quote Peri himself, recitative was \u2018a harmony surpassing that of ordinary speech but falling so far below the melody of song as to take an intermediate form\u2019.\n\nPeri had collaborated on Euridice with his court rival Giulio Caccini, who in 1602 produced his own opera of the same title. Setting texts by Rinuccini, Peri and Caccini drew on Greek myth for their subjects as, of course, did Monteverdi for L\u2019Orfeo. Peri, however, used a modest ensemble of instruments, whereas Monteverdi had much grander ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop image of Jacopo Peri is by Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/prince-honore-iii-one-of-the-longest-reigns-in-european-history-en/", "page_content": "Everybody knows that the reign of French King Louis XIV, \u2018Le Roi Soleil\u2019, was the longest in European history. Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://www.unofficialroyalty.com/honore-iii-prince-of-monaco/", "page_content": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n\u00a9 Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nHonor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco is the longest-reigning sovereign of Monaco but the French Revolution had dire consequences for his family and caused the Principality of Monaco to be annexed to France from 1793 until the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814.

Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques; Credit \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nBecause of the poor relationship of his maternal grandparents, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques decided to live in France. They spent their time between Jacques\u2019 mansion in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France where the de Goyon de Matignon family chateau, Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon, was located. Honor\u00e9 was mostly raised at the French court under the supervision of Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine, the wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, King Louis XIV\u2019s legitimized son by his official mistress Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan.\n\nOn February 20, 1731, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s maternal grandfather Antonio I, Prince of Monaco died and his mother Louise-Hippolyte was now the Sovereign Princess of Monaco. Louise-Hippolyte had a very short reign of ten months. Several weeks before Christmas of 1731, a smallpox epidemic spread through the Mediterranean coastal areas. Louise-Hippolyte died from smallpox at the age of 34, on December 29, 1731.\n\nUpon Louise-Hippolyte\u2019s death, her husband Jacques was now the legal guardian of their ten-year-old eldest son Honor\u00e9 and had a plan. Jacques should rule as Prince of Monaco until Honor\u00e9 reached his twenty-fifth birthday. At that time, Honor\u00e9 would abdicate in favor of his father following the example of sons who gave up to their fathers land they had inherited through their mothers. Although the plan was initially accepted, it met with increasing opposition.\n\nFinally, in May 1732, Jacques handed over the rule of Monaco to his brother-in-law Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi, an illegitimate son of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco. Jacques\u2019 official abdication date was November 7, 1733, but he had long since returned to Paris with his eldest son who was now technically Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco. Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi became Governor-General of Monaco, was the de facto ruler of Monaco from 1732 until he died in 1784, and ably served as regent for more than fifty years for his nephew Honor\u00e9 III. Honor\u00e9 resided at his father\u2019s Paris home the H\u00f4tel de Matignon and spent much time at the French court at the Palace of Versailles. His father Jacques lived the remainder of his life in France, dying aged 61, on April 23, 1751, at his Paris home, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon.\n\nAs Colonel of the Regiment of Monaco, part of the French army, Honor\u00e9 III took part in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 \u2013 1748) and was wounded at the 1746 Battle of Rocoux and then at the 1747 Battle of Lawfeld. Honor\u00e9 had close ties to the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. In 1756, Honor\u00e9 decreed that Monaco would be ceded to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty was to die out.\n\nOver the years, Honor\u00e9 III had declined many marriage proposals. In 1755, a marriage was proposed between 35-year-old Honor\u00e9 and 18-year-old Maria Caterina Brignole, daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi. Maria Caterina\u2019s parents came from two of the most powerful families in the Republic of Genoa. Her paternal grandfather Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, 5th Marquis of Groppoli had been Ambassador of the Republic of Genoa to France. Two of her paternal uncles were Doges of the Republic of Genoa. Maria Caterina\u2019s maternal grandfather Francesco Maria Balbi also had been a Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had previously been the lover of Maria Caterina\u2019s mother but wished to marry to provide an heir to the throne of Monaco. However, Maria Caterina\u2019s father opposed the marriage because of Honor\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation and because of his fear that Honor\u00e9 might inherit his fortune. In 1756, only after the intervention of King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour did Maria Caternina\u2019s father consent to the marriage.\n\nThe wedding of Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina was to occur on July 5, 1757, in Monaco, and it got off on a bad foot. Maria Caterina traveled to Monaco by boat accompanied by a contingent of Genovese nobility. When they arrived, Honor\u00e9 did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. He said his status as a monarch demanded that Maria Caterina come to him. The Genovese contingent refused, saying that Maria Caterina was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa. The ship was stranded offshore for several days while a bridge was built between the port and Maria Caterina\u2019s ship. Honor\u00e9 and Maria Caterina walked towards each other at the same distance and met each other over the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina had two sons:\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9\u2019s death, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for Honor\u00e9 III and his family. The Grimaldi family lost all aristocratic privileges in France and was dispossessed of their French property. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was arrested and imprisoned in Paris. Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 (IV) was also arrested as were Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s wife Louise d\u2019Aumont and his son Florestan. Honor\u00e9 (IV) was released after fifteen months in prison and his wife and son were saved by their family doctor.\n\nThe last victims of the Reign of Terror on their way to the guillotine \u2013 Among them was Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s daughter-in-law Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul\n\nThe wife of Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s other son Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e. His wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was eventually released from prison. He died soon afterward in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. At 59 years, the reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco. Following the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 IV, aged 56 and in ill health since his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, returned to Monaco where he reigned as Sovereign Prince until his death in 1819.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It was Napoleon, in fact, who initially introduced modern European theatre to the country.\n\nBefore this, the only forms of entertainment that were similar to theatrical performances were puppet shows, pantomimes and jesters, which took place in public places.\u00b9\n\nThese performances, which were improvised acts that used masks in the style of the Italian commedia dell\u2019arte, dealt with satirical themes that were mainly related to the social conditions of the less well-off classes. It was with the construction of the first theatre halls by the French that the public began to sit, for the first time, alongside the Egyptian, Greek and Italian Francophone aristocracy.\n\nBefore the construction of the Cairo Opera House, the only descriptions of European theatre performances in Egypt are those that were described by the writer Rifa\u2019a Rafi\u2019 al-Tahtawi who, like many other Egyptians at the time, had studied in Paris in order to broaden his knowledge in a modern country such as France and had had the opportunity to frequent some of the most important French opera houses of the time.\u00b2\n\nTahtawi describes the theatre and the opera as the greatest entertainment he had ever witnessed, saying that \u201cif there were not so many Satanic leanings in the French theatre, it would have to be considered an institution with highly beneficial virtues\u201d.\u00b3\n\nIn 1834, the governor, Muhammad Ali Pasha, considered to be the founding father of modern Egypt, was so struck by Tahtawi\u2019s account that he ordered him to start teaching the fundamentals of European theatre in schools.\n\nThe occupation of Egypt by Napoleon and, subsequently, the Western-inspired modernising policies pursued by Muhammad Ali Pasha both fostered a rapid spread of a \u201cEuropean culture of modern theatre\u201d in Egypt: \u201cit was the European theatre, performed in French or Italian, that was paramount and was given precedence by the authorities, not the nascent Arabic theatre\u201d.\u2074\n\nFrom the 1840s, the amount of performances of European theatre increased significantly, \u201caudiences [being] particularly fond of lighter works: operettas, comedies, farces and vaudevilles\u201d.\u2075\n\nThe first documented performance of an Italian lyric opera in Egypt was Donizetti\u2019s L\u2019elisir d\u2019amore, which was staged in Alexandria in 1841. Ricci\u2019s Chiara di Rosenberg, Lucia di Lammermoor by Donizetti and I Puritani di Scozia by Bellini followed in 1842.\n\nItalian theatre had such a presence in the city that a set of regulations, written in Italian, was released by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and circulated by the local authorities.\u2076\n\nPietro Avoscani, an architect from Livorno who took refuge in Alexandria after participating in Giuseppe Mazzini\u2019s Giovine Italia (Young Italy) movement, made significant contributions to the promotion of Italian opera in Egypt. In fact, he oversaw, at his own expense, the production of three operas in 1841: Gemma di Vergy by Donizetti, Ernani by Verdi and Rossini\u2019s Barbiere di Siviglia, which were put on at the palace at Gabari and were received enthusiastically by Muhammad Ali Pasha.\u2077\n\nIn July 1856, Avoscani organised a big public celebration at the Palace at Gabari, where operas, dramas, ballets and gymnastics were staged over the course of three days.\u2078\n\nA year later, together with other Italians, he asked for permission to build a theatre in the Italian style and organised a contest for its design, which was won by the Florentine architect Mariano Falcini.\n\nThis project was never realised, but in 1862 Etienne Zizinia, the powerful Greek consul general for Belgium, commissioned Avoscani to design a theatre to be built near the Rosetta Gate in Alexandria. Avoscani\u2019s building was very similar to the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.\n\nIn contrast with the Scala\u2019s Neoclassical style he used terracotta decorations, typical of Milanese buildings of the Risorgimento period, perhaps to celebrate the accomplishment of his patriotic ideals after Italian Unity was proclaimed in 1861. Although the city contained other theaters, it was his Zizinia Theater that marked the line of the road to the Rosetta Gate as a main urban axis of the European quarter, along which consulates and villas came to be built a few years later.\u2079\n\nFor a long period the Zizinia Theatre, inaugurated in 1863, was one of the most prestigious places in Alexandria, which at the time was not only one of the country\u2019s most well-connected cities with the international (particularly Italian) social and economic scenes, but also itself a growing and thriving cultural centre.\u00b9\u2070\n\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre Zizinia\n\nIt is worth noting that the impresario of the Zizinia Theatre until the end of the 1870s was Giuseppe V.W. Malfigianni, a composer of Maltese origins who was also the first impresario of the Royal Opera House in Valletta (Malta), which was inaugurated on October 9, 1866.\u00b9\u00b9\n\nWith a capacity of 2,000, the theatre was operative until 1908, when it was demolished to make room for the construction of a new theatre, the Mohamed Aly Theatre, which was inaugurated in 1921. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the theatre was renamed as the Sayed Darwish Theatre, and is today more commonly known as the Alexandria Opera House.\n\nIn the meantime, Pietro Avoscani continued to have a significant impact on the development of the opera house in Egypt.\n\nAlexandria Opera House\n\nUnder the Khedivate of Egypt of Isma\u2019il Pasha, who ruled between 1863 and 1879, the work begun by Muhammad Ali Pasha to modernise the country continued, with a reform programme inspired by those of major European nations.\n\nIt was during his rule that the French completed the ambitious project of creating the Suez Canal, the artificial channel that allows direct navigation from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, via Egypt itself.\n\nThe Canal was inaugurated with a ceremony in Port Said on November 17, 1869, and was attended by Empress Eugenie of France. A celebratory march, the Egyptischer Marsch by Johann Strauss II, was commissioned specially for the occasion.\n\nKhedivial Opera House\n\nIt was in fact during the celebrations of the opening of the Suez Canal that the Khedive of Egypt, who was impassioned by melodrama (he had studied at the \u00c9cole d\u2019\u00e9tat-major in Paris), decided to build an 850-seat theatre in Cairo within a few months: the Khedivial Opera House (the future Cairo Opera House)."}]}
