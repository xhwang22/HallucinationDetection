{"John Holman also developed the 'Holman Rule' to explain the relative reactivity of different radicals.": [{"url": "https://theconversation.com/how-the-holman-rule-allows-the-house-to-fast-track-proposals-to-gut-government-programs-without-debate-or-much-thought-at-all-198384", "page_content": "The slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives has just voted to give itself a streamlined way to fire civil servants and shut down federal programs it doesn\u2019t like \u2013 outside the standard process of review and debate.\n\nThis method, known as the Holman rule, has been used in the past by both parties to cloak political decisions in the language and process of saving taxpayers money. It was included in a package of rules approved as the House began its business in January.\n\nAs a former acting general counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives and the author of a treatise on congressional procedure, I know that this method has been used in the past to push extreme political agendas through the political process without due consideration for the public interest. And it\u2019s likely to happen again.\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack spoke about the Holman rule\u2019s adoption on the House floor in early January 2023, calling federal officials \u201cunelected bureaucrats, the true, real swamp creatures here in D.C.,\u201d saying they had \u201crun roughshod over the American people without consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday marks our first move, and certainly not our last, to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Simon, public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, sees the Holman rule differently: \u201cIt goes around everything that protects the civil service from political corruption \u2014 not just federal employees but entire agencies. It is precisely for theater and to create chaos and disrupt the operation of federal agencies, including law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n\nThe rule allows House members to transform the normal process of compiling appropriation bills \u2013 normally, lists of amounts of money to be spent \u2013 into vehicles to fire government employees and shut down programs they don\u2019t like.\n\nAnything is ripe for cutting with the Holman rule, from environmental protection agencies to government efforts for human rights to existing programs for addressing sales of semi-automatic weapons.\n\nFast and furious\n\nNormally, such cuts to staff or programs would have to go through an extensive review process, either to restructure or abolish programs.\n\nThat process includes initial drafting of a full-scale bill, subcommittee and full committee hearings and debates, testimony and evidence presented by the president\u2019s administration, press coverage of these steps and adaptation of Congress members\u2019 positions in light of that coverage. Then, votes are held on edits to the bill, known as markups, after which there is a separate committee vote on reporting the bill out to the full House, the drafting of committee report sections by supporters and opponents \u2013 and even more after that.\n\nBut Holman sidesteps that considered process.\n\nIt allows provisions for altering or abolishing programs to be offered to and made a part of appropriation bills, as long as the provision putatively saves money. Under Holman, individual House members offer amendments during full House consideration of a bill on the floor. As long as these amendments cut spending, they are considered proper.\n\nFor example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 created a program to improve the technology infrastructure of the IRS and to hire more auditors to focus on the wealthy and corporations. Estimates are the program will cost US$80 billion over a decade. Proposed changes to that program in legislation that goes the normal route through many hearings might get bogged down in debate.\n\nBut under Holman, a critic of the program could just drop a change into the must-pass part of the appropriations bill that contains spending for Treasury Department operations and kill or alter the program. No one could stop that from happening unless they chose to vote against the entire appropriations bill, which funds that whole department of the government.\n\nSimilarly, the EPA proposes to strengthen regulations limiting the oil and gas industry\u2019s methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. A House critic of the methane-control program could just pop into the appropriations bill containing spending on the EPA a Holman rule provision that either cuts the program head\u2019s salary to $1 or terminates the program altogether.\n\nBipartisan tool \u2013 for a time\n\nHistorically, the Holman rule, named after Rep. William S. Holman of Indiana, wasn\u2019t a tool of only the Republican Party. It was first developed in 1876 when a Democratic House majority faced a Republican president. I wrote about the history of the Holman rule in my book on congressional practice and procedure.\n\nAt the time, the Democratic Party held what would later be called the solid South (today, these areas are usually Republican) and sought to expel Yankee Reconstruction \u2013 and repeal the laws behind it. Democrats adopted the Holman Rule to get those repeals of law past President Grant.\n\nThe Holman rule could be, and was, put to diverse uses in its early days.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service says, \u201cA broad initial construction of the rule by the House resulted in putting a great mass of general legislation upon the appropriation bills.\u201d\n\nThe Holman rule was used from 1876 to 1895 and again from 1911 to 1983. It was brought back into use by the GOP in 2017. When Democrats took over the House in 2019, they dropped it.\n\nIn one notable attempt in 2017, House Republicans were angry about evaluations of proposed legislation by staff of the nonpartisan Budget Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office. So, they used the Holman rule to try to abolish that division and move its employees to another part of its parent agency, making the proposal in a wider budget allocation bill.\n\nHolman allowed disgruntled Republicans to rush their proposal onto the House floor, instead of going through slower, more deliberative processes of examining whether the Budget Analysis Division was fulfilling its mission. The vote to eliminate the division failed, but, significantly, the use at that time of the Holman rule was promoted by the same faction of the Republican party, the Freedom Caucus, that has advocated for using the rule now.\n\nGreasing the skids\n\nThere are a number of situations that could lead current House Republicans to use the Holman rule.\n\nFirst, House Republican leaders may need to unify their party to pass controversial appropriation bills in the face of anticipated unanimous Democratic resistance. Allowing Holman amendments to be proposed by members with extreme views may get needed legislative support from the fringe of the caucus.\n\nHouse passage of provisions to cut or wipe out programs and whole agencies has two effects. House Republicans can demoralize agency employees who do not know whether to take jobs elsewhere or stay. And House passage may presage passage by the whole Congress.\n\nAn attempt by the Senate Democratic majority to kill a House-passed Holman rule provision when it considers legislation sent over from the House would need 60 votes to move ahead. That would require votes from almost a dozen Republican members, which may not be possible to get.\n\nAn appropriations bill that contains Holman provisions would then go to conference, which is a temporary committee made up of House and Senate legislators and formed to reconcile differences in legislation passed by both chambers. Senate Democrats may go along, even with objectionable Holman or other provisions, to get buy-in from all the factions of the House Republican party needed for passage of the appropriations bill and avoidance of a government shutdown.\n\nWhich brings us full circle to where the Holman rule started, with the southern Democrats\u2019 aim to force through House provisions that Republican President Ulysses S. Grant did not want.\n\nWould President Joe Biden veto all the appropriation bills that have any Holman rule-passed provisions?"}, {"url": "https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-Holman-Rule/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "page_content": "Historical Highlights\n\n\n\nAbout this object Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nOn this date in 1876, by a vote of 156 to 102, the U.S. House of Representatives first adopted the Holman Rule that sought to institutionalize reductions in government spending through changes in House rules of operation. Proposed by the \u201cwatchdog of the Treasury,\u201d Representative William S. Holman of Indiana, it modified House Rule 120 which prohibited appropriations \u201cfor any expenditure not previously authorized by law.\u201d The only exceptions concerned public works in progress and contingency funds\u2014generally applied as salary raises for government workers. The Rules Committee reported a change to Rule 120 that would allow legislative language in relevant appropriations bills to cut federal outlays. Holman explained that the Appropriations Committee held the authority under Rule 120 to increase spending, and now \u201cwe shall be able to retrench expenditures.\u201d Opponents to the new rule, such as former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio, warned that Appropriations would gain \u201csuch a general sweeping power\u201d as \u201cto render obsolete the power of all the other committees of the House.\u201d Iowa\u2019s John A. Kasson feared that the committee could replace the priorities of the authorization committees with its own. The House then proceeded to adopt the Rules Committee report. That the vote was along party lines indicated the majority\u2019s expectations that the change would arm them in their upcoming battles with a Senate and President of the opposite party."}, {"url": "https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_(Vollhardt_and_Schore)/20%3A_Carboxylic_Acid_Derivatives/20.1%3A_Relative__Reactivities%2C_Structures%2C_and__Spectra__of_Carboxylic_Acid__Derivatives", "page_content": "Objectives After completing this section, you should be able to compare the reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives with nucleophiles to the reactions of aldehydes and ketones with nucleophiles. arrange a given list of carboxylic acid derivatives in order of increasing or decreasing reactivity towards nucleophiles. explain the difference in reactivity towards nucleophiles of two or more given carboxylic acid derivatives. explain why esters and amides are commonly found in nature, but acid halides and acid anhydrides are not.\n\nStudy Notes The general nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, and its mechanism, were discussed earlier in \u201cIII. General Reactions of Carbonyl Compounds.\u201d Review if necessary. The reading describes the relative reactivities of \u201cbiologically relevant acyl groups.\u201d Both acid anhydrides and acid halides readily react with water and cannot exist for any length of time in living organisms. The following scheme illustrates the relative reactivities of most carboxylic acid derivatives that you will encounter.\n\nCarboxylic acid derivatives and acyl groups The functional groups that undergo nucleophilic acyl substitutions are called carboxylic acid derivatives: these include carboxylic acids themselves, carboxylates (deprotonated carboxylic acids), amides, esters, thioesters, and acyl phosphates. Two more examples of carboxylic acid derivatives which are less biologically relevant but important in laboratory synthesis are carboxylic acid anyhydrides and acid chlorides. The carboxylic acid derivatives can be distinguished from aldehydes and ketones by the presence of a group containing an electronegative heteroatom - usually oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur \u2013 bonded directly to the carbonyl carbon. You can think of a carboxylic acid derivative as having two sides. One side is the carbonyl group and the attached alkyl group: this is called an acyl group (in the specific case where R is a methyl group, the term acetyl group is used). One the other side is the heteroatom-containing group: in this text, we will sometimes refer to this component as the \u2018acyl X' group (this, however, is not a standard term in organic chemistry). Notice that the acyl X groups are simply deprotonated forms of other functional groups: in an amide, for example, the acyl X group is an amine, while in an ester the acyl X group is an alcohol. Example 21.2.1 What is the \u2018acyl X\u2019 group in: an acid anhydride? a thioester? a carboxylic acid? Solution\n\nThe nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction The fact that the atom adjacent to the carbonyl carbon in carboxylic acid derivatives is an electronegative heteroatom \u2013 rather than a carbon like in ketones or a hydrogen like in aldehydes - is critical to understanding the reactivity of these functional groups. Just like in aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acid derivatives are attacked from one side of their trigonal planar carbonyl carbon by a nucleophile, converting this carbon to tetrahedral (sp3) geometry. In carboxylic acid derivatives, the acyl X group is a potential leaving group. What this means is that the tetrahedral product formed from attack of the nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon is not the product: it is a reactive intermediate. The tetrahedral intermediate rapidly collapses: the carbon-oxygen double bond re-forms, and the acyl X group is expelled. Notice that in the product, the nucleophile becomes the new acyl X group. This is why this reaction type is called a nucleophilic acyl substitution: one acyl X group is substituted for another. For example, in the reaction below, one alcohol X group (3-methyl-1-butanol) is replaced by another alcohol X group (methanol), as one ester is converted to another. Another way of looking at this reaction is to picture the acyl group being transferred from one acyl X group to another: in the example above, the acetyl group is being transferred from 3-methyl-1-butanol to methanol. For this reason, nucleophilic acyl substitutions are also commonly referred to as acyl transfer reactions. When the incoming nucleophile in an acyl substitution is a water molecule, the reaction is also referred to as an acyl hydrolysis. For example, the following reaction can be described as the hydrolysis of an ester (to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol). We could also describe this reaction as the transfer of an acyl group from an alcohol to a water molecule. In a similar vein, the hydrolysis of an amide to form a carboxylic acid could be described as the transfer of an acyl group from ammonia (NH 3 ) to water. As we will see in later sections of this chapter the hydrolysis of esters and amides are particularly important reaction types in biochemical pathways. When your body digests the fat in a hamburger, for example, enzymes in your pancreas called lipases first catalyze ester hydrolysis reactions to free the fatty acids (we'll look more closely at this reaction in section 12.4D)."}, {"url": "https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/339671204", "page_content": "Hofmann\uff08\u970d\u592b\u66fc\uff09\u89c4\u5219\uff08Hofmann's Rule\uff09\n\n\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u7406\u94fe\u63a5\uff1ahttp://chem.kingdraw.cn/Shortlink?id=20200714140519\n\n\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u6307\u5728\u56db\u7ea7\u94f5\u76d0\u4e0e\u78b1\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u6240\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u8131\u53bb\u4e00\u5206\u5b50\u80fa\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u5e94\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u751f\u6210\u7684\u70ef\u70c3\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5e26\u6709\u8f83\u5c11\u53d6\u4ee3\u57fa\u7684\u70f7\u57fa\u30021881\u5e74\u7531A.W.von\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u624e\u4f0a\u91c7\u592b\u89c4\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u89c4\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56db\u7ea7\u94f5\u78b1\u52a0\u70ed\u5206\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u70ef\u70c3\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff1b\u624e\u4f0a\u91c7\u592b\u89c4\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9187\u8131\u6c34\u6216\u5364\u4ee3\u70f7\u8131\u5364\u5316\u6c22\u751f\u6210\u70ef\u70c3\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\n\n\u916f\u70ed\u89e3\u4e5f\u670d\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u8981\u53cd\u5e94\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9075\u5faaHofmann\u89c4\u5219\u3002\n\n\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u89c4\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u5206\u5b50\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u53cc\u5206\u5b50\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u53cd\u5f0f\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u4f53\u79ef\u5927\u7684\u79bb\u53bb\u57fa\u56e2\uff08\u4e09\u7ea7\u80fa\u57fa\uff09\u4e0e\u03b2-\u0397\u6b63\u5904\u4e8e\u76f8\u53cd\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u5411\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u3002\n\n\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u5e94\u5f80\u5f80\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u624e\u4f0a\u91c7\u592b\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u76f8\u53cd\u6027\u6b63\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5404\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u624e\u4f0a\u91c7\u592b\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u89c4\u5219\u5374\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u5173\u3002"}, {"url": "https://budgetcounsel.com/cyclopedia-budgetica/cb-holman-rule-of-the-h-ouse-of-representatives/", "page_content": "Holman Rule\n\nSummary\n\nThe Holman Rule is a rule in the United States House of Representatives that allows amendments to appropriations legislation that would reduce the salary of or fire specific federal employees, or cut a specific program.

Res. 5 (115th Congress) on a temporary basis, in clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House.

History of clause 2 of rule XXI.\n\nThe 25th Congress in 1837 was the first to adopt a rule prohibiting appropriations in a general appropriation bill or amendment thereto not previously authorized by law, in order to prevent delay of appropriation bills because of contention over propositions of legislation. In 1838 that Congress added the exception to permit unauthorized appropriations for continuation of works in progress and for contingencies for carrying on departments of the Government. The rule remained in that form until the 44th Congress in 1876, when William S. Holman of Indiana persuaded the House to amend the rule to permit germane legislative retrenchments. In 1880, the 46th Congress dropped the exception that permitted unauthorized appropriations for contingencies of Government departments, and modified the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d to define retrenchments as the reduction of the number and salary of officers of the United States, the reduction of compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or the reduction of the amounts of money covered by the bill. That form of the retrenchment exception remained in place until the 49th Congress in 1885, when it was dropped until the 52d Congress in 1891, and then reinserted through the 53d Congress until 1894. It was again dropped in the 54th Congress from 1895 until reinserted in the 62d Congress in 1911 (IV, 3578; VII, 1125).\n\n\u201cHOLMAN RULE\u201d ON RETRENCHING EXPENDITURES\n\n\u00a71062. Legislation reducing expenditures.\n\nDecisions under the so-called \u201cHolman Rule\u201d in clause 2 of rule XXI have been rare in the modern practice of the House. The trend in construing language in general appropriation bills or amendments thereto has been to minimize the importance of the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d in those cases in which the decision can be made on other grounds. The practice of using limitations in appropriation bills has been perfected in recent years so that most modern decisions by the Chair deal with distinctions between such limitations and matters that are considered to be legislation (see \u00a7\u00a71053\u20131057, supra). Under the modern practice, the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d only applies where an obvious reduction is achieved by the provision in question and does not apply to limiting language unaccompanied by a reduction of funds in the bill (July 16, 1979, pp. 18808\u201310). It has no application to an amendment to an appropriation bill that does not legislate but is merely a negative limitation citing but not changing existing law (June 18, 1980, p. 15355).\n\nA paragraph containing legislation reported in an appropriation bill to be in order must on its face show a retrenchment of a type that conforms to the requirements of the rule (Mar. 17, 1926, p. 5804).\n\nThe reduction of expenditure must appear as a necessary result, in order to bring an amendment or provision within the exception to the rule. It is not sufficient that such reduction would probably, or would in the opinion of the Chair, result therefrom (IV, 3887; VII, 1530\u20131534). Thus, an amendment to a general appropriation bill providing that appropriations made in that act are hereby reduced by $7 billion, though legislative in form, was held in order under the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d exception (Apr. 5, 1966, p. 7689), but an amendment providing for certain reductions of appropriations carried in the bill based on the President\u2019s budget estimates was held not to show a reduction on its face and to provide merely speculative reductions (Deschler, ch. 26, \u00a75.6; June 24, 1992, p. 16110). An amendment authorizing the President to reduce each appropriation in the bill by not more than 10 percent was ruled out as legislation conferring new authority on the President (May 31, 1984, p. 14617; June 6, 1984, p. 15120). An amendment reducing an unauthorized amount permitted to remain in a general appropriation bill is in order as a retrenchment under this clause (Oct. 1, 1975, p. 31058). An amendment to a general appropriation bill denying the availability of funds to certain recipients but requiring Federal officials to make additional determinations as to the qualifications of recipients is legislation and is not a retrenchment of expenditures where it is not apparent that the prohibition will reduce the amounts covered by the bill (June 26, 1973, p. 21389).\n\nThe amendment must not only show on its face an attempt to retrench but also must be germane to some provision in the bill even though offered by direction of the committee having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the amendment (VII, 1549; Dec. 16, 1911, p. 442). An amendment providing that appropriations \u201cherein and heretofore made\u201d shall be reduced by $70 million through the reduction of Federal employees as the President determines was held to be legislative and not germane to the bill, because it went to funds other than those carried therein, and was therefore not within the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d exception (Oct. 18, 1966, p. 27425).\n\nAn amendment reducing an amount in an appropriation bill for the Postal Service and prohibiting the use of funds therein to implement special bulk third-class rates for political committees was held in order because not specifically requiring a new determination and because constituting a retrenchment of expenditures even if assumed to be legislative (July 13, 1979, pp. 18453\u201355).\n\nAs long as an amendment calls for an obvious reduction at some point in time during the fiscal year, the amendment is in order under the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d even if the reduction takes place in the future in an amount actually determined when the reduction takes place (for example, by formula) (VII, 1491, 1505; July 30, 1980, pp. 20499\u201320503). To an amendment that is in order under the \u201cHolman Rule,\u201d containing legislation but retrenching expenditures by formula for every agency funded by the bill, an amendment exempting from that reduction several specific programs does not add further legislation and is in order (July 30, 1980, pp. 20499\u201320503).\n\nA motion to recommit the District of Columbia appropriation bill with instructions to reduce the proportion of the fund appropriated from the Federal Treasury from one-half, as provided in the bill, to one-fourth of the entire appropriation is in order, because the effect of the amendment if adopted would reduce the expenditure of public money although not reducing the amount of the appropriation (VII, 1518).\n\nThe term \u201cretrenchment\u201d means the reduction of the amount of money to be taken out of the Federal Treasury by the bill, and therefore a reduction of the amount of money to be contributed toward the expenses of the District of Columbia is in order as a retrenchment (VII, 1502).\n\nAn amendment proposed to an item for the recoinage of uncurrent fractional silver, which amendment struck out the amount appropriated and added a provision for the coinage of all the bullion in the Treasury into standard silver dollars, the cost of such coinage and recoinage to be paid out of the Government\u2019s seigniorage, was held not to be in order under the rule; first, because not germane to the subject matter of the bill (the sundry civil); second, because it did not appear that any retrenchment of expenditure would result, the seigniorage being the property of the Government as other funds in the Treasury (VII, 1547).\n\nTo an item of appropriation for inland transportation of mails by star routes an amendment was offered requiring the Postmaster General to provide routes and make contracts in certain cases, with the further provision \u201cand the amount of appropriation herein for star routes is hereby reduced to $500.\u201d A point of order made against the first or legislative part of the amendment was sustained, which decision was, on appeal, affirmed by the committee (VII, 1555).\n\nTo a clause appropriating for the foreign mail service an amendment reducing the appropriation, and in addition repealing the act known as the \u201csubsidy act,\u201d was held not in order because the repealing of this act was not germane to the appropriation bill; and that to be in order both branches of the amendment must be germane to the bill (VII, 1548).\n\nA provision in the agricultural appropriation bill transferring the supervision of the importation of animals from the Treasury to the Department of Agriculture is out of order, being a provision changing law and not retrenching expenditure (IV, 3886).\n\nWhere a paragraph containing new legislation provides in one part for a discharge of employees, which means a retrenchment, and in another part embodies legislation to bring about the particular retrenchment that in turn shows on its face an expenditure the amount of which is not apparent, the Chair is unable to hold that the net result will retrench expenditures. However, where the additional legislation does not show on its face an additional expenditure, the Chair will not speculate as to a possible expenditure under the additional legislation (VII, 1500).\n\nAs explained in the annotation in \u00a71043, supra, the amendment of clause 2(b) in the 98th Congress narrowed the \u201cHolman Rule\u201d exception to the general prohibition against legislation to cover only retrenchments reducing amounts of money covered by the bill, and not retrenchments resulting from reduction of the number and salary of officers of the United States or of the compensation of any person paid out of the U.S. Treasury. Accordingly, the Chair held out of order an amendment mandating the reduction of certain Federal salaries and expenses as not confined to a reduction of funds in the bill (June 17, 1994, p. 13422). Paragraph (b) also eliminated separate authority conferred upon legislative committees or commissions with proper jurisdiction to report amendments retrenching expenditures, and permitted legislative committees to recommend such retrenchments by reduction of amounts covered by the bill to the Appropriations Committee for discretionary inclusion in the reported bill. Paragraph (d) as added in the 98th Congress provides a new procedure for consideration of all retrenchment amendments only when reading of the bill has been completed and only if the Committee of the Whole does not adopt a motion to rise and report the bill back to the House. Other decisions that involved interpretation of the \u201cHolman Rule,\u201d but which do not reflect the current form or interpretation of that rule, are found in IV, 3846, 3885\u20133892; VII, 1484, 1486\u20131492, 1498, 1500, 1515, 1563, 1564, 1569; June 1, 1892, p. 4920.\n\n\u201cHolman Rule\u201d\n\nAlthough congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding, House rules provide for exceptions in certain circumstances. One such circumstance allows for the inclusion of legislative language in general appropriations bills or amendments thereto for \u201cgermane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.\u201d This exception appears in clause 2(b) of House Rule XXI and is known as the Holman rule, after Representative William Holman of Indiana, who first proposed the exception in 1876.\n\nSince the period immediately after its initial adoption, the House has interpreted the Holman rule through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. Under current precedents, for a legislative provision or amendment to be in order, the legislative language in question must be both germane to other provisions in the measure and must produce a clear reduction of appropriations in that bill.\n\nIn addition, the House has also adopted a separate order for the first session of the 115th Congress that provides that retrenchments of expenditures by a reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill shall be construed as applying to:\n\nany provision or amendment that retrenches expenditures by\u2014\n\n(1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill;\n\n(2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or\n\n(3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\n\nThis report provides a history of this provision in House rules and an analysis of precedents that are illustrative of its possible application.\n\nSection-by-Section from the 115th Congress for H. Res. 5\n\nSection 3. Separate Orders\n\nHolman Rule. Subsection (a) provides a new standing order for the first session of the 115th Congress based on the \u2018\u2018Holman Rule,\u2019\u2019 most of which was removed from the standing rules in 1983. This standing order functions as an exception to clause 2 of rule XXI to allow provisions changing law in certain limited circumstances. Under this order, a provision in a general appropriation bill or an amendment thereto may contain legislation to retrench expenditures by (1) reducing amounts of money in the bill, (2) reducing the number or salaries of Federal employees, or (3) reducing the compensation of any person paid by the Treasury. To qualify for treatment under this order, an amendment must be offered after the reading of the bill and must comply with all applicable rules of the House, such as the germaneness rule. The purpose of this provision is to see if the reinstatement of the Holman rule will provide Members with additional tools to reduce spending during consideration of the regular general appropriation bills.\n\nReference\n\nCRS \u2013 Holman Rule (House Rule XXI, Clause 2(b)) (R44736) January 13, 2017\n\n\u201cHow a 141-year-old rule could revolutionize the budget process\u201d (The Hill) May 17, 2017"}, {"url": "https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/2017/01/30/heres-why-the-holman-rule-is-good-its-not-because-it-cuts-spending/", "page_content": "Could there be a way in one simple resolution to increase the ability of Members of Congress to participate in the legislative process and cut spending? The House of Representatives voted to provide itself a way to do that on the very first day of the 115th Congress.\n\nOn the first day of each new Congress, the House adopts a set of rules (commonly called a \u201crules package\u201d) that governs debate for the next two years. Earlier this month, the House voted to restore a version of the Holman Rule, which provides a way for Members to offer amendments cutting spending from appropriation bills on the Floor. This has caused controversy because opponents say it will be used to threaten the livelihood of government workers.\n\nWhen reading about the Holman Rule in The Washington Post, one gets the sense that people think the House could not cut the pay of government workers or their salaries before it adopted the rules package on Tuesday, January 3. The problem with this understanding is that, even before the Holman rule was reinstated, in modern practice, there were few procedural hurdles to cutting salaries or positions to begin with. So we\u2019ll try to explain what the rule is and actually how important it is. Generally, it is important less because of the potential for spending cuts and more because it is a sign that the House is serious about following processes as laid out in its standing rules.\n\nWhat is the Holman Rule?\n\nThe Holman Rule, named for Rep. William Holman of Indiana (pictured above), permits Members to offer amendments cutting funds from spending bills under certain conditions. Since its adoption in 1876, it has been variously reformed or repealed. According to Deschler\u2019s Precedents (a precedent in the House is a ruling from the Speaker or the Chair of the Committee of the Whole in a prior case that is binding or highly influential in determining the parliamentary ruling on similar procedural motions with similar facts), from 1911 until 1983, the Holman Rule was the bolded, second sentence of House rule XXI clause 2, which read:\n\nNo appropriation shall be reported in any general appropriation bill, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law, unless in continuation of appropriations for such public works and objects as are already in progress. Nor shall any provision in any such bill or amendment thereto changing existing law be in order, except such as being germane to the subject matter of the bill shall retrench expenditures by the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States, by the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill: Provided, That it shall be in order further to amend such bill upon the report of the committee or any joint commission authorized by law or the House Members of any such commission having jurisdiction of the subject matter of such amendment, which amendment being germane to the subject matter of the bill shall retrench expenditures.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated rule, so here is an explanation of it.\n\nThe House has long distinguished between authorization bills and appropriations bills. Authorization bills set policies for government programs and agencies. Appropriations bills provide funds to carry out the provisions of the authorization bills. According to a traditional analogy, an authorization bill is like a pitcher, and when Congress authorizes, it determines how big to make the pitcher and what shape it should be. When Congress appropriates, it determines how much water to pour into that pitcher.\n\nIn theory, all funds must be authorized before they are appropriated. To ensure that appropriations bills are not held up by contentious policy debates, \u201clegislative\u201d language, i.e., policy provisions, should not be included in appropriations bills, nor should an appropriation bill contain an appropriation that has not been previously authorized. (An appropriation that has not been authorized is known as an \u201cunauthorized appropriation.\u201d) The first part of Rule XXI clause 2 attempts to ensure that Congress maintains the authorization-appropriation distinction when it says that the House may not consider any \u201cgeneral\u201d appropriation bill or amendment containing \u201cfor any expenditure not previously authorized by law\u201d. (The first part of Rule XXI clause 2 is not part of the Holman Rule, even though they are listed together. The first part predates the Holman Rule.)\n\nThe Holman Rule itself comes after the general prohibition on unauthorized appropriations. It restates the general authorization-appropriation distinction by noting \u201cany provision in any such [appropriation] bill or amendment thereto changing existing law\u201d is impermissible. The rest of the Holman rule, however, permits provisions that would normally be considered \u201clegislative\u201d if they \u201cretrench\u201d spending (a retrenchment is a parliamentary term for cutting government spending). But such retrenchments must fall under one of a handful of categories. Permissible provisions are those that would cut:\n\nThe numbers of \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d and how much they are paid;\n\nOr the pay of \u201cany person paid out of the Treasury\u201d more generally;\n\nOr funds listed in the appropriation bill itself (\u201camounts of money covered by the bill\u201d).\n\nAccording to Deschler\u2019s Precedents, in 1983, the House eliminated the provisions permitting cuts to the numbers and pay of those in the employ of the government. Left intact was the third point, that the House could cut funds from the bill.\n\nOne important requirement of the Holman Rule is that the retrenchment amendment must be germane. The rule of germaneness\u2014one of the House\u2019s oldest parliamentary principles\u2014requires that amendments be related to the bill. It allows the House to remain focused on one topic at a time. For the Holman Rule, it would mean, in a simplified example, that a Member could not offer an amendment cutting spending for the Department of Education when the House is debating its Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n\nFurthermore, rule XXI applies to \u201cany general appropriation bill\u201d. \u201cGeneral\u201d is a critical qualifier. Not every law that appropriates money is a \u201cgeneral appropriation bill\u201d. The 12 appropriations bills that the Congress should pass as part of the budget process are examples of general appropriations bills. Continuing resolutions are examples of bills that are not general appropriations. In theory, continuing resolutions should only be temporary, stopgap spending measures Congress passes as it tries to pass the normal full-year appropriations bills, but in recent years, Congress has simply used these instead. This distinction is critical because rule XXI, which includes the Holman rule, does not apply to non-general appropriations bills, including continuing resolutions.\n\nThe newest version of the Holman rule resembles the form as it existed before 1983. Earlier this week, the House basically readopted the rules from the 114th Congress, with some modifications. One modification was that, anytime clause 2 of rule XXI speaks of permitting retrenchment amendments, it specifically includes amendments that cut spending, the number of Federal Government officers and their salaries, or pay drawn from the Treasury in general.\n\nOne noteworthy aspect of this rule change is that it is only in force for the first session of the 115th Congress. This suggests that the House is going to test how it works, and then revisit the issue in a year. If the House finds that the rule is worth keeping, extending it for the rest of the Congress is a simple task and could be done by a simple majority vote. If the House does not find the rule useful, it can simply let it expire.\n\nDid adopting the Holman Rule provide the House a power it hasn\u2019t had since 1983?\n\nNot exactly.\n\nArticle I section V of the U.S. Constitution grants each Chamber \u201cmay determine the Rules of its Proceedings\u201d. This is a wide grant of authority for either Chamber to do business as it sees fit. The practice of the modern House is such that if a majority wants to pass almost any kind of legislation, it can do so quite easily. The House can adopt what is known as a special rule, which lays out the terms of debate for a bill. For instance, a special rule can determine how long the House will debate a bill or whether Members can offer amendments. A special rule is a simple resolution that the House Rules Committee reports, and it is adopted if a simple majority of Members vote in favor of it. If a majority of Members votes for a special rule, there are remarkably few restrictions on how the House can organize its debate.\n\nSince there are few procedural mechanisms to limit special rules, theoretically speaking, in the recent past, the Chamber could easily have adopted legislation slashing salaries and eliminating positions, regardless of other House rules. One way the House could have done that is by waiving rule XXI. As mentioned above, rule XXI prohibits legislative provisions in general appropriations bills, and the Holman Rule presents several exceptions to rule XXI. If the House had wanted to cut salaries or positions in an appropriations bill, it could waive rule XXI through a special rule. Additionally, a special rule could specifically permit\u2014\u201cmake in order\u201d\u2014amendments that cut spending and government employees, notwithstanding any other rules of the House. In truth, because of its wide rule-making authority, if the House had wanted to, it could have \u201cholmaned-up\u201d the entire Federal Government several times over already. This is not to say the Senate would have passed such legislation or that the President would have signed it; it is unlikely the Senate or President would accept deep spending cuts. But in terms of parliamentary procedure, there were few obstacles to legislation cutting spending or positions before the House re-adopted the Holman Rule.\n\nIf the House has could cut spending all along, why was there the Holman Rule to begin with and why did it last so long?\n\nWhen adopted, the Holman Rule would have been an efficient way for cutting spending. As a reminder, in theory, appropriations bills should not contain provisions making policy, and Congress has a rule to ensure this; the Holman Rule is an exception to the rule against policy provisions in appropriations. This exception was procedurally expedient since the House then didn\u2019t use modern special rules to set the terms of the debate, waive rules of the House, provide for the consideration of amendments, etc.\n\nThe modern Rules Committee, which drafts special rules to govern debate, was not established as a permanent panel until 1880, four years after the Holman Rule was adopted. According to Hinds\u2019 Precedents, which contain rulings of the presiding officer from 1789 through 1907, the first simple-majority special rule was adopted in 1883. Prior to that, waiving rules was more difficult, and adopting the Holman Rule as part of the standing rules would have made it easier to cut spending. Even after special rules became a feature of the legislative process, leaving the Holman Rule in place would have still permitted Members to offer amendments cutting spending and positions if a special rule did not affect how rule XXI operates.\n\nSince the House can use special rules to set how the House debates, is the Holman Rule is a meaningless redundancy?\n\nAbsolutely not. As indicated above, if a special rule does nothing to affect rule XXI, the Holman Rule is still in force and Members can use it as they please. But more importantly, readopting this rule is a sign that the legislative process is evolving. Including this reform suggests that the House Republican leadership is serious about respecting House rules and procedure. Many have criticized how the House regularly waives its rules. If leadership intended to use special rules to achieve the same effects as the Holman rule, there would be no need to adopt it in the first place. And if it intended to ignore the rule in the first place, there would have been no need to make it a year-long trial-run. So, its inclusion in the rules package for the 115th Congress is a sign that the House is working to adhere more closely to its rules and that Floor processes will be more \u201copen\u201d, allowing Members to participate more fully in shaping legislation when it is debated in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. Appropriations bills have traditionally been considered under an open special rule (i.e., one that allows amendments)\u2013 and restoring the Holman rule suggests Speaker Ryan intends to follow that tradition. Adopting this rule is a step towards a more inclusive, more robust legislative process.\n\nHow will the Holman Rule affect the authorization process?\n\nWe need more time to see, but it will be interesting.\n\nIn theory, the House should set policy in the authorization process, not through appropriations. The Holman Rule is an exception to the general principle that there should be no legislative provisions in appropriations bills. This has led some to suggest reviving the Holman Rule will undercut the authorization process. As Rep. Tom Cole pointed out in April 2016, Holman-rule amendments could affect \u201chow agencies and programs are staffed, structured and compensated\u2014things that are directly under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees and involve permanent changes in law.\u201d\n\nMaybe the Holman Rule will weaken the authorization process, but there is perhaps another way that it could help. Approximately a third of the money Congress appropriates is unauthorized. Since the Holman Rule permits Members to offer amendments cutting spending, the House can use this rule to eliminate unauthorized spending (and even spending that is authorized, for that matter). This, however, would be an incidental side effect of the Holman Rule and not its primary purpose, as it was not adopted as a way of fighting unauthorized appropriations. In fact, if Members used the Holman Rule to offer amendments stripping unauthorized funds from bills it would be ironic, since, on the face of it, the Rule tends to weaken the procedural distinction between the authorization and appropriations processes.\n\n(At this point, however, it must be noted that the principal way of eliminating unauthorized appropriations is by raising a point of order on the Floor, per the first part of rule XXI clause 2. If rule XXI is not waived, when debating a bill with unauthorized appropriations, a Member could raise an objection against such funds.)\n\nAlthough the Holman Rule may not help the authorization process much, the House did adopt another less-remarked upon reform as part of the rules package. For some time now, the standing rules have required committees to submit oversight plans to the Committee on House Administration and the Committee on Government and Oversight Reform. The House added to this requirement by requiring committees to draft authorization plans. A committee\u2019s authorization plan should identify which programs or agencies in its jurisdiction received unauthorized appropriations in the previous fiscal year, which of these entities will the committee intends to authorize in the current and next Congress, and other details. Approximately a third of the money Congress appropriates is unauthorized, so systematically authorizing the Federal Government will challenge Congress, but requiring authorization plans indicates that the House is ready to take on that task.\n\nWill the Holman Rule have any other effects?\n\nAs much as progressives have complained about the reinstatement of the Holman Rule, there could be a way to use it to their advantage. Democrats will undoubtedly oppose Trump Administration initiatives, so they can use the Holman Rule to offer amendments that would try to prevent him from carrying out his plans. Conservatives can also benefit. Some on the right have asked for greater opportunities to cut spending and shape legislation on the Floor. This rule provides another means for them to amend legislation and leaves the decisions on these matters to the House as a whole, rather than congressional leaders.\n\nThe new rules about authorization plans and the Holman Rule should be seen as part of a regularly needed exercise in evaluating what rules and procedures are necessary or expedient to conduct the country\u2019s business. Reviewing, removing, and adopting rules are important for the evolution and reform of the Congress. With the re-instituted Holman Rule and new authorization plans, let\u2019s see how House develops in the 115th Congress.\n\nMark Strand is the President of the Congressional Institute and Timothy Lang is the research director.
