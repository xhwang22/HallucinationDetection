Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.\n\nWith speeds that can reach over 90 mph, luge is one of the most dangerous sports at the Olympic Games.\n\nAccidents and injuries are common during competition.\n\nTwelve years ago, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died before the Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics after losing control of his sled on a training run and hitting a steel pole that was unpadded.\n\nThe International Luge Federation conducted an investigation where they determined that human error was the cause of the deadly training run crash. While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport. Austria\u2019s 22 total luge medals are the most in Olympic history for a non-German country.\n\nGerman Natalie Geisenberger is the two-time defending Olympic champion in women\u2019s singles entering Beijing and has continued her dominance in the sport with four world championship medals since the last Winter Olympics."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-sports-georgia-beijing-canada-b842754aa238d98066d2eeaee33d8dff", "page_content": "FILE - Saba Kumaritashvili of Georgia poses for a photo before speeding down the track during a men's race at the 52th FIL Luge European Championships in Sigulda, Latvia, Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021.

(AP Photo/Sandra Skutane, File)\n\nLuge is Saba Kumaritashvili\u2019s family business. His great-grandfather is credited with bringing the sport to their homeland, the former Soviet republic of Georgia, more than a half-century ago. His father runs the national federation, as his relatives have for decades.\n\nAt home, his family is synonymous with sliding.\n\nAt the Olympics, his family is synonymous with sadness.\n\nHe qualified for the Beijing Games with hopes of changing that.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since his cousin, Nodar Kumaritashvili, died in a training accident at the Vancouver Games, a death that still haunts the sport, especially so every four years when the Olympics roll around and the memories get rekindled. Nodar was 21 when he would have made his Olympic debut; Saba is 21 now, about to make his Olympic debut.\n\nPut simply, Saba slides for his country. For his family. And for Nodar.\n\n\u201cEvery generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.\u201d\n\nIt is that strength that got him here, even while he knows that some in his family are nervous whenever he takes the ice because of what happened to his cousin.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili was killed Feb. 12, 2010, after losing control of his sled during a training run just hours before the Vancouver Games officially opened. He would have raced the next day, becoming the first in his family to compete on sliding\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nHis cousin now has that chance.\n\n\u201cI am happy and proud that I have opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said. \u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me. It\u2019s really big motivation, so I will try to do my best for them.\u201d\n\nThat is what Nodar Kumaritashvili was trying to do 12 years ago.\n\nThe crash happened at 10:50 a.m. on a Friday, with most people already turning their attention to the opening ceremony taking place that night. The Whistler, Canada, track has 16 curves, and Nodar Kumaritashvili appeared to lose control around the 13th turn. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces, which sent him careening along the ice-covered walls of the track. The last impact with one of those walls knocked him off his sled and sent him flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nHis body sailed over the wall of the track near the finish line, the back of his head striking a metal post outside of the track. Rescue workers got to him within seconds to no avail. He was pronounced dead after 59 minutes of resuscitation efforts, though a coroner\u2019s report later revealed his head injuries were so traumatic that he died instantly.\n\nHis last recorded speed was 89.4 mph (143.9 kph), which almost certainly was the fastest of his career. Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2014 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. ... I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident. An accident. These things happen in life and it\u2019s awful, but we can either live in fear from it or learn from it, grow from it and keep going. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s an excellent story.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with luge is believed to go back to at least the early 1970s when Aleko Kumaritashvili \u2014 \u201cmy great-grandfather laid the foundation for this sport,\u201d Saba said \u2014 oversaw the building of a short training track. Soviet officials helped build a more complete track around 1973, and Aleko Kumaritashvili served as the country\u2019s coach.\n\nIt has been part of the family makeup ever since. Saba and Nodar took similar paths to the Olympics; both were introduced to the sport by their family as kids, then got into international sliding and did enough to qualify for the Games despite not having World Cup circuit experience.\n\nSaba insists he is ready.\n\n\u201cI look at his story as what the Olympics are all about,\u201d Niccum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what life is about. It\u2019s what every motivational story there is talks about. It\u2019s perseverance. Forgetting about the past, the fears of the past, the tragedies of the past and looking forward, not living in fear or letting anything slow you down.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2022/02/06/1078592886/a-beijing-olympic-luge-racer-honors-his-cousin-who-died-at-the-vancouver-games", "page_content": "A Beijing Olympic luge racer honors his cousin who died at the Vancouver Games\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 When Saba Kumaritashvili took to the ice at the Yanqing sled-racing venue in the mountains near Beijing on Saturday he was facing some of the best lugers in the world.\n\nHe was also facing a tragedy that has haunted his family for 12 years.\n\nAt the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Kumaritashvili's cousin Nodar was on a training run at a track built in Whistler, British Columbia.\n\nIn the final turn, going nearly 90 mph, he flipped off his sled, over the wall and into a steel post outside the track.\n\nNPR reported at the time that the death of the 21-year-old luger from the Republic of Georgia left Olympic officials \"in deep mourning\" and \"heartbroken beyond words.\"\n\nSaba Kumaritashvili, also now 21-years-old, said despite the loss, luge racing remains an important family tradition.\n\n\"I think about Nodar.

It will draw attention to complaints from other competitors about a facility that has stretched the boundaries of safety in what is already a dangerous sport. \"We are not crash-test dummies,'' an Australian competitor said on Thursday.\n\nYet if these are issues for the lawyers somewhere down the line, more immediate questions may be asked by the Canadians of themselves, who, in pursuit of their own Olympic dream \u2013 30 medals at least, with as many golds as possible \u2013 appear to have forgotten that national \u00adcharacteristic for which they are best known: politeness.\n\n\"Some say what defines us/is something as simple as please and thank you/and as for you're welcome/well we say that too,'' wrote Shane Kozycan in \"We Are More\", a poem he delivered during the opening ceremony.\n\nIn normal times perhaps, but in the run-up to these games, the hosts \u2013 or at least the Canadian Olympic Committee \u2013 seemed to have mislaid their manners. \"Own the podium,\" it implored its athletes in an initiative aimed at ensuring the host nation finishes at the top of the medals table at these games. Money has been poured into training, while a hard-edged approach has been adopted in dealing with other teams, most noticeably in granting them only limited access to facilities such as the sliding track.\n\nSuch behaviour is within the Olympic rules, but it came across as distinctly un-Canadian at the time, and in the context of Friday's death it seemed like a terrible misjudgment. Steven Holcomb of the US bobsleigh team said: \"This track is one of the fastest and most difficult in the world, so I think keeping it closed and not letting people have access\u2026 made it very difficult. Then you have Olympic ice, which is even faster. Little mistakes become big mistakes, and big mistakes end in tragedy.''\n\nKumaritashvili was one of those who had relatively limited experience on the track. He spent a week there in November during training, according to reports, and had gone down the track 26 times in total. He had crashed once, as had the double Olympic champion, Armin Z\u00f6ggeler of Italy.\n\n\"It would be speculation if I said the time period of practice was sufficient or was not,'' said Georgia's minister of sport Nikolos Rurua, before defending the luger against suggestions that he was inexperienced \u2013 or simply not good enough \u2013 to be competing at Olympic level. Rurua said: \"He was a very progressive, strong athlete. It was his wish to compete at the Olympics, and he underwent a rigorous qualifying process. He was 44th in world rankings.\"\n\nYet if the formalities of Olympic diplomacy required the minister to leave it at that, so sparing the feelings of the hosts, Holcomb felt no such compunction. \"They limited the amount of access and training time we had on the track, while they let Canadians train on it as much as they wanted,\" he said. \"There were smaller nations that have never been down here before. It is kind of unfair and now it is a tragedy.''

Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2013 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. \u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident. An accident. These things happen in life and it\u2019s awful, but we can either live in fear from it or learn from it, grow from it and keep going. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s an excellent story.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with luge is believed to go back to at least the early 1970s when Aleko Kumaritashvili \u2013 \u201cmy great-grandfather laid the foundation for this sport,\u201d Saba said \u2013 oversaw the building of a short training track. Soviet officials helped build a more complete track around 1973, and Aleko Kumaritashvili served as the country\u2019s coach.\n\nIt has been part of the family makeup ever since. Saba and Nodar took similar paths to the Olympics; both were introduced to the sport by their family as kids, then got into international sliding and did enough to qualify for the Games despite not having World Cup circuit experience.\n\nSaba insists he is ready.\n\n\u201cI look at his story as what the Olympics are all about,\u201d Niccum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what life is about. It\u2019s what every motivational story there is talks about. It\u2019s perseverance. Forgetting about the past, the fears of the past, the tragedies of the past and looking forward, not living in fear or letting anything slow you down.\u201d\n\nOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

The new scientific findings from a leading expert on sports biomechanics may now finally explain why Kumaritashvili was thrown off the track.\n\n\"The forces that were applied to the right runner of the sled, early in the interaction with this rounded fillet, provided very large vertical forces,\" says Mont Hubbard, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of California in Davis.\n\n\"And those are the forces required to shoot, to give him upward velocity and to allow him to pass over the wall.\"\n\nThe fillet, as Hubbard calls it, is the curved joint of the track where the sidewall meets the floor.\n\nThe Georgian athlete's luge sled hit the fillet at the inside wall at the end of the last curve after coming down high from the outside wall.\n\nHe was travelling at a speed of 144 kilometres an hour.\n\nWatch Watch the fifth estate documentary, The Last Race on Friday. It airs on CBC-TV at 9 p.m. (9:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador).\n\nThe official explanation from the International Luge Federation has always been that a \"catapult\" effect launched him out of the track, that his sled compressed and then acted like a spring.\n\nHubbard says Kumaritashvili's sled did compress, but after he acquired the vertical velocity for launch.\n\n\"He was already essentially launched,\" says Hubbard. \"When the catapult happened, he already had that velocity, and it was caused by running up on the fillet and \u2014 yep, vertical forces.\"\n\nFirst scientific analysis\n\nHubbard's research, to be published in the international journal Sports Engineering, is the first scientific analysis of the deadly crash that was the low point of the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe B.C. coroner's report makes no conclusion how Nodar Kumaritashvili's luge sled was ejected from the Whistler track. Eric Foss/CBC News\n\n\"I waited for the FIL [International Luge Federation] report to see what their explanation of the event was going to be. When it was a non-explanation, in some sense, that's when I decided to model the interaction of the luge with the fillet,\" says Hubbard \"Because the amazing thing is that this accident was on video, and you can't not see that the right runner is interacting with the fillet, it's right there in front of your eyes.\"\n\nThe publishing of Hubbard's research comes on the heels of the December release of the Whistler safety audit, which was recommended by the Coroners Service of British Columbia in its report into the death of Kumaritashvili.\n\nSection 5.5.4.3 of the audit says it did evaluate Kumaritashvili's crash and \"analysis was conducted to identify the interaction that resulted in the vertical velocity motion of the slider.\"\n\nBut Hubbard says that analysis of vertical velocity is not in the safety audit, and it should be.\n\n\"And that's a glaring absence, I think. Given the fact that accident is the reason the audit happened,\" says Hubbard.\n\n\"That was not the intent of the study,\" says Alex Zahavich of SAIT Polytechnic in Calgary, the principal investigator on the safety audit in an interview with the fifth estate's Bob McKeown.\n\n'For the audit not to have it in the main body of its report, some precise, careful description of how that ejection happened is curious.'\u2014Prof. Mont Hubbard\n\n\"We were not there to determine what happened because that is the assignment of the cause of the accident, that would be determined by the coroner.\"\n\nBut the coroner's report makes no conclusion how Kumaritashvili's luge sled was ejected from the track.\n\nIn his call for the safety audit, the coroner specified that it should address the possibility of \"sleds leaving the track\".\n\n\"For the audit not to have it in the main body of its report, some precise, careful description of how that ejection happened is curious,\" says Hubbard.\n\nThe International Luge Federation declined to be interviewed by the fifth estate about the role of the fillet in Kumaritashvili's crash. The organization instead directed CBC News to its online rule book, where there is no mention of fillets.\n\n\"I believe the fillet is the proximate cause of ejection,\" says Hubbard. \"Because if the fillet hadn't been there, I believe ejection could not possibly have happened because there isn't any way to get the vertical velocity you need without that fillet. There's simply no way.\"\n\nWatch the fifth estate documentary, The Last Race on Friday.

It also raises disturbing questions about the purpose and consequences of the whole Olympic enterprise.\n\nThe Olympic establishment was predictably quick to close ranks and blame the victim. On the day following the accident the International Olympic Committee and the International Luge Federation (FIL) issued a joint statement. They listed the luger\u2019s \u201cerrors\u201d on his final run and stated that \u201cThe technical officials of the FIL were able to retrace the path of the athlete and concluded there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track.\u201d\n\nThe statement deliberately misses the point. Luge is an inherently dangerous sport, with about 3 percent of competitive runs ending in crashes. There will always be \u201cerrors\u201d leading to accidents. They should not lead to death.\n\nThe credentials of the track designers could not be more impeccable. The original design was by Udo Gurgel, responsible for the design of six previous Olympic tracks. Detailed plans were drawn up by Stantec Architecture, who performed the same function for the 2002 Winter Olympics. The design team clearly had the knowledge and experience to deliver according to the expectations of their clients.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy several commentators have noted that a track does not have to be faster to be more challenging. And yet it seems unlikely that the decision makers behind the Vancouver Games would have been content with building the world\u2019s most technically interesting track. They wanted the world\u2019s fastest. And that is what they got.\n\nAthletes have been privately and publicly expressing concerns about the safety of the track ever since it opened. Curve 13 was nicknamed \u201cCurve 50/50,\u201d reflecting the perceived chances of negotiating it successfully. Defending world champion Armin Zoeggeler of Italy was among those who crashed during practice, while Romanian Violeta Stramaturaru was knocked unconscious and had to withdraw. Australia\u2019s Hannah Campbell-Pegg commented: \u201cI think they are pushing it a little too much. To what extent are we just little lemmings that they just throw down a track and we\u2019re crash-test dummies? I mean, this is our lives.\u2019\u2019\n\nGiven the unprecedented speed of the track, elementary safety considerations should have dictated extended practice times to familiarize athletes with the challenges they were facing. This is especially true for athletes from smaller, poorer countries, who inevitably have less exposure to cutting-edge track design than their more affluent colleagues.\n\nKumaritashvili, according to the Wall Street Journal, \u201ctold his father he was terrified of the track before doing the run that killed him.\u201d\n\nThe ugly reality is that Canadian authorities stringently restricted practice runs to boost their team\u2019s \u201chome-field advantage.\u201d Canadian athletes were given nearly 10 times as many runs as non-Canadians.\n\nThe preferential training arrangements for Canadian athletes did not apply to the sliding events alone. A major row erupted in 2009 when US skaters were denied access to the Olympic skating facilities in Richmond, BC. The story has been the same across the spectrum of sporting events.\n\nThrown on the defensive, Canadian officials insisted that they have stuck to the letter of Olympic regulations and have behaved no worse than every other host country before them.\n\nThat may very well be true. Unfortunately, the opening ceremonies told the world that Canadians were \u201cdifferent\u201d (meaning, \u201cdifferent\u201d from their neighbours to the South), because they were more polite, more tolerant and just plain nicer.\n\nBut Max Gartner of Alpine Canada did not sound \u201cpolite\u201d or \u201cnice\u201d when he said, \u201cThere are a lot of resources getting spent on making this training possible. This is a Canadian advantage we are not going to give away.\u201d\n\nCanadian luger Ian Cockerline commented regretfully, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s money invested. It\u2019s really what it comes down to at the end of the day, I suspect.\u201d\n\nCockerline suspects correctly.\n\nThe \u201cOwn the Podium\u201d program was launched in 2005 with the explicit goal of enabling Canada to finish at the top of the medal standings in the 2010 Winter Olympics. A total of $120 million CAD has been raised from government and corporate sources and lavished on selected athletes perceived as potential medal winners. Coaches, physiotherapists, GPS systems, neuro-feedback transmitters\u2014no expense has been spared.\n\nTo finish on top of the medal standings, Canada will need about 35 medals. A preliminary report estimated that without the \u201cOwn the Podium\u201d funding Canada would \u201conly\u201d win 16 medals. In order to win those extra medals, Canadian government and business together are spending $6 million CAD per medal.\n\nNo wonder they won\u2019t let anyone play on their ice.\n\nIt should be noted that programs like \u201cOwn the Podium\u201d are now standard for Olympic hosts. Australia spent $135 million AUD on its Gold Medal Plan for the 2000 Sydney Games. Beijing spent huge sums to little effect on Project 119 to boost its 2008 results in events where it had traditionally been weak. The UK\u2019s Mission 2012 will raise \u00a3300 million to cover its athletes in glory in London two years from now.\n\nBut even as countries like Canada are spending unprecedented sums on their elite athletes, the health of their general population is declining dramatically. The Public Health Agency of Canada says, \u201cOver the past several years, Canada has experienced an alarming increase in obesity rates among adults, children and youth.\u201d The agency estimates that as many as a quarter of all Canadians may be dangerously overweight.\n\nObesity is a complex condition with multiple causes, but lack of exercise and poor diet are significant contributing factors. Poverty, long and irregular working hours do not help either. Underlying all the complexities, however, is the simple fact of the corporate control of public sports. In the profit-driven sporting model, there is no place for the huge majority of the population as participants. The only role for the masses in this scenario is as passive consumers.\n\nThe peak of physical condition attained by the elite few finds its reflection in the physical debilitation of the many.\n\nGiven that what is perceived as meaningful participation in sports is only open to a small, well-rewarded elite, competition at every level becomes more intense and less \u201csporting.\u201d Reports of fathers coming to blows with referees at their eight-year-old\u2019s hockey game are just one sad manifestation of this trend. Those who succeed in joining the ranks of the sporting elite are aware of the fragility of their position and are careful to do nothing that will offend the officials and sponsors who control their careers.\n\nProfessional athletes are only too aware that, as far as the sports business is concerned, they are indeed \u201cjust little lemmings that they just throw down a track.\u201d\n\nNone of which has dampened the enthusiasm of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the Olympics. In a speech before the British Columbia legislature last Thursday, Harper called on Canadians to stop being \u201cthe least bit shy or embarrassed\u201d about their patriotism. He admitted that \u201cboisterous displays of nationalism, we tend to associate with others\u201d (meaning \u201cour neighbours to the South\u201d), but then, leading by example, he unrolled a large Canadian flag and chanted, \u201cGo, Canada, Go!\u201d\n\nLast December, Harper prevailed on the Governor General to close down parliament for three months. His obvious motive was to put an end to increasingly uncomfortable questions about the complicity of Canadian troops in the torture of Afghan detainees. Harper has been transparently calculating that the Olympic Games and the $120 million medal bonanza would induce patriotic fervour across the nation. This would translate into unquestioning support for \u201cour\u201d soldiers in Afghanistan and threaten to tar the opposition parties as unpatriotic if they persisted in asking awkward questions.\n\nThe federal government has invested heavily in \u201cOwn the Podium.\u201d No less than his corporate partners, Mr. Harper expects to get his money\u2019s worth. He needs a good medal haul to get his domestic agenda back under control and enhance Canada\u2019s prestige going into the G20 negotiations this summer.\n\nDespite the official platitudes (and the wishes of the vast majority of spectators and participants) the Olympic Games take place in the poisonous atmosphere of global rivalry between nations and corporations. The increasing violence of international conflict and the growing contempt of the ruling elites for human life will inevitably make themselves felt. Tragedies like the death of Nodar Kumaritashvili are the unhappy result."}]}
