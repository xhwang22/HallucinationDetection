Having caught Sky (Sinead McCafferty) and the alien boy Man (Bug Hall) agent Josh Myron (C. Thomas Howell) learns that due to mankind Earth is doomed and he must find a way to prove to Sky that mankind are worth saving or else they will wipe mankind out.\n\nLet me take you back to December 2008 when the big sci-fi remake \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" starring Keanu Reeves was about to hit the big screens across the globe. Well 3 days before its release The Asylum released \"The Day the Earth Stopped\" a movie despite having been written by Darren Dalton, Carey Van Dyke, and Shane Van Dyke was remarkably similar to \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" with aliens, big robots, the world facing destruction unless someone can prove mankind is worth saving. Yes \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" is one of those mockbusters which The Asylum seemed to specialise in.\n\nWhat \"The Day the Earth Stopped\" also has is the low production values which many have come to expect from some thing The Asylum would make. As such the special effects are poor, the dialogue is basic and the acting feels like those involved were handed a rough idea what a scene was going to be just before they were to shoot it and then made it up as they went. It doesn't work and whilst at times entertaining for the wrong reasons, Judd Nelson showing up for a few scenes with a cheesy grin being a highlight, this is mostly a waste of time.\n\nWhat this all boils down to is that \"The Day the Earth Stopped\" is a bad movie and no matter how much I would love to tell you that it is enjoyably bad I simply can't. Beyond a few amusing scenes there is little in \"The Day the Earth Stopped\" to warrant you spending time watching it."}, {"url": "https://letterboxd.com/film/the-day-the-earth-stopped/", "page_content": "The Asylum strikes again!\n\nC. Thomas Howell continues to peddle a 'career', if you can call it that, that still seems to be trading on 'The Hitcher'. Here he stars and directs this The Day The Earth Stood Still knock-off that replaces 'Canoe Reeves' with an actress clearly not bothered about starting a film completely nude.\n\nFrom there its downhill in a film that doesn't seem to care about explaining anything let alone how Judd Nelson can get billing so far up the bill for less than 5 minutes work, but then I suppose if it's good enough for Dame Judy Dench its good enough for dear old Judd.\n\nAvoid at all costs unless there really isn't anything else to watch or your really really pissed!"}, {"url": "https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/9786/day-the-earth-stopped-the-2008/", "page_content": "Day the Earth Stopped, The (2008)\n\nReviewed by The Foywonder\n\nStarring C. Thomas Howell, Sinead McCafferty, Bug Hall, Jeff Ellefson, Judd Nelson\n\nDirected by C. Thomas Howell\n\nThe Day the Earth Stopped is the mockbuster that prompted Fox to send their lawyers after The Asylum. Nothing came of it though. In retrospect, The Asylum probably should have sued Fox instead for putting out a film so bad it could potentially hurt interest in their mockbuster. After sitting through the anger-inducing affront to human intelligence that was the remake of \u201c>The Day the Earth Stood Still (review) this past weekend, I found myself thinking that this might be one of the rare instances where an Asylum mockbuster proves to be truly superior to its big screen counterpart. After watching Stopped, well, let\u2019s just call it a tie.\n\n666 colossal robots from outer space have begun landing all over the Earth. 666 is a good round number, no? Government authorities refer to them as \u201cmegaliths\u201d, a word typically used to describe gigantic stone monuments of prehistoric times. This led me to suspect that the original script idea was not to make these megaliths look like Robotjox but since the movie its mockbustering boasts a giant robot\u2026 Why do I suspect this? Leave it to The Asylum to make a movie featuring gargantuan robots that just stand there and do nothing. If attacked they\u2019ll fire laser beams at their attackers, but other than that \u2026. nada. Might as well just been giant stone monoliths instead.\n\nThe impoverished nature of the budget shows quite often though the special effects work on the megaliths is fairly decent. Again, that\u2019s probably because they just stand there almost completely motionless the entire film. Even when they fly off into space all we see are static shots of the robots lifting straight up without any kind of rocketry or visual trickery. Ever see the \u201cPoochie\u201d episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d when they animators killed Poochie by just having a single animation cell rise up out of the frame? Practically the same effect here.\n\nAt the same time, in some woods on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a naked alien woman struts about looking more like she just stepped out of the pages of Penthouse, not a spaceship. Now in this aspect I have to give the film credit for being vastly superior to the film it\u2019s ripping off \u2013 both versions. Michael Rennie and Keanu Reeves vs. a perfectly sculptured naked redhead; guess which wins in my book?\n\nArmy guy C. Thomas Howell (who also directed, badly) brings her to a nearby army base where they put clothes on her but make sure she\u2019s still wearing a very tight white top. She informs him the human race is to be wiped out because of our destructive ways. The megaliths are emitting a sonic wave that will cause the earth\u2019s core to stop spinning; hence the movie\u2019s title.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how stopping the earth\u2019s core from spinning could kill us, might I advise you go add The Core to your Netflix queue. Better yet, don\u2019t. No need to add this one, either.\n\nWe are to be exterminated by the end of the day unless we, and by we I mean C. Thomas Howell (the fate of the world resting in the hands of Soul Man does not comfort me), can convince her of humanity\u2019s humanity. Enter United States government agents looking to torture and interrogate her, scoffing mightily at the very notion of proving humanity\u2019s essential goodness. What? No mustaches to twirl?\n\nThere\u2019s also a second alien, a male, who upon getting captured sits in his jail cell explaining to other government scientists what\u2019s going on and why for the rest of the movie. Pointless.\n\nHowell\u2019s fellow \u201cBrat Pack\u201d friend Judd Nelson also appears ever so briefly in a role so insignificant that it wouldn\u2019t even be appropriate to call it a cameo. More like a favor.\n\nHowell springs the stacked alien babe, and the two roam around the almost completely evacuated city playing gender reversal Starman while being hunted by the authorities. He\u2019ll first try to prove our worth by taking her to church and introducing her to the saving grace of Jesus Christ. This does not convince her. Pat Robertson will be most displeased when he hears about this film.\n\nWhat does eventually convince her of our humanity is something so mundane it makes what convinces Keanu to save us in the remake seem truly profound. I won\u2019t spoil it but here\u2019s a hint: what woman can resist a baby.\n\nBut you, you can resist this latest Asylum snoozefest. The Day the Earth Stopped never even gets started. The only thing that stopped was the pacing. Any attempt at thoughtful science fiction is undermined by the simpleminded mimicry of the script. Any attempt at being exciting is undermined by the almost complete lack of action. Any attempt at being a thriller is undermined by the overall tedium of the events. I can already hear most viewers of the film long before the elongated closing credits roll saying to themselves, \u201cStop the world, I want to get off.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1290471/reviews", "page_content": "1 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nThe Day the Earth Stopped starts as hundreds of huge robots descend from space & land on Earth in hundreds of different locations, the authorities refer to them as 'Megaliths'. Then in Los Angeles a much smaller spacecraft lands & two naked aliens (Sinead MacCafferty & Bug Hall (!?!)) start wandering around, local army dudes including Private Josh Myron (director C. Thomas Howell) set out to capture the aliens which they do. After a while the aliens begin to talk & the woman nicknamed Sky says that the Megaliths have been sent by a distant alien race to wipe out humanity before it becomes a threat or something like that & that in order to stop them she must be shown the nature of humanity & why it must be saved. The evil authorities want to torture & drug Sky which doesn't go down well so Myron breaks her out & takes it upon himself to convince her that humanity is worth saving, well I feel a lot safer already...\n\n\n\nDirected by & starring C. Thmas Howell the IMDb would have you believe The Day the Earth Stopped was a homage to the classic sci-fi film The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) but in actuality it's one of The Aslum's terrible 'Mockbuster' rip-offs, this time it's the big budget remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) with Keanu Reeves & in fact Twentieth Century Fox got their lawyers onto The Asylum but unfortunately they couldn't stop this terrible film from being released which is a shame as it would have saved me 90 odd wasted minutes. The Day the Earth Stopped is an absolutely awful film on every level, the script is terrible with awful character's & dialogue & a story that just makes no sense. If these aliens see us as so much of a threat why not just destroy us, why give us a chance at all? It's never really explained who the model like alien woman is or what power she has & that bloke alien basically does nothing the entire film & I struggle to see hwy he's even there. At 90 odd minutes it drags & is really boring with a predictable & lacklustre plot that has no momentum or excitement. Are we to believe when aliens land & threaten the very existence of all humanity the people trying to solve the problem will amount to about half a dozen soldiers & a guy in a suit? Then there's the supposed moral message about behind all the bad things in the world there's lots of good & we should never forget our humanity which is as subtle as a baseball bat round the head & very heavy-handed in a preaching moralistic sort of way that patronizes & induces tedium in equal measure. This whole film is a mess, it's boring, poorly thought out, moralising in the worse possible way & just plain rotten to sit through.\n\n\n\nIf the story wasn't bad enough there's not even any fun to be had here, there is absolutely zero blood or gore & even when Sky gets shot while wearing a white top not one drop of blood is seen & the part when that woman gives birth in the back of Myron's car is ridiculous as it's got hair, totally clean & that bloke must have been a doctor since the umbilical cord was cut as well, the makers didn't even attempt to make the baby look like a new born child. There's the scene where someone remarks that all the cars have stopped working yet seconds later a car is clearly seen driving past in the background & then there's the usual awful CGI computer effects the least said about the better. Also while trying to save the world from complete destruction by gigantic alien robots the best we have have to work in what looks like an abandoned warehouse with about two computers & one table at their disposal. There are no action scenes, all the aliens look human & apart from a bit of nudity at the start this is PG rated stuff all the way.\n\n\n\nWith the usual low budget of probably about $250,000 this looks awful with rotten CGI effects & terrible production values, the whole thing basically relies on fooling people into thinking they are going to watch the big budget version that came out at the same time & it's just wrong. Filmed in California. The acting is awful & are we really supposed to believe that model like woman is an alien who the very existence of humanity depends? She just looks so wrong for the part it's untrue.\n\n\n\nThe Day the Earth Stopped is a terrible rip-off 'Mockbuster' from The Asylum, a company who quite simply make the worst films around & try to con people into buying or renting them by associating them with bigger better films out at the time. Have they actually made a good film? Watch the original The Day the Earth Stood Still or the remake instead as this is not worth your time."}, {"url": "https://valorguardians.com/blog/?p=14081", "page_content": "Monday night I watched \u201cThe Day the Earth Stopped\u201d featuring those geniuses of the large screen C. Thomas Howell, Judd Nelson, and Sinead McCafferty. I will begin here, as I do each review, with something that the publishers can affix to the back of the work to provide notice about what the lucky purchaser can look forward to enjoying:\n\nPart Independance Day, part that crappy movie where Rosie O\u2019Donnell plays retarded bus rider (easy casting) this movie should not be watched by anyone with a frontal lobe who hasn\u2019t spent the vast bulk of the day sniffing glue and giving themselves scrotal lacerations to dip in lemon juice. There\u2019s the one scene with the hot chick that is redeemable, but alas, they didn\u2019t put that 30 seconds on a loop. I\u2019d find Gary Coleman playing center for the Lakers equally believable as this movie.\n\nNow, how bad was it? Well, I restarted the movie at 4 minutes in to take notes. At 15 minutes I punched out of the note taking, and at 40 minutes I just had to turn it off. It wasn\u2019t even bad-good, like those movies that are so ridiculous that you have to keep watching. It was just Bad-bad, like Ishtar, George Takei\u2019s hair and the Yankees bullpen.\n\nAnyway, here are my notes, fleshed out to be complete sentences.\n\n\u2013 Movie starts with millions and millions of spaceships flying by planets and suns and stuff. They finally arrive at their destination of earth at about the 2 minute mark, at which time you see a close up of the ships, and they are not the same ones that were flying across your screen as they announced to a nearly breathless audience that indeed, C Thomas Howell and Judd Nelson would be a part of this extravaganza.\n\n\u2013 At 2:15 in, a small ship breaks off from the big ships and then lands on Earth.\n\n\u2013 2:30, now we are getting somewhere! For reasons not clearly explained, we now have a naked woman walking through the woods. She looks kinda like Monica Belluci, only with Angelina Jolie\u2019s lips. But, you don\u2019t actually see her face. Well, maybe you do, I don\u2019t know, I was concentrating on how the director let us know that Earth is considerably colder than her home planet. Why the hell is she creeping through the woods? The way she walks is bizarre, it\u2019s like a 4 year old doing the pee pee dance. Whatever, this unknown planet attacking us has some serious smokeshows. The naked pee pee dance walk with D cups endeth and 3 minutes. [Ed Note: this is where they should have looped the film. BTW- Turn the safe search off and do a google search on this chick and you will see the scene, and then you too can ponder what it would be like to be invaded by glass cutters from space.]\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Rainer Hosch\n\n(More after Jump, if you dare)\n\n\n\nOK, so now we start to get the feel for the movie, we get our first look at the protagonists, and sweet merciful spongebob does this thing head south in a hurry.\n\n\u2013 OK, so there is now some Transformers looking dude standing over the city, Humvees come rolling up to a padlocked fence, and out jumps our first soldier. He\u2019s wearing an IBA (modern body armor) only the thing has no plates in it, so he\u2019s not actually defended, and he has on a T-Shirt. His helmet has no cover on it, and (HOLY SHIT NO) he has grendades hanging from the spoon on the front of the armor. He looks like the pimp from Deuce Bigelow.\n\n\u2013 OK, some dude who looks kinda familiar seems to be in charge of this situation, we know that because he pulled out a cigarette and had some little catamite looking dude light his cigarette. And now he is inexplicably taking off his shirt and tie to stand there in a T-shirt. Dude, you couldn\u2019t do that in the humvee?\n\n\u2013 Alien Transformers guy still standing there.\n\n\u2013 Some other dude in the building with the guy in charge is in the restroom trying to wiz, and is coming up with a dry fire. Reminds me of privates on \u201cpiss test day\u201d when Sgt ____ used to say, \u201cdamn you look good. What say you come over later and we have a few drinks together?\u201d Maybe the dude has a kidney problem or something, but this whole movie is like one large prostate exam.\n\n\u2013 Ok, now they are all rolling out the woods and the dude in charge is asking for map \u201c996954\u201d which is a 6 digit grid coordinate with no identifiers. That seems odd, no?\n\n\u2013 OK, now there is a naked dude running through the woods, and the military dudes are tracking him with M16\u2019s and shotguns etc, with flashlights affixed on top like your standard \u201cgear queer\u201d in wanna be military movies. Now dude in charge is saying that they should track the guy via their \u201cinfrared\u201d but not a single dude in this unit seems to have any NODS (Night Observation Device) or anything else with Infrared, and besides, they all have flashlights and the dude is like 7 feet away.\n\n\u2013 They shoot the naked dude with darts, he uses some magic to stun them, runs a bit further, in chage dude hits him with more darts, he passes out into the river. If the guy has these superpowers, how come he goes down like a sack of crap to 2 darts in the neck. And what was the back up plan if he didn\u2019t?\n\n\u2013 OK, back to the naked chick, now standing in the middle of the road. Along comes another military vehicle with Can\u2019t Piss Guy and some other dude who looks like he likes to sit on park benches across from Catholic schools. They apparently assume that this naked broad with the model quality boobs was an innocent bystander to the crash of the alien craft, and that she can\u2019t speak English as a result. Meanwhile, In Charge Guy calls them on the radio and they say they have been delayed, but inexplicably manage to not report that they just picked up a naked broad walking in the middle of the street.\n\n\u2013 OK, so Naked Alien Dude is sedated in the mini-CP out in the woods, and the Can\u2019t Piss Guy and Not So Bright guy roll up in the humvee with the naked chick now bedecked in a military top and no pants. Camera man sucks, cause he never goes below her waist. In Charge Guy is saying that the crashed alien craft was a 2 seater, and they have a naked dude, and he wonders where the other alien has gone to. No one still seems able to notice that the gorgeous naked chick, standing there with a not so bright look on her face, and still seemingly freezing to death, might somehow be related to each other.\n\n\u2013 The two dudes report in, and again fail to mention the naked brunnette who is now like a piece of luggage.\n\nAt this point, I stopped taking notes. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nIf you are in a humvee, and you see a naked chick with gorgeous breasts, I would ask each of you to alert your commander at the first opportunity. Seriously, because you never know what a naked model might auger for your future. As an excercise in military operations, please write me a salute report in the comments here on how to correctly inform higher of what you have going on.\n\nAnd for the love of God, do not see this movie.\n\nCategory: General Whackos"}, {"url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-day-the-earth-stopped-review/", "page_content": "Seeing that Fox has fairly recently released a certain Keanu Reeves film on DV, it seems only fair to look at The Asylum\u2019s take on \u2018the alien coming to earth\u2019 genre and see if it\u2019s any good.\n\nLarge robots are appearing around the earth and governments are obviously alarmed and confused by their intentions. A crack unit is assembled in Los Angeles to combat this, then suddenly two pods land just outside the LA area. Terminator style, both aliens are naked and are soon picked up by the unit. Now the nakedness of actress Sinead McCaffety and Bug Hall is not really a plot point but an excuse to see McCafferty topless and bum shots of Hall. Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your point of view, this is the last \u2018nudey\u2019 shots and we are returned to familiar but fun sci-fi territory.\n\nThe female alien (Sky) bonds with C Thomas Howell\u2019s character Josh and reveals to him the human race are finished unless they can prove to her otherwise. Typically, the establishment want to blow up the robots and torture the aliens. This is obviously not the greatest of ideas and the more time they waste, the less time earth has left.\n\nFor a sci-fi film, the film is fairly subtle on the effects and in my humble opinion works better for it.

Seeing the potential for a strong box office response to such material, he asked assistant story editor Maurice Hanline to search for a filmable science fiction tale. Knowing that it would probably be prohibitively expensive to depict an outer space adventure, he told Hanline that they should confine their search to Earthbound stories. In an anthology, Hanline found a reprinting of \"Farewell to the Master,\" by Harry Bates, which had first appeared inmagazine in October, 1940. Blaustein thought the story was perfect to expand into a feature film; it told of an outer space visitor, Klaatu, landing in Washington, D.C. on a mission to bring peace to the planet. The spaceman is shot by nervous soldiers, but rescued by an enormous humanoid robot called Gnut. In a retrospect article on the film inmagazine, Steve Rubin quoted Blaustein on his reaction to reading the story: \"The thing that grabbed my attention was the response of people to the unknown. Klaatu holds his hand up with something that looks unfamiliar to them and he is immediately shot. It was a terribly significant moment for me in terms of story. It really started the whole thing going.\"Blaustein's next step in producing a science fiction film was to persuade Fox production chief Darryl F. Zanuck. The executive didn't think much of the Bates story, but gave the go-ahead to purchase the film rights. The Pulp publisher sold the rights to the story for only $1000, half of which was given to Bates. Fox staff writer Edmund H. North was assigned to write the film's script, and completed a 35-page outline by June 25, 1950. Blaustein was nervous because the Korean conflict had just broken out, and he feared that Zanuck would nix the story's message of peace in a time of war. According to North, in a final story conference Zanuck said, \"To hell with it! Let's go ahead anyway. It's a good piece of entertainment. I believe in it.\" Also,had been released in May, and was doing extremely good business at the box office.Director Robert Wise was under non-exclusive contract to Fox, and was Blaustein's first choice to helm the picture, now announced to the press as being called. By the time North had completed his script, the New York office of Fox had requested another title change, to, a reference to the dramatic show of non-violent power that Klaatu demonstrates to the world. When North's screenplay was submitted to the Production Code Administration, the Breen Office stipulated that Klaatu could not be brought back to life in the film, because \"only God can do that.\" North was flabbergasted. As he told Rubin, \"[Klaatu] had to be brought back to life to make the final speech and provide the film's logical conclusion. Julian, Bob [Wise], and I debated this for a long time and we finally came up with a foolish compromise where Klaatu is brought back to life, but only for a limited period and where he mentions that the power of life and death lies not with Gort but with 'the all-mighty spirit.' It was really a nasty confrontation which had us all boiling over.\"For the all-important role of Klaatu, name stars such as Spencer Tracy and Claude Rains were initially considered. Blaustein, however, felt that an actor unknown to American audiences would be more easily accepted as \"a stranger in a strange land.\" Zanuck suggested a British actor who had recently made his American film debut in(1950), Michael Rennie. Rennie had just signed a long-term contract with Fox, but was not yet well-known. Fox contract player Patricia Neal was signed to play Helen Benson, the Earthling that Klaatu/ Mr. Carpenter relates to the closest. Her son Bobby was played by long-time child actor Billy Gray. Perfectly cast as Professor Barnhardt (obviously patterned after Albert Einstein), was character actor Sam Jaffe. After being given the part, Jaffe's name appeared in the infamouspamphlet listing performers with supposed Communist connections. Jaffe was almost dismissed as the Hollywood Blacklist began, but Blaustein insisted that the actor be allowed to finish shooting. (Following, Jaffe did not appear again in films for several years).Casting an actor to play the giant robot Gort (changed from \"Gnut\" in the story) was not an easy task. As quoted by Sergio Leeman in the book,, the director said, \"Somebody remembered that the Grauman's Chinese Theater had in those days a terribly tall doorman. He was 7'7\" and we hired him to be in that suit. He was not a strong man, and that suit was heavy. He could only stay in it for about half an hour at a time. He couldn't pick up Pat Neal.\" The man's name was Lock Martin - he was tall, but indeed quite frail, and many tricks had to be employed to make it appear as if Gort was all-powerful. Cutaways disguised the fact that viewers never see him pick up a person, and that lightweight dummies were substituted for the actors. Gort was designed to have a \"fluid metal\" appearance; the body of the suit was made of pliable, smooth latex. Seams were hidden by building two suits - one that laced up the back for shots showing the front, and another suit that laced in the front when Gort is seen walking away from the camera. The spare design, not to mention an ominous slit-for-an-eye that emits a deadly ray beam, ensured that Gort would be long remembered as one of the most effective film robots of all time.Shooting onbegan on April 9. 1951 - it was budgeted at a generous $960,000, but 20th Century Fox head Zanuck was still insistent on holding down costs. He was particularly concerned with overshooting, and would fire off memos to directors if he felt that he was seeing too many set-ups during a day's rushes. Robert Wise later said, \"I shot a sequence around the breakfast table in the boarding house, and I had planned carefully just the angles I needed to make the whole thing go together. Zanuck chose that one to write me a very harsh memo saying. 'I've been warning you about overshooting. ...I think this must stop now. Otherwise, I'm going to take some kind of measure.' I sat down and wrote him a very detailed memo of just what coverage I had and why I felt it was necessary. I never heard another thing from him.\"The film wrapped principal photography on May 22, 1951. Wise supervised the post-production, which included several excellent optical effects shots. Department head Fred Sersen and effects artists Ray Kellogg, Emil Kosa, and L. B. Abbott executed shots of Gort's heat rays, and a particularly effective opening scene of Klaatu's ship landing on a baseball diamond in Washington. Also completed during post-production was the music score, composed by Bernard Herrmann. Director Wise and Herrmann had worked together on Orson Welles' first two films,(1941) and(1942), when Wise was an editor at RKO. For, Herrmann devised one of his greatest scores. He rearranged the standard film studio orchestra, first by dropping the string section entirely and replacing it with electronic violins and an electric bass. To this he added the exotic electronic instrument, the Theremin. Dr. Samuel Hoffman was brought in to play the instrument, which was double-tracked in most instances and also occasionally run in reverse.Darryl F. Zanuck was delighted with the completed film, and wanted to send it out without even an audience preview. Blaustein and Wise were not as certain, however, and nervously previewed the film - they needn't have worried; \"It worked beautifully,\" Wise later recalled.opened in Los Angeles on September 18th, and in New York ten days later. By the end of its first release,had racked up a worldwide gross of $1.8 million. The film retains its power to this day, and the movie's message of peace also resonates. Robert Wise later said, \"I always want my films to have a comment to make. However, the comment should be made by the story itself, the development of the plot and the interplay of the characters, without having the actors say it in so many words.is an exception to that. The whole purpose of it was for Klaatu to deliver that warning at the end.\"Producer: Julian BlausteinDirector: Robert WiseScreenplay: Edmund H.

Klaatu holds his hand up with something that looks unfamiliar to them and he is immediately shot. It was a terribly significant moment for me in terms of story. It really started the whole thing going.\" Blaustein's next step in producing a science fiction film was to persuade Fox production chief Darryl F. Zanuck. The executive didn't think much of the Bates story, but gave the go-ahead to purchase the film rights. The Pulp publisher sold the rights to the story for only $1000, half of which was given to Bates. Fox staff writer Edmund H. North was assigned to write the film's script, and completed a 35-page outline by June 25, 1950. Blaustein was nervous because the Korean conflict had just broken out, and he feared that Zanuck would nix the story's message of peace in a time of war. According to North, in a final story conference Zanuck said, \"To hell with it! Let's go ahead anyway. It's a good piece of entertainment. I believe in it.\" Also, Destination Moon had been released in May, and was doing extremely good business at the box office. Director Robert Wise was under non-exclusive contract to Fox, and was Blaustein's first choice to helm the picture, now announced to the press as being called Journey to the World. By the time North had completed his script, the New York office of Fox had requested another title change, to The Day the Earth Stood Still, a reference to the dramatic show of non-violent power that Klaatu demonstrates to the world. When North's screenplay was submitted to the Production Code Administration, the Breen Office stipulated that Klaatu could not be brought back to life in the film, because \"only God can do that.\" North was flabbergasted. As he told Rubin, \"[Klaatu] had to be brought back to life to make the final speech and provide the film's logical conclusion. Julian, Bob [Wise], and I debated this for a long time and we finally came up with a foolish compromise where Klaatu is brought back to life, but only for a limited period and where he mentions that the power of life and death lies not with Gort but with 'the all-mighty spirit.' It was really a nasty confrontation which had us all boiling over.\" For the all-important role of Klaatu, name stars such as Spencer Tracy and Claude Rains were initially considered. Blaustein, however, felt that an actor unknown to American audiences would be more easily accepted as \"a stranger in a strange land.\" Zanuck suggested a British actor who had recently made his American film debut in The Black Rose (1950), Michael Rennie. Rennie had just signed a long-term contract with Fox, but was not yet well-known. Fox contract player Patricia Neal was signed to play Helen Benson, the Earthling that Klaatu/ Mr. Carpenter relates to the closest. Her son Bobby was played by long-time child actor Billy Gray. Perfectly cast as Professor Barnhardt (obviously patterned after Albert Einstein), was character actor Sam Jaffe. After being given the part, Jaffe's name appeared in the infamous Red Channels pamphlet listing performers with supposed Communist connections. Jaffe was almost dismissed as the Hollywood Blacklist began, but Blaustein insisted that the actor be allowed to finish shooting. (Following The Day the Earth Stood Still, Jaffe did not appear again in films for several years). Casting an actor to play the giant robot Gort (changed from \"Gnut\" in the story) was not an easy task. As quoted by Sergio Leeman in the book, Robert Wise On His Films, the director said, \"Somebody remembered that the Grauman's Chinese Theater had in those days a terribly tall doorman. He was 7'7\" and we hired him to be in that suit. He was not a strong man, and that suit was heavy. He could only stay in it for about half an hour at a time. He couldn't pick up Pat Neal.\" The man's name was Lock Martin - he was tall, but indeed quite frail, and many tricks had to be employed to make it appear as if Gort was all-powerful. Cutaways disguised the fact that viewers never see him pick up a person, and that lightweight dummies were substituted for the actors. Gort was designed to have a \"fluid metal\" appearance; the body of the suit was made of pliable, smooth latex. Seams were hidden by building two suits - one that laced up the back for shots showing the front, and another suit that laced in the front when Gort is seen walking away from the camera. The spare design, not to mention an ominous slit-for-an-eye that emits a deadly ray beam, ensured that Gort would be long remembered as one of the most effective film robots of all time. Shooting on The Day the Earth Stood Still began on April 9. 1951 - it was budgeted at a generous $960,000, but 20th Century Fox head Zanuck was still insistent on holding down costs. He was particularly concerned with overshooting, and would fire off memos to directors if he felt that he was seeing too many set-ups during a day's rushes. Robert Wise later said, \"I shot a sequence around the breakfast table in the boarding house, and I had planned carefully just the angles I needed to make the whole thing go together. Zanuck chose that one to write me a very harsh memo saying. 'I've been warning you about overshooting. ...I think this must stop now. Otherwise, I'm going to take some kind of measure.' I sat down and wrote him a very detailed memo of just what coverage I had and why I felt it was necessary. I never heard another thing from him.\" The film wrapped principal photography on May 22, 1951. Wise supervised the post-production, which included several excellent optical effects shots. Department head Fred Sersen and effects artists Ray Kellogg, Emil Kosa, and L. B. Abbott executed shots of Gort's heat rays, and a particularly effective opening scene of Klaatu's ship landing on a baseball diamond in Washington. Also completed during post-production was the music score, composed by Bernard Herrmann. Director Wise and Herrmann had worked together on Orson Welles' first two films, Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), when Wise was an editor at RKO. For The Day the Earth Stood Still, Herrmann devised one of his greatest scores. He rearranged the standard film studio orchestra, first by dropping the string section entirely and replacing it with electronic violins and an electric bass. To this he added the exotic electronic instrument, the Theremin. Dr. Samuel Hoffman was brought in to play the instrument, which was double-tracked in most instances and also occasionally run in reverse. Darryl F. Zanuck was delighted with the completed film, and wanted to send it out without even an audience preview. Blaustein and Wise were not as certain, however, and nervously previewed the film - they needn't have worried; \"It worked beautifully,\" Wise later recalled. The Day the Earth Stood Still opened in Los Angeles on September 18th, and in New York ten days later. By the end of its first release, The Day the Earth Stood Still had racked up a worldwide gross of $1.8 million. The film retains its power to this day, and the movie's message of peace also resonates. Robert Wise later said, \"I always want my films to have a comment to make. However, the comment should be made by the story itself, the development of the plot and the interplay of the characters, without having the actors say it in so many words. The Day the Earth Stood Still is an exception to that. The whole purpose of it was for Klaatu to deliver that warning at the end.\" Producer: Julian Blaustein Director: Robert Wise Screenplay: Edmund H.

Yes \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" is one of those mockbusters which The Asylum seemed to specialise in.\n\nWhat \"The Day the Earth Stopped\" also has is the low production values which many have come to expect from some thing The Asylum would make. As such the special effects are poor, the dialogue is basic and the acting feels like those involved were handed a rough idea what a scene was going to be just before they were to shoot it and then made it up as they went. It doesn't work and whilst at times entertaining for the wrong reasons, Judd Nelson showing up for a few scenes with a cheesy grin being a highlight, this is mostly a waste of time.\n\nWhat this all boils down to is that \"The Day the Earth Stopped\" is a bad movie and no matter how much I would love to tell you that it is enjoyably bad I simply can't.
