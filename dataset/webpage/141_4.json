Thomas, second son of Benjamin and his wife Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Brideson, was born on 1 December 1845 in London and accompanied his parents to Moreton Bay aboard the Chaseley in 1849. James, born on 4 October 1856 at Ipswich, was the third child of Benjamin's second marriage in 1853 to Clarissa Foote; Henry, born on 5 April 1864 at Ipswich, was their youngest son.\n\nThomas was a foundation pupil of the Ipswich Boys's Grammar School, where his brothers were also educated. Like them he entered his father's mercantile and banking business, ultimately becoming senior partner and retiring in 1902. In religion, they continued the family tradition of staunch and devoted Nonconformism; Thomas in lifelong service to the Ipswich Congregational Church, much of it as a deacon, while James and Henry were for many years superintendents and teachers of the Sunday school. Family support for the grammar school was maintained by Thomas and James, the former as chairman of trustees of the Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. His love of music was reflected in his presidency of the Blackstone-Ipswich Cambrian Choir.\n\nOn 23 May 1893 Thomas was appointed to the Legislative Council; he resigned three years later and won Ipswich in the Legislative Assembly. He served in the assembly during great political instability, including the fall of three ministries, a railway construction scandal and the worst drought on record. The Philp ministry was forced to drastically retrench the civil service and, as colonial treasurer in 1901-03, Cribb compounded the government's unpopularity with the first income tax in Queensland, causing its fall; he was defeated at the next election in 1904. With others who disliked the political bias of the Brisbane Courier he had launched the Daily Mail in May 1903.\n\nCribb was reappointed to the Legislative Council in June 1913, but was too ill to serve. He died at his Southport home on 4 September. Of his marriage on 3 June 1874 to Marian Lucy, n\u00e9e Foote, there were five sons and two daughters. His estate was valued for probate at \u00a369,435. Slightly built, gently spoken and with a keen sense of humour, Cribb seemed happiest within his family. Asthmatic from youth, only a strong sense of duty propelled him into public life; deafness from middle age increased his problems.\n\nJames was member for Rosewood in the assembly in 1893-96. He devoted 1896-99 to the family business, then represented Bundamba in 1899-1912 and Bremer in 1912-15. A confirmed liberal, he easily held these working-class seats, perhaps because of his help to Ipswich coal-mining. He gained much credit for stabilizing the industry by persistent agitation for a schedule price scheme for railway coal in place of tendering; the loop-line to Bundamba and Blackstone mines was another success. He was also a skilful industrial conciliator.\n\nJames served on the Bundamba Shire Council and on the Girls' Grammar School Board, while holding directorships, including the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Co. Ltd and the Ipswich Gas and Coke Co. Ltd. On 20 February 1884 in Melbourne, he married Alice Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. F. H. Browne, of the Richmond Congregational Church. They had three sons and five daughters. He disposed of his interest in the family firm to relatives in 1904 and died at Ipswich on 23 May 1926 of arteriosclerosis.\n\nThe true inheritor of his father's entrepreneurial skill was Henry. Friendly and sociable, he was very much a man of the world and a sporting gentleman. He represented the colony in cricket, football and tennis. A foundation member of the Queensland Hunt Club, where his horse Parnell twice won the point-to-point steeplechase, he was also a fine horseman and polo-player. Breeding and exhibiting fox terriers, greyhounds, homing pigeons, Jersey cattle and horses, he was a councillor of the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association in 1920-40 and was active in other agricultural show societies. As a bloodstock breeder, notably of trotting horses, on his grazing property, Gulvallis, at Toogoolawah, he imported sires from New Zealand and America and helped to improve show trotting in Queensland. A lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry, he served during the 1891 shearing strike.\n\nIn 1917 Henry was closely connected with the Nationalist Party as president of the Ipswich and Bremer National Association, and as a financial backer and president of the National Democratic Council in 1919-21. Three sons and one daughter were born of his marriage on 2 May 1888 to Esther Elizabeth Gomez de Silva. By the death or retirement of other shareholders, he was able to acquire sole ownership of the family firm on 31 December 1924. On 22 June 1927 he and his family sold their interests, severing the last connexions of the Cribb and Foote families with the firm founded by Benjamin Cribb in 1849. Henry died at Ipswich on 16 July 1944.\n\nThe Cribbs made no outstanding or lasting contribution as members of parliament. Yet they were typical of those Queensland families who came to hold and to wield considerable local and regional power. For almost a century they dominated the cultural, sporting, economic and political life of the West Moreton district. Ipswich is still graced by their town houses, several of which are outstanding Queensland examples of the best of colonial architecture."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/142211577/james-clarke", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

D. Manley\n\nCharles James Clarke (1894-1973), soldier and farmer, was born on 1 October 1894 at Launceston, Tasmania, son of John Clarke, labourer, and his wife Rebecca, n\u00e9e Wright. When he was in his early teens his family began farming at Kialla, Victoria, and he was shearing at Euroa when he enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force on 15 October 1914.\n\nClarke was allotted to the 14th Battalion and sailed for Egypt in December. They reached Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 and served throughout the Peninsula campaign, including several major actions, among them Courtney's Post and Hill 60. Clarke was wounded at Durrant's Post on 12 November, was evacuated and rejoined his unit in Egypt on 19 January 1916. He was promoted lance corporal on 26 May and five days later embarked for France as a signaller. The battalion moved into the line near Armenti\u00e8res in mid-June and in August fought in the battle of Pozi\u00e8res Ridge. Clarke was awarded the Military Medal for gallantry: as a runner he delivered a message from the front line to reinforcements and, under heavy fire, guided them to their position. Later that year he served at Mouquet Farm and, after a brief period in Flanders, spent the winter of 1916-17 on the Somme.\n\nIn 1917 the 14th Battalion fought at Bullecourt, Messines and Polygon Wood. Clarke was promoted corporal on 27 February 1918 and was made acting sergeant in June. For 'conspicuous gallantry' in the battle of Amiens he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. The citation praised his assistance in maintaining communication lines 'over bare ground swept by field-gun fire'. He 'worked for 48 hours mending breaks and remained four hours after the unit was relieved' helping the incoming unit 'under shell fire of all calibres'. He was made a lance sergeant in August and from then until November fought in the battle of the Hindenburg Outpost-Line, receiving a Bar to his Military Medal for distinguished service as a signaller. He was made a temporary sergeant in January 1919.\n\nClarke returned to Australia in November and was demobilized in June 1920. Soon afterwards he began farming at Barmah East in Victoria and on 20 December, at St John's Anglican Church, Narioka, married Elizabeth Schier. He remained on the same farm for the rest of his life. Between the wars he helped to raise and train a local light horse squadron and was commissioned lieutenant in the 20th Light Horse Regiment in 1928; by 1938 he was a major. During World War II he served with the second A.I.F. in several training and administrative posts until failing health caused his retirement in 1942. Survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters, he died on 10 November 1973 at Mooroopna and was buried in Nathalia Anglican cemetery.\n\nClarke, known throughout the Nathalia district as 'Nobby', was a popular and colourful personality with a lively sense of humour and a reputation for spinning yarns. Though proud of his military awards he was modest about his achievements and is known to have used his medals on occasion to weight his fishing lines. His estate was sworn for probate at $59,210."}], "James Clarke was buried in St. Mary's Churchyard, Islington, London.": [{"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/2243598/st.-mary's-churchyard", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

Hopefully I can return for a daytime tour, and if you are interested in the tour of this historic church, I have put a link at the end of the post to where I found out about these tours.\n\nSt Mary Islington is in Upper Street, and is a short walk from Angel underground station, continuing past Islington Green. As you walk along Upper Street, the spire of St Mary\u2019s is a landmark on the right of the street:\n\nThen the full front of the church comes into view, which is easier to see in winter when there are no leaves on the trees between church and street:\n\nThe church we see today dates from two distinct periods. The front fa\u00e7ade of the church (except for the portico and columns), the tower and steeple date from the 18th century, however the body of church is from the mid 20th century.\n\nThe church was bombed in September 1940 when a bomb landed on the nave, which suffered substantial damage. The tower and steeple survived. The church was rebuilt in the early 1950s to a design by the architectural partnership of Seely & Paget.\n\nThe new nave of the church was built on the same outline as the original, and walls lined with tall windows to allow a large amount of natural light into the nave of the church. From the churchyard we can see the new nave and the original tower and steeple:\n\nAs with the majority of London churchyards, St Mary\u2019s has been cleared of gravestones and has been converted to a garden. The churchyard was closed to new burials by the 1852 Burial Act which applied to churches in the metropolitan London area. As with so many London churches, St Mary\u2019s had been taking very many burials over the centuries, and with Islington\u2019s rapidly growing population, it was impractical to continue to use the churchyard, even without the 1852 Act.\n\nThirty acres of land was purchased in East Finchley for the use of St Pancras and Islington for burials.\n\nThe gardens at the rear of the church on a sunny December afternoon:\n\nLooking back towards Upper Street, with the church on the right, and as with many London churchyards, when they were converted to gardens the gravestones were moved to the edge and form parallel rows along the external wall:\n\nThere is a named grave of a significant Islington resident next to the front of the church, just behind bus stop N on Upper Street. This is the grave of Richard Cloudesley:\n\nRichard Cloudesley was born around 1470 and died in 1517. He was an Islington resident and landowner. In his will he left two \u201cstony fields\u201d covering an area of around 14 acres, and these became part of a charitable trust which is still in existence and today is simply known as the Cloudesley.\n\nThe fields were rented out and generated an income, however with the northwards expansion of London during the early 19th century, the land was becoming valuable for house building, so in the 1830s, the trust began selling leases to parts of the lands, and what would become the Cloudesley Estate began to be built.\n\nWhilst much of the land and houses have been sold, the Cloudesley charitable trust still owns around 100 properties, and the income from these continues to support the aims of the trust, which includes the health needs of Islington residents, along with a grants programme which helps maintain and repair Church of England churches in Islington.\n\nThe grave in the above photo is not where Richard Cloudesley was originally buried. His body was taken from an unknown location in the churchyard, and reburied in the current position in 1812. The grave was originally more ornate than we see today, however being so close to the church it suffered from bomb damage in 1940, and in 2017 the Cloudesley charity provided funding to repair and restore the grave.\n\nThe tower of the church supports a spire \u2013 the most visible feature in the surrounding streets:\n\nThe spire has an interesting history, as in 1787, during repairs to the tower, it was decided to install a lightning conductor on the spire. Rather than construct scaffolding around the spire, the church contracted a basket maker by the name of Thomas Birch, who charged the church \u00a320 to effectively build a wicker casing which fully enclosed the spire. Inside this wicker casing was a set of stairs that allowed workmen to reach the full height of the spire.\n\nThe spire, surrounded by its wicker case is shown in the following print from 1787 (\u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum):\n\nAlthough Thomas Birch was paid \u00a320 by the church, he found another way of making more money and he advertised the spiral staircase as a means for the public to reach the top and see the view. Apparently charging for the climb and view raised a further \u00a350.\n\nWhat is not clear from the above print is where someone climbing the spire could have looked out through the wicker and see the view, whether they had to climb the full height and peer out over the top of the wicker, which would have been an experience not for those with a fear of heights.\n\nThe site of St Mary\u2019s has been the site of a church for very many years.\n\nIt is in a key position. Upper Street has long been an important road from the City of London to the north, and the church is alongside this road.\n\nThere is very little evidence to confirm, however there may have been a church on the site in Anglo-Saxon times. Evidence for this seems to be mainly based on the parish of St Mary the Virgin being established in the year 628 by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nThere was an 11th century church built on the site, and we were shown a stone with a zig-zag pattern in the crypt which apparently dates from the 12th century church.\n\nThe next church on the site was built in 1483, and this version of the church would last until the mid-18th century.\n\nJohn Rocque\u2019s map of 1746 shows the church (circled in the following extract), at a time when Islington was still mainly rural with buildings extending along Upper Street and Lower Street (now Essex Road), gardens, and the wider countryside being fields.\n\nAs well as Rocque\u2019s map, the following print shows what the view of the church would have been at roughly the same time as Rocque\u2019s map (although the print shows a date of 1775, the British Museum record states c. 1750) (\u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum):\n\nThe view is looking across Upper Street towards the church, and shows a cow and sheep being herded along the street. Islington at the time was known as a place where cows were kept with their milk being sold in the City, and Upper Street was also used as a route to Smithfield Market.\n\nThere appear to be two houses attached to the west front of the church, facing Upper Street. It is not clear when these were built , or there original purpose, however around 1710 rooms in these buildings were used to provide a school.\n\nIf the 1750 date is correct, then the church in the above print is the 1483 version of the church. By 1750 it has fallen into a poor state of repair, and an Act of Parliament was approved to demolish and rebuild the church.\n\nFunds for the new church were gathered by a tax on local land and property owners.\n\nThe tower in the above print looks reasonably substantial and this appears to have caused a problem when attempts were made to demolish the church. The first attempt to take down the tower was by the use of gunpowder, which did not work, so a large fire was built in the foundations of the tower, which apparently worked.\n\nA new church was built by a Lancelot Dowbiggin. He was a joiner, and may have been local as he was later buried in the churchyard. This latest version of the church did not include the portico and the colonnades, which can be seen in the second photo in the post, and when viewed from a distance do look a bit as if they have been stuck onto an earlier church. These additions were made in 1902.\n\nIt was Dowbiggin\u2019s church that survived until the bombing in September 1940, and his tower remains to this day.\n\nThe mid 18th century rebuild of the church included a new set of bells which were cast in the 1770s. These are still in use in the church and were renovated and rehung in 2003. The walk up the tower passed the entrance to where the bells are hung, unfortunately being dark, they could not be seen.\n\nTime to have a look inside the church, but before I walked in, I noticed the following poster adjacent to the entrance to the church:\n\nA lovely bit of graphic design, but the reason it really caught my eye was the similarity to the design on the spine of a series of books produced from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nThis was the County Books series, a wonderful set of detailed, illustrated descriptions of English Counties published by Robert Hale Limited of Bedford Square. Each book was written by an author who knew the area.\n\nI have the six books covering London, along with books for a couple of surrounding counties, and the following shows the spine of the book on the left and the main cover on the right. As can be seen \u201cThe County Books\u201d graphic at the top of the spine is the same as in the poster outside St Mary\u2019s:\n\nI cannot find out who designed the covers for the Robert Hales County Books, but they all have an identical cover design, with only the name of the county, the author and the picture changing from book to book.\n\nWalking into the church, and we can see that this is not an old design, and how the large windows of Seely & Paget\u2019s design let in a large amount of natural light, even on a late December afternoon. The following photo is looking from the entrance towards the altar:\n\nThe following photo is from near the altar looking back towards the entrance:\n\nDue to the degree of bomb damage, there are very few original features to be seen in the church.\n\nAs well as the portico and colonnades built on the front of the church in 1902, the work also provided a new font for the church, and the original 18th century font was moved to the crypt, and it was this that saved the font in September 1940.\n\nThe 1902 font was destroyed and as part of the 1950s rebuilt of the church, the 18th century font was moved from the crypt, back up to the main church:\n\nAnd the Arms of George III, which had been hung in St. Mary\u2019s in 1781 were recovered from the ruins of the church, restored and returned to the new church:\n\nMy first visit to the church was during the early afternoon, during daylight, as the tour was late afternoon and after dark, so I left the church for a couple of hours then returned for the tour which took in the main body of the church and the crypt, before heading up the tower, the top of which was reached by a very narrow set of steps.\n\nThe view on reaching the top of the tower was well worth the climb. This is the view looking to the City of London on the right, with the Isle of Dogs and the towers surrounding Canary Wharf on the left:\n\nI had set-up the camera with hopefully the right settings to take photos at night, at the top of a tower with a narrow walkway and a light breeze, whilst avoiding any camera shake, and for most of the photos this seems to have worked.\n\nA close-up view looking towards the City of London, with the Shard to the right:\n\nAnd zooming into Canary Wharf and surrounding buildings, showing how large parts of the Isle of Dogs is now covered in tall towers, brightly lit at night:\n\nLooking towards the south and west, the purple light of the London Eye can be seen on the left edge of the photo, and towards the right is the BT Tower. Upper Street is the road, and to the right of centre is the long roof of the old Agricultural Hall:\n\nThe following photo is looking north, with Upper Street running up towards Highbury Corner. Just to the right of the far end of the street are the blue lights of the Union Chapel. I believe the yellow lights on the horizon are those of the Emirates Stadium.\n\nA final look over towards the City, with one of the stone decorations on the top of the tower in the foreground:\n\nThe photos hopefully provide an impression of the view from the tower, however looking at the view from a narrow walkway at the top of the tower, with the spire disappearing into the darkness above certainly adds to the experience.\n\nI understand that there may well be more tours in the future. They are led by Clerkenwell and Islington Guides, and I found out about the walks from their newsletter which can be subscribed to from the home page of their website, here.\n\nalondoninheritance.com\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.deceasedonline.com/servlet/GSDOSearch", "page_content": "Search registers by Country, Region, County, Burial Authority or Crematorium free of charge.\n\nRegister as a Deceased Online user and gain access to\n\nAbout Deceased Online\n\nDeceased Online is the first central database of statutory burial and cremation registers for the UK and Republic of Ireland -- a unique resource for family history researchers and professional genealogists\n\nUntil now, to search these records you had to approach about 3,000 burial authorities and nearly 250 crematoria in the UK alone, each independently holding their own registers, mostly as old fragile books.

It replaced the ancient church of the Augustinian nunnery of St Mary, by then much altered but basically of the twelfth century. Part of this church had been used by the local inhabitants since the creation of the parish of Clerkenwell in 1176, and after the nunnery's suppression the building was retained as the parish church. The dedication, originally to the Virgin Mary, was augmented before 1500 to include St James the Less, and by 1540 the church seems to have been rededicated to St James alone. (fn. 1)\n\n21. Old St James's Church, showing outline of rebuilt church of 1788\u201392 in red. The grey shaded portion indicates the probable extent of the original cruciform nunnery church of c. 1160\n\nOf James Carr relatively little is known. (fn. 2) He was probably the Mr Carr who acted as surveyor to the Apothecaries' Company in 1785, and he was one of the City Road Turnpike Trustees from the 1780s onwards, and probably surveyor to the trust as well. (fn. 3) In Clerkenwell, he is known to have drawn up a plan for building on the Penton estate in 1781. At the time of his involvement with St James's and adjacent houses on the Newcastle House site (see above), he was described as of Artillery Place, Finsbury. In both these projects he was associated with James Fisher, a carpenter of Bunhill Row, who acted as his trustee in some deeds. (fn. 4)\n\nThe Old Church\n\nThe nunnery church\n\nLittle is known of the church as originally built, c. 1160, other than that it was a stone structure, probably cruciform in plan, and aisleless (Ill. 21). (fn. 5) All that survived subsequent reconstruction was the long, narrow nave and the north transept. A view made during demolition in the late eighteenth century shows remnants of blind arcading on the inner face of the nave's south wall, with scallop or chevron-moulded capitals\u2014a characteristic Early English feature that originally may have extended around the other walls of the nave (Ill. 26).\n\nMore is known of the church as enlarged in the 1180s and 90s, after it took on the additional role of parish church, as essentially this was the form it retained until the rebuilding of the church in the 1780s (Ills 21\u201328). The major alteration was the demolition of the south transept and east end to make way for a much bigger and taller chancel with north and south aisles. At the east end of the nave and old crossing an extension was built to the south, with a square-plan tower and porch as a new public entrance. On the north side of the church a cloister was constructed, part of an enlargement of the conventual buildings. It has been suggested that these late twelfth-century additions may also have included a clerestory over the east end and crossing. (fn. 6)\n\n22. Old St James's Church, from the south-west, c. 1750; the low building to the left of the tower is the former nunnery church nave\n\nThe most likely interpretation of this new arrangement would have seen the central chancel and north aisle of the enlarged east end, and the north transept\u2014easily accessible from the conventual accommodation around the cloister\u2014appropriated as the nuns' 'high quire'. This probably would have been screened off from the south aisle, which, with the tower and porch, served as the parish church, well placed for public access from the main nunnery gate to the south. The function of the nave after this reconstruction is less clear, though possibly it was reserved for brethren and other male members of the nunnery community, as the chaplains' accommodation was situated near by, on the west side of the precinct.\n\n23, 24. Old St James's Church in 1788. Looking east into the chancel and (right) looking west\n\nThe arcades separating the new chancel and aisles comprised large semi-circular arches with rolled mouldings, supported on piers with clustered shafts (Ills 25, 26). Beneath the north-east corner of the tower was one particularly massive pier with eight shafts. Marking the entrance to the north transept was an arch and responds with smaller, more heavily clustered shafts and ribs, and chevron or scallop decoration.\n\nAfter centuries of financial constraint, a major reconstruction of the church began in the late 1470s, funded partly by papal indulgences, partly by private benefactions, continuing into the early 1500s (Ills 23\u201326). A new roof was laid across the east end on a much shallower pitch, the gables and upper parts of the walls being rebuilt in brick. If there had been a clerestorey, it must have been removed at this point, and, perhaps to compensate for the loss, large Perpendicular windows were inserted in the east end, the north transept, and the lower stage of the tower. Both the body of the church and the tower were given stone battlements. With the reconstruction of the cloister, the north wall of the nave was entirely rebuilt with an outer face (to the cloister) of dressed ragstone rubble, into which were set the triple-shaft responds which supported the ribs of the cloister vaulting (Ills 27, 28). Part of this wall, now exposed in St James's Garden, is the sole remaining fragment of the nunnery to survive above ground.\n\nBrackets either side of the main chancel window and five niches over the crossing arch shown in the eighteenth-century views appear also to be late medieval in date (Ills 23, 24). These were presumably intended for statues, most likely of Our Lady and St James at the east end; and perhaps of angels holding the five instruments of the Passion over the crossing, as this was a popular subject with female orders.\n\nThe church after the Dissolution\n\nWhen the downfall of the church was decreed, its general aspect was that of an edifice, antique indeed, but in which nearly every ancient feature was so mixed up with modern repairs, that few feelings of veneration could be excited by it. (fn. 7)\n\nThe local historian Thomas Cromwell's description of old St James's on the eve of its destruction conjures up an image of organic irregularity of the sort that taste then and later found so unappealing. Had it not been demolished in 1788, the church would certainly have succumbed to the improving hand of the High Victorian restorers. St James's had survived the Dissolution more or less intact, presumably because of its additional status as parish church. According to Stow, it drew not only locals but also worshippers from as far afield as Muswell Hill, where some 65 acres of land once belonging to the nunnery formed a detached portion of the parish. (fn. 8) Until the Interregnum, St James's was privately owned, and rented by its parishioners; but in 1656 they were able to acquire the freehold, and, most unusually, held on to it even after the Restoration in 1660. (fn. 9)\n\n25, 26. Old St James's Church, demolition in 1789. The tower from the north transept arch and (below) looking towards the east window, with remains of twelfth-century blind arcading in old nave at extreme right\n\nBy the 1780s St James's was hardly recognizable from the outside as an ancient structure, its rough stone facing patched up in brick and partly covered in plaster, and with houses picturesquely built up against it, particularly at the south-west, next to Clerkenwell Close (Ill. 22). But essentially it was still the twelfth-century nunnery church. The long and slender nave had been adapted as a vestry and other offices, and worship was confined to the old chancel and south aisle, the north aisle having collapsed before 1587 (Ill. 21). The loss of the aisle apart, the greatest change to the fabric since medieval times had been the fall of the steeple in 1623 and the damage caused by the fall of its replacement during construction. This second collapse, due to neglect on the part of the builder, took with it the church bells, their carriages and frames, and part of the roof, 'the Weight of all these together, bearing to the Ground two large Pillars of the South Isle, a fair Gallery over-against the Pulpit, the Pulpit, all the Pews, and whatsoever was under, or near it'. (fn. 10) Construction of a new tower had reached as high as the church roof by 1627, but does not seem to have been completed till considerably later. Eighty feet high, square on plan, the tower appeared squat and massy, with heavy corner buttresses, and battlements originally coped with stone (Ill. 22).\n\nAs part of the reconstruction, a sort of transept was inserted at the junction of the nave and tower, where much of the damage had been done. Though it projected a little beyond the main walls at either end, the transept apparently 'made little appearance within'; but externally it was incongruous, the gable-ends of its steeply pitched roof a prominent feature in later views of the church (Ill. 22). (fn. 11)\n\nSt James's was the subject of a number of views by artists in the 1780s and early 90s, shortly before and during demolition, leaving behind a reasonably detailed record of its final form (Ills 23\u201326). To a large degree the heavy, clustered stone columns and semicircular moulded arches of the twelfth century still dominated the interior. At the east end the large perpendicular five-light window was one of the last significant alterations made before the nunnery's suppression. The roof, and most of the fixtures and fittings\u2014including the oak box-pews, galleries, pulpit and tester, were of post-Dissolution date.\n\nThe west end was closed by a screen, built across the twelfth-century arch separating the crossing from the choir, and above this was a gallery for charity children, added in 1722 with money bequeathed by Thomas Crosse, of a local brewing family. On the south side of the nave were two other galleries: a private one for the Duke of Newcastle and his family, added in 1633, almost opposite the pulpit; and, in the next bay to the west, another known as 'Loveday's gallery', built with funds left to the parish in 1704 by Francis Loveday. (fn. 12)\n\n27, 28. Old St James's Church, remains of the south cloister in 1786. View from north, showing eighteenth-century furniture warehouses; and (below) view east along the cloister walk\n\nMore than anything else the post-Dissolution church was noted for its fine series of funerary monuments, recorded sedulously by writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A number that survived the rebuilding and were reinstalled in the new church are briefly described below. Important burials at the church included those of its founder, Jordan de Bricet and his wife, Muriel de Munteni, in the chapter-house; Isabella Sackville, the nunnery's last prioress, whose grave lay near the high altar; and Sir William Weston, prior of St John's monastery at the time of its suppression in 1540, who had a spectacular monument set against the north wall of the chancel (see Ill. 159 on page 133). (fn. 13) Thomas Dekker, the playwright, was buried at the old church in 1632, and in the mid-seventeenth century two of Izaak Walton's sons were buried in the churchyard, as was Thomas Britton, the 'musical small-coal man' (see page 139). (fn. 14) Daniel Defoe's first child, Daniel, was baptised here in 1708. (fn. 15) Samuel Pepys recorded his attendance at the church on several occasions between 1661 and 1668, in the hope of catching glimpses of two local ladies, the beauteous Frances Butler and the remarkable Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle.\n\nDecorative improvements and 'beautifyings' of the church were made on several occasions during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, but little seems to have been done to address the building's structural defects. Few important alterations were made after about 1700, but one, the cause of controversy, was the erection of a new reredos in 1735. This was a sort of triptych in the form of an architectural fa\u00e7ade, with Corinthian pilasters and a broken pediment with a bishop's mitre occupying the break (Ill. 29). It caused great offence because of the subject matter of its paintings: a central panel of the Nativity with the Virgin Mary, and two flanking panels with images of Moses and Aaron. One correspondent to the Bishop of London denounced it as 'the Reproach of Protestantism, and very near ally'd to Images, which we so justly condemn in the Church of Rome'. A later description suggests that a vase subsequently took the place of the mitre; no doubt the offending pictures were also covered up or replaced. Carter's sketch of 1788 (Ill. 23) suggests a central picture (but no pediment), flanked by panels of writing. (fn. 16)\n\nThe New Church\n\nBy the early eighteenth century the poor structural condition of the old St James's was recognized. 'Our church', its churchwardens noted at the time of a visitation in 1711, 'hath lately been Beautify'd both within and without at the Charge of the Parishioners but it is in a very weak & crazy condition not capable to be long supported by the inhabitants'. (fn. 17) But though the church-building commission set up in that year identified the parish as one where an additional church ought to be built and looked into sites, rebuilding the old church was not considered. Instead, it was decided to purchase the remnant of the priory church of St John as a second church for Clerkenwell (see page 128). (fn. 18)\n\nThe question of rebuilding finally came to a head in 1786, when the Vestry set up a committee to look into the matter. Having contemplated reconstruction, a majority on the committee voted for another round of repairs. But an examination of the fabric by the Vestry's surveyor, Francis Carter, and another surveyor-architect, James Carr, found it to be in a parlous state; brought in to give a second opinion, the county surveyor, Thomas Rogers, condemned it outright. That convinced the committee to change tack and opt for rebuilding. Carter and Carr were appointed joint surveyors for the new church. In April 1787 they produced a ground plan, which was approved despite a last-ditch attempt by some vestrymen to keep and repair the old tower. Soon Carter dropped out, and Carr became sole surveyor. (fn. 19)\n\n29. Reredos erected in 1735 in old St James's Church\n\n30. St James's Church, west end. Drawing by John Coney, 1818\n\nAs often in Georgian church-building, it was necessary to secure a special Act before anything could be done. Passed early in 1788, this sanctioned the removal of the old building and empowered a large body of trustees to raise up to \u00a38,000 on the security of the rates for the new one by means of subscriptions and annuities. It was supplemented by a second Act in 1790. (fn. 20) Demolition of the old church had started by May 1788. Of the old materials a portion, it was reported that autumn, 'is now working up into houses in St George's Fields' (Southwark), while some found its way to Islington for use as hardcore in the foundations of a chapel, in what is now Gaskin Street. (fn. 21) Following competitive tenders, the building contract was awarded in August to John Lee, William Fielder and William Hopcraft, the last identifiable as a stonemason. (fn. 22) The arched vault or crypt of the new church was constructed 'over the same parts of the former structure', (fn. 23) and therefore to some extent the size and alignment of the building was dictated by its predecessor. Nothing of the old fabric appears to have been retained, however. But the more compact form of Carr's building permitted much of the old nave with the vestry room at its west end to be retained during the works, 'as decently fitted up as possible for prayer and preaching', until its successor was ready.

St James's Church, axonometric view of church and steeple\n\nThe foundation stone was laid on 16 December 1788, scaffolding on the spire was struck at the end of March 1791, and consecration took place on 10 July 1792. (fn. 25) The total cost was reckoned afterwards at \u00a311,674. (fn. 26)\n\nExterior\n\nSt James's is a fairly plain Georgian preaching box, wanting the geometrical conviction of London's best churches of the 1780s and 90s, such as Plaw's St Mary's, Paddington Green, or Spiller's St John-at-Hackney. What it lacks in architectural flair it makes up for in its elevated, village-like setting, just above Clerkenwell Green (Ill. 32). The west and south-west aspects, enlivened by the sweep of Clerkenwell Close and by Carr's fine if old-fashioned tower and steeple, have always been those most cherished. Originally old houses abutted close upon the east end, but that did not prevent Carr from providing an ample louvre under the gable to ventilate the roof, and below it the frame of a large Venetian window, blocked at first (Ill. 31). The north side was equally hemmed in, partly by a row of new houses also due to Carr (see above), and made irregular by the prominent projection of the vestry. The basic material of the exterior is brick, set off by Portland stone for dressings and architectural features. The roof, carried on nine king-post trusses, is shallow-pitched and slated (Ill. 37).\n\nThe ends of the open elevation to the south are embellished with two pedimented doorways, framed in the Tuscan order which runs quietly but consistently through the church's major features. The doors (the eastern one now blocked) are reached up steep flights of steps flanked by plain iron railings which appear to be of the early nineteenth century. But the principal approach to the church was from the west, where a portion of the Newcastle House ground was incorporated into the churchyard. (fn. 27) The flat-fronted and pedimented centrepiece on this elevation is faced in stone to read with the tower and steeple, while a three-sided flight of steps leads up to the rusticated west doorway (Ill. 30).\n\nThe square stone tower rises in two stages from the body of the church, surmounted by a steeple. This steeple, based on long-established models like St Martin-in-theFields and St Giles-in-the-Fields, was an afterthought. Carr's original design had called for a three-storey tower topped off with a wooden dome or cupola. Shorn of one storey in May 1788, the revised design is shown on the obverse of a medal struck to serve as a pass to the site. (fn. 28) The trustees evidently harboured ambitions to substitute a stone cupola for the wooden one. At first the extra cost deterred them, but in November 1790, with work on the tower well advanced, the wooden cupola was ousted in favour of the high stone steeple. A model of this was ordered from James Fisher and survives in the vestry room. (fn. 29) The tower contains a clock, with dials on three sides; the mechanism was made by the local firm of Thwaites in 1791. (fn. 30) Above the clock is a bell chamber with eight bells, seven of which were recast in the same year by Thomas Mears from the six bells in the old church. The first peal was rung in September 1791, well ahead of the consecration. (fn. 31)\n\nInterior\n\nThe west end consists of three compartments, with two double-height stairwells of generous dimensions flanking a lower octagonal central lobby. In the side compartments stone staircases with winders lead up to the galleries. The sheet-metal 'modesty boards' attached to the plain iron railings are presumably original; in 1792 the trustees agreed 'that something is necessary to be placed against the Balusters on the Gallery Stairs of a proper Height to screen them from the site [sic] of Persons below'. (fn. 32) All these spaces have been little altered. They have dado-height panelling, now painted, with plastered walls.\n\nIn the body of the church (Ills 34, 35), the main components of the galleried interior are also still Carr's, despite many later alterations. The most fetching feature, and the chief clue to its date along with the delicate plasterwork of the ceiling, is the curved west end, reminiscent of urban nonconformist chapels. Originally the interior was box-pewed. The pews on the ground floor were divided into two ranks with a wide central aisle between them, in which were placed three Honduras mahogany benches (soon augmented). The only survivals of the original seating are below the west gallery, the Corporation Pew to the south and the Church Officers' Pew to the north. These, along with the dados lining the aisles, are grained. Towards the east end, a high central pulpit and sounding board flanked by a clerk's desk dwarfed the communion table and reredos behind. Carr's first proposal for the pulpit took up too much room, so early in 1792 he designed another, with a hexagonal plan and a circular stairway. (fn. 33)\n\nAt the east end is a chaste tripartite reredos in the Tuscan order, with attached columns, pilasters, frieze and pediment, surmounted by a large Venetian window (Ill. 36). It was considerably altered in 1881\u20132. As first erected the reredos was lower than its present position, and 'painted in wainscot' to look like oak, with pillars and pilasters marbled. It framed four round\u2014headed panels inscribed with the Lord's Prayer left of centre, the Commandments in two narrow central panels beneath the pediment, and the Creed right of centre. Only the panels bearing the Lord's Prayer and the Creed survive, relettered and relocated left and right to the sides of the reredos. The pediment was originally crowned by the arms of George III, executed in Coade stone and dated 1792 (now to be found in the entrance lobby above the door into the nave). On the entablature to either side stood two 'flaming urns' of Adamesque profile, also of artificial stone. The crown and palm branches in the tympanum of the pediment were originally gilded, while gilt flowers also filled the metopes of the entablature. On either side of the reredos the walls were decorated with gilt plaster bas-reliefs of the communion utensils and other items, suspended by ribbons. (fn. 34)\n\nA striking difference between the interior as first built and its present-day appearance lies in the treatment of the area over the reredos. Originally the Venetian window opening here was blank, since houses behind entirely screened the eastern elevation. (fn. 35) In February 1792 the trustees accepted an offer from Thomas Greenwood, scene-painter at Sadler's Wells, Covent Garden and Drury Lane theatres, to paint free of charge, 'some ornaments at the east end of the church'. Four panels on frames were made to fill up the openings. On the central panel Greenwood painted the word 'Jehovah' in Hebrew, surrounded by a glory under a curtain, on the two side panels he painted various sacred emblems, and, on the semicircular panel at the top, infant angels and a dove descending. (fn. 36) No illustration is known of this rare feature, which disappeared in or before 1863.\n\nOnly the main gallery is original, the upper tier being a later addition. It is supported by Tuscan columns, hollow and enclosing iron cores. They are doubled up at the junctions with the western curve and at one time were painted to resemble veined marble. (fn. 37) The finest feature of the gallery, and indeed of the church as a whole, is the organ with its noble frontispiece, built in 1790\u20132 by George Pike England (see below).\n\n38. St James's Church, south elevation and plan in 1933\n\n39. St James's Church, looking west in 1858\n\nA complete list of craftsmen who worked on the new church does not survive, but some names are known. The original light fittings, including a three-tier 36-light central candelabrum, were produced by the Hoxton brassfounders John Horsley & Son, but do not survive. Much of the furniture, including the pulpit, was provided or executed by the Aldersgate firm Gilding & Banner, which was based temporarily in Newcastle House adjoining the church at this time or shortly before (see page 36). (fn. 38)\n\nAlterations since 1792\n\nOne early change to the church considered, though in the event not carried out, was the building of a western portico. At some stage Carr must have designed one, because when in 1812 the Trustees met to consider buying some columns for a portico, he produced his original plan (and two alternatives) and persuaded them not to proceed. (fn. 39) The portico was again discussed but rejected in 1824, and again in 1829\u201330. (fn. 40) No more is recorded of the matter in the trustees' minute books. But that some sort of competition for the portico may have been held around the latter date is suggested by a drawing, now known only from a photograph, inscribed with the romantic Italian motto Celato Nondimeno in Terra and bearing the date 1829. It shows a domed Doric circular portico of monumental grandeur, with a tetrastyle propylaeum in front for the approach from Clerkenwell Close. This rather juvenile design may relate to the fashion for urban improvement schemes around 1830. (fn. 41)\n\nThe first major executed change to the interior took place in 1822, when an upper tier of galleries was added to provide seating for some 500 children (Ill. 39). Hitherto they had been crammed into two recesses at the west end over the doors on to the main gallery. (fn. 42) Carr having died by then, the new galleries were designed by a Mr Blyth\u2014probably the surveyor Andrew Blyth of Goswell Street\u2014and made by Reddall & Ashby, carpenters and window manufacturers. Originally they extended from the organ right round to the east end, carrying across and partially obscuring the upper windows of the nave, and in the opinion of Thomas Cromwell 'improving the general aspect by relieving the former blankness of the walls'. They could be reached either from the two main staircases at the west end (whose reinforcement with iron columns and girders probably dates from this time) or from two new, very tight staircases boxed into the north-east and south-east corners of the church. Supported on slender iron columns, the upper galleries were 'light and not inelegant in appearance', with pretty ironwork fronts. (fn. 43) All that survives of them are two quadrants flanking the organ, which continue to add a theatrical touch to the interior (Ill. 35). In 1824, just after these galleries were installed, the sounding board was removed from the pulpit, presumably because it blocked the view of and muffled the sound of the preacher for those sitting high up. (fn. 44)\n\nIn a survey of 1843, the trustees' surveyor Ebenezer Perry found the upper part of the steeple to be 'considerably out of perpendicular' and 'quite far enough advanced towards a state of danger that its reinstatement should be no longer postponed'. (fn. 45) Nothing was done, however, until 1849, when in the wake of wind damage which took off the weather vane, the upper part of the spire was dismantled and rebuilt in Portland stone. Erected under the supervision of the local architect William Pettit Griffith, the replacement spire was apparently a faithful facsimile of the old. (fn. 46)\n\nThe inevitable Victorian refurbishment of St James's, though postponed until as late as 1881\u20132, was 'so radical as to amount to a transformation'. (fn. 47) The job of making this typical Georgian urban church interior more sacramental and therefore directed towards the altar was entrusted to Arthur W. Blomfield, architecturally expert in such conversions. On this occasion Blomfield appears to have subcontracted most of the work to his principal assistant, J. S. Paul, who is jointly credited with his master. The builders were Dove Brothers, equally experienced in such tasks; they also undertook a general restoration of the fabric. To achieve the desired liturgical result, the east end of the nave was raised a step and a squarish chancel area formed with a mosaic floor and choir stalls. The oldfashioned high box pews in the main body of the church were replaced with oak benches; and the 1822 galleries were cut back at the east end, the subsidiary staircases being removed. The pulpit and reading desk were cut down and the pulpit resited to one side. A brass eagle lectern, given by the Clerkenwell Lodge of Freemasons, was also installed. (fn. 48)\n\nIn 1899 another round of renovation and redecoration saw the extension of the mosaic pavements to the nave and aisle passages, the erection of a wrought-iron chancel screen, the installation of electric light, and the final ousting of the old wooden pulpit. This last was replaced by an open iron pulpit incorporated high up within the chancel screen itself\u2014a 'curious though not unpleasing device' in the view of the Daily Graphic. The work was carried out by Campbell, Smith & Co. under the superintendence of J. S. Paul & Sons. (fn. 49)\n\nThe present appearance of the interior is largely as altered by Dove Brothers following a report by the architect Thomas Ford in 1938. A restoration of the fabric in 1939 preceded substantive internal changes, apparently carried out during the early months of 1940. Ford removed Paul's iron chancel screen and integral pulpit and further cut back the upper galleries, leaving only the two short surviving stubs on either side of the organ. He also installed the present wooden pulpit. (fn. 50) In the 1990s Blomfield and Paul's choir stalls and lectern were removed.\n\nFurnishings and fittings\n\nReredos. Original wooden reredos remodelled by Blomfield and Paul, and raised 'to make the caps of columns range with cornice of gallery'. (fn. 51) The present three-arched openings with their subsidiary pilasters all date from 1881\u20132, as do the fibrous plaster panels they contain painted with the Commandments to the sides and the Communion injunction in the centre, and probably also the white-and-gold colour scheme. Of the four panels from the original arrangement two survive (inscribed with the Creed and the Lord's Prayer), resited on either side of the reredos.\n\nCommunion table. Bow-fronted, of mahogany inlaid with boxwood. Ordered in 1792 from the cabinet-maker Francis Gilding, of Gilding & Banner. (fn. 52)\n\nCommunion rails. The main section of these wrought-iron rails is also original, although they have been much altered, probably in 1881. (fn. 53)\n\nPulpit. Made from old pews in 1939, apparently to the design of Thomas Ford. (fn. 54)\n\nReading desks. The two reading-desks in the chancel are probably remnants of Blomfield and Paul's fittings, 1881\u20132.\n\nFonts. The main font is a circular stone basin on squat Romanesque marble pillars, installed by Blomfield and Paul in 1881\u20132, now in the south-east corner. A portable early nineteenth-century font of rosewood with a tricorn base, given by Michael Gillingham, stands near the pulpit. The original font, designed by Carr, was a 'handsome basin and pedestal of marble', though smaller than he had intended. Its position is not known. It was replaced in 1851 by a font designed by W. P. Griffith, who also raised the money to pay for it. Carved from Portland stone by the mason John Malcott, it consisted of a lead-lined bowl decorated with carved leaves, raised on a stumpy column with a moulded base. A simple Jacobean-style oak cover was given by a parishioner. (fn. 55) Griffith's font latterly stood at the west end of the central aisle, below the organ, where its successor may also have originally stood. (fn. 56)\n\nOrgan. By George Pike England, and inscribed on the front of its case 'England fecit 1792'. One of this distinguished maker's earliest instruments, it replaced an organ built for the old church in 1749 by his grandfather, Richard Bridges. The new instrument impressed the professionals, the organists at Windsor Castle and the Chapel Royal in St James's telling the building trustees that they 'could not have had a better one made anywhere'. (fn. 57) It was enlarged in 1877 by Gray & Davison and extensively altered in 1928\u20139 by Alphonse Noterman, who brought forward the case, building what was effectively a new organ inside with a detached pneumatical-action console in the gallery to the south. Noterman's changes were undone in 1978 when Noel Mander, a descendant of England, rebuilt the instrument 'on 18th-century foundations'. In twelve of the twenty-two speaking stops, the pipework is mostly England's. (fn. 58) Mander also restored England's mahogany case and scarlet paint to the carved drapery and hangings over the lower flats and central tower. The three finials on the pipe towers are not England's. The central finial, a sort of plumed helm almost touching the ceiling, was in place by 1941, when the two flanking towers terminated in hemispheres topped by decorated cones. Mander replaced these with the two flaming urns which had stood on either side of Noterman's console. (fn. 59)\n\nFigure of St James the Less. Probably dating from the eighteenth century, this stands over the inside of the main door from the central lobby into the church. It stood over the poor-box in the old parish church, and was then for many years in the vestry room of the present building. (fn. 60)\n\nStained glass\n\nStained and coloured glass was first introduced to the church in the 1860s. (fn. 61) During the 1881\u20132 reordering all the remaining clear glass was replaced by tinted cathedral glass. The earliest and largest of the stained-glass windows is the garish Ascension scene filling the Venetian east window, installed in 1863 by Alexander Gibbs & Co. to replace Greenwood's painted panels. The treatment of the subject attracted some criticism, especially the inclusion of the Virgin among the Apostles. The window is historically significant as an early example of the 'Raphaelesque' school in Victorian stained glass. (fn. 62)\n\nEast end. The two pictorial windows flanking the main east window, showing 'The Building of the Temple' (north) and 'The Queen of Sheba visiting the Temple on its completion' (south), were installed in 1882 as a gift from the Crusaders' Lodge of Freemasons, to designs by Charles Evans of Warwick Street. Masonic emblems and the arms of several lodges are included. (fn. 63)\n\nNorth side (under gallery). East: Memorial to Ephraimia, wife of the Rev. Robert Maguire, by Heaton, Butler & Bayne, 1866, and described as 'of the German School'. (fn. 64) Centre: Memorial to Helen Augusta Paget, made by James Powell & Sons, 1892, repeating a design by George Woolloscroft Rhead first used at St Stephen's church, Dublin. West: Memorial to the Rev. John Henry Rose, vicar, signed by T. F. Curtis of Ward & Hughes and dated 1899.\n\n40.

Robert Maguire's first ten years as incumbent, by Cox & Son, 1867. (fn. 65) Centre: Memorial to the Rev. C. J. Parker, vicar, by William Morris & Co. (Westminster), 1938. (fn. 66) West: Memorial to Benjamin R. Moore, clockmaker, by Arthur Louis Moore, signed and dated 1882.\n\nSouth side (over gallery). East: Memorial to Colonel Henry Penton (d. 1882), by John Jennings, founder of the Lambeth Art Glass Works.\n\nMonuments and memorials\n\nThe best monuments are all from the old church. A few of the more notable were re-erected at the expense of the Trustees; otherwise, old memorials were installed in the new church only if relatives or other interested parties footed the bill. (fn. 67) Among the old monuments destroyed were those of Isabella Sackville, last prioress of St Mary's nunnery; Thomas Bedingfield, Master of the Tents and Pavilions to James I; and John Weever, the poet and antiquary. Only the monuments to Thomas Crosse, William Wood and possibly Henry Penton were immediately installed in the body of the new church. Others were originally stored in the crypt and only gradually moved up during the nineteenth century. Two older monuments re-erected in the new church were the mutilated effigy of Lady Elizabeth Berkeley (d. 1585), lady of the bedchamber to Elizabeth I, illustrated by Pinks (fn. 68) and now preserved in an ante-room, and the skeletal effigy of Sir William Weston, the last prior of St John's monastery. The architectural setting of Weston's tomb (see Ill. 159 on page 133) was destroyed in 1788, but his effigy was preserved and in 1882 placed under the easternmost window on the north side of the nave, a site comparable to its position in the old church. In 1931 it was removed to the crypt of St John's Church (see page 133). (fn. 69) The first new monument, erected in 1792, was an oval tablet to the minister, the Rev. William Sellon, put up by his son. (fn. 70)\n\n41. St James's Church, monument to Countess of Exeter (d. 1654)\n\nThe following is a select list of monuments, chronologically arranged.\n\nJohn Bell (d. 1556), Bishop of Worcester 1539\u201343. Brass, the oldest memorial in the church. Bell retired to Clerkenwell and was buried in the old church. The top of his crozier, long missing, was restored in the 1990s, having been found in Hereford Cathedral.\n\nElizabeth, Countess Dowager of Exeter (d. 1654). Marble mural monument with heraldic carving (Ill. 41).\n\nSir William Wood (d. 1691), marshal of the Society of Finsbury Archers and author of The Bowman's Glory, or, Archery Revived. Inscribed tomb-stone which stood outside the old church, against the south wall. In 1792 it was placed on the wall of the south gallery staircase, the Toxophilite Society of London having paid for its restoration. (fn. 71)\n\nElizabeth Partridge (n\u00e9e Holder, d. 1702, aged 17). A Baroque cartouche with weeping putti, drapery, skull and a half-length alto relievo of Elizabeth herself in a roundel. It has lost its original colouring and gilding, and shield with impaled arms of the Partridge and Holder families. Stored in the crypt until placed in its present position in 1858. (fn. 72)\n\nThomas Crosse (d. 1712) and his wife, incorporating portrait busts of the couple (Ill. 40). Erected in 1722 at the Vestry's expense in recognition of Crosse's 'great acts of charity to the poor of this parish'. By an unknown sculptor. The long-accepted attribution to Roubiliac, who did not come to England until the 1730s, is now rejected on grounds of both chronology and quality. (fn. 73)\n\nGilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury (d. 1715). This inscribed black marble floor slab, one of two memorials to Burnet in St James's, originally covered his grave in the old church which was near the altar. It was cut by Edward Stanton. (fn. 74) The second memorial was put up by the Vestry in 1715. Architectural cartouche, incorporating scrolls and books (including Burnet's own History), surmounted by his arms under a mitre. Signed Robert Hartshorne, one of Edward Stanton's assistants. Stored in the vaults after rebuilding, it was restored and fixed in the south staircase compartment in 1819 (Ill. 40). (fn. 75)\n\nHenry Penton of Lincoln's Inn (d. 1715), purchaser of what became the Pentonville estate. Decorated marble obelisk wall tablet (Ill. 40).\n\nJohn Short (d. 1794), late of Edlington, Lincolnshire, and a lord of the Manor of Clerkenwell. Marble wall tablet with coat-of-arms.\n\nThomas Greatorex (d. 1824) and his sister, Mrs Mary Fox (d. 1840). Neo-Hellenic tablet, signed J. Hollis of Goswell Road.\n\nWilliam Clare (d. 1838) and his wife, Sarah (d. 1845). Signed John James Sanders of Keppel Row, New Road.\n\nAbud family (d. 1827, 1842 and 1848). Signed John Malcott of Newgate Street, who was also responsible for James Carr's monument in Cheshunt Church, Hertfordshire, (fn. 76) and W. P. Griffith's font of 1851.\n\nRev. W. E. L. Faulkner (d. 1856). Signed James Samuel Farley of Goswell Road.\n\nMemorial to victims of the Clerkenwell Explosion. An emotionally worded tablet to the six people killed in 1867 when an attempt was made to free Fenians awaiting trial in the nearby Middlesex House of Detention.\n\nMemorial to the Protestant Martyrs, consecrated 1963. Black painted board with the names inscribed in gold of the 66 Protestants burned at Smithfield during the reign of Mary Tudor. The martyrs were formerly commemorated in the Smithfield Martyrs Memorial Church, demolished in 1955 (see page 313). (fn. 77)\n\nVestry Room\n\nOn the north side of the church is the vestry room, entered from the north vestibule and lobby. An original feature of Carr's church, it is an airy and well-lit space, the trustees having ordered that it should be more than two feet six inches higher than Carr had originally intended. (fn. 78) The room retains its original wooden chimneypiece, tall panelled dado and various doorways, some giving access to cupboards. Gilding & Banner supplied a suite of mahogany furniture in 1792, comprising two seven-foot tables, four benches, each four feet long, one large chair and six small ones. (fn. 79) None of these pieces remains in the room, but a mahogany armchair now in the chancel may be part of this set. On a bracket above the fireplace is Fisher's model of the steeple, adapted as a clock.\n\nCrypt\n\nBeneath the church is a large crypt (Ill. 42), 102 ft by 53 ft, with simple quadripartite brick vaults originally supported on brick piers, and intended for storing the coffins, grave slabs and many of the monuments salvaged from the old church. More of a semi-basement than a true crypt, it was commended by Pinks for not having 'that gloomy cheerless aspect common to such places of sepulture \u2026 being well lighted and ventilated' by open windows, on all four sides, filled only with protective iron grilles. (fn. 80) Having been reorganized by Blomfield and Paul in 1882, it was cleared of coffins in 1910\u201311, when it was converted into a hall or schoolroom with a stage, a gymnasium and other rooms off. The floor was then lowered six feet, the brick piers were removed and replaced by steel girders resting on pairs of cast-iron columns, and the windows lengthened and glazed. (fn. 81)\n\n42. St James's Church, view of crypt in 1995\n\nChurchyard and St James's Garden\n\nThe spacious area of grass and trees surrounding St James's Church today contrasts with its original cloakedin situation, houses then abutting closely to the building on the north and east. Those to the east were already old, but those on the north, replacing Newcastle House and its garden, were the private speculation of the church's architect (page 36). So concerned were the trustees that in 1792 they sought agreement with Carr to secure sufficient light to the new vestry room. (fn. 82) They also acquired from him a small piece of the Newcastle House ground to make a proper entrance to the west door of the church. The iron railings around the west and south-west borders of the churchyard, erected on a brick retaining wall with castiron copings, date from this period. They have gates with overthrows and oil-lamp holders aligned on the west and south-west doors.\n\nTo the south-east of the church, a large piece of ground was taken from the Green and added to the churchyard. This was enclosed by a low wall and railings, with a gate at the corner, from where a path led diagonally to the south-east door of the church (see Ill. 98 on page 92).\n\nBurials having ceased, in 1890 the graveyard to the south and south-east of the church was laid out as a public garden to the design of the Vestry's surveyor, William Iron. A small portion along the east side was sacrificed to widen St James's Walk. (fn. 83) Nothing survives of Iron's layout of curving walks, but some of the plane trees in this part of the churchyard probably date from that time (Ill. 33).\n\nDrastic clearance for a public open space planned by the London County Council in the 1960s would have swept away most of the buildings on the north side of the Green and left the church in more or less splendid isolation. Some ground north and east of the church was cleared, and with the abandonment of the scheme was laid out as a garden and children's playground called St James's Garden."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/projects/London-Monumental-Inscriptions-Cemeteries-and-Graveyards/17486", "page_content": "Monumental Inscriptions, Cemeteries and Graveyards of London\n\nImage Right - Bow Cemetery\n\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to gather together information regarding cemeteries and graveyards in the county which either have available transcriptions or have been photographed and transcribed.\n\nThis project is an index with links to external web pages recording transcriptions and/or photographic records of graves.

and a plain monument is now erecting on the spot, by some of her friends\u2026\u201d\n\nApart from the fact it is where her mother was buried, the grave played an important role in Shelley\u2019s story. Not only is it said that her father, William Godwin, taught her to read her name by tracing the letters on the gravestone, it later became a place of key importance for Shelley in her developing relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\nIn fact, it was at this gravestone that Mary and the poet would meet in secret prior to their elopement to Europe (some even speculate it was here that they first consummated their love). Secrecy was a necessity \u2013 Percy Shelley was already married and Mary\u2019s father disapproved of their relationship.\n\nInterestingly, Wollstonecraft is no longer buried here (although the gravestone still stands there). In 1851, as per the wishes of Mary Shelley, Wollstonecraft\u2019s remains \u2013 and those of her husband which were buried there after his death \u2013 were removed by her grandson, Percy Florence Shelley and reinterred in the Shelley family tomb in St Peter\u2019s Churchyard in Bournemouth.\n\nThe tomb is Grade II-listed. The lettering was restored in 1992 to mark the bicentenary of the publication of Wollstonecraft\u2019s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.\n\nPICTURE: The gravestone in St Pancras Old Churchyard (Chris Beckett/licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0/Image cropped and lightened)"}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Clarke-74", "page_content": "Thomas Clarke aka Clark aka [uncertain]\n\nabout 1599 in England Bornin\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nSusanna (Ring) Clarke Husband of\u2014 married before 1634 [location unknown]\n\nAlice (Hallet) Clark Husband of\u2014 married after 1664 [location unknown]\n\nDescendants\n\n24 Mar 1697 at about age 98 in Plymouth, Plymouth, Province of Massachusetts Bay Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 2 Feb 2023 | Created 11 Jun 2010\n\nThis page has been accessed 14,121 times.\n\nThomas Clarke migrated to New England during the Puritan Great Migration (1620-1640).

Please do not merge Clarke-680 Thomas Clarke born 1605 to Thomas Clarke and Rose (Kerrich) Clarke, into this profile.\n\nBiography\n\nThomas Clarke was born circa 1599, based on his age at death[1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nHe may, or may not, have been \"Thomas son of John Clarke of Ratliff\" who was baptized 8 March 1599/1600 at St. Dunstan's, Stepney, Middlesex [5] , but this theory has not been proven [2] . See research notes on disputed father below.\n\n, but this theory has not been proven . See research notes on disputed father below. He may, or may not have been the son of John Clarke, the pilot of the Mayflower[5] [3], but this theory has not been proven[2]. See research notes on disputed father below.\n\nHe arrived in New England in July 1623 on the Anne[6] [2] [5] [3] [4], and was admitted as a freeman on January 1, 1632/3[7] [2]\n\nThomas Clarke was referred to as a carpenter, merchant, yeoman, and gentleman, and pursued various business and land development interests in Plymouth, Boston and Barnstable[5]. He also served as Constable, Highway surveyor and Deputy. Court proceedings show that he was literate and had an interest in legal matters[2].\n\nBefore July 1631, he married Suzanna Ring.[2] [5] [3] [4] [8] This marriage date is derived from her mother's will, which referred to her as my daughter Suzanna Clark.[9]\n\nTheir children included: [5][2] [4]\n\nWilliam, born about 1634, who married Sarah Wolcott and Hannah Griswold James, born about 1636, who married Abigail Lothrop Suzanne, born about 1638, who married Barnabas Lothrop John, born about 1640, whose wife was Sarah Unknown Nathaniel, born about 1642, who married Dorothy (Lettice) Gray, daughter of Thomas Lettice and widow of Edward Gray Andrew, born about 1644, who married Mehitable Scotto\n\nSuzanna's death date is not known, but it is reasonable to assume she died before her husband remarried.\n\nOn January 20, 1664/5, Thomas married Alice (Hallett) Nichols, daughter of Richard Hallett, and widow of Mordecai Nichols.[2] [5] [3] [4] [10] No further children are noted in these sources.\n\nThe family moved from Plymouth to Boston by 1660, then returned to Plymouth in 1678, and may have lived in Barnstable on occasion.[2]\n\nThomas Clarke died March 24, 1697, at age 97.[1][2] [5] [3] [4], and is buried on Burial Hill[11] [12] [13]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nPossible Father\n\nSome sources give John Clarke born 1575, the pilot on the Mayflower, as Thomas' father.\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nThere is a record for a marriage between a John Clarke and a Mary Morton in the St. Dunstan's Church, Stepney Parish, Middlesex dated 1598. [ citation needed ]\n\nThere is a record for a baptism \"Thomas son of John Clarke of Ratliff\" dated 8 March 1599/1600, also at St. Dunstan's (see Anderson, above). This was soon after the marriage and could be our John.\n\nThe headstone for Thomas places his date of birth around 1599, consistent with the baptism record.\n\nJohn sailed back to Virginia aboard the Providence, arriving in April 1623 (and died in Jamestown shortly thereafter). Thomas arrived in Mass. July of 1623 aboard the Anne. He could have been following his father.\n\narriving in April 1623 (and died in Jamestown shortly thereafter). Thomas arrived in Mass. July of 1623 aboard the Anne. He could have been following his father. The Clarke family genealogy (incorrectly) attributes Thomas as being the Mayflower Pilot. This is family lore that was passed down through the generations. It might have been a simple matter to confuse father John with son Thomas. The fact that there's some connection in the family account at least lends credence to the idea.\n\nPilot. This is family lore that was passed down through the generations. It might have been a simple matter to confuse father John with son Thomas. The fact that there's some connection in the family account at least lends credence to the idea. Thomas' grandson Nathaniel was widely known to espouse the theory in his later years\n\nDonald Lines Jacobus, a noted genealogist, accepted the theory [3]\n\nRobert Charles Anderson later called the theory \"very attractive, but unproven.\"[2]\n\nIncorrect Attribution as Ship's Pilot\n\nDespite a mistaken account in an early Clark Genealogy[14], and a history of the town of Plymouth,[15] which confused Thomas Clarke with his possible father, Thomas Clarke could not have been the Pilot of the Mayflower. He would have been 12 years old when beginning his career as a Pilot to the New World, and 21 years old at the time of the 1620 Mayflower sailing. Master's Mates were second in command of the ship - a position of great responsibility - and the job of Pilot was bestowed only after years of experience and voyages. It is well established that John Clarke was the Pilot of the Mayflower.[16] [2] [3]\n\nIncorrect Wife\n\nSome sources claim Thomas married a third time, Elizabeth Crow on 12 February 1689/90,[citation needed] however this is accepted to be an error. Elizabeth Crow's spouse was a deacon, and this Thomas Clarke was not. Further, Thomas was ninety years old at the time of this marriage, and had been living as a widower for nearly twenty years.[2] [3] [17]\n\nSources\n\nSee also:"}, {"url": "https://southwellchurches.nottingham.ac.uk/nottingham-st-mary/hchyard.php", "page_content": "Nottingham\n\nSt Mary Churchyard The churchyard contains an area of approximately 6270 square yards including the site of the church: the boundaries are, on the North: Kayes Walk, the South: High Pavement, the East: Stoney Street, the West: St Mary\u2019s Gate.\n\naround the Church, several\n\n\n\nbeen used by St Mary\u2019s since\n\nthe 18 th Century. In addition to the Churchyardaround the Church, several other burial grounds havebeen used by St Mary\u2019s sincethe 18Century. St Mary\u2019s churchyard has served at least three churches suggesting that people have been buried here since Anglo Saxon times. Stone Coffins The Stone coffin in St Mary\u2019s churchyard was unearthed in February 1912 when the Lady Chapel was being built. For years it stood lidless on the grass but was moved to make way for the Memorial Garden, dedicated at Easter 2002. Now, filled with earth, it serves as a flower trough near the east wall of the chancel. Stone coffins are occasionally seen in ancient churchyards, sometimes with interestingly carved covers. Although they were for high status burials they were recovered at a later date and reused for other burials. A second stone coffin was found in February 1912 four feet deep but badly damaged and is no longer to be seen. In the Chapter House there is a framed drawing of this coffin which had contained a small silver cross. Alfred Stapleton mentions graves in the same area cut into the bedrock of the churchyard six or seven feet below the level of the church which bore the same distinctive hole cut for the head as can be seen in the stone coffins. In 1948 a Faculty for laying down the headstones included \u2018to remove the ancient stone coffins at present outside the church...\u2019 Bone Holes In the past churchyard space was re-used and bones from previous graves stored in ossuaries, bone holes or bone houses. Bone holes excavated from the sandstone in the churchyard provided storage when old graves were excavated for new ones. The medieval door on the north wall was once an exterior door into the church. It has been confirmed by English Heritage that the area behind it was once a chantry chapel which was built after the church was completed. It was being used as a bone house in the first quarter of the 19th century when a note was made that the heating furnace was situated under it. A Mr Samuel Smith claimed that between 1819 and 1826 there was a small trapdoor in the churchyard near the wall next to St Mary\u2019s Gate, which appeared to be a bone hole. He mentions two slate gravestones dated 1736 and 1758 forming a side and top to this shaft. He descended the ladder inside the shaft and discovered a cave containing bones. A bone hole excavated out of the rock, probably the one described by Mr Smith and existing as late as 1912 (by the High Pavement boundary wall in line with the south west corner of the church) was marked by a ventilation grating which rested on three side stones. It was filled up with surplus soil excavated during building work on the Lady Chapel in February 1912 and the site obliterated. However, it is described by Alfred Stapleton, who visited it in January that year. It was entered by climbing down a ladder in a narrow brick-lined shaft with the churchyard wall forming the fourth side of the shaft. The cave hollowed out of the bedrock was roughly circular and estimated to be up to 11\u00bd feet wide. Cut into the rocky sides were shelved recesses about 15 inches wide. In 1911 the heating apparatus for the church was operated from a deep rock excavation 40 steps down on the north side of the church between the old vestry and the north transept and reputed to have been a bone hole. It was rediscovered in the 1990s when a paving stone collapsed but was immediately resealed. Earliest Descriptions Possibly the earliest eyewitness mention of the churchyard is that of an action to recover the value of a tombstone broken by the felling of a tree. The year was 1394, the stone (value 6s 8d) was on the tomb of one Robert Langar; the complainant was John Albyn, the plaintiff John Ile and the Vicar at the time was Robert de Retford. From 1600, victims of the county gallows were interred in the churchyard between the Vicar\u2019s vestry and north transept. On the 7 July 1600 it is recorded that six named persons were \u201cExecuted and Buryed\u201d. Other instances of multiple executions are recorded in 1631, 1646, 1647 and 1679. Many prisoners from the Queen\u2019s and King\u2019s gaol who died whilst in captivity are also buried in the churchyard, as was Katherin, a young maid servant unto Richard Singell who hanged herself, 12 July 1605. On 30th July 1776 James Bromage and William Wainer, two young men who had formerly been of good character but found guilty of robbery were made to listen to a sermon, then lie in the graves they would occupy later to check the fit before walking to the gallows in their shrouds. St Mary\u2019s Churchyard was not always the peaceful place it is now. In ancient days churchyards were used for all sorts of purposes which we would find very strange. Merrymaking and church ales were held within its borders. On 12th October 1629, the Mickletorn Jury, a body which was charged with the general oversight of the decorum and well-being of the medieval town prosecuted Ann Hind for wilfully putting her swine into the churchyard, whereof she deserves great punishment. Thoroton\u2019s 1670 map shows a row of houses along the High Pavement frontage of the churchyard, commencing at St Mary\u2019s Gate \u2013 with an additional house at the corner of High Pavement and Stoney Street. Blackner describes them as a \u2018chantry house belonging to the Bridge Estate and several little dwellings belonging to the vicarage\u2019. A vestry meeting in July 1719 records that the churchwardens of St Mary\u2019s should allow the Vicar \u00a32, at two payments, in consideration of a house in the churchyard \u2018at the north-west end of the Church, near Dr Bee\u2019s house\u2019, which the contemporary Vicar, Samuel Berdmore, consented should be pulled down. The Borough records say: It is this day ordered yat the chamberlyns for the tyme being take downe the several howses against the south side of Saint Marye\u2019s churchyard that are now untenanted thereof to the use of this Corporation. Hollow Stone was widened in 1740 and the house on the corner of Stoney Street which had belonged to the Duke of Kingston no longer existed when the 1744 Badder & Peet map was made. The Terrier mentions a house in the churchyard having been taken down to enlarge the space for burials. Churchyard Wall In 1792 the other houses were demolished and the old churchyard wall and a portion of the churchyard cut away. There are stories of graves being disturbed during the work. At the end of the 18th century the churchyard extended across Kayes Walk to large houses and gardens in a continuous sweep of green. The wealthy Plumptre family had only yards to walk across the churchyard from their house to take their places in the North transept, reserved for their use. The present east wall along Stoney Street was built in 1804, followed by the south wall along High Pavement. In 1806 the churchyard was enclosed by iron railings with a gate at each corner. At the entrance to the churchyard were iron rings that held thick glass globes of whale oil with a floating wick for lighting before gas lighting was introduced to Nottingham. Two of these were recorded in 1928 and one is still to be seen at the High Pavement entrance at the top of Hollow Stone. Kayes Walk was constructed in 1807 and taken off the north side, which had formerly been part of the churchyard. Prior to that there was a public footpath through the churchyard linking St Mary\u2019s Gate with Stoney Street. There was a stile at each end of the path, the one at the east end commonly accepted to have been over 200 years old. Eight old gravestones were propped up against the church wall, the remains of some can now be seen along this busy pathway. The fact that it had originally been part of the churchyard explains why human remains were discovered beneath it when the pavement on Kayes Walk collapsed during work on the footpath in 1998. Kayes Walk was named after the Rev Sir Richard Kaye, Bart LL.D., Rector of Marylebone, Prebend of Southwell, Archdeacon of Nottingham and Prebend and Dean of Lincoln. He died in 1809 and was buried at Lincoln but had something more remarkable than a pathway named after him. Captain Cook\u2019s Journal dated 11th May 1778 tells: I bore up for the island \u2013 I left a bottle with a paper in it on which were inscribed the names of the ships and the date of our discovery, and along with it I enclosed two silver twopenny pieces of his Majesty\u2019s coin of the date 1772. These, with many others, were furnished me by Rev. Dr. Kaye (now Dean of Lincoln) and as a mark of my esteem and regard for that gentleman; I named the island after him, \u2018Kaye\u2019s Island\u2019. At the corner of Kayes Walk and St Mary\u2019s Gate stood a large house where in 1812, Mr Trentham, the owner, was shot at his front door by miscreants who had been hiding behind the tombstones in the churchyard. He survived but his attackers were never caught, despite large rewards being offered. After Mr Trentham\u2019s death in 1820 the house was owned by Mr Daft Smith Churchill, one of the original directors of the General Cemetery. Mr Churchill perished in the wreck of the \u2018Forfarshire\u2019 off Farne Lighthouse in 1837. The tragedy is best known for the story of the courage of Grace Darling and her father who rowed out in an attempt to rescue the victims of the wreck. A large monument was erected by his co-directors in memory of Mr Churchill near the Derby Road entrance of the General Cemetery. However after his death his son had it demolished. During excavations for the cellars and foundations a long tunnel was discovered running northwards from the graveyard. A wall was built across it for the foundations of the new building. In 1911 a Faculty was granted for the erection of a \u2018Morning Chapel\u2019 (now known as the Lady Chapel) on the South side of the existing Chancel ... to remove certain monuments, monumental tablets or tombstones relating to deceased persons interred in the Churchyard of the said Parish as specified in plan numbered three so deposited and also any bodies or remains which may be found there under and to re-enter (sic) such bodies or remains and place such monuments, monumental tablets or tombstones in another portion of the said churchyard provided that a plan with the corresponding numbers showing the positions to which such bodies or remains and also the monuments ... tombstones are respectively removed shall be filed in the Registry of our said Court as aforesaid. In 1939 the Choir vestry was built on the north side of the church and some graves were removed. The remains were re-interred in the Southern Cemetery at Wilford Hill and certain tablets and Memorial stones were reinstated. The graves and tombstones removed included eleven names: Askew, Bramley, Broderip, Eddowe, Mather, Oakland, Osborne, Porter, Robinson, Troop, Widerton. North side of the\n\nchurchyard with many\n\nstones laid flat In 1948 a Faculty was granted to lay down the gravestones in the churchyard. Exceptions included the terra cotta Sefton memorial and the table tomb to the memory of William Crofts. The ancient stone coffins at present outside the church were moved and any stones which had been part of the church fabric were buried in the churchyard. Alfred Stapleton mentions that both Deering and Blackner had seen ancient tombs and memorials at St Mary\u2019s and thought it was a pity they hadn\u2019t recorded them for posterity. Old stories about obsolete gravestones being recycled include one in premises in St Mary\u2019s Gate and another one in a cellar on Kayes Walk. Named Tombstones In 1907 Alfred Stapleton transcribed the memorials in the St. Mary\u2019s Churchyard and Burying grounds. Stapleton recorded a total of about 600 stones, 580 memorials, some illegible, making approximately 550 supplying definite information, one third of which carry visible 18th century dates, one quarter carrying 19th century in addition to 18th century dates in the churchyard. The earliest is 1707 and the latest is 1882, alphabetically Abnet to Young; 440 surnames, with additional 22 unduplicated surnames which were used as Christian names. The Barker Gate memorials range alphabetically from Aldridge to Young and total 210 with 13 surnames used as Christian names. The War Memorial at the south west gate was dedicated in 1922. Plaque on the east\n\nend of the church Garden of Remembrance In 1958 permission was granted to reserve a space at the east end of the church for the interment of cremated remains. This area is now a Garden of Remembrance. The plaque on the outside of the west wall indicating the Garden of Remembrance was made by stone mason John Shaw MA FRSA of Saxby, Lincolnshire. It was dedicated on Easter Sunday 2002 Interesting Graves in the Churchyard Buried in St. Mary\u2019s old graveyards are people from Crich (Derbyshire), Leeds, several from Leicestershire, Belton near Grantham, Woolsthorpe by Belvoir Castle and Manchester. One interesting memorial was to a Mr Taylor who died on his passage from Tahiti to Melbourne. Clay headstone of\n\nthe Sefton family The oldest stone is one engraved \u201cMorris 1713\u201d lying in the paving to the west of the church. The latest was that of Alderman Twiner dated 1882. One of the earliest, rarest and most unusual memorials in the churchyard today is the clay gravestone made by clay-pipe-maker William Sefton for his two youngest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary who died in 1707 (the earliest date in the churchyard) and 1714 respectively. After nearly 300 years, this stone is now rather weathered but some of the letters stamped onto it can still be seen. The stone remains upright near the path at the northwest corner of the church. In 1907 Alfred Stapleton recorded the words with the comment, \u201cThe inscription now difficult to read\u201d: Here lyeth the body of Mary the daughter of Wm. & Elizabeth Sefton who departed this life May the 30 th in the 6 th year of her age in 17[1]4. Here lyeth the body of Elezabeth ye daughter of Wm. & Elezabeth Sefton who departed this life May the 29 in the **th year of her age in 1707. Bearing in mind how it was made, this stone must have been made after the death of the second daughter. On the north (Kayes Walk) side of the churchyard is the grave of William Doubleday Crofts, chief ringer and conductor of St Mary\u2019s bell ringers in the 1770s. On the north side of the churchyard are the graves of George Africanus and his wife Esther and that of George Africanus junior their 14 year-old son. Nottingham\u2019s first black citizen, George Africanus came as a child from Sierra Leone, was brought up by Benjamin Molyneux in Wolverhampton, baptised, educated, trained as a brassfounder, married into a Nottingham family, became a burgess with full voting rights, prospered, bought his house and lived in Nottingham from about 1784 until his death at the age of about 71 in 1834. The gravestone of George and his wife Esther was probably erected by their only surviving daughter Hannah and read: In memory of George Africanus who died May 19th 1834 aged 70 years Also Ester Africanus, wife of the above Who died May 12th 1853 Aged 81 years O cruel death that separated here\n\nA loving father from his daughter dear\n\nAlso a tender parent in decline of life\n\nA loving mother and a careful wife\n\nWhile in this world they did remain\n\nTheir latter Days were full of pain. The sandstone gravestone of George senior was heavily weathered and became impossible to read. A new slate memorial with the freshly engraved inscription was inserted into it for the Bicentenary of the 1807 abolition of slavery. From The Parish Records: (1763-1796) Burials: Isaac Son of Thomas Beardsley. An extraordinary story is related on the headstone, in St Mary\u2019s churchyard, to the memory of this unfortunate youth: In memory of Isaac Beardsley the son of Thomas & Eliz: Beardsley who Departed this life the 9th day of November 1765: in ye 12th Year of his Age. Stop Passenger to Ponder on this stone,\n\nAnd think how soon this cruel Deed was done;\n\nA wicked Wretch Pursu\u2019d my Life to Slay,\n\nBecause to shut a Gate I would not stay:\n\nSo he pursu\u2019d till me he over took,\n\nJust by a Gap on th\u2019 Margin of a Brook\n\nAnd fear\u2019d it is he firmly did intend\n\nTo my short Life to put a final end This headstone was recorded in 1907 by Alfred Stapleton but is no longer to be found.
