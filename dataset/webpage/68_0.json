Hij was de tweede zoon van prins Honorius IV en volgde zijn broer Honorius V op die zonder wettelijke opvolger was overleden. Onvoorbereid op deze taak - hij was acteur bij een theatergezelschap - liet hij het feitelijke bestuur over aan zijn echtgenote Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz, eveneens een actrice die hij huwde in 1816. Tijdens zijn regeerperiode kwamen de plaatsen Menton en Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in opstand en verklaarden zichzelf onafhankelijk onder de bescherming van het koninkrijk Sardini\u00eb. Deze plaatsen maakten 80% uit van de oppervlakte van het prinsdom. In het jaar 1861, bij de assimilatie van Sardini\u00eb door het ontstane koninkrijk Itali\u00eb, werden de plaatsen formeel aan Frankrijk afgestaan. Het vorstelijke paar had 2 kinderen: * prins Karel, als troonopvolger (1818-1889) * prinses Florestine (1833-1897) (nl)\n\nFlorestan I av Monaco, f\u00f6dd i Paris 10 oktober 1785, d\u00f6d 20 juni 1856, var en monark (furste) av Monaco. Han var son till Honor\u00e9 IV av Monaco och Louise d'Aumont. Florestan var initialt verksam som sk\u00e5despelare, och gifte sig 1816 med en kollega, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz, med vilken han fick en dotter och en son. Han hade en \u00e4ldre bror, Honor\u00e9 V, och f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntades aldrig bli furste i Monaco, som han aldrig hade bes\u00f6kt f\u00f6re sitt trontilltr\u00e4de. 1826 \u00e4rvde han en f\u00f6rm\u00f6genhet av sin mor. \u00c5r 1841 avled brodern ogift och utan en legitim son, och Florestan eftertr\u00e4dde honom.

Era o segundo filho do pr\u00edncipe Honorato IV e Lu\u00edsa de Aumont, tendo ascendido ao trono ap\u00f3s a morte de seu irm\u00e3o Honorato V. Florestan nunca foi preparado para assumir o papel de pr\u00edncipe soberano: ele tinha sido um ator no Theatre de l\u2019Ambigu-Comique. Na verdade, o poder real durante seu reinado estava concentrado nas m\u00e3os de sua esposa, Maria Carolina Gibert de Lametz. Por algum tempo, ela p\u00f4de aliviar a situa\u00e7\u00e3o de dificuldade econ\u00f4mica origin\u00e1ria da nova posi\u00e7\u00e3o de M\u00f4naco como protectorado do Reino de Sardenha, ent\u00e3o o poder regional, em vez da Fran\u00e7a. O casal real tamb\u00e9m tentou encontrar demandas locais por maior democracia e ofereceu duas constitui\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o local, mas estas foram rejeitadas, particularmente pelo povo de Menton. Quando eles perceberam que seus esfor\u00e7os falharam, concederam o poder ao seu filho Carlos (depois Carlos III). No entanto, era tarde demais. Encorajados pelos eventos de 1848, as cidades de Menton e Roquebrune se revoltaram e declararam-se independentes. Elas esperavam ser anexadas por Sardenha, mas isso n\u00e3o ocorreu, e continuaram no estado de limbo pol\u00edtico at\u00e9 serem finalmente cedidas \u00e0 Fran\u00e7a em 1861, no reinado de Carlos III. Apesar de suas boas inten\u00e7\u00f5es, no momento de morte de Florestan em 1856, M\u00f4naco era um pa\u00eds dividido com poucas perspectivas de prosperidade financeira.

Between the reigns of Honor\u00e9 I in 1523 and Honor\u00e9 II just over one hundred years later it was the great rivalries between Spain and France through which Monaco had to ingeniously steer a course.\n\nThe reign of Honor\u00e9 II (1604\u20131662) in many ways could be considered a miracle against the turbulence of the age. Not only did he protect Monaco\u2019s independence, he secured additional formal recognition of it in the diplomatic arena with clarity on the title Prince (rather than Lord or Seigneur) and had the right to mint his own coinage since 1640.\n\nHonor\u00e9 II lulled his Spanish host-occupiers into believing their strategy of limiting his powers was working. They were happy to see him immerse himself in a role devoted to cultural pursuits and entertainment of foreign guests. Meanwhile the Spanish kept a tight rein on governance, protected by their occupying garrison on the Rock. They also limited the role of the Monaco Ruling Council much to the resentment of the Monegasque population. In the meantime Honor\u00e9 turned his custodianship in the cultural domain into a strategic victory for the Principality. Monaco became a magnet for poets, artists, sculptors and musicians. The Princely Palace joined Paris and Florence as a European centre of great culture and learning. Indeed, the quality of the art collection of Prince Honor\u00e9 became a topic of conversation across Europe.\n\nAnd another transformation took place out of what had been originally more a feature of the military fortifications on the Rock. The apartments for the Prince, previously enlarged and renovated by Honor\u00e9 I, became even more regal and palatial. And similarly with the Church of Saint Nicholas.\n\nWhile all the time lulling the Spanish occupiers into a false sense of security Honor\u00e9 was quietly planning his crowning achievement \u2014 to rid Monaco of the oppressive Spanish to whom it had become partially victim.\n\nTreaty of P\u00e9ronne\n\nWorking discreetly, Prince Honor\u00e9 II negotiated with Cardinal Richelieu of France, who represented King Louis XIII. Out of that came the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641) which stipulated that Monaco become a French protectorate. However, most importantly the independent status of the Prince was guaranteed. Monaco was also granted lands in France to compensate for inevitable losses that the break from Spain would entail.\n\nFrench troops were envisaged as garrisoning Monaco with their officers being directly answerable to the Prince of Monaco rather than to the French State. And just as importantly Monegasque independence was to be maintained.\n\nExpulsion of the Spanish\n\nOn November 17, 1641 Honor\u00e9 II put his plan to expel the Spanish garrison into effect. He quickly imprisoned those individuals known to be sympathetic to Spanish rule. Then that same evening he threw a sumptuous banquet for the Spanish troops and their commanders. The soldiers were given generous amounts of alcohol to subdue them and then, at a prearranged signal of a canon shot numerous Monegasques sprang on the Spanish. French troops came rushing out of hiding to finish them off and force them to surrender. Records report only 5 killed and 10 wounded before the Spanish garrison yielded. Monaco then officially expelled them and Honor\u00e9 relinquished his Spanish honorary title of Order of the Golden Fleece. As expected the Spanish confiscated all of the Prince\u2019s property in Spain and Monaco\u2019s Spanish-linked possessions in Italy.\n\nDuke of Valentinois\n\nThe French compensated Honor\u00e9 for the losses of land and titles. Louis XIII made Honor\u00e9 II the Duke of Valentinois, Count of Carlad\u00e8s, Baron of Buis and Calvinet as well as granting him the lands and title of St-R\u00e9my. The monarchs of France and Monaco became very close. Thus when Honor\u00e9 was approached by English Royalists to harbour a fleet in Monaco with the intention of wrestling power from Cromwell, Honor\u00e9 consulted with France\u2019s Cardinal Mazarin who was looking to ally with Cromwell against Spain. On Mazarin\u2019s advice he very diplomatically resisted.\n\nAn Enviable Legacy\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9 II died on January 10, 1662 at the age of 64 deservedly very popular and with a legacy of numerous achievements. He had removed Monaco from being under the yolk of Spain. He created a new alliance with the increasingly powerful French while maintaining Monaco\u2019s independence. It also fell to him to help his subjects survive through a plague. Thanks to advice from monks in Nice on cleanliness and sanitation the plague abated. His cultural achievements flowed from a natural passion and the prestige he gained from them led him to be referred to as the \u00abLouis XIV of Monaco\u00bb. And the Sun King Louis XIV would stand as godfather to Honor\u00e9 II\u2019s grandson who was also named Louis, cementing relations with France that last to this very day."}, {"url": "https://dbpedia.org/page/Honor%C3%A9_V,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 V. von Monaco (* 14.

Toen de macht van zijn vader Honorius IV na de capitulatie van Napoleon Bonaparte krachtens het Verdrag van Parijs in 1814 werd hersteld, wilde deze vanwege zijn slechte gezondheid de macht overdragen aan zijn broer . Na protesten van Honorius Gabri\u00ebl aanvaardde Honorius IV toch zelf de regering, sinds 1815 onder regentschap van zijn zoon. Honorius V besteeg na de dood van zijn vader in 1819 de troon van het vorstendom Monaco, dat sinds 1815 een protectoraat van het koninkrijk Sardini\u00eb was. Koning Lodewijk XVIII bekrachtigde, als nieuwe koning van Frankrijk tijdens de Restauratie, zijn titel van hertog van Valentinois voor het leven (1817). Honorius V trachtte door draconische maatregelen de economische malaise in zijn staat aan te pakken, hetgeen tot misnoegen leidde bij de bevolking. In 1833 kwam het in Menton tot protesten tegen de vorst. Met zijn minnares, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Rouault de Gamaches, had hij een zoon Louis Gabriel Oscar Grimaldi (1814-1894).

Han var son till Honor\u00e9 IV av Monaco och Louise d'Aumont. Han tj\u00e4nstgjorde i den franska arm\u00e9n, och beskrivs som lojal till Napoleon I. N\u00e4r furstend\u00f6met Monaco \u00e5teruppr\u00e4ttades 1814, blev hans far furste, men p\u00e5 grund av hans h\u00e4lsotillst\u00e5nd sattes faderns bror, prins Josef av Monaco, som hans regent.

Vid Napoleons slutliga fall 1815, blev Monaco d\u00e4rf\u00f6r placerat under Sardinien snarare \u00e4n Frankrike, och utsattes f\u00f6r en ekonomisk bojkott som orsakade kris i furstend\u00f6met.

Han beskrivs som en ensamvarg som inte litade p\u00e5 n\u00e5gon och levde i konflikt med sin bror, som eftertr\u00e4dde honom eftersom han inte gifte sig, och endast hade en utom\u00e4ktenskaplig och d\u00e4rmed inte arvsber\u00e4ttigad son.

He was the first son of Honor\u00e9 IV of Monaco and Louise d'Aumont.\n\nRegent [ edit ]\n\nIllnesses resulting from his imprisonment incapacitated Honor\u00e9 IV in his later years, and following the re-establishment of the Principality in 1814, a regency was established to rule in Honor\u00e9's name. This regency was directed, first, by his brother Joseph Grimaldi, then from 1815 by his son, the Hereditary Prince Honor\u00e9, who succeeded him in 1819 as Sovereign Prince Honor\u00e9 V.[1]\n\nReign [ edit ]\n\nA professor of the period, Victor de la Canorgue, wrote of Prince Honor\u00e9 in negative terms: extravagant and fond of luxuries for himself, but miserly for others, even his own family, to whom he gave \"pensions disproportionate to his means.\"[2] This professor endeavored to collect accounts of the reigns of Honor\u00e9 V and of his brother and successor, Prince Florestan, and to translate them from Italian to French, for the purpose of better understanding the causes of the ever-increasing anti-monarchist movements, especially in former parts of the Principality like Menton and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. One ordinance, dated from 1815, suggested that Prince Honor\u00e9 V was not only miserly but greedy, that he brought even \"the benches of the parish church, which some persons had built at their own expense\",[2] under his control, for his own profit.\n\nGustave Saige described him as a loner who did not trust anyone, including his brother, to help him govern. He was invisible to the public.[3] His focus was on the crippled economy of Monaco; he raised taxes and tried to restore the tobacco plant his grandfather Honor\u00e9 III had founded but which had been closed by the government of Turin.[4] He endeavored to open factories and initiate citrus farm cooperatives in order put people to work, generate production, and alleviate poverty. However, none of his efforts raised his popularity, as his measures were seen by the people as autocratic.[4]\n\nChild and succession [ edit ]\n\nHonor\u00e9 V never married. He had a son, with his mistress F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Gamaches, Louis Gabriel Oscar Grimaldi, born in Paris on 9 June 1814 and died in Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 15 July 1894.[5][6][7] Honor\u00e9's son was legitimized,[7] but the throne nevertheless passed to Honor\u00e9's brother, Florestan.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.unionpedia.org/Honor%C3%A9_IV,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco Honor\u00e9 IV (17 May 1758 \u2013 16 February 1819) was Prince of Monaco and Duke of Valentinois from 12 March 1795 to 16 February 1819.

Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "http://www.worldheritage.org/articles/Honor%C3%A9_IV,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "World Heritage Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia is the largest and most comprehensive Encyclopedia ever compiled.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia.

This prince, perhaps, experienced more challenges in life than any other Grimaldi. Most of his hardships were caused by the French Revolution, and the last hours of his life are still shrouded in mystery \u2026\n\nThe victims of the Great Terror\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9 IV was unlucky enough to be living in Paris when the Reign of Terror broke out in France. As a nobleman and prince he was soon arrested and thrown into prison. The prince\u2019s former wife, Duchess of Mazarin, was also taken into custody. Assisted by their family doctor, however, she managed to escape and hide with her youngest son Florestan.\n\nThe revolution did not spare the family of Prince\u2019s Honore IV\u2019s youngest brother, Joseph. His wife, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, was arrested on suspicion of espionage and executed by guillotine. She was only 27, leaving behind three little daughters.\n\nAs for Prince Honor\u00e9, he was imprisoned for one and a half years. This time in prison greatly undermined his health, and he never fully recovered from it afterwards. On March 21, 1795 his father died and Honor\u00e9 IV ascended the throne of Monaco. At that time the monarchy had just been banned and Monaco was once again annexed to the French Republic under the name of Port Hercule.\n\nEven after Prince Honor\u00e9 was released from prison, it took another seven years of negotiations before the French regime restored some of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s and his brother Prince Joseph\u2019s income. The future started to look brighter for the Grimaldi\u2019s once the radical revolutionary regime was followed by the French consulate and, finally, by the First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nReturn to the throne\n\nWhen the Napoleonic Wars finally came to an end, the status of Monaco was restored by the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) thanks to the efforts of Prince Talleyrand. On May 30, 1814 Honor\u00e9 IV was officially named the Principality\u2019s ruler. However, he was too ill to take control of his country. So it was his brother Prince Joseph who became regent.\n\nThe Prince\u2019s eldest son, 36-year-old Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, however, was not happy about this decision. A brilliant soldier, he entered the cavalry service at the age of 20 and prospered in the army of the Empire Marshal, Emmanuel de Grouchy. Since Prince Joseph was not particularly eager to deal with the Principality\u2019s affairs, preferring his life in the capital, he easily facilitated handing over the reins to his nephew, Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, who ruled Monaco up until the death of Honor\u00e9 IV (later becoming Prince Honor\u00e9 V). As for Honor\u00e9 IV, he lived in Paris until his very death which remains mysterious to this day\u2026\n\nAccident or murder ..?\n\nOn a winter\u2019s day of February 16, 1819, Honor\u00e9 IV drowned in the Seine river. The death of the Monaco prince looked like a typical accident. That\u2019s what the investigation concluded as an official version. It must not be forgotten, however, that Honor\u00e9 IV was not a very healthy person, to say the least. This is the reason why he was not only unwilling, but was also physically unfit to rule the country. Imprisonment and numerous personal tragedies had taken their toll on the Prince, making him, for all intents and purposes, disabled. This is what the scanty preserved data suggests. A legitimate question arises: how could a 60-year-old monarch, in deplorable physical state, manage to cover such a considerable distance away from home (Avenue Denfert-Rochereau) to the Seine river bank..?\n\nWas it really an accident? Or rather a premeditated murder? Or could it be that the Prince decided to put an end to his own unhappy life? Being a depressed person, did he step into the Seine himself..? The answer remains a mystery.\n\nThe main legacy of Prince Honore IV\n\nAs Prince of Monaco, Honor\u00e9 IV suffered three arrests and never actually ruled Monaco. He spent part of his life in a prison cell and the rest, trying to improve his health. Needless to say, there are very few mentions of the Prince, even in the archives of Monaco. His most important contribution to the history of Monaco was the birth of his two sons \u2014 the future princes, Honor\u00e9 V and Florestan I, who consistently ruled the Principality and left their mark on the state\u2019s history."}, {"url": "https://www.unofficialroyalty.com/honore-iv-prince-of-monaco/", "page_content": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n\u00a9 Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nHonor\u00e9 Charles Anne Grimaldi was born in Paris, France on May 17, 1758. He was the elder of the two sons of Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco and Maria Caterina Brignole who came from a Republic of Genoa (now in Italy) noble family. Honor\u00e9\u2019s paternal grandparents were Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. His maternal grandparents were Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV had one younger brother:\n\nPrince Joseph of Monaco, Regent of Monaco (1763 \u2013 1816), married (1) Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, had three children, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was guillotined during the French Revolution (2) Frances Margaret Powell, no children\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV\u2019s parents had issues with their marriage. Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 III was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 III continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 III and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 III finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s death in 1798, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV and his brother Joseph grew up mostly in France, living in homes inherited from their paternal grandfather Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny: a Paris mansion, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and the Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon (link in French) in Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France. In 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III arranged a marriage for his son Honor\u00e9 (IV) to Louise d\u2019Aumont, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the only child of Louis Marie Guy d\u2019Aumont de Rochebaron, Duke of Aumont (1732 \u2013 1799) and Louise-Jeanne de Durfort, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye (1735 \u2013 1781). Through her mother, Louise was the great-great-great-granddaughter of Hortense Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the mistress of King Charles II of England, and one of the two heirs of her uncle Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the First Minister of King Louis XIV of France. Louise was the heir of Hortense Mancini\u2019s titles and the Mazarin family wealth. Therefore, a marriage to Louise came with a large dowry and the prospect of a fortune. Honor\u00e9 (IV) and Louise married on July 15, 1777.\n\nThe marriage did produce two sons, both Sovereign Princes of Monaco:\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for the Grimaldi family. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. The members of the former ruling Grimaldi dynasty lost all aristocratic privileges in France, were dispossessed of their French property, and became French citizens. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 (IV), his wife Louise, their son Florestan, and Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 III were arrested and imprisoned in Paris as enemies of the people. Louise and her son Florestan were rescued by a family doctor who forged release papers and then hid them in his home until the Reign of Terror was over. The wife of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. When Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution, his wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn October 1794, Honor\u00e9 III and Honor\u00e9 (IV) were released from prison. Honor\u00e9 III never recovered from his imprisonment and died in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. Honor\u00e9 IV, whose chronic ill health had been worsened by imprisonment, would have become Prince of Monaco but Monaco was no longer a sovereign monarchy. However, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s family properties in France were returned to him but they were in poor condition and all of the contents were gone.\n\nIn 1794, while Honor\u00e9 IV was still in prison, Louise had given birth to an illegitimate daughter Am\u00e9lie C\u00e9leste Erodore d\u2019Aumont. The father of the child is believed to have been Antoine de Montazet, Archbishop of Lyon. After Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s release from prison, Louise and Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s marriage became unhappy and the couple separated. In 1798, Louise divorced Honor\u00e9 IV, giving Louise sole access to her fortune.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. Honor\u00e9 IV could not adapt to the new French society and for the most part, remained an outsider. Because of a lack of funds, he needed to sell his family\u2019s Paris and Normandy homes. Surprisingly, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s health improved and he joined the French Army. He was wounded during Napoleon\u2019s Russian Campaign, lost the use of one arm, and was sent back to Paris.\n\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s defeat in 1814 and the Bourbon Restoration which saw Louis XVIII, a younger brother of the beheaded King Louis XVI, become King of France, Florestan\u2019s uncle Joseph petitioned King Louis XVIII to restore the Principality of Monaco to the Grimaldi family. Florestan\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 IV finally became Sovereign Prince of Monaco in 1814. The independence of Monaco lasted for only one year. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna, an international diplomatic conference that reconstituted the European political order after the downfall of Napoleon I, declared that Monaco would be a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\nBy the time Honor\u00e9 IV became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, his physical condition had worsened and he was now paralyzed on one side of his body. Because of his condition, a regency was established to rule in his name. Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was regent from 1814 -1815 and then Florestan\u2019s brother Honor\u00e9 V served as regent until his father\u2019s death in 1819 when he succeeded him as Honor\u00e9 V, Prince of Monaco.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco died in Paris, France on February 16, 1819, aged 60. He was buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas in Monaco. During the late 19th century, a new and larger church, the Cathedral of Monaco, was built on the site of the Church of Saint Nicholas. The original church was demolished in 1874 but the current cathedral was built over the areas of the previous church and the old burial site so that the sovereign princes and consorts originally buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas are now buried in the Cathedral of Monaco.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Tough and authoritarian, accustomed to military discipline from his youth, he made important economic decisions alone but failed to make the country prosperous and failed to make its population rich and happy. In fairness, we note that the Prince sincerely did his best.\n\nMilitary service for France\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9-Gabriel, the eldest son of Prince Honor\u00e9 IV of Monaco and Princess Louise Felicite Victoire d\u2019Aumont, was born in Paris on May 14, 1778. He enlisted in a French cavalry regiment when he was 20 years old and worked his way up through the ranks by his own merits until he became an officer on the staff of Marshal Grouchy. He was an exemplary soldier and was cited for his bravery many times. Being wounded in the arm he couldn\u2019t take part in the action at Austerlitz (1805) but did serve with great distinction at the battle of Jena (1806) with Marshal Murat\u2019s cavalry corps. Marshal Grouchy recommended him for the star of the Legion of Honour, relating that the Prince had taken a handful of cavalry and forced the surrender of an entire enemy battalion.\n\nIn April 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte abdicated the throne and was sent into exile on the island of Elba. The restored King Louis XVIII of France himself then also restored the Grimaldis to their places in the French nobility. Therefore, after the restoration of 1814, Honor\u00e9-Gabriel was also named member of the House of Peers by King Louis XVIII. But many were afraid that Monegasque independence would not be secure or that the Principality might be annexed by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. Thanks to Prince Talleyrand, however, a clause was inserted into the Treaty of Paris to put Monaco securely back in order and independent.\n\nReturn to Monaco and meeting with Napoleon\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV was unable to return to Monaco because of his poor health and so appointed his brother Joseph to rule on his behalf. But Honor\u00e9-Gabriel didn\u2019t like that idea and he protested fiercely about this and after some struggle he was himself appointed to govern Monaco.\n\nIn March, 1815 on his way to Monaco he met with his old commander Napoleon who was on his way to Paris to seize power at the start of the 100 days. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d, Napoleon asked. \u201cGoing home, to Monaco\u201d, Honor\u00e9-Gabriel answered. \u201cMe too, I\u2019m going home, to the Tuileries,\u201d Napoleon said. When Napoleon attempted to restore his empire during the 100 days Monaco was occupied by British troops and so the Grimaldis played no part in the affair.\n\nDifficult years of reign\n\nIn 1819, when his father passed away, Honor\u00e9-Gabriel became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as Honor\u00e9 V and inherited a Principality beset with problems. At the same time being both a member of the French Parliament and the Sovereign of Monaco, he picked up on the project of his grandfather to diversify economic resources and encouraged the installation of factories. The Great Powers of Europe had taken Monaco out of the French sphere of influence and made the Principality a protectorate of Piedmont-Sardinia. The government in Turin closed the tobacco plant that Honor\u00e9 III had established and enforced a number of other changes that had left Monaco impoverished.\n\nHonor\u00e9 V went to Turin to try to reason with the King of Piedmont-Sardinia but, although he was treated with great honour and respect, none of his grievances were addressed. Honor\u00e9 V also had to raise taxes considerably which made him increasingly unpopular. His granting of a monopoly on flour caused a bread shortage but no one had the nerve to voice opposition to him. He also pushed opportunities for tourism. However, the lack of a market for local products, the omnipresence of the State and the lack of presence of the Sovereign created tensions, especially in Menton. The Sovereign ended up pacifying Menton before going forward with his effort to provide the Principality with amenities. By his own admission he \u201cdesired to do good\u201d but \u201cdid not manage to\u201d, despite his philanthropic ideals.\n\nWhen liberal movements began to oppose the counter revolutionary tide of post-Napoleonic Europe some in Monaco thought of joining in but Sardinian troops arrived to crush the potential rebellion in its infancy.\n\nUnjust dislike\n\nHistory has tended to record Prince Honor\u00e9 V as a very unpopular and autocratic monarch, but, in reality he was quite progressive. He sincerely wished to help his people and had great sympathy for the poor. His reaction to seeing beggars on the streets was to form state-owned industries and put them to work. Some of the industries he set up included a lace factory and a hat factory. He also had them put to work on farm cooperatives as citrus orchards had long been a large part of the Monegasque economy. All of this has led some people to regard Prince Honor\u00e9 V as a sort of socialist, though he probably would not have seen it that way.\n\nBut all efforts to save the economy did not make Monegasques appreciate their Prince. Honor\u00e9 V of Monaco died on October 2, 1841 in Paris and remained in the history of the country as an authoritarian ruler who did not trust anyone, including family members, and made decisions alone. As he was not married and had no children the Monegasque throne passed to his poet-actor brother Florestan."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/prince-honore-iii-one-of-the-longest-reigns-in-european-history-en/", "page_content": "Everybody knows that the reign of French King Louis XIV, \u2018Le Roi Soleil\u2019, was the longest in European history. Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7832651/honor%C3%A9_iv-of_monaco", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

This prince, perhaps, experienced more challenges in life than any other Grimaldi. Most of his hardships were caused by the French Revolution, and the last hours of his life are still shrouded in mystery \u2026\n\nThe victims of the Great Terror\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9 IV was unlucky enough to be living in Paris when the Reign of Terror broke out in France. As a nobleman and prince he was soon arrested and thrown into prison. The prince\u2019s former wife, Duchess of Mazarin, was also taken into custody. Assisted by their family doctor, however, she managed to escape and hide with her youngest son Florestan.\n\nThe revolution did not spare the family of Prince\u2019s Honore IV\u2019s youngest brother, Joseph. His wife, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, was arrested on suspicion of espionage and executed by guillotine. She was only 27, leaving behind three little daughters.\n\nAs for Prince Honor\u00e9, he was imprisoned for one and a half years. This time in prison greatly undermined his health, and he never fully recovered from it afterwards. On March 21, 1795 his father died and Honor\u00e9 IV ascended the throne of Monaco. At that time the monarchy had just been banned and Monaco was once again annexed to the French Republic under the name of Port Hercule.\n\nEven after Prince Honor\u00e9 was released from prison, it took another seven years of negotiations before the French regime restored some of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s and his brother Prince Joseph\u2019s income. The future started to look brighter for the Grimaldi\u2019s once the radical revolutionary regime was followed by the French consulate and, finally, by the First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nReturn to the throne\n\nWhen the Napoleonic Wars finally came to an end, the status of Monaco was restored by the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) thanks to the efforts of Prince Talleyrand. On May 30, 1814 Honor\u00e9 IV was officially named the Principality\u2019s ruler. However, he was too ill to take control of his country. So it was his brother Prince Joseph who became regent.\n\nThe Prince\u2019s eldest son, 36-year-old Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, however, was not happy about this decision. A brilliant soldier, he entered the cavalry service at the age of 20 and prospered in the army of the Empire Marshal, Emmanuel de Grouchy. Since Prince Joseph was not particularly eager to deal with the Principality\u2019s affairs, preferring his life in the capital, he easily facilitated handing over the reins to his nephew, Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, who ruled Monaco up until the death of Honor\u00e9 IV (later becoming Prince Honor\u00e9 V). As for Honor\u00e9 IV, he lived in Paris until his very death which remains mysterious to this day\u2026\n\nAccident or murder ..?\n\nOn a winter\u2019s day of February 16, 1819, Honor\u00e9 IV drowned in the Seine river. The death of the Monaco prince looked like a typical accident. That\u2019s what the investigation concluded as an official version. It must not be forgotten, however, that Honor\u00e9 IV was not a very healthy person, to say the least. This is the reason why he was not only unwilling, but was also physically unfit to rule the country. Imprisonment and numerous personal tragedies had taken their toll on the Prince, making him, for all intents and purposes, disabled. This is what the scanty preserved data suggests. A legitimate question arises: how could a 60-year-old monarch, in deplorable physical state, manage to cover such a considerable distance away from home (Avenue Denfert-Rochereau) to the Seine river bank..?\n\nWas it really an accident? Or rather a premeditated murder? Or could it be that the Prince decided to put an end to his own unhappy life? Being a depressed person, did he step into the Seine himself..? The answer remains a mystery.\n\nThe main legacy of Prince Honore IV\n\nAs Prince of Monaco, Honor\u00e9 IV suffered three arrests and never actually ruled Monaco. He spent part of his life in a prison cell and the rest, trying to improve his health. Needless to say, there are very few mentions of the Prince, even in the archives of Monaco. His most important contribution to the history of Monaco was the birth of his two sons \u2014 the future princes, Honor\u00e9 V and Florestan I, who consistently ruled the Principality and left their mark on the state\u2019s history."}, {"url": "https://royalty.miraheze.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_IV,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco (Honor\u00e9 Charles Anne; 17 May 1758 \u2013 16 February 1819) was Prince of Monaco and Duke of Valentinois from 1814 to 16 February 1819.

He was the elder of the two sons of Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco and Maria Caterina Brignole who came from a Republic of Genoa (now in Italy) noble family. Honor\u00e9\u2019s paternal grandparents were Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. His maternal grandparents were Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV had one younger brother:\n\nPrince Joseph of Monaco, Regent of Monaco (1763 \u2013 1816), married (1) Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, had three children, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was guillotined during the French Revolution (2) Frances Margaret Powell, no children\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV\u2019s parents had issues with their marriage. Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 III was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 III continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 III and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 III finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s death in 1798, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV and his brother Joseph grew up mostly in France, living in homes inherited from their paternal grandfather Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny: a Paris mansion, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and the Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon (link in French) in Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France. In 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III arranged a marriage for his son Honor\u00e9 (IV) to Louise d\u2019Aumont, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the only child of Louis Marie Guy d\u2019Aumont de Rochebaron, Duke of Aumont (1732 \u2013 1799) and Louise-Jeanne de Durfort, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye (1735 \u2013 1781). Through her mother, Louise was the great-great-great-granddaughter of Hortense Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the mistress of King Charles II of England, and one of the two heirs of her uncle Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the First Minister of King Louis XIV of France. Louise was the heir of Hortense Mancini\u2019s titles and the Mazarin family wealth. Therefore, a marriage to Louise came with a large dowry and the prospect of a fortune. Honor\u00e9 (IV) and Louise married on July 15, 1777.\n\nThe marriage did produce two sons, both Sovereign Princes of Monaco:\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for the Grimaldi family. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. The members of the former ruling Grimaldi dynasty lost all aristocratic privileges in France, were dispossessed of their French property, and became French citizens. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 (IV), his wife Louise, their son Florestan, and Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 III were arrested and imprisoned in Paris as enemies of the people. Louise and her son Florestan were rescued by a family doctor who forged release papers and then hid them in his home until the Reign of Terror was over. The wife of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. When Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution, his wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn October 1794, Honor\u00e9 III and Honor\u00e9 (IV) were released from prison. Honor\u00e9 III never recovered from his imprisonment and died in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. Honor\u00e9 IV, whose chronic ill health had been worsened by imprisonment, would have become Prince of Monaco but Monaco was no longer a sovereign monarchy. However, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s family properties in France were returned to him but they were in poor condition and all of the contents were gone.\n\nIn 1794, while Honor\u00e9 IV was still in prison, Louise had given birth to an illegitimate daughter Am\u00e9lie C\u00e9leste Erodore d\u2019Aumont. The father of the child is believed to have been Antoine de Montazet, Archbishop of Lyon. After Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s release from prison, Louise and Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s marriage became unhappy and the couple separated. In 1798, Louise divorced Honor\u00e9 IV, giving Louise sole access to her fortune.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. Honor\u00e9 IV could not adapt to the new French society and for the most part, remained an outsider. Because of a lack of funds, he needed to sell his family\u2019s Paris and Normandy homes. Surprisingly, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s health improved and he joined the French Army. He was wounded during Napoleon\u2019s Russian Campaign, lost the use of one arm, and was sent back to Paris.\n\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s defeat in 1814 and the Bourbon Restoration which saw Louis XVIII, a younger brother of the beheaded King Louis XVI, become King of France, Florestan\u2019s uncle Joseph petitioned King Louis XVIII to restore the Principality of Monaco to the Grimaldi family. Florestan\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 IV finally became Sovereign Prince of Monaco in 1814. The independence of Monaco lasted for only one year. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna, an international diplomatic conference that reconstituted the European political order after the downfall of Napoleon I, declared that Monaco would be a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\nBy the time Honor\u00e9 IV became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, his physical condition had worsened and he was now paralyzed on one side of his body. Because of his condition, a regency was established to rule in his name. Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was regent from 1814 -1815 and then Florestan\u2019s brother Honor\u00e9 V served as regent until his father\u2019s death in 1819 when he succeeded him as Honor\u00e9 V, Prince of Monaco.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco died in Paris, France on February 16, 1819, aged 60. He was buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas in Monaco. During the late 19th century, a new and larger church, the Cathedral of Monaco, was built on the site of the Church of Saint Nicholas. The original church was demolished in 1874 but the current cathedral was built over the areas of the previous church and the old burial site so that the sovereign princes and consorts originally buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas are now buried in the Cathedral of Monaco.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He belonged to the rich and influential family of the Savelli and was a grandnephew of Honorius III. Very little is known of his life before he ascended the papal throne. He studied at the University of Paris, during which time he held a prebend and a canonry at the cathedral of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne. Later he obtained the benefice of rector at the church of Berton, in the Diocese of Norwich. In 1261 he was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin by Martin IV, who also appointed him papal prefect in Tuscany and captain of the papal army. By order of Clement IV he and three other cardinals invested Charles of Anjou as King of Sicily at Rome on 28 July, 1265. He was one of the six cardinals who elected Gregory X by compromise at Viterbo on 1 Sept., 1271. In 1274 he accompanied Gregory X to the Fourteenth General Council at Lyons, and in July, 1276, he was one of the three cardinals whom Adrian V sent to Viterbo with instructions to treat with King Rudolf I of Hapsburg concerning his imperial coronation at Rome and his future relations towards Charles of Anjou, King of Sicily. The death of Adrian V in the following month rendered fruitless the negotiations with Rudolf. Nothing further is known of the cardinal's doings until, nine years later, he was elected pope.\n\nMartin IV died 28 March, 1285, at Perugia, and three days after his death fifteen out of the eighteen cardinals who then composed the Sacred College had a preliminary consultation at the episcopal residence at Perugia, and appointed the following day, 2 April, 1285, for the election of the new pope. The election took place without the conclave, which had been prescribed by Gregory X, but suspended by John XXI. At the first vote taken, Giacomo Savelli was unanimously elected and took the name of Honorius IV. His election was one of the speediest in the history of the papacy. The reason for this great haste may be found in the Sicilian complications, which did not allow any interregnum, and especially in the fact that the cardinals wished to avoid the unjustifiable interference which occurred at the election of the preceding pope, when Charles of Anjou induced the inhabitants of Viterbo to imprison two cousins of the deceased Nicholas III, in order to effect the election of a pope of French nationality. On 19 May, 1285, the new pontiff was ordained priest by Cardinal Malabranca Orsini of Ostia, and the following day he was consecrated bishop and crowned pope in the basilica of St. Peter at Rome. Honorius IV was already advanced in age and so severely affected with the gout that he could neither stand nor walk. When saying Mass he was obliged to sit on a stool and at the Elevation his hands had to be raised by a mechanical contrivance.\n\nSicilian affairs required the immediate attention of the pope. By throwing off the rule of Charles of Anjou and taking Pedro III of Aragon as their king without the consent and approval of the pope, the Sicilians had practically denied his suzerainty over Sicily. The awful massacre of 31 March, 1282, known as the Sicilian Vespers, had precluded every possibility of coming to an amicable understanding with Martin IV, a Frenchman who owed the tiara to Charles of Anjou. Pope Martin demanded unconditional submission to Charles of Anjou and the Apostolic See and, when this was refused, put Sicily and Pedro III under the ban, deprived Pedro of the Kingdom of Aragon, and gave it to Charles of Valois, the son of King Philip III of France. He, moreover, assisted Charles of Anjou in his attempts to recover Sicily by force of arms. The Sicilians not only repulsed the attacks of Charles of Anjou but also captured his son Charles of Salerno. On 6 January, 1285, Charles of Anjou died, leaving his captive son Charles of Salerno as his natural successor. Such were the conditions in Sicily when Honorius IV ascended the papal throne. The Sicilians cherished the hope that the new pontiff would take a different stand from that of his predecessor in the Sicilian question, but their hopes were only partly realized. He was indeed less impulsive and more peaceably inclined than Martin IV, but he did not renounce the claims of the Church and of the House of Anjou upon the Sicilian crown. Neither did he set aside the severe ecclesiastical punishments imposed upon Sicily or restore to Pedro III the Kingdom of Aragon which Martin IV had transferred to Charles of Valois. On the other hand, he did not approve of the tyrannical government to which the Sicilians had been subject under Charles of Anjou. This is evident from his wise legislation as embodied in his constitution of 17 September, 1285 (\"Constitutio super ordinatione regni Siciliae\" in \"Bullarium Romanum\", Turin, IV, 70-80). In this constitution he inculcates that no government can prosper which is not founded on justice and peace, and he passes forty-five ordinances intended chiefly to protect the people of Sicily against their king and his officials. In case of any violation of these ordinances by the king or his officials, the people were free to appeal to the Apostolic See for redress. The king, moreover, was bound to observe the ordinances contained in this constitution under pain of excommunication. Martin IV had allowed King Philip III of France to tax the clergy in France, and in a few dioceses of Germany, one-tenth of their revenues for the space of four years. The money thus collected was to be used for waging war against Pedro III with the purpose of conquering Aragon for Charles of Valois. Honorius IV approved this action of his predecessor. When Edward I of England requested him to use his influence to put an end to the war, he answered that Pedro III deserved to be punished and that Philip III should not be kept from reaping the fruits of a war which he had undertaken in the service and at the instance of the Church. The death of Pedro III on 11 November, 1285, somewhat changed the Sicilian situation. His two sons Alfonso and James succeeded him, the former as King of Aragon, the latter as King of Sicily. Honorius IV, of course, acknowledged neither the one nor the other. On 11 April, 1286, he solemnly excommunicated King James of Sicily and the bishops who had taken part in his coronation at Palermo on 2 February, 1286; but neither the king nor the bishops concerned themselves about the excommunication. The king even sent a hostile fleet to the Roman coast and destroyed the city of Astura by fire. Charles of Salerno, the lawful King of Sicily, who was still held captive by the Sicilians, finally grew tired of his long captivity and signed a contract on 27 February, 1287, in which he renounced his claims to the Kingdom of Sicily in favour of James of Aragon and his heirs. Honorius IV, however, who was asked for his approval, refused to listen to such an unprincipled act, which surrendered the rights of the Church and of the House of Anjou to refractory rebels. He declared the contract invalid and forbade all similar agreements for the future. While Honorius IV was inexorable in the stand he had taken towards Sicily and its self-imposed king, his relations towards Alfonso of Aragon became less hostile. Through the efforts of King Edward I of England, negotiations for peace were begun by Honorius IV and King Alfonso. The pope, however, did not live long enough to complete these negotiations, which finally resulted in a peaceful settlement of the Aragonese as well as the Sicilian question.\n\nRome and the States of the Church enjoyed a period of tranquillity during the pontificate of Honorius IV, the like of which they had not enjoyed for many years. He had the satisfaction of reducing the most powerful and obstinate enemy of papal authority, Count Guido of Montefeltro, who for many years had successfully resisted the papal troops. The authority of the pope was now recognized throughout the papal territory, which then comprised the Exarchate of Ravenna, the March of Ancona, the Duchy of Spoleto, the County of Bertinoro, the Mathildian lands, and the Pentapolis, viz. the cities of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, and Ancona. The Romans were greatly elated at the election of Honorius IV, for he was a citizen of Rome and a brother of Pandulf, who had during the preceding summer been elected one of the two annual senators of Rome. The continuous disturbances in Rome during the pontificate of Martin V had not allowed that pope to reside in Rome, but now the Romans cordially invited Honorius IV to make Rome his permanent residence. During the first few months of his pontificate he lived in the Vatican, but in the autumn of 1285 he removed to the magnificent palace which he had just erected on the Aventine. With Northern Italy Honorius IV had few dealings beyond those that were of a purely ecclesiastical character. On 16 March, 1286, he removed the interdict which had been imprudently placed upon Venice by Martin IV because that city had refused to equip a fleet for the service of Charles of Anjou in his war against Pedro III of Aragon. At Florence and Bergamo he brought about the abolition of some newly-made laws that were hostile to the Church and the clergy.\n\nThe relations between Honorius IV and the German King Rudolf of Hapsburg were most cordial. The negotiations for Rudolf's imperial coronation which had been begun during the pontificate of Adrian V (1276) and continued during that of Nicholas III (1277-1280) were entirely suspended during the pontificate of Martin IV (1281-1285) who had little love for the Germans. Immediately upon the accession of Honorius IV these negotiations were resumed and the feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin, 2 February, 1287, was determined as the day on which Rudolf should be crowned emperor in the Basilica of St. Peter at Rome. The pope requested the German prelates to contribute a share of their revenues to cover the expenses of his journey to Rome. He even sent Cardinal John of Tusculum, the only one who received the purple during the pontificate of Honorius, as legate to Germany, Sweden, Russia, and the other countries of the north to hasten the king's Italian expedition, but Rudolf's war with Count Eberhard of Wurtemberg and other dissensions in Germany prevented his departure. The same legate presided at the national council of W\u00fcrzburg, which began its sessions on 16 March, 1287. The decrees which were passed at this council are practically the same as those of the general council of Lyons in 1274.\n\nThe two great mendicant orders which at that time exerted great influence, both as pastors of the faithful and as professors at the great seats of learning in Europe, received many new privileges from Honorius IV. He also approved the privileges of the Carmelites and the Augustinian hermits and permitted the former to exchange their striped habit for a white one. He was especially devoted to the Williamites, an order founded by St. William, Duke of Aquitaine (d. 1156), and added numerous privileges to those which they had already received from Alexander IV and Urban IV. Besides turning over to them some deserted Benedictine monasteries, he presented them with the monastery of St. Paul at Albano, which he himself had founded and richly endowed when he was still cardinal. On 11 March, 1286, he condemned the sect of the Apostolics or false apostles, which had been started by a certain Gerard Segarelli at Parma in 1260. At the University of Paris he advocated the erection of chairs for the Oriental languages in order to give an opportunity of studying these languages to those who intended to labour for the conversion of the Musselmans and the reunion of the schismatic churches in the East.\n\nSources PROU, Les Registres d'Honorius IV, recueil des bulles de ce pape, publiees ou analysees d'apres le manuscrit original des archives du Vatican (Paris, 1887-89); PAWLICKI, Papst Honorius IV., eine Monographie (Munster, 1896); REDLICH, Regesta Imperii, Die Regesten des Kaiserreichs unter Rudolph, Adolph, Albrecht, Heinrich VII. 1273-1313 (Innsbruck, 1898)."}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Honor%C3%A9_IV,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV (Honor\u00e9 Charles Anne Grimaldi; 17 May 1758 \u2013 16 February 1819) was Prince of Monaco and Duke of Valentinois from 1814 to 16 February 1819 .

This prince, perhaps, experienced more challenges in life than any other Grimaldi. Most of his hardships were caused by the French Revolution, and the last hours of his life are still shrouded in mystery \u2026\n\nThe victims of the Great Terror\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9 IV was unlucky enough to be living in Paris when the Reign of Terror broke out in France. As a nobleman and prince he was soon arrested and thrown into prison. The prince\u2019s former wife, Duchess of Mazarin, was also taken into custody. Assisted by their family doctor, however, she managed to escape and hide with her youngest son Florestan.\n\nThe revolution did not spare the family of Prince\u2019s Honore IV\u2019s youngest brother, Joseph. His wife, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, was arrested on suspicion of espionage and executed by guillotine. She was only 27, leaving behind three little daughters.\n\nAs for Prince Honor\u00e9, he was imprisoned for one and a half years. This time in prison greatly undermined his health, and he never fully recovered from it afterwards. On March 21, 1795 his father died and Honor\u00e9 IV ascended the throne of Monaco. At that time the monarchy had just been banned and Monaco was once again annexed to the French Republic under the name of Port Hercule.\n\nEven after Prince Honor\u00e9 was released from prison, it took another seven years of negotiations before the French regime restored some of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s and his brother Prince Joseph\u2019s income. The future started to look brighter for the Grimaldi\u2019s once the radical revolutionary regime was followed by the French consulate and, finally, by the First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nReturn to the throne\n\nWhen the Napoleonic Wars finally came to an end, the status of Monaco was restored by the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) thanks to the efforts of Prince Talleyrand. On May 30, 1814 Honor\u00e9 IV was officially named the Principality\u2019s ruler. However, he was too ill to take control of his country. So it was his brother Prince Joseph who became regent.\n\nThe Prince\u2019s eldest son, 36-year-old Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, however, was not happy about this decision. A brilliant soldier, he entered the cavalry service at the age of 20 and prospered in the army of the Empire Marshal, Emmanuel de Grouchy. Since Prince Joseph was not particularly eager to deal with the Principality\u2019s affairs, preferring his life in the capital, he easily facilitated handing over the reins to his nephew, Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, who ruled Monaco up until the death of Honor\u00e9 IV (later becoming Prince Honor\u00e9 V). As for Honor\u00e9 IV, he lived in Paris until his very death which remains mysterious to this day\u2026\n\nAccident or murder ..?\n\nOn a winter\u2019s day of February 16, 1819, Honor\u00e9 IV drowned in the Seine river. The death of the Monaco prince looked like a typical accident. That\u2019s what the investigation concluded as an official version. It must not be forgotten, however, that Honor\u00e9 IV was not a very healthy person, to say the least. This is the reason why he was not only unwilling, but was also physically unfit to rule the country. Imprisonment and numerous personal tragedies had taken their toll on the Prince, making him, for all intents and purposes, disabled. This is what the scanty preserved data suggests. A legitimate question arises: how could a 60-year-old monarch, in deplorable physical state, manage to cover such a considerable distance away from home (Avenue Denfert-Rochereau) to the Seine river bank..?\n\nWas it really an accident? Or rather a premeditated murder? Or could it be that the Prince decided to put an end to his own unhappy life? Being a depressed person, did he step into the Seine himself..? The answer remains a mystery.\n\nThe main legacy of Prince Honore IV\n\nAs Prince of Monaco, Honor\u00e9 IV suffered three arrests and never actually ruled Monaco. He spent part of his life in a prison cell and the rest, trying to improve his health. Needless to say, there are very few mentions of the Prince, even in the archives of Monaco. His most important contribution to the history of Monaco was the birth of his two sons \u2014 the future princes, Honor\u00e9 V and Florestan I, who consistently ruled the Principality and left their mark on the state\u2019s history."}, {"url": "https://www.unofficialroyalty.com/honore-iv-prince-of-monaco/", "page_content": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n\u00a9 Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nHonor\u00e9 Charles Anne Grimaldi was born in Paris, France on May 17, 1758.

However, Honor\u00e9 III continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 III and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 III finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s death in 1798, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV and his brother Joseph grew up mostly in France, living in homes inherited from their paternal grandfather Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny: a Paris mansion, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and the Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon (link in French) in Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France. In 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III arranged a marriage for his son Honor\u00e9 (IV) to Louise d\u2019Aumont, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the only child of Louis Marie Guy d\u2019Aumont de Rochebaron, Duke of Aumont (1732 \u2013 1799) and Louise-Jeanne de Durfort, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye (1735 \u2013 1781). Through her mother, Louise was the great-great-great-granddaughter of Hortense Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the mistress of King Charles II of England, and one of the two heirs of her uncle Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the First Minister of King Louis XIV of France. Louise was the heir of Hortense Mancini\u2019s titles and the Mazarin family wealth. Therefore, a marriage to Louise came with a large dowry and the prospect of a fortune. Honor\u00e9 (IV) and Louise married on July 15, 1777.\n\nThe marriage did produce two sons, both Sovereign Princes of Monaco:\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for the Grimaldi family. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. The members of the former ruling Grimaldi dynasty lost all aristocratic privileges in France, were dispossessed of their French property, and became French citizens. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 (IV), his wife Louise, their son Florestan, and Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 III were arrested and imprisoned in Paris as enemies of the people. Louise and her son Florestan were rescued by a family doctor who forged release papers and then hid them in his home until the Reign of Terror was over. The wife of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. When Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution, his wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn October 1794, Honor\u00e9 III and Honor\u00e9 (IV) were released from prison. Honor\u00e9 III never recovered from his imprisonment and died in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. Honor\u00e9 IV, whose chronic ill health had been worsened by imprisonment, would have become Prince of Monaco but Monaco was no longer a sovereign monarchy. However, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s family properties in France were returned to him but they were in poor condition and all of the contents were gone.\n\nIn 1794, while Honor\u00e9 IV was still in prison, Louise had given birth to an illegitimate daughter Am\u00e9lie C\u00e9leste Erodore d\u2019Aumont. The father of the child is believed to have been Antoine de Montazet, Archbishop of Lyon. After Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s release from prison, Louise and Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s marriage became unhappy and the couple separated. In 1798, Louise divorced Honor\u00e9 IV, giving Louise sole access to her fortune.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. Honor\u00e9 IV could not adapt to the new French society and for the most part, remained an outsider. Because of a lack of funds, he needed to sell his family\u2019s Paris and Normandy homes. Surprisingly, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s health improved and he joined the French Army. He was wounded during Napoleon\u2019s Russian Campaign, lost the use of one arm, and was sent back to Paris.\n\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s defeat in 1814 and the Bourbon Restoration which saw Louis XVIII, a younger brother of the beheaded King Louis XVI, become King of France, Florestan\u2019s uncle Joseph petitioned King Louis XVIII to restore the Principality of Monaco to the Grimaldi family. Florestan\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 IV finally became Sovereign Prince of Monaco in 1814. The independence of Monaco lasted for only one year. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna, an international diplomatic conference that reconstituted the European political order after the downfall of Napoleon I, declared that Monaco would be a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\nBy the time Honor\u00e9 IV became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, his physical condition had worsened and he was now paralyzed on one side of his body. Because of his condition, a regency was established to rule in his name. Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was regent from 1814 -1815 and then Florestan\u2019s brother Honor\u00e9 V served as regent until his father\u2019s death in 1819 when he succeeded him as Honor\u00e9 V, Prince of Monaco.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco died in Paris, France on February 16, 1819, aged 60. He was buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas in Monaco. During the late 19th century, a new and larger church, the Cathedral of Monaco, was built on the site of the Church of Saint Nicholas. The original church was demolished in 1874 but the current cathedral was built over the areas of the previous church and the old burial site so that the sovereign princes and consorts originally buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas are now buried in the Cathedral of Monaco.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the son of Prince Honor\u00e9 III by his wife, Maria Caterina Brignole, a Genoese noblewoman. After the fall of Napoleon I, he regained control of the principality thanks to a clause added by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord at the Congress of Vienna stating that, \"the Prince of Monaco should return to his estates\", and passed on his titles to his eldest son, Honor\u00e9 V, Prince of Monaco.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV married Louise F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Victoire d'Aumont, Duchess of Aumont, Duchess Mazarin and of La Meilleraye on 15 July 1777 in Paris. They divorced in 1798. They had two sons:\n\nDuring the French occupation of Monaco, Honor\u00e9 IV was imprisoned for several years. Illnesses resulting from this imprisonment incapacitated Honor\u00e9 IV in his later years, and following the re-establishment of the Principality a regency was established to rule in Honor\u00e9's name.\n\nAncestry\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Asbox/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Asbox/styles.css\"></templatestyles>"}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/prince-honore-iii-one-of-the-longest-reigns-in-european-history-en/", "page_content": "Everybody knows that the reign of French King Louis XIV, \u2018Le Roi Soleil\u2019, was the longest in European history. Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/Pope-Honorius-IV", "page_content": "Honorius IV (GIACOMO SAVELLI), POPE, b. at Rome about 1210; d. at Rome, April 3, 1287. He belonged to the rich and influential family of the Savelli and was a grandnephew of Honorius III. Very little is known of his life before he ascended the papal throne. He studied at the University of Paris, during which time he held a prebend and a canonry at the cathedral of Chalons-sur-Marne. Later he obtained the benefice of rector at the church of Berton, in the Diocese of Norwich. In 1261 he was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin by Martin IV, who also appointed him papal prefect in Tuscany and captain of the papal army. By order of Clement IV he and three other cardinals invested Charles of Anjou as King of Sicily at Rome on July 28, 1265. He was one of the six cardinals who elected Gregory X by compromise at Viterbo on September 1, 1271. In 1274 he accompanied Gregory X to the Fourteenth General Council at Lyons, and in July, 1276, he was one of the three cardinals whom Adrian V sent to Viterbo with instructions to treat with King Rudolf I of Hapsburg concerning his imperial coronation at Rome and his future relations towards Charles of Anjou, King of Sicily. The death of Adrian V in the following month rendered fruitless the negotiations with Rudolf. Nothing further is known of the cardinal\u2019s doings until, nine years later, he was elected pope.\n\nMartin IV died March 28, 1285, at Perugia, and three days after his death fifteen out of the eighteen cardinals who then composed the Sacred College had a preliminary consultation at the episcopal residence at Perugia, and appointed the following day, April 2, 1285, for the election of the new pope. The election took place without the conclave, which had been pre-scribed by Gregory X, but suspended by John XXI. At the first vote taken, Giacomo Savelli was unanimously elected and took the name of Honorius IV. His election was one of the speediest in the history of the papacy. The reason for this great haste may be found in the Sicilian complications, which did not allow any interregnum, and especially in the fact that the cardinals wished to avoid the unjustifiable interference which occurred at the election of the preceding pope, when Charles of Anjou induced the inhabitants of Viterbo to imprison two cousins of the deceased Nicholas III, in order to effect the election of a pope of French nationality. On May 19, 1285, the new pontiff was ordained priest by Cardinal Malabranca Orsini of Ostia, and the following day he was consecrated bishop and crowned pope in the basilica of St. Peter at Rome. Honorius IV was already advanced in age and so severely affected with the gout that he could neither stand nor walk. When saying Mass he was obliged to sit on a stool and at the Elevation his hands had to be raised by a mechanical contrivance.\n\nSicilian affairs required the immediate attention of the pope. By throwing off the rule of Charles of Anjou and taking Pedro III of Aragon as their king without the consent and approval of the pope, the Sicilians had practically denied his suzerainty over Sicily. The awful massacre of March 31, 1282, known as the Sicilian Vespers, had precluded every possibility of coming to an amicable understanding with Martin IV, a Frenchman who owed the tiara to Charles of Anjou. Pope Martin demanded unconditional submission to Charles of Anjou and the Apostolic See and, when this was refused, put Sicily and Pedro III under the ban, deprived Pedro of the Kingdom of Aragon, and gave it to Charles of Valois, the son of King Philip III of France. He, moreover, assisted Charles of Anjou in his attempts to recover Sicily by force of arms. The Sicilians not only repulsed the attacks of Charles of Anjou but also captured his son Charles of Salerno. On January 6, 1285, Charles of Anjou died, leaving his captive son Charles of Salerno as his natural successor. Such were the conditions in Sicily when Honorius IV ascended the papal throne. The Sicilians cherished the hope that the new pontiff would take a different stand from that of his predecessor in the Sicilian question, but their hopes were only partly realized. He was indeed less impulsive and more peaceably inclined than Martin IV, but he did not renounce the claims of the Church and of the House of Anjou upon the Sicilian crown. Neither did he set aside the severe ecclesiastical punishments imposed upon Sicily or restore to Pedro III the Kingdom of Aragon which Martin IV had transferred to Charles of Valois. On the other hand, he did not approve of the tyrannical government to which the Sicilians had been subject under Charles of Anjou. This is evident from his wise legislation as embodied in his constitution of September 17, 1285 (\u201cConstitutio super ordinatione regni Siciliae\u201d in \u201cBullarium Romanum\u201d, Turin, IV, 70-80). In this constitution he inculcates that no government can prosper which is not founded on justice and peace, and he passes forty-five ordinances intended chiefly to protect the people of Sicily against their king and his officials. In case of any violation of these ordinances by the king or his officials, the people were free to appeal to the Apostolic See for redress. The king, moreover, was bound to observe the ordinances contained in this constitution under pain of excommunication. Martin IV had allowed King Philip III of France to tax the clergy in France, and in a few dioceses of Germany, one-tenth of their revenues for the space of four years. The money thus collected was to be used for waging war against Pedro III with the purpose of conquering Aragon for Charles of Valois. Honorius IV approved this action of his predecessor. When Edward I of England requested him to use his influence to put an end to the war, he answered that Pedro III deserved to be punished and that Philip III should not be kept from reaping the fruits of a war which he had undertaken in the service and at the instance of the Church. The death of Pedro III on November 11, 1285, somewhat changed the Sicilian situation. His two sons Alfonso and James succeeded him, the former as King of Aragon, the latter as King of Sicily. Honorius IV, of course, acknowledged neither the one nor the other. On April 11, 1286, he solemnly excommunicated King James of Sicily and the bishops who had taken part in his coronation at Palermo on February 2, 1286; but neither the king nor the bishops concerned themselves about the excommunication. The king even sent a hostile fleet to the Roman coast and destroyed the city of Astura by fire. Charles of Salerno, the lawful King of Sicily, who was still held captive by the Sicilians, finally grew tired of his long captivity and signed a contract on February 27, 1287, in which he renounced his claims to the Kingdom of Sicily in favor of James of Aragon and his heirs. Honorius IV, however, who was asked for his approval, refused to listen to such an unprincipled act, which surrendered the rights of the Church and of the House of Anjou to refractory rebels. He declared the contract invalid and forbade all similar agreements for the future. While Honorius IV was inexorable in the stand he had taken towards Sicily and its self-imposed king, his relations towards Alfonso of Aragon became less hostile. Through the efforts of King Edward I of England, negotiations for peace were begun by Honorius IV and King Alfonso. The pope, however, did not live long enough to complete these negotiations, which finally resulted in a peaceful settlement of the Aragonese as well as the Sicilian question."}, {"url": "http://www.worldheritage.org/articles/Honor%C3%A9_IV,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "World Heritage Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia is the largest and most comprehensive Encyclopedia ever compiled.
