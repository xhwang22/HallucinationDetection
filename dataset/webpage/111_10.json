{"Dan Stearns has also produced albums for other bands, including The Replacements and The Pos": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/21/the-replacements-thirty-years-later-interview", "page_content": "It was the evening of 18 January 1986, and the Replacements had the biggest TV spot of their career. Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs \u2013 their single Bastards of Young and Kiss Me on the Bus \u2013 both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.\n\nMaybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn\u2019t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements\u2019 two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.\n\nIf you want a single incident that encapsulates the Replacements, their bass player Tommy Stinson says, that\u2019s the one. He\u2019s right \u2013 because as well as all but falling off the stage, the Replacements were also sort-of-great that night \u2013 their performance of Bastards of Young, especially, is a blast.\n\n\u201cThere was a game that had to be played that had nothing to do with music and everything to do with stroking someone else and fucking doing the whole song and dance that was completely foreign and, quite frankly, illegal to us,\u201d Stinson says of their attitude to career management. \u201cIt was reprehensible some of the things they wanted us to do that were supposed to make our career bigger and ultimately make them the money. I swear to God we tried several times to get in line with that and we just couldn\u2019t do it. Our personalities would not allow us to do that thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI admit there\u2019s a lack of dignity,\u201d says the Replacements\u2019 singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist, Paul Westerberg. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of what being the band is. You have to go out on a limb and take a chance. Falling on your face when you\u2019re young and good looking is one thing, but when you\u2019re an old man it can be quite humiliating.\u201d\n\nWesterberg and Stinson are now going out on a limb and taking that chance. After playing their first shows together under the Replacements name in more than 20 years in summer 2013, they\u2019re making their first return to Europe with five shows at the end of May and the start of June. And the whole thing has not been without its concerns for Westerberg, who has spent the last couple of decades on a quietly dignified solo career, while Stinson has stood alongside Axl Rose in Guns N\u2019 Roses. \u201cThere\u2019s a funny chemistry between Tommy and myself when we get together \u2013 we do tend to want to raise the devil a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a temptation. It\u2019s so natural.\u201d He laughs, a little ruefully. \u201cI think I was afraid of the lifestyle of the band. And feeling like there was some obligation to do that.\u201d\n\nThe story of one of the ur-bands of American rock \u2013 beloved by peers including REM and disciples such as Nirvana, and whose perfect, lovelorn songs have attracted admirers as unlikely as Matty Healy of the 1975 \u2013 started in unpromising circumstances in Minneapolis. Stinson was an 11-year-old tearaway \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d been to jail three times already, for fucking just being a little fuck-up\u201d \u2013 when his older brother Bob gave him a bass guitar in 1978 in an attempt to keep him off the streets. Stinson was already a rock\u2019n\u2019roll fan, listening to a 50s oldies station on the AM radio he kept in the \u201cTommy shrine\u201d in the closet jammed against his bed, and now the Stinson brothers started a band, Dogbreath, who rehearsed in the family basement, playing the prog rock Bob loved \u2013 \u201cAll the stuff that really makes my ears hurt now,\u201d Tommy says \u2013 in versions Tommy concedes were approximate at best.\n\nThe Replacements \u2013 Bastards of Young\n\nOne evening Westerberg, then an 18-year-old janitor in the office of Senator David Durenberger, heard Dogbreath practising as he walked home from work. He inveigled his way into the band, gradually establishing himself as its leader, and the Replacements were born. In May 1980 they recorded their first demo, got themselves signed to the local label Twin Tone, and commenced on a run of records that made them one of the most admired bands in America. Initially, they were trying to play hardcore punk, but it rapidly became apparent that they could and would try their hands at anything, with sometimes disastrous results. Given an audience of punks, they would reconfigure their songs into country or lounge music, to wind up the crowd. The internet is awash with recordings of Replacements shows in which the blind-drunk band toss off gruseome cover after gruesome cover: one of them got a semi-official release with the wholly accurate title The Shit Hits the Fans. Yet Westerberg also blossomed into an astonishing songwriter, with an equal facility for fearsome rockers and heartrending ballads.\n\nNot that the band were always appreciative of his songs. \u201cThey all liked Takin\u2019 a Ride, the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that it was a big argument for 10 years.\u201d He laughs. He\u2019s been insistent over the years that the rest of the band were especially unhappy with his penchant for ballads, but Stinson disagrees. \u201cThat\u2019s a misconception he\u2019s run with. I was never mortified by them. My brother was definitely not into them, but that\u2019s because Paul and my brother had more of a competing nature towards each other. Fucking every song he brought in was a hit in my world \u2013 \u2018Shit, let\u2019s get out there and fucking tear it up!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe heart of the Replacements lies in the three albums they released between 1984 and 1987. Let It Be \u2013 what a hubristic title! \u2013 mixed utter stupidity, the last gasps of their hardcore beginnings, and a series of ballads that captured teenage life like few writers had done before, with incredible empathy; Tim contained what were arguably Westerberg\u2019s best songs, but was hampered by a rotten period production (\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible-sounding record,\u201d Stinson says); Pleased to Meet Me was the most traditionally rocking album, but contained the perfect acoustic miniature Skyway (\u201cI knew that was a good little song,\u201d Westerberg says).\n\nWhat enabled them to be so many different things, Westerberg says, is that \u201cthere\u2019s more than one Paul. Paul is the rhythm guitar player and singer of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. And then Paul is the songwriter who really liked his Hank Williams and his Bob Dylan. That is something that I was always very cautious with around the guys. But that was part of what made us unique: we were utterly unpredictable. We had a metal maniac guitar player and an artist for a drummer. And me, a closet folkie. It made for a nice mix of unpredictablility. I think you\u2019re hard pressed to find another group that had as many facets to them as we did, and going through the songs now there\u2019s an unlimited variety of everything from quasi showtunes to fake speed metal. God almighty, what were we trying to prove?\u201d\n\nThe Replacements live in 1981\n\nWesterberg also had a gift for song titles and for lyrics that would alternate from vulnerability to one-liners, often summing up his own band\u2019s situation: \u201cOne foot in the door/ The other one in the gutter,\u201d he sang, accurately on I Don\u2019t Know, from Pleased to Meet Me. \u201cI read a great deal back then, a ton of fiction, Tennessee Williams, Updike and Flannery O\u2019Connor. I\u2019ve gotten away from that, but I think that was good for my writing process. And some of these lyrics are pretty good. It\u2019s a shame that I threw them away, because I don\u2019t remember them.\u201d\n\nBut by their penultimate album, 1989\u2019s Don\u2019t Tell a Soul, things were going awry. Bob Stinson was long sacked, and Westerberg, by his own account, was trying too hard to write hits. He was also realising that maybe the Replacements weren\u2019t only missing success because of their attitude, but also because people seemed to prefer their rock\u2019n\u2019roll to be polished and slick and big-haired, rather than sloppy and unpredictable. So he tried to be polished and slick and big-haired. \u201cOur nemesis was the Cult \u2013 they were on the same label, and all of our records were pushed back or held because the Cult had a new record out,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they\u2019d hire someone to throw in a bunch of compression and reverb to make it sound like it would work on the radio and that kind of funny business. But it didn\u2019t sound right, it didn\u2019t look right. We were just \u2026 midwestern.\u201d Stinson is more succinct about the album: \u201cIt was a bit of a disaster. Don\u2019t Tell a Soul was our least honest record and we made it under duress.\u201d\n\nThere was one more album, All Shook Down \u2013 a Westerberg solo record in all but name, though Stinson says it\u2019s now just about his favourite Replacements record \u2013 and that was that for more than 20 years, years in which the legend of the band grew, in which they were namedropped more and more often, films were made about them, and the offers for them to reform got bigger and bigger. The records were reissued with bonus tracks scraped up from all over the place (\u201cStuff that came from my basement that a manager pocketed one day and however many years later it\u2019s viable for someone else to make money off of,\u201d Westerberg says. \u201cI\u2019m always wary of it\u201d).\n\nThe Replacements on stage in 2013. Photograph: Steve Cohen\n\nWesterberg thinks that if they\u2019d become stars first time round, two things would have happened. First, several members of the band would have died (as it was, Bob Stinson died as a result of his addictions to alcohol and drugs in 1995, eight years after being sacked) from a lifestyle in which booze and powders were constants. Second, no one would care about them now. Their failure, he says, \u201ccertainly cemented the fans. And then the legend grew from us not playing \u2013 we weren\u2019t debunking it by not going out.\u201d After the split, not just their legend but their influence spread. The Goo Goo Dolls built a career on their admiration for the Replacements\u2019 sound, but in recent years the focus has been not on the revved-up guitars, but on the content of Westerberg\u2019s songwriting, resulting in some unlikely covers \u2013 Swingin\u2019 Party, originally on Tim, was a centrepiece of Lorde\u2019s live show, and has been covered by Kindness. Glen Campbell recorded a version of Sadly Beautiful in 2008. Now Miley Cyrus has just unveiled a cover \u2013 alongside Joan Jett and Laura Jane Grace \u2013 of Androgynous, originally from Let It Be.\n\nThe two founder members \u2013 they are now supplemented on stage by drummer Josh Freese and guitarist Dave Minehan \u2013 have markedly different attitudes to their band now. For Stinson, it\u2019s a journey back with \u201cattitude and nonchalance\u201d, the chance to remind everyone that \u201cthe charm of the Replacements is that we\u2019re not the greatest musicians on the planet, we\u2019re a great fucking rock\u2019n\u2019roll band.\u201d\n\nFor Westerberg, there\u2019s the irritated awareness that after two years on the road, the Replacements have again become an opportunity for other people to make money. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly whiffs of that these days,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s income being generated, and, like the song says, money changes everything. But once we get up there \u2026 We play for free. We get paid for waiting.\u201d There\u2019s also the problem of relearning the songs all over again, 25 or 30 years after they were written. \u201cLiterally, we haven\u2019t played Treatment Bound in years, so I\u2019m sitting there writing the words for the second time in my life. The first time was when we did it and the second time is here, 30 years later,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the fact that being a Replacement again has revived something in him. \u201cSince starting up with the band again it\u2019s kind of shaken every cobweb out of my head and got me rattled in a way \u2013 probably in a good way. I can\u2019t relax any more. I can\u2019t sit down and watch the television. I\u2019m torn between the world of being a father, a homewowner and a creative artist and a rock\u2019n\u2019roll singer. I was doing the crossword puzzle waiting for you to call, and that\u2019s about as relaxing as I get.\u201d\n\nWhen the Replacements take to the stage for the first of their two nights at the Roundhouse in London on 2 June , much of the past will be missing. There\u2019ll be no guitarist wandering on halfway through because he was too drunk to play from the start; there will be no deliberate antagonising of the audience, no show so bad they\u2019ll have to inscribe an apology into the runoff groove of their next record (as they did with Portland). But take a look at the clips from the reunion shows: there will still be a rock\u2019n\u2019roll band with the power to cut through the nostalgia and surprise the assembled thousands. Accept no replacements.\n\nThe Replacements play the Roundhouse, London, on 2 and 3 June.

It was born from what Stearns describes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the cumulative fatigue one acquires grinding the proverbial square peg at a round hole, year after year,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and was developed in rumination and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waking dreams.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The album isn\u2019 hard listening because of any technical deficiency or lack of ideas (quite the opposite) \u2013 rather, it feels uncomfortably personal. There is a confronting sense of voyeurism in hearing the inner workings of Stearns\u2019 psyche played out so starkly in his compositions. Particularly where this psyche itself seems ill at ease, the album gives off a discomforting feeling of having delved too far into another person\u2019 life and found things that weren\u2019 meant to be shared.\n\nStearns suffers from bouts of dissociation, a psychological state in which a person experiences a detachment between their perception and their emotional and conscious reactions to the world. This feeling of detachment snakes its way through the entire album. The sounds and tracks sit against each other in unusual ways and the pieces idle and brood with no rush to develop. Golden Town is all the more personal for its jarring juxtapositions and lack of polish \u2013 scribbled electronics, distressed field recordings, ghosts of traditional instruments and murmuring sub-bass all press against one another in cramped acoustic spaces.\n\nStearns claims the pieces are designed to work in isolation and they do, to a point, but their real interest comes from their placement within the broader context of the album. Part of what makes Golden Town so engrossing (and exhausting) is its lack of any single emotional through-line. The tracks move between a vast number of psychological states from brooding intensity (\u201cSigmate\u2019) to out and out violence (\u201cPileus\u2019) to journalistic detachment (\u201cBLUEwallREDroseBROWNdoor\u2019). Emerging from the overcast atmosphere of the rest of the album, the title track plays out a naive mix of chiming strings and cartoon gun sounds. It is a beautiful, childlike moment that only works as well as it does for its unexpected arrival amongst the harrowing inner spaces of the rest of the release.\n\nA big part of Golden Town\u2019 success is its refusal to cooperate. The album defies expectation or categorisation by shifting between wildly different aesthetic and emotional positions with little sense of narrative. There are almost no clear melodies or pulses to give a foothold in the abstraction. Though this makes for a difficult listen, it also feels incredibly authentic. Stearns hasn\u2019 censored or regulated his output toward some overarching sound; he has simply shared the sounds he has made in their raw and vulnerable state. It\u2019s a long way from being pleasant (and I certainly don\u2019 feel like listening to it again soon) but Golden Town is frequently moving, constantly interesting and occasionally poignant.\n\nHenry Andersen"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/08/the-replacements-10-of-the-best", "page_content": "1 Shiftless When Idle\n\nThe beginning of the Replacements in 1978 was as inauspicious as any band\u2019s has been. Guitarist Bob Stinson and drummer Chris Mars were in their late teens, Tommy Stinson wasn\u2019t even in his teens and perpetually getting in trouble with the law. His big brother ordered him to take up bass to keep him out of trouble, bribing him with cans of Coke and chocolate to keep him playing. Collectively, they were called Dogbreath, and their big number was a cover of Yes\u2019s Roundabout. One night, frontman-to-be Paul Westerberg was walking home from his job as a caretaker in the district office of US senator David Durenberger when he heard the band practising in the Stinson family home. He was eventually invited to join, and refused to play Roundabout. The band became the Replacements and Westerberg started bringing his songs to the party. In autumn 1980 they recorded their first album, Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash: it was sort of punk, sort of classic rock, wholly ragged, but both Westerberg\u2019s ability to write an indelible hook and the band\u2019s gift for finding the perfect way to back it were already evident \u2013 his description of the band as \u201cpower trash\u201d was pretty much perfect. Shiftless When Idle was one of the first Replacements anthems, a spot-on description of the band\u2019s own beautiful fecklessness. \u201cAnd I ain\u2019t got no idols, I ain\u2019t got much taste,\u201d Westerberg sings. \u201cI\u2019m shiftless when I\u2019m idle, and I got time to waste.\u201d It was also an early display of Westerberg\u2019s gift for the perfect song title, poetic in its simplicity and choice of words.\n\n2 Color Me Impressed\n\n\n\nPunk was a vehicle for the Replacements, and one that could have taken them into a dead end. They realised that though they could play fast and they could play loud, there were always others who could play faster and louder. There weren\u2019t any others, though, who could combine all the things the Replacements did: silliness, melody, empathy, romance, anger, ennui. Stink, their second album \u2013 or EP, really \u2013 was pretty much their last gasp as a punk band, and its follow-up, Hootenanny, was the first time the band displayed every facet of their personality. That means it\u2019s sometimes a shocking mess, but for all the terrible jokes \u2013 if the title track were half as amusing as the band thought it was, it would be twice as amusing as it actually is \u2013 it allowed Westerberg\u2019s songwriting to stretch into new places. Within Your Reach was an early effort at what would be revealed as possibly his greatest strength, the lovelorn ballad, while Color Me Impressed portrayed him in his favourite role: the outsider who\u2019s simultaneously superior and insecure: \u201cEverybody at your party/ They don\u2019t look depressed/ Everybody dressin\u2019 funny/ Color me impressed.\u201d In retrospect, though, Color Me Impressed was just a dry run for what came next.\n\nThe band play Saturday Night Live in 1986 \u2026 Tommy Stinson, Chris Mars, Paul Westerberg, Bob Stinson. Photograph: NBC/Getty\n\n3 Androgynous\n\n\n\nThe fourth Replacements album was their masterpiece, the one that still gets 10/10 reviews when reissued, that crops up in best album ever lists. It had the perfect cover \u2013 the band, looking hungover, perched on the roof of the Stinson home \u2013 and the perfect title. After rejecting Kind of a Sewer and The Replacements Get a Soft On as options, they chose to pluck one from rock history in an act of bravado: the album was called Let It Be. The strange thing about Let It Be is that a good chunk of the album, is by most rational standards, throwaway. There\u2019s a song about Tommy getting his tonsils out (Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out); a cod-metal track that gleans amusement from someone having an erection (Gary\u2019s Got a Boner); a Kiss cover (Black Diamond), and a throwaway complaint about MTV bands (Seen Your Video), but those songs are somehow necessary. Let It Be\u2019s greatness lies in it being the perfect summation of the life of a young man who\u2019s not yet graduated to being grown up: most \u201cgreat\u201d albums reduce life to one set of emotions, but Let It Be encompassed everything: reckless stupidity, sexual uncertainty, wild abandon, boredom, excitement. It sounded like all of late teenage life condensed into less than 40 minutes, by someone who seemed as confused as you, but was able to articulate that confusion. Androgynous was one of its greatest moments, a piano ballad about gender ambiguity that espoused the message of the album\u2019s title without ever seeming to preach. Indeed, Westerberg seemed just as confused here as anywhere \u2013 and showed his repeated gift for capturing a complicated thought in a single line (\u201cHe might be a father, but he sure ain\u2019t a dad\u201d). It\u2019s a strange, beautiful song, and testament to how far he had travelled in a very short time.\n\nThe_Replacements \u2026 Let It Be\n\n4 Sixteen Blue\n\nLet It Be\u2019s Unsatisfied is usually held up as the definitive Westerberg ballad, but this is the one that grabs me every time. His vocal is perfect \u2013 for a singer with a limited range, he was startlingly expressive, and his gravelly, battered tone gave him an unusual ability to communicate empathy. Sixteen Blue (another perfect title) is one of the greatest-ever songs about being a teenager. Westerberg was only 22 when he wrote it, and it helped to have an actual 16-year-old around, in the form of Tommy Stinson. It veers from defiance (\u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 funny/ You ain\u2019t laughin\u2019 are you?\u201d) to vulnerability (\u201cBrag about things you don\u2019t understand/ A girl and a woman, a boy and a man/ Everything is sexually vague/ Now you\u2019re wondering to yourself/ If you might be gay\u201d). It\u2019s witty (\u201cYou\u2019re lying, now you\u2019re lying on your back\u201d) and it\u2019s accepting (\u201cYou\u2019re age is the hardest age/ Everything drags and drags). And, musically, it\u2019s beautiful: the melody is perfectly pitched, and it ends with a great miniature guitar solo from Bob Stinson. It\u2019s easy when writing about the Replacements to concentrate on Westerberg\u2019s songwriting, or to talk about the band\u2019s couldn\u2019t-give-a-fuck attitude, but this was a band that was genuinely greater than the sum of its parts, and Stinson was the perfect guitarist: tuneful but fierce and wild. He seemed like someone who was trying to play classic rock and getting it all wrong, creating something even more memorable as a result.\n\n5 Bastards of Young\n\nLet It Be won the Replacements their major-label deal, and Tim was the first album with Sire. There\u2019s a lot wrong with it: the production is horrible, the cover is worse, but it contained some of Westerberg\u2019s best songs yet: Left of the Dial (another great title) was his love letter to the alternative music scene, Swingin\u2019 Party another great hymn to vulnerability (and covered not so long ago by Lorde). And then there was this, an anthem of defiance and alienation, and the first major-label single from the Replacements. And how did they choose to promote it in the heyday of the MTV age? With a black-and-white video that showed not the band, just a loudspeaker vibrating to the music. At around 1:45 a figure appears and picks up a copy of Tim, then sits down, his cigarette in shot. And aside from different extremities of that person coming into view, blurrily, that\u2019s about it \u2013 until he kicks in the speaker and leaves the room at the end of the clip. Bastards of Young stated Westerberg\u2019s ambivalence about being the Next Big Thing \u2013 \u201cGod, what a mess, on the ladder of success/ Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung,\u201d it opened \u2013 and, even, about having fans. \u201cThe ones who love us best are the ones we\u2019ll lay to rest/ And visit their graves on holidays at best,\u201d he insists, while \u201cthe ones who love us least are the ones we\u2019ll die to please\u201d. It was set, naturally, not to music that expressed any of that confusion, but to one of the band\u2019s hardest tunes.\n\n6 Here Comes a Regular\n\nThe Replacements \u2013 perhaps unfortunately \u2013 became as much a legend as a band. People would go to shows to see them pass out. They would play shocking gigs of tuneless cover versions (one particularly bad performance was released as a bootleg by their original label, Twin/Tone, titled The Shit Hits the Fans). Sobriety was their enemy. But Westerberg knew alcohol wasn\u2019t always your friend, that it was a passport to loneliness as much as a source of camaraderie. Here Comes a Regular was the inverse of the theme from Cheers. The residents of the bar go there hoping for someone to call out their name, but really they\u2019re going to escape responsibility. \u201cAm I the only one who feels ashamed?\u201d he asks.\n\nCan\u2019t Hardly Wait was recorded again and again, with different lyrics, the version that eventually got released being recorded for the second Sire album, Pleased To Meet Me, with horns and strings. For my money, the version recorded for Tim and eventually released on All for Nothing/Nothing for All is better \u2013 more taut and raw. More rocking, really. It\u2019s a simple song, little more than a nagging, itchy riff, a not-quite-anthemic chorus, and the usual share of one-liners (\u201cJesus rides beside me, he never buys any smokes\u201d). As usual, though, there\u2019s uncertainty beneath the triumphant music \u2013 Westerberg is shouting that he can\u2019t hardly wait not in a moment of joy, but after climbing on top of a \u201cscummy water tower\u201d. This is one of the Replacements song titles that was custom-made for use in a film: a 1998 high-school comedy took the name and used the song.\n\n8 Alex Chilton\n\nPleased to Meet Me was probably the Replacements\u2019 best-sounding album, given a big, hard production by Jim Dickinson at Ardent Studios in Memphis. Given the location, it was almost natural that Westerberg would pay tribute to one of his heroes (who produced the version of Can\u2019t Hardly Wait above). At this point, Alex Chilton wasn\u2019t yet the lionised figure he\u2019s become, and writing a song with his name in the title was the kind of thing that would provoke a flurry of interest. Some of the lyrics are a little bit \u201cDid he really sing that?\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo we will rape and pillage in a village of his choice\u201d. But there\u2019s a delightful sincerity to Westerberg\u2019s insistence, in the song\u2019s bridge, that \u201cI never travel far/ Without a little Big Star.\u201d And the riff was one of the Replacements\u2019 best. The only thing it lacked was a sloppy, crazy Bob Stinson solo \u2013 the guitarist had been kicked out of the band by this time, in circumstances that did no credit to Westerberg. In the summer of 1986, Stinson had been ordered by a court to undertake a rehab programme. Three dry weeks later, the band played a five-night stand in Minneapolis and on the last night, Westerberg ordered him to \u201cEither take a drink, motherfucker, or get off my stage.\u201d His then wife, Carleen, told the writer Michael Azerrad: \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d seen Bob cry.\u201d He was sacked a couple of weeks later. He died in 1995 of organ failure, caused by years of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n9 Skyway\n\nI interviewed Westerberg last week for a forthcoming Guardian feature and he told me, half joking, that Skyway was the first good song he\u2019d written. It\u2019s not true: he\u2019d written plenty already by that time. But it might be the most perfect song he\u2019s ever written. It\u2019s nothing more than a simple acoustic love song, but it\u2019s rooted perfectly in place \u2013 in the skyways of Minneapolis, the enclosed passages between buildings so the locals don\u2019t have to venture into the winter snows (Minnesota is the coldest of the lower 48 states). A man keeps seeing a woman, he wonders if they\u2019ll meet, and when he gets his chance \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do or say\u201d. That\u2019s all there is to it. It\u2019s sad and true and heartfelt.\n\nThe Replacements \u2026 at the brink of splitting in 1990. Photograph: Jim Steinfeldt/Getty Images\n\nBy 1989\u2019s Don\u2019t Tell a Soul, their penultimate album, the Replacements had pretty thoroughly lost their way. The songs weren\u2019t as good \u2013 Westerberg told me he was trying too hard to write anthems \u2013 and the production was horrible. It was an outfit who weren\u2019t meant to be a big, commercial rock band trying far too hard to be a big, commercial rock band. It wasn\u2019t just that it wasn\u2019t what their audience wanted, it was also something they were temperamentally unsuited to: by all accounts the post-Stinson years (at least until Westerberg got sober in 1990) were a morass of even more drugs, even more booze and the resultant paranoia. But even so, there were moments of greatness. Achin\u2019 to Be was the last of the great lovelorn Replacements ballads. It would have benefited from sounding rougher, rather than like something custom-built for FM radio (this is the version of the Replacements that was copied by admirers, rather than the completely inimitable band of Let It Be), but it\u2019s still a beautiful song about a woman who\u2019s mystifying but compelling. And its title summed up the very notion of what the Replacements were about: they were achin\u2019 to be; they never really realised what they were."}, {"url": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/todd-rundgren-10-best-production-credits-patti-smith-new-york-dolls/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Todd Rundgren was announced as part of the 2021 Class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. My view of the institution is not exactly high, and I doubt an iconoclastic figure like Rundgren is too chuffed at the idea either. Still, as a titanic figure of popular music for more than four decades, his absence began to feel more and more egregious with every passing year. The man once known solely as the singer behind \u2018Hello It\u2019s Me\u2019 and \u2018Bang the Drum All Day\u2019 has rightfully been acknowledged as a major creative influence over a litany of musical styles and genres, including pop, rock, progressive rock, and electronica.\n\nBut Rundgren\u2019s legacy can\u2019t just be confined to his own work. The musician\u2019s second calling, as it turned out, was as a producer who could both expand an artist\u2019s sonic horizons and reel in the more experimental minds of music. His production work varies wildly from act to act, sometimes favouring stripped down live takes with a heightened focus on band chemistry, and other times providing lush arrangements and new technology for artists to explore their most eccentric of ideas.\n\nWhen looking at it all together, Rundgren\u2019s career thus far looks to be one of the most prolific in all of popular music. Through his stints in the band\u2019s Nazz and Utopia, his 26 official studio albums, and his collaborations with other musicians, Rundgren\u2019s place has now been permanently etched among the greatest of all time. To celebrate, let\u2019s look at how he shaped the world of music through his production. These are ten albums that feature Rundgren behind the studio glass, helping others fully realise their visions.\n\nTodd Rundgren\u2019s 10 best production credits:\n\nThe Band \u2013 Stage Fright\n\nAlthough his name doesn\u2019t appear as an official producer, Rundgren\u2019s first big break after his departure from Nazz was helping roots rock stalwarts The Band craft their impressively funky third LP Stage Fright.\n\nTaking an especial interest in the complex keyboard interplay between the savant-level musicianship of Garth Hudson and the hardened boogie-woogie of Richard Manuel, Rundgren was able to highlight the blend of old-style Americana that the Canadian group had so lovingly fostered on their first two albums and pair it with updates in newer technology and stopping arrangements.\n\nBadfinger \u2013 Straight Up\n\nLike a number of Rundgren\u2019s future production projects, Straight Up was fraught with difficulties and miscommunication. Unlike those future projects, Rundgren wasn\u2019t initially a complicit party: Badfinger were being battered around by Apple Records, having their first attempt at the album produced by Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick shelved and their second attempt, this time produced by George Harrison, stuck in limbo.\n\nThe resulting album with Rundgren is a mishmash of different captains steering a ship in opposing directions, but it helps that all those captains happen to be musical geniuses. \u2018Baby Blue\u2019, \u2018Name of the Game\u2019, and \u2018Day After Day\u2019 are stone-cold classics, while the deeper cuts roar to life with a rollicking energy that would soon become recognized as a precursor to power pop.\n\nSparks \u2013 Halfnelson/Sparks\n\nDespite their combined reputations for eccentricity and intractability, Rundgren actually had a positive report with the Mael brothers when they worked together on Sparks\u2019 debut LP. Sharing a similarly experimental bent and penchant for sugary melodies, the trio crafted what could very well be described as the band\u2019s most accessible studio effort, initially released as Halfnelson and later.\n\nStill finding their voice, Sparks presented themselves as simply a \u201cweird rock band\u201d instead of the genre-defying amalgam they became. For his part, Rundgren didn\u2019t attempt to change the band\u2019s quirky uniqueness, simply trying to record the songs as cleanly as possible. The result might be a bit thin compared to both artist\u2019s lofty heights, but Sparks remains a highly enjoyable time capsule of a band and a producer both finding their signature voices.\n\nNew York Dolls \u2013 New York Dolls\n\nThe great thing about Todd Rundgren was that he could work with anyone. Genres were blurred lines to him, and the singular sounds of an artist\u2019s style took precedence over whether it was in line with what he personally would have done. The New York Dolls, in all their proto-punk sloppiness and jagged edges, were miles away from the increasingly intricate leanings of Rundgren, but the album that resulted from the pairing, New York Dolls, is everything that it needed to be: loud, aggressive, unpretentiously wild and fun.\n\nRundgren\u2019s occasional additions on tracks like \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 and \u2018Personality Crisis\u2019 never overshadow the band\u2019s gritty energy, and the result just might be his one production effort most resistant to changing times and tastes. New York Dolls still sounds as badass as it did nearly 40 years ago.\n\nGrand Funk Railroad \u2013 We\u2019re an American Band\n\nGrand Funk, it could be argued, were not a great band. A meat and potatoes hard rock outfit from Flint, Michigan, Grand Funk played unpretentious, uncomplicated good time rock and roll that sang about girls and cars and dancing, the farthest thing from \u201cart\u201d that you could possibly find. The trick for making Grand Funk a success wasn\u2019t about making them smarter or cooler, and Rundgren doesn\u2019t even pretend to try on We\u2019re an American Band.\n\nInstead, he focuses on how goofy, dumb, and uniquely patriotic he can make the proceedings, resulting in a bare-chested, flag-waving, beer-drinking party that remains completely committed to the joys of being as simple as possible. Grand Funk didn\u2019t have to be a great band to be at their best, they just needed to be an American band.\n\nMeat Loaf \u2013 Bat Out of Hell\n\nOn the complete opposite spectrum from Grand Funk lies Meat Loaf, the theatrical wild man performer and his writer Jim Steinman, the poet laureate of excessive kitchen sink style rock and roll. The songs on Bat Out of Hell are multipart suites that owed as much to musical theatre as they did to Chuck Berry, and Rundgren placed all of his Phil Spector-esque grandeur into making the album as over the top as possible.\n\nThat turned out to be a stroke of genius, as the only way to contain a personality like Meat Loaf on record was to surround him with the biggest, cheesiest, most extravagant arranging and production humanly possible. The result should be a muddled mess, but instead, it soars with a completely unexpected grace, the kind that doesn\u2019t require subtlety or simplicity to have a gigantic impact.\n\nThe Tubes \u2013 Remote Control\n\nBizarre new wave collective The Tubes were far too artsy to ever make a lasting impact on popular music. Their wild stage shows, consciously futuristic sound, and insistence on complex concepts to drive every aspect of the band\u2019s existence meant that they were always destined for cult adoration.\n\nFee Waybill\u2019s singular warble spitting out a half-coherent story about television obsession found Rundgren in a unique position of being a comparatively straight-laced presence, but he gamely rode the band\u2019s vision to its sleek, electronically bustling, utterly strange conclusion.\n\nPatti Smith \u2013 Wave\n\nSuch distinctive and idiosyncratic voices as Patti Smith and Todd Rundgren should, in an ideal world, cause creative explosions that result in career-defining albums for both.\n\nIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re expecting going into Wave, you\u2019ll be disappointed. But if you temper your expectations, what you\u2019ll find is a consistently rewarding album that brings out the poppiest recordings of Smith\u2019s career that never compromises her unmistakable growl or poetic lyricism. Rundgren is a deceptively transparent figure, subtly edging Smith and her group away from punk and towards art-pop. It might rankle fan\u2019s of Smith first three albums, but Wave is an exciting and worthy addition to Smith\u2019s canon.\n\nThe Psychedelic Furs \u2013 Forever Now\n\nRundgren\u2019s production style very rarely overlapped with the predominant tastes of contemporary pop music. He was drawn to unique textures and restlessly forward-thinking sounds as opposed to popular trends. He was able to synthesize both, however, on The Psychedelic Furs Forever Now.\n\n\u2018Love My Way\u2019 is an indelible slice of \u201980s pop, but the rest of Forever Now plays into the post-punk foundations of the group and the willingness of all involved to indulge in angular guitar lines, growling vocals, and decidedly uncommercial darkness. Rundgren\u2019s contributions, including marimba and the instigation of backing vocals from harmony extraordinaire Flo & Eddy, gave the album just enough polish to have it be viable for public consumption.\n\nXTC \u2013 Skylarking\n\nNow, finally, comes the culmination of all of Rundgren\u2019s sometimes creatively fertile, sometimes combatively combustive tendencies. In most productions, Rundgren could either commandeer the album\u2019s direction or sink into the background and let the band ride on their own peculiar inclinations. No such luck with Andy Partridge.\n\nThe two fought, verbally sparred, and clashed all throughout the making of Skylarking. Rarely seeing eye to eye on anything, the two creative geniuses made the recording process as difficult as it could possibly be. No matter. The album is a masterpiece, one that represents the peak of each other\u2019s best musical ideas and worst social proclivities."}, {"url": "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/four-seasons-now-tragic-deaths-25726508", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the best celeb gossip with the Daily Star Showbiz newsletter\n\nThey're one of music's all-time greatest vocal groups, and in 2015, a film about The Four Seasons was made into a major Hollywood film - Jersey Boys, based on the stage musical of the same name.\n\nWith hits including Walk Like a Man, Sherry and December 1963 (Oh, What A Night), they were an inspiration for generations of musicians, with music legend Billy Joel paying tribute to them when he inducted the group into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nHe said: \"The Four Seasons had wonderful chord progressions, beautiful writing, terrific production, fantastic harmony, [and] records that really spoke to us.\"\n\nOn the anniversary of bass player Nick Massi's death on December 24, 2000, Daily Star takes a look at where the other members of The Four Seasons are now.\n\nFrankie Valli\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFrankie Castelluccio, otherwise known as Frankie Valli, is the frontman for The Four Seasons who dazzled audiences with his impressive falsetto voice.\n\nAs well as singing hit songs including Bye Bye Baby and Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, which have been covered by numerous artists, Frankie also lent his vocals to the soundtrack for one of the biggest musicals of all time, Grease, singing its hit theme song.\n\nWith a career spanning almost 70 years, it is no surprise that he has amassed a huge estimated fortune of more than $80million (\u00a359m), after being the voice of songs that have been the soundtrack to thousands of people's lives around the world.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt's not just on the stage where he has made a name for himself though - he has also landed roles in hit TV shows including Miami Vice as Mafia Boss Frank Doss and in The Sopranos as mobster Rusty Millio.\n\nHe most recently released an album of jazz songs called Touch of Jazz in 2021, and has tour dates planned across the world throughout 2022.\n\nAway from the limelight, the star had six children and has been married three times - first to Mary Mandel from 1957-1971, then to Mary Ann Hannigan from 1974-1982, and then to Randy Clohessy from 1984-2004.\n\nTragically, Frankie's stepdaughter Celia died in 1980 when she fell off a fire escape, with his youngest daughter, Francine, dying from a reported drug overdose just six months later.\n\nBob Gaudio\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBefore joining The Four Seasons, Bob Gaudio was already a successful songwriter of the hit single Who Wears Short Shorts? at the age of 15 - a song which continues to delight audiences decades later and has even been featured in comedies such as The Simpsons.\n\nHis flair for writing timeless songs was then discovered by none other than award winning actor Joe Peschi of Home Alone and Goodfellas fame, who then told group member Tommy Devito and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBob is the songwriter behind The Four Season's hit songs including Sherry and Big Girls Don't Cry, and although he stopped performing with the band in the '70s, he continued writing songs for the group and Frankie Valli such as December 1963 (Oh What A Night), which he wrote with his wife.\n\nTalking to The Tennessean, Bob explained that he and Frankie Valli have a close bond, despite not performing together anymore, so much so that the singer trusts Bob to cast the actor who plays him in hit show Jersey Boys.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe said: \"Frankie always says that I know more about him than he does, so whenever we\u2019re casting that role, I spend a few days with them in the studio.\n\n\"The same with casting the Bobs.

The members were Morrison (in full James Douglas Morrison; b. December 8, 1943, Melbourne, Florida, U.S.\u2014d. July 3, 1971, Paris, France), Ray Manzarek (b. February 12, 1939, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.\u2014d. May 20, 2013, Rosenheim, Germany), Robby Krieger (b. January 8, 1946, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), and John Densmore (b. December 1, 1945, Los Angeles).\n\nThe Doors\u2019 instrumentalists\u2014keyboardist Manzarek, guitarist Krieger, and drummer Densmore\u2014combined backgrounds in classical music and blues with the improvisational daring of a jazz band. It was the dark-edged eroticism of Morrison\u2019s baritone and pseudo-poetic lyrics, however, that set the Los Angeles-based quartet apart from the prevailing hippie utopianism that pervaded West Coast rock in the late 1960s. Morrison\u2019s early death only enhanced his reputation as the quintessential rock showman and troubled artiste for subsequent generations.\n\nMorrison and Manzarek, acquaintances from the film school of the University of California at Los Angeles, conceived the group after the singer recited one of his poems to the keyboardist on a southern California beach. Morrison took the band\u2019s name from Aldous Huxley\u2019s book on mescaline, The Doors of Perception, which in turn referred to a line in a poem by William Blake. The Doors acquired a reputation for pushing the boundaries of rock composition, both musically and lyrically, in performances on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Their breakthrough hit, \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d was an anthem in 1967, but it was songs such as \u201cThe End\u201d\u2014an 11-minute Oedipal drama with sexually explicit lyrics and a swirling ebb-and-flow arrangement\u2014that established the Doors\u2019 reputation as one of rock\u2019s most potent, controversial, and theatrical acts. Indeed, the group was banned from the Whisky-a-Go-Go in Los Angeles after an early performance of the song.\n\nThough the group\u2019s ambitious music encompassed everything from Chicago blues to German cabaret, their string of pop hits caused them to be dismissed by some critics as a teenybopper act; this deeply troubled Morrison, who craved acceptance as a serious artist. By the time of the release of the Doors\u2019 third album, Waiting for the Sun (1968), Morrison had created a shamanistic alter ego for himself, the Lizard King; the singer\u2019s poem \u201cThe Celebration of the Lizard King\u201d was printed inside the record jacket. His concert performances were marked by increasingly outrageous stunts, and Morrison was arrested in 1969 for exposing himself onstage in Miami. The charges were eventually dropped, but the incident served notice of Morrison\u2019s physical decline, in part because of his addiction to alcohol.\n\nThe singer took increasing solace in his poetry, some of which was published, and the group\u2019s tours became less frequent. The Doors reestablished their artistic credibility with the blues-steeped Morrison Hotel (1970), but after the quartet\u2019s sixth studio release, L.A. Woman (1971), Morrison retreated to Paris, where he hoped to pursue a literary career. Instead, he died there of heart failure in 1971 at age 27. Without Morrison, the Doors produced two undistinguished albums before breaking up. They reunited briefly in 1978 to record An American Prayer, providing backing music for poetry Morrison recorded before his death. Manzarek also produced albums for the punk band X.\n\nIn death Morrison was lionized by generations of fans, both as a youth icon and as an influence on singers such as Iggy Pop, Echo and the Bunnymen\u2019s Ian McCulloch, and Pearl Jam\u2019s Eddie Vedder. The Doors\u2019 releases continued to sell in the millions, and The Doors, a 1991 movie directed by Oliver Stone, was a critical and popular success. The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2007."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dan-auerbach-the-arcs-new-album-1234610273/", "page_content": "The Black Keys\u2019 Dan Auerbach has reactivated his side project the Arcs for Electrophonic Chronic, the band\u2019s first album since their 2015 debut Yours, Dreamily.\n\nThe LP features the Arcs\u2019 original lineup of Dan Auerbach, Leon Michels, Nick Movshon, Homer Steinweiss, and the late Richard Swift, with the album paying tribute to the beloved singer-songwriter-producer-collaborator who died in 2018.\n\n\u201cThis new record is all about honoring Swift,\u201d Auerbach said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to say goodbye to him, by revisiting him playing and laughing, singing.

All or Nothin\u2019 \u2013 Nikki Lane\n\nThough Lane had her reservations at first when it came to fully trusting Auerbach\u2019s calls, she later ended up with a solid record that included her hit track \u201cRight Time.\u201d Aside from working together in the studio, the two linked up on stage in 2013 to perform a rendition of Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton\u2019s serenade \u201cJust Someone I Used to Know.\u201d\n\n3. Supernova \u2013 Ray LaMontagne\n\nRay LaMontagne had been trying to work with Auerbach for five years, until his dream was finally realized in Supernova. While several songs share similarities in sound to the softer side of The Arcs, the rest of the album delivers upbeat, feel-good tracks such as the hit \u201cSupernova.\u201d\n\n4. Ultraviolence \u2013 Lana Del Rey\n\nAuerbach wasn\u2019t the sole producer for the singer\u2019s sophomore effort, though he was responsible for several of the record\u2019s hits such as \u201cWest Coast,\u201d which peaked at No. 17 on the Hot 100. While the two were candid about their musical differences, Del Rey has said in interviews that working with Auerbach helped her gain confidence and made her feel interesting. The two met through mutual friends while Auerbach was still working on LaMontagne\u2019s record.\n\n5. Head in the Dirt \u2013 Hanni El Khatib\n\nAuerbach produced Khatib\u2019s sophomore album, and in turn helped propel the emerging rocker to the next level. The two met by chance at a bar in Paris, in which Khatib was DJing at following a show. The two ended up sharing the turntable the rest of the evening and later decided to take their kindred taste in music back to the studio.\n\n6. Hypnotic Nights \u2013 JEFF the Brotherhood\n\nThough this record was the band\u2019s seventh studio album, it marked their first major label release. The rock duo rightfully called upon Auerbach \u2014 also one half of a rock duo \u2014 to help production run smoothly, as it clearly did. Tracks like \u201cSixpack\u201d showcase JEFF the Brotherhood diving into the DIY aesthetic and distortion often heard on the Black Keys\u2019 work.\n\n7. Locked Down \u2013 Dr. John\n\nAuerbach has been a long time fan of Dr. John, though when it came to producing the iconic artist\u2019s upcoming album he needed encouragement from a friend. Auerbach was urged to visit Dr. John in New Orleans, where he first pitched the idea of the two working together. Dr. John has said Auerbach was honest with him and that in the end he trusted his spirit, which told him to take the risk of trying something new. The risk paid off, as the album peaked at No. 1 on the Blues Albums chart.\n\n8. Tell Me \u2013 Jessica Lea Mayfield\n\nAside from working together on music, Auerbach and Mayfield share another similarity in that they grew up less than 30 minutes away from each other in Akron and Kent, Ohio, respectively. While Auerbach primarily records at his studio in Nashville, the two laid down this album in his hometown \u2014 where they also recorded Mayfield\u2019s 2008 release, With Blasphemy, So Heartfelt.\n\n"}]}
