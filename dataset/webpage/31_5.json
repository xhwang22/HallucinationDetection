In 2014, Peter mounted an underdog campaign to unseat a popular six-term incumbent Republican in the primary election, closing a 25-point margin and eventually securing a 14-point victory. In November 2014, he would go on to become the first resident of the Village of Lombard in 140 years to be elected to the General Assembly.\n\nIn November 2018, Breen lost a tight reelection in the midst of the national \u201cBlue Wave,\u201d with House Speaker Michael Madigan spending over $2 Million against Breen, outspending Breen\u2019s underdog campaign roughly 3 to 1. Breen concluded his two terms with 32 bills passed into law, more than any other second term legislator. His bills saved small businesses and nonprofits millions, protected seniors from having their estates raided by scammers, and shined a bright spotlight on the activities and spending of Illinois\u2019 many thousands of units of government. He enjoyed consistently high marks for his support of small businesses, manufacturing and technology jobs, lower taxes and balanced budgets, a healthier environment, craft brewers and organic farmers, transparency and openness, and free speech and personal freedoms.\n\nAn attorney by training, Peter left a lucrative private law practice in Chicago in 2004 to enter full-time public service. One year later, Peter founded a local not-for-profit, mobilizing hundreds of volunteers who have since served thousands of pregnant women in need and their children in DuPage and Will counties. He spearheaded the Chicagoland Project Gabriel campaign, which distributed tens of thousands of \u201cPregnant? Need Help?\u201d bumper stickers throughout local churches to reach out to women in difficult and untimely pregnancies. In 2008, Peter joined the Thomas More Society, a national not-for-profit law firm that focuses on the defense of First Amendment rights. As Vice President and Senior Counsel for the Society, Peter represents churches, organizations, and individuals in state and federal courts across the country, and he regularly advises state and federal elected officials on the effects of proposed legislation. Peter is sought out by local and national television, radio, and print media as an expert legal analyst.\n\nPeter served as an elected Trustee on the Lombard Village Board from 2011-2014, stepping in as Lombard\u2019s Acting Village President in 2012-13. One of his first initiatives as a trustee was authoring and securing passage of the strongest municipal transparency policy in the state of Illinois, earning Lombard a rare 100% transparency rating from the Illinois Policy Institute. When he took over as Acting Village President, Peter initiated a line-by-line review of the Village\u2019s proposed 2013 annual budget, identifying and cutting over half a million dollars in spending without the loss of Village services. He then ensured that those savings were returned to Lombard taxpayers by permanently eliminating the Village\u2019s annual vehicle sticker and fee. The next year, Peter led a successful fight to freeze property taxes in the Lilac Village, which was the first property tax relief residents experienced in 20 years.\n\nDuring his time as Trustee, Peter served as Chairperson of the Lombard Economic & Community Development Committee. Under Peter\u2019s leadership, the Committee took on numerous initiatives to help downtown Lombard and to improve the business climate generally in the village. He sponsored and worked to pass the Lombard \u201coutdoor dining\u201d program, rolling back unnecessary regulations to allow new outdoor dining options in the downtown area. He also started downtown Lombard\u2019s \u201cOutdoor Game Watches,\u201d bringing in hundreds of new patrons to shop at local businesses. In order to encourage lower prices for taxi service and to allow Lombard-based livery businesses to grow, Peter rewrote the Lombard Taxi Ordinance to wipe away outdated regulations and to allow a wider variety of vehicles to service residents\u2019 transport needs.\n\nIn 2009, Peter founded \u201cBanRedCams,\u201d a grassroots initiative that sought to ban unfair and punitive red light cameras in Lombard and surrounding communities. Lombard removed its cameras shortly thereafter. As a Village Trustee, Peter successfully worked to prevent garnishment of residents\u2019 state tax refunds to pay red light camera ticket fees.\n\nIn 2019, Peter began the Fair Maps Initiative to remove the redistricting power from Michael Madigan. This initiative would give voters the opportunity to pass a referendum in the 2020 November elections to amend the Illinois Constitution. If passed, redistricting would be put into the hands of a bipartisan commission, ending gerrymandering in Illinois. The goal is to give more residents in Illinois a voice when choosing representatives.\n\nPeter earned his Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, completing the program in just 3 years. Peter earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame, which he attended on scholarship. He is a member of the Father Boecker Council of the Knights of Columbus and is an Eagle Scout. Peter and his wife Margie have been married for 14 years, and they are the proud parents of two sons, Matthew Elijah, whom they adopted in August 2016, and James Francis, whom they adopted in September 2018.\n\nsource: VoteBreen.com"}, {"url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/10/21/18423343/illinois-house-48th-district-republican-nominee-peter-breen", "page_content": "Republican Peter Breen is the Sun-Times\u2019 endorsed candidate in the 48th district race in the Illinois House. Breen faces Democrat Terra Costa Howard in the general election.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times sent the candidates seeking nominations for the Illinois House of Representatives a list of questions to find out their views on a range of important issues facing the state of Illinois.\n\nThese are the answers Breen submitted to our questionnaire.\n\nPlease explain what cause or causes you will make priorities.\n\nBreen: Too many Illinoisans feel they must uproot and leave the state they call home. Senior citizens are taxed out of their homes, or are just tired of supporting a state government they see as disconnected and corrupt. Students are heading to college out of state, never to return. Families are packing up for places with more and better paying jobs.\n\nThe solutions are not easy, but they are simple. Lower the tax burden on our residents and businesses\u2014both income taxes and property taxes have to come down. Stop out-of-control spending at the state level, which is driving tax and fee increases. Embrace reform measures like Fair Maps, to ensure that legislators represent whole communities, not sliced up narrow groups of partisans. Our broken state government is the primary obstacle standing in the way of turning our state around.\n\nPlease list three concerns that are highly specific to your district, such as a project that should be undertaken or a state policy related to some local issue that must be changed.\n\nBreen: The latest studies indicate that, for every tax dollar the residents of DuPage County send to Springfield, only 31 cents come back. That\u2019s a lot of money sent to Springfield, with very little to show for it.\n\nFor our district, when we identify a local issue that requires some action by the state, I\u2019ve usually able to secure those changes. For instance, I was able to work with Sen. Chris Nybo and others on getting IDOT approval to bring in the new Mariano\u2019s on Roosevelt Rd in Lombard. He and I also successfully sponsored a bill to allow a local nonprofit, SCARCE, collect cooking grease and oil, which had been prohibited under state law. And when a popular local microbrewery, Noon Whistle, were prohibited by state law from using innovative \u201c360-lid\u201d technology (allowing removal of nearly all the top of a beverage can, making it more like a cup), I drafted the bill to get that changed.\n\nThe people and businesses of our district are burdened the most by out-of-control spending and tax increases, onerous mandates on businesses and local governments, and excessive debt, all caused by past mostly Democrat-led majorities of the General Assembly.\n\nWho is Peter Breen?\n\nHis legislative District: 48th Representative District His political/civic background: State Representative, 2015-present, Floor Leader, 2017-present Trustee, 2011-2014, & Acting President, 2012-2013, Village of Lombard His occupation: Constitutional Attorney & State Representative His education: Juris Doctor, University of Notre Dame Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Vanderbilt University Diploma, Naperville North High School Campaign website: votebreen.com\n\nWhat are the most important differences between you and your opponent?\n\nBreen: I\u2019ve been an independent advocate for the people of my district during my two terms in the Illinois House. There\u2019s no person or group that can claim to \u201cown\u201d me.\n\nHowever, my opponent is almost entirely funded by House Speaker Mike Madigan and his political operation. She\u2019s staffed with his people. She uses the talking points his people provide her.\n\nMy opponent sat on a school board for 8 years, and she voted to increase property taxes every single year, including during the worst depths of the Great Recession. She even broke ties several years to raise property taxes. And those were large increases, some years as high as 12% or 15%, well more than the rate of inflation. My opponent raises taxes, and she has zero credibility in addressing the massive property tax problem plaguing our state.\n\nI\u2019ve repeatedly voted to freeze property taxes, and I support reducing and capping them. This isn\u2019t new for me: while on the Lombard Village Board, I secured a freeze, the first property tax relief the people of the Lilac Village had experienced in 20 years. I also led the effort as Acting Village President to cut half a million dollars from our annual budget, with no loss of services, and return the money to the people by permanently eliminating the village vehicle sticker. If you drive in Lombard, you might see some folks still have a sticker on their car\u2013that\u2019s from 2012-2013, the final year of that most-despised fee.\n\nFinally, my opponent has pointed to abortion either as the primary reason she decided to run against me or the only issue she would discuss in interviews with reporters. That sort of single-issue focus doesn\u2019t fit our district, and it isn\u2019t the reason Illinois state government is broke and bankrupt either. On abortion, my opponent supports taxpayer funding of elective abortions, while I do not believe tax dollars should be used for elective abortions. But I\u2019m focused cleaning up the fiscal mess in Springfield and shining a bright light on the special interests who have taken hold of so much of Illinois government, at all levels.\n\nIllinois is now the sixth-most populated state, down from No. 5, after 33,703 people moved out between July 2016 and July 2017. What must the Legislature do to make Illinois a more desirable place to live?\n\nBreen: We should be terribly alarmed by our population loss. Our consumer base is powerful. But as we lose residents, the corporate and business base follows them out of state. Our start-up businesses, our education opportunities, and employment opportunities will all suffer. Reversing the trend means making Illinois a more hospitable place to live, with regard to our taxing policy, and a better place to start, expand, and run a business.\n\nOur border state neighbors take full advantage of our poor policies with regard to property taxes, sales taxes, fees, and regulations. When a huge corporation chooses a location a few miles north in Kenosha County, it takes advantage of our highly skilled, highly educated work force, but another state realizes the lion\u2019s share of the benefits of that corporation. Many residents will move a few miles to take even greater advantage of lower tax policies overall, and a lower cost of living. This scenario continues to happen to Illinois.\n\nWe have to lower the tax burden. Create policy that offers businesses a long-term vision of an Illinois that is hospitable to them and their growth. These are things that could happen quickly with the right governance. The reasons for not doing so are utterly selfish and self-dealing government policies. It\u2019s not too late yet, but we are absolutely on the verge of passing a point where it is.\n\nIn 2017, our state\u2019s unfunded pension liability ballooned to more than $130 billion. What\u2019s to be done about that?\n\nBreen: The General Assembly refuses to grapple with substantive pension reform. The Illinois Democrats rely heavily on government employee unions for campaign workers and dollars, and those government unions have taken a hard line against any pension reform. And the many government workers in downstate districts have firmly instructed their legislators, \u201cdon\u2019t touch our pensions.\u201d But these attitudes have us hurtling toward a future where our (clearly unsustainable) pension liabilities can\u2019t be paid. The problem stems from politicians over-promising pension benefits, mainly in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, leading to a 1000% increase in liability over the past 30 years.\n\nThe General Assembly should do everything possible to stem the tide of increasing pension liabilities. We should immediately convene a Blue Ribbon Commission, bringing together the top legal and economic experts, to lay out every option possibly available to us. That should lead into the broadest possible public, statewide debate on this crisis. Since Illinois politicians either refuse or feel they can\u2019t address this issue, avenues should be explored to put the matter directly to the People.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2016, the number of Illinois residents who enrolled as college freshmen outside the state increased by 73% (20,507 to 35,445). Why are so many more Illinois residents going to college elsewhere? What should be done to encourage more of them to go to school here?\n\nBreen: The causes for our college decline are both short-term and long-term. First off, we\u2019re not competitive enough in the short-term for the students looking at schools. Our kids who in years past would attend an Illinois school are headed out of state for a variety of immediate reasons, including because they got a better financial package or because they felt the programs offered by an out-of-state school would better meet their educational aims.\n\nA review of the data from the past few years shows that, for each of our state universities, the Illinois state government spends more money per pupil than nearly any other competing institution\u2013and at the same time, our schools charge a higher tuition per student than their competing schools! This imbalance, where we\u2019re pumping in more tax dollars but still charging more than competing schools, needs to be addressed openly and honestly.\n\nThe long-term issues relate to the desire of families and businesses to stay here. If families don\u2019t see a future for themselves in Illinois, why would their kids bother attending school in-state? If there are more and better jobs elsewhere, why stay? We have to fix our broader governmental problems before we will stem the long-term tide of students leaving.\n\nWhat laws, if any, should the Legislature pass to address the problem of gun violence?\n\nBreen: This term, I worked with Rep. Kathy Willis (D-Addison) to craft the state\u2019s new Firearms Restraining Order law, which provides a mechanism to get guns out of the hands of provably dangerous individuals. That law is a significant step forward to addressing the issue of gun violence. I\u2019ve also supported the licensing of firearms dealers, to stop the illegal flow of guns into the hands of criminals, and increased penalties on those who commit crimes with guns.\n\nOn-demand scheduling software now helps large retail companies determine how many staff members they will need on a day-to-day or even hour-to-hour basis. The downside is that employees may not receive their work schedules until the last minute. Oregon and a number of cities have responded by adopting \u201cfair scheduling\u201d laws. Would it be appropriate for the Illinois\n\nLegislature to pass a \u201cfair scheduling\u201d law? Please explain. What would such a law look like?\n\nBreen: At this point, we need to focus on reducing the burdens on businesses, and especially those facing small businesses, and help them create jobs and economic growth. In reviewing any regulation, my first question is \u201cwhat are our competing states doing?\u201d\u2013that means reviewing the policies of the states that are now home to former Illinois businesses.\n\nShould recreational marijuana be legalized in Illinois? Please explain.\n\nBreen: The law enforcement community is strongly against a full-scale legalization and commercialization of recreational marijuana, and their concerns should be thoroughly investigated, discussed, and analyzed before legalization is considered.\n\nOpioid overdoses and fatalities continue to rise in number. In Illinois in 2017, there were 13,395 opioid overdoses, including 2,110 deaths. What should the Legislature do, if anything, about this?\n\nBreen: Opioid abuse has destroyed families and taken too many of our loved ones. I\u2019m in favor of an all-of-the-above approach on this subject, whether in looking at alternatives to opioids, education campaigns, and law enforcement and criminal justice reforms, among others.\n\nThe Future Energy Jobs Act, passed in 2016, is generating job growth in renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. Do you agree or disagree with the objectives and substance of the Act? What more \u2014 or less \u2014 should be done?\n\nBreen: I supported the Future Energy Jobs Act, and I was recognized this year by the Illinois Environmental Council with a 100% rating for my support of legislation protecting our environment. The Act appears to be working, but due to its complexity, it\u2019s taken a while to fully implement. There will inevitably be bumps in the road, which the General Assembly should monitor and intervene to address if necessary.\n\nWhat would you do to ensure the long-term viability of the state\u2019s Medicaid program? What is your view on managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries?\n\nBreen: Every state has different ways of providing care for those on Medicaid, so as we look at reforms, there are myriad examples to draw upon. Whether you\u2019re looking at managed care, or some form of individual savings accounts, or some of the innovative new medical practice models sweeping the country, let\u2019s take an honest look. The point is to get the best care possible at the best price, and if there are better ways to achieve that goal, we should assess them.\n\nUnderfunding at the Department of Corrections has led to troubling findings by the auditor general that many inmates don\u2019t receive services or opportunities for work while incarcerated. Is this a legitimate concern? What should the Legislature do?\n\nBreen: One of the purposes of prison is reformative, to provide the support necessary to the individual to be a productive member of society upon release. Whatever we need to do to bring that about, we should do. Work skills are absolutely critical to this\u2013without those skills, you can\u2019t get and keep a job. If folks who have been in prison can find good jobs after release, the incentives to commit crimes in the future obviously go way down.\n\nShould the state restore the practice of parole for people sentenced to long terms? Why or why not?\n\nBreen: At this time, with the terrible violence plaguing our communities, we need to first focus on protecting innocent folks across our state who are at risk of grave harm. The victims need to be our top priority.\n\nAhead of the historic 2018 elections, the Sun-Times is teaming up weekly with the Better Government Association, in print and online, to fact-check the truthfulness of the candidates.

The use of animal imagery was meant as a metaphor to compare American politics to a circus.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt , a Republican U.S. president from 1901 to 1909, inspired the teddy bear when he refused to shoot a tied-up bear on a hunting trip. The story reached toy maker Morris Michtom, who decided to make stuffed bears as a dedication to Roosevelt. The name comes from Roosevelt\u2019s nickname, Teddy.\n\nRepublican Party , byname Grand Old Party (GOP) , in the United States , one of the two major political parties, the other being the Democratic Party . During the 19th century the Republican Party stood against the extension of slavery to the country\u2019s new territories and, ultimately, for slavery\u2019s complete abolition. During the 20th and 21st centuries the party came to be associated with laissez-faire capitalism , low taxes, and conservative social policies. The party acquired the acronym GOP, widely understood as \u201cGrand Old Party,\u201d in the 1870s. The party\u2019s official logo, the elephant , is derived from a cartoon by Thomas Nast and also dates from the 1870s.\n\nHistory\n\nThe term Republican was adopted in 1792 by supporters of Thomas Jefferson, who favoured a decentralized government with limited powers. Although Jefferson\u2019s political philosophy is consistent with the outlook of the modern Republican Party, his faction, which soon became known as the Democratic-Republican Party, ironically evolved by the 1830s into the Democratic Party, the modern Republican Party\u2019s chief rival.\n\nThe Republican Party traces its roots to the 1850s, when antislavery leaders (including former members of the Democratic, Whig, and Free-Soil parties) joined forces to oppose the extension of slavery into the Kansas and Nebraska territories by the proposed Kansas-Nebraska Act. At meetings in Ripon, Wisconsin (May 1854), and Jackson, Michigan (July 1854), they recommended forming a new party, which was duly established at the political convention in Jackson.\n\nAt their first presidential nominating convention in 1856, the Republicans nominated John C. Fr\u00e9mont on a platform that called on Congress to abolish slavery in the territories, reflecting a widely held view in the North. Although ultimately unsuccessful in his presidential bid, Fr\u00e9mont carried 11 Northern states and received nearly two-fifths of the electoral vote. During the first four years of its existence, the party rapidly displaced the Whigs as the main opposition to the dominant Democratic Party. In 1860 the Democrats split over the slavery issue, as the Northern and Southern wings of the party nominated different candidates (Stephen A. Douglas and John C. Breckinridge, respectively); the election that year also included John Bell, the nominee of the Constitutional Union Party. Thus, the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln, was able to capture the presidency, winning 18 Northern states and receiving 60 percent of the electoral vote but only 40 percent of the popular vote. By the time of Lincoln\u2019s inauguration as president, however, seven Southern states had seceded from the Union, and the country soon descended into the American Civil War (1861\u201365).\n\nBritannica Quiz 43 Questions About Politics (Mostly in the United States) Compiled from Britannica\u2019s Quizzes\n\nIn 1863 Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared slaves in rebelling states to be \u201cforever free\u201d and welcomed them to join the Union\u2019s armed forces. The abolition of slavery would, in 1865, be formally entrenched in the Constitution of the United States with the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment. Because the historical role played by Lincoln and the Republican Party in the abolition of slavery came to be regarded as their greatest legacy, the Republican Party is sometimes referred to as the party of Lincoln.\n\nThe prolonged agony of the Civil War weakened Lincoln\u2019s prospects for reelection in 1864. To broaden his support, he chose as his vice presidential candidate Andrew Johnson, a pro-Union Democratic senator from Tennessee, and the Lincoln-Johnson ticket subsequently won a landslide victory over Democrat George B. McClellan and his running mate George Pendleton. Following Lincoln\u2019s assassination at the end of the war, Johnson favoured Lincoln\u2019s moderate program for the Reconstruction of the South over the more punitive plan backed by the Radical Republican members of Congress. Stymied for a time by Johnson\u2019s vetoes, the Radical Republicans won overwhelming control of Congress in the 1866 elections and engineered Johnson\u2019s impeachment in the House of Representatives. Although the Senate fell one vote short of convicting and removing Johnson, the Radical Republicans managed to implement their Reconstruction program, which made the party anathema across the former Confederacy. In the North the party\u2019s close identification with the Union victory secured it the allegiance of most farmers, and its support of protective tariffs and of the interests of big business eventually gained it the backing of powerful industrial and financial circles.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

After 1860 the Democratic and Republican parties became the major parties in a largely two-party system. In federal elections from the 1870s to the 1890s, the parties were in rough balance\u2014except in the South, which became solidly Democratic. The two parties controlled Congress for almost equal periods, though the Democrats held the presidency only during the two terms of Grover Cleveland (1885\u201389 and 1893\u201397).\n\nIn the country\u2019s second critical election, in 1896, the Republicans won the presidency and control of both houses of Congress, and the Republican Party became the majority party in most states outside the South. The Republican presidential nominee that year was William McKinley, a conservative who favoured high tariffs on foreign goods and \u201csound\u201d money tied to the value of gold. The Democrats, already burdened by the economic depression that began under President Cleveland, nominated William Jennings Bryan, who advocated cheap money (money available at low interest rates) based on both gold and silver.\n\nThe assassination of President McKinley in 1901 elevated to the presidency Theodore Roosevelt, leader of the party\u2019s progressive wing. Roosevelt opposed monopolistic and exploitative business practices, adopted a more conciliatory attitude toward labour, and urged the conservation of natural resources. He was reelected in 1904 but declined to run in 1908, deferring to his secretary of war and friend, William Howard Taft, who won handily. Subsequently disenchanted with Taft\u2019s conservative policies, Roosevelt unsuccessfully challenged him for the Republican nomination in 1912. Roosevelt then bolted the Republican Party to form the Progressive Party (Bull Moose Party) and ran for president against Taft and the Democratic candidate, Woodrow Wilson. With the Republican vote divided, Wilson won the presidency, and he was reelected in 1916. During the spectacular prosperity of the 1920s, the Republicans\u2019 conservative and probusiness policies proved more attractive to voters than Wilson\u2019s brand of idealism and internationalism. The Republicans easily won the presidential elections of 1920, 1924, and 1928.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed had severe consequences for the Republicans, largely because of their unwillingness to combat the effects of the depression through direct government intervention in the economy. In the election of 1932, considered the country\u2019s third critical election, Republican incumbent Pres. Herbert Hoover was overwhelmingly defeated by Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the Republicans were relegated to the status of a minority party. Roosevelt\u2019s three reelections (he was the only president to serve more than two terms), the succession of Harry S. Truman to the presidency on Roosevelt\u2019s death in 1945, and Truman\u2019s narrow election over New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey in 1948 kept the Republicans out of the White House for two decades. Although most Republicans in the 1930s vehemently opposed Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal social programs, by the 1950s the party had largely accepted the federal government\u2019s expanded role and regulatory powers.\n\nIn 1952 the Republican Party nominated as its presidential candidate World War II Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, who easily defeated Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson in the general election. Despite Eisenhower\u2019s centrist views, the Republican platform was essentially conservative, calling for a strong anticommunist stance in foreign affairs, reductions in government regulation of the economy, lower taxes for the wealthy, and resistance to federal civil rights legislation. Nevertheless, Eisenhower did dispatch federal troops to Arkansas in 1957 to enforce the court-ordered racial integration of a high school in Little Rock; he also signed the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960. Moreover, his \u201cmoderate Republicanism\u201d led him to oversee an expansion of social security, an increase in the minimum wage, and the creation of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nIn the early 1950s Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin became the party\u2019s most ardent anticommunist, taking the limelight while attempting to expose communists who he claimed were in the American government. In the interest of party unity, Eisenhower chose not to criticize McCarthy\u2019s demagogic red-baiting and occasionally appeared to support him; privately, however, the president did not hide his enmity for McCarthy, worked to discredit him, and pushed Republican senators to censure him.\n\nThe party retained the traditional support of both big and small business and gained new support from growing numbers of middle-class suburbanites and\u2014perhaps most significantly\u2014white Southerners, who were upset by the prointegration policies of leading Democrats, including President Truman, who had ordered the integration of the military. Eisenhower was reelected in 1956, but in 1960 Richard M. Nixon, Eisenhower\u2019s vice president, lost narrowly to Democrat John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe Republicans were in severe turmoil at their 1964 convention, where moderates and conservatives battled for control of the party. Ultimately, the conservatives secured the nomination of Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, who lost by a landslide to Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s vice president and successor. By 1968 the party\u2019s moderate faction regained control and again nominated Nixon, who narrowly won the popular vote over Hubert H. Humphrey, Johnson\u2019s vice president. Many Southern Democrats abandoned the Democratic Party to vote for the anti-integration candidate George C. Wallace. Importantly, the 1964 and 1968 elections signaled the death of the Democratic \u201cSolid South,\u201d as both Goldwater and Nixon made significant inroads there. In 1964, 5 of the 6 states won by Goldwater were in the South; in 1968, 11 Southern states voted for Nixon and only 1 voted for Humphrey.\n\nAlthough Nixon was reelected by a landslide in 1972, Republicans made few gains in congressional, state, and local elections and failed to win control of Congress. In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Nixon resigned the presidency in August 1974 and was succeeded in office by Gerald R. Ford, the first appointed vice president to become president. Ford lost narrowly to Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976. In 1980 Ronald W. Reagan, the charismatic leader of the Republican Party\u2019s conservative wing, defeated Carter and helped the Republicans to regain control of the Senate, which they held until 1987.\n\nReagan introduced deep tax cuts and launched a massive buildup of U.S. military forces. His personal popularity and an economic recovery contributed to his 49-state victory over Democrat Walter F. Mondale in 1984. His vice president, George H.W. Bush, continued the Republicans\u2019 presidential success by handily defeating Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. During Bush\u2019s term, the Cold War came to an end after communism collapsed in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. In 1991 Bush led an international coalition that drove Iraqi armies out of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War. Congress continued to be controlled by the Democrats, however, and Bush lost his bid for reelection in 1992 to another Southern Democrat, Bill Clinton. Partly because of Clinton\u2019s declining popularity in 1993\u201394, the Republicans won victories in the 1994 midterm elections that gave them control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1954. They promptly undertook efforts to overhaul the country\u2019s welfare system and to reduce the budget deficit, but their uncompromising and confrontational style led many voters to blame them for a budget impasse in 1995\u201396 that resulted in two partial government shutdowns. Clinton was reelected in 1996, though the Republicans retained control of Congress.\n\nIn 2000 Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of the former president, recaptured the presidency for the Republicans, receiving 500,000 fewer popular votes than Democrat Al Gore but narrowly winning a majority of the electoral vote (271\u2013266) after the Supreme Court of the United States ordered a halt to the manual recounting of disputed ballots in Florida. Bush was only the second son of a president to assume the nation\u2019s highest office. The Republicans also won a majority in both chambers of Congress (though the Democrats gained effective control of the Senate in 2001 following the decision of Republican Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont to became an independent). A surge in Bush\u2019s popularity following the September 11 attacks of 2001 enabled the Republicans to recapture the Senate and to make gains in the House of Representatives in 2002. In 2004 Bush was narrowly reelected, winning both the popular and electoral vote, and the Republicans kept control of both houses of Congress. In the 2006 midterm elections, however, the Republicans fared poorly, hindered largely by the growing opposition to the Iraq War, and the Democrats regained control of both the House and the Senate. In the general election of 2008 the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, was defeated by Democrat Barack Obama, and the Democrats increased their majority in both houses of Congress. The following year the Republican National Committee elected Michael Steele as its first African American chairman.\n\nWith a gain of some 60 seats, a swing not registered since 1948, Republicans recaptured control of the House and dramatically reduced the Democrats\u2019 majority in the Senate in the 2010 midterm election. The election, which was widely seen as a referendum on the Obama administration\u2019s policy agenda, was marked by anxiety over the struggling economy (especially the high unemployment rate) and by the upsurge of the Tea Party\u2014a populist movement whose adherents generally opposed excessive taxation and \u201cbig\u201d government. Tea Party candidates, some of whom had displaced candidates favoured by the Republican establishment during the primaries, had mixed success in the general election.\n\nIn the 2012 general election, the Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was unable to unseat Obama. The situation in Congress remained relatively unchanged, with Republicans retaining their hold on the House of Representatives and Democrats successfully defending their majority in the Senate. The Republicans regained control of the Senate during the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was a watershed moment for the Republican Party. The party\u2019s nomination was captured by businessman and television personality Donald Trump, who easily defeated more-mainstream Republican candidates such as Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz in the primaries. Trump\u2019s far-right social positions and outspoken hostility toward immigrants made a number of mainstream Republicans concerned that he was setting the party up for a Goldwater-esque landslide electoral defeat. But, to the surprise of most political pundits, he won the electoral college despite amassing almost three million fewer popular votes than Democrat Hillary Clinton, giving Republicans the presidency for the first time in eight years to go alongside the party\u2019s retention of power in both chambers of Congress. Trump continued to defy political norms after taking office, and his presidency was plagued by controversy, especially allegations that his campaign had colluded with Russia to secure his election. Although he enjoyed solid support among Republicans, some believed that he was causing irreparable harm to the party. His overall approval ratings were typically low, and in the 2018 midterms Democrats retook control of the House."}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/terra-costa-howard-attacks-rep-peter-breens-pro-life-views/", "page_content": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- Democrats like State Representative nominee Terra Costa Howard are choosing abortion as a key issue in the fight.

Click here to see more.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times Editorial Board sent nominees for the Illinois House of Representatives a list of questions to find out their views on a range of important issues facing the state of Illinois and their districts. Peter Breen submitted the following responses:\n\n1. The COVID-19 pandemic has hammered the finances of Illinois. The state is staring at a $6.2 billion budget shortfall in this fiscal year. What should be done? Please be specific.\n\nThe pandemic highlighted the historical short-sightedness of the General Assembly. We went into this horrific situation with absolutely NO money in a \u201crainy day fund.\u201d Further, for over a decade, the General Assembly knowingly passed underfunded budgets using every accounting scheme imaginable. Even when we had higher than anticipated tax receipts in the state, as the result of a very positive economy, we didn\u2019t save but spent every dime and more. Then the virus came and devastated business, personal income, taxes and user fees, etc. While the economy is beginning to rebound, Illinois must become far more proactive in helping grow small and midsize businesses, instead of again hiking crippling taxes to meet the voracious appetite for out-of-control spending in Springfield.\n\n2. What grade \u2014 \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d \u2014 would you give Gov. J.B. Pritzker for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic? Please explain. What, if anything, should he have done differently?\n\nThe grade has to be \u201cIncomplete,\u201d since we are still midway through the pandemic. We won\u2019t know the impact of the governor\u2019s lockdown and pandemic orders until at least next year: then, we can see the full results of these policies on the physical, mental, and economic health of our residents versus those of neighboring states.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Illinois imposed the worst tax burden on its residents of any state in the country, along with being known as a notoriously bad place to start, build, or bring a business. Gov. Pritzker then imposed one of the most severe lockdowns in the country. Predictably, Illinois residents have not recovered their jobs and businesses as quickly as folks in other states. Even with the lockdown, Illinoisans experienced worse physical health impacts from COVID than neighboring states.\n\nWe need a full post-COVID review of why we suffered such high infections and deaths in long-term-care facilities. Without that review, we won\u2019t know whether this was due to the governor\u2019s actions or inactions, or some other cause.\n\nFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve advocated against including my county of DuPage in a \u201czone\u201d with Cook County in terms of phasing openings and policies. That penalized and handicapped our ability to move more quickly to recovery.\n\nAnd it was wrong to ban small family retailers from in-person sales of their products, while large retailers could sell those same products.\n\nFinally, the Pritzker Administration entirely botched unemployment insurance, leaving the jobless with no one to answer the phone, trying to navigate a broken website, and suffering the indignity of their personal identification details put on the internet. With tens of thousands of government employees across Illinois at home, there were plenty of people who could have manned unemployment phone lines during this unprecedented crisis.\n\n3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, legislatures in some states have taken up the issue of police reform. Should Illinois do the same? If so, what would that look like?\n\nEveryone was horrified by the tragic circumstances surrounding the needless death of George Floyd. It was inexcusable on every level. There are clearly agencies and departments that require more and better training of officers and a clear set of policies to prevent such a tragic result ever again. That officer in Minneapolis was acting outside of guidelines and deserves to be punished for his crimes. Our agencies are better than this, particularly in DuPage County.\n\nIn Illinois, I backed the bipartisan Police and Community Relations Improvement Act, which banned chokeholds, put standards in place for officer-involved deaths, and improved training requirements, among other reforms. While due to this Act, Illinois already has in place many of the reforms other states are now reviewing, we should always be looking at any and every helpful reform that protects the public and gives our agencies the ability to perform professionally in maintaining the law. As a Village Trustee, I was also a strong supporter of body cameras to protect both the public and police officers in altercations. This was at a time when there was significant resistance to these devices.\n\n4. Should the Legislature pass a law requiring all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras? Why or why not?\n\nAbsolutely. It protects both citizens and law enforcement. It can and does act as a deterrent for both parties. I would immediately sponsor or co-sponsor such a bill.\n\n5. Federal prosecutors have revealed a comprehensive scheme of bribery, ghost jobs and favoritism in subcontracting by ComEd to influence the actions of House Speaker Michael Madigan. Who\u2019s to blame? What ethics reforms should follow? Should Madigan resign?\n\nTerra Costa Howard, and enablers like her, are to blame. During the 2018 elections, Costa Howard promised the residents of the 48th District that she would be independent of Mike Madigan, but then she turned around and took $1.5 million in campaign contributions from him (more than any other state legislative candidate) and voted for him for Illinois House Speaker. Terra Costa Howard handed our vote\u2014and our voice\u2014to a crook and a thief.\n\nEven today, Costa Howard still refuses to return one dime of all the dirty money she\u2019s taken\u2014and she is still raking in money from Madigan-controlled campaign committees.\n\nMadigan has run state government as a pay-to-play scheme for decades. The monied interest groups pay into his campaign committees and hire his preferred lobbyists, guaranteeing them a seat at the legislative table. If you don\u2019t have money or the right lobbyist, you lose.\n\nAnd he\u2019s done this in plain sight, with increasing numbers of Illinoisans watching in horror, but unable to stop it. When reform-minded candidates like me step forward to run in competitive districts, they get hit with multi-million-dollar smear campaigns, executed by the Madigan machine\u2019s sophisticated political operation. Even post-Madigan, this won\u2019t change unless we elect new leaders clean of the taint of Madigan and his machine.\n\nOn Madigan, I called for his resignation last year. While in the House, I opposed Madigan for Speaker twice.\n\nOn reforms, we need term limits. We have a part-time citizen legislature, and term limits will strengthen the temporary nature of legislative service. There are a raft of additional reforms in this vein: bans on lobbying after legislating, strengthening lobbyist disclosure requirements, limits on legislative leaders, taking power away from legislative leaders and returning it to members, and putting teeth into laws prohibiting conflicts of interest by legislators, among others. Reform should be an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach.\n\n6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years, whether it\u2019s legislation you have sponsored or work you have done in other ways to improve your community.\n\nMy wife and I were blessed to be able to adopt our second son two years ago, literally a week before the last election. We\u2019re very committed to our community and blessed to raise a family here.\n\nDuring COVID, I\u2019ve been active running food drives that collected thousands of pounds of food and thousands of dollars for our local St. Vincent De Paul Societies. I\u2019ve also been handling requests from local residents who weren\u2019t able to get help from the Costa Howard district office. And I\u2019ve been putting out informational Facebook Live videos that have received tens of thousands of views, on a variety of topics of interest to our district.\n\nAt the end of last year, after our community suffered a spate of over-valuations on local properties, I put on multiple emergency property tax seminars, along with working directly with residents, to help folks get their assessments and taxes lowered. Ms. Costa Howard was not responsive to the needs of these residents, who are literally being taxed out of their homes.\n\nIn my professional capacity, I\u2019ve worked hard to assist churches to be able to open safely, with precautions, to enjoy the status that other \u201cessential places\u201d have had. My wife and I also participate with both time and treasure to many of the civic organizations in my community.\n\n7. Please list three concerns that are specific to your district, such as a project that should be undertaken or a state policy related to an important local issue that should be revised.\n\nThe people and businesses of our district are burdened the most by out-of-control spending and taxes, onerous mandates on businesses and local governments, and rampant corruption. We can\u2019t recover quickly and fully from COVID while suffering under these burdens.\n\nYet all of them have been made worse by Terra Costa Howard: she supported unbalanced budgets, new mandates on local businesses, and voted for Madigan for House Speaker. Costa Howard told voters during her 2018 campaign that she\u2019d be for \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d and \u201csmall business,\u201d but once she got to Springfield, her voting record was the exact opposite.\n\nCosta Howard even voted against a proposal to stop the conflicts of interest in General Assembly members, like Mike Madigan, writing the property tax laws and then raking in millions doing property tax appeals. The Chicago City Council banned that practice, in response to the Ed Burke prosecution, but Costa Howard rejected reform and stood with Madigan.\n\nFor our district, I\u2019ve succeeded in securing relief when state action was required. Whether it was securing IDOT approval for the new Mariano\u2019s on Roosevelt Rd in Lombard; helping a local nonprofit, SCARCE, with a law allowing it to collect cooking grease and oil; or changing state law to allow Noon Whistle Brewing to use innovative \u201c360-lid\u201d technology (allowing removal of nearly all the top of a beverage can, making it more like a cup), I got the job done.\n\n8. What are your other top legislative priorities?\n\nToo many Illinoisans feel they must uproot and leave the state they call home. We are now at six straight years of losing residents to other states, losing over 100,000 people net in just the past two years. Every person who leaves takes their hopes and dreams and contributions with them, pulling vitality and energy away from Illinois.\n\nAnd the latest data shows we\u2019re not just losing seniors\u2014it\u2019s prime working-age residents who are leading the exodus. Residents are taxed out of their homes, or are just tired of supporting a state government they see as disconnected and corrupt. Students are heading to college out of state, never to return. Families are packing up for places with more and better paying jobs.\n\nThe solutions are not easy, but they are simple. Lower the tax burden on our residents and businesses\u2014both income taxes and property taxes have to come down. Stop out-of-control spending at the state level, which is driving tax and fee increases. Embrace reform measures like Fair Maps and Term Limits, to ensure we have citizen legislators representing whole communities, not sliced up narrow groups of partisans. Our broken state government is the primary obstacle standing in the way of turning our state around.\n\n9. What is your position on Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s proposed graduated income tax? Please explain.\n\nI stand firmly against the graduated income tax. My greatest reason comes from my experience in the General Assembly, where I saw first-hand the amount of wasteful spending and poor fiscal policy being implemented in the state. The budgets passed always exceeded our anticipated income, and even those income numbers were artificially inflated as part of an obscene effort to call these budgets \u201cbalanced.\u201d They never were. In a state with an insatiable appetite for spending, feeding more hard-earned taxpayer money into that corrupt process is not the solution.\n\nOur entire budgeting process should be overhauled, a zero-based budget starting with a clean slate. There are numerous programs which are simply routinely re-appropriated, without careful assessment of effectiveness or necessity. They often become silos of money for discretionary spending, and they are rife for corruption. Before anyone asks an Illinois taxpayer for a single penny more, there should be an absolutely full accounting of all of the money this state already raises through every tax and fee we already levy. We\u2019re in recovery mode. Consumers will be a huge part of that. Taking away more money isn\u2019t the way to encourage growth.\n\n10. Illinois continues to struggle financially, with a backlog of unpaid bills. In addition to a progressive state income tax \u2014 or in lieu of such a tax \u2014 what should the state do to pay its bills, meet its pension obligations and fund core services such as higher education?\n\nAs stated before, this state needs to re-examine every dollar we are spending now. Illinois should do what any entity should do when they are spending more than they take in: reform, and spend less.\n\nIllinois government needs to innovate with a view to 2030, not 1830. Advancements in technology should lead to lower expense, not greater, but there\u2019s never a solution proposed in this state that doesn\u2019t include a tax hike. That\u2019s the first and only solution ever considered.\n\nThere also needs to be a very serious and fair discussion with relation to pension funds. These have become an eternal issue with no solvent funding solution in place. I lose sleep over the fact that these funds won\u2019t be there for people who have been made promises that are fiscally impossible to keep. I believe that before we can solve this problem, we have to stop the bleeding first. There are some measures with the tier system that have helped a little bit, but are still inadequate. For everyone\u2019s sake, including pensioners who deserve security and certainty, a fair, equitable set of agreements to tackle this dire issue over a reasonable period of time is the only realistic solution.\n\nAs for \u201ccore services\u201d, we need to narrowly define them and fund them properly. This area of funding suffers more than any other as they don\u2019t enjoy the auto-reappropriation so many other elements of the state budget do. The whole budget needs to be re-imagined and re-examined starting with a fresh balance sheet.\n\n11. Should Illinois consider taxing the retirement incomes of its very wealthiest residents, as most states do? And your argument is?\n\nThere aren\u2019t many incentives to remaining an Illinoisan. The policy of not taxing retirement income is among the few incentives any resident of Illinois has to stay here. If we were to selectively consider taxing retirement income, who would decide who is wealthy? Who would decide the rates? Who would decide when those rates should change, because Illinois still continues to spend more than it takes in? We know who. The same General Assembly that put us in the fiscal morass we\u2019re stuck in. Who would trust them to make those decisions? To make my answer clear: No, Illinois should not consider this.\n\n12. What can Illinois do to improve its elementary and high schools?\n\nIllinois schools spend double the national average on administration\u2014we have to move that money back to the classroom. And the state imposes numerous unfunded mandates that hike costs for local school districts.\n\nI put forward a bill to cap administrative spending at the national average, which would free up hundreds of millions of dollars for classroom needs and property tax relief. Whether this efficiency is achieved by consolidating districts or sharing administrative costs, this is a huge sum of money being wasted in our state.\n\nWhen I review our standards, I believe they\u2019re high enough, but we\u2019re not meeting them. There needs to be more accountability for doing so. We are in a financial crisis in this state that affects everyone, including school districts. It very much affects the families sending these students to schools. The funding of schools has experienced years of band-aid approaches, special legislation and a completely non-comprehensive approach.\n\nAt present, we\u2019re not even sure if schools are going to open this school year or how. I\u2019m a public high school graduate. I was fortunate to get an outstanding education and go on to very strong universities with that foundation. I don\u2019t believe that is the case for many of our students today.\n\nThe only way to truly improve schools is by actively reforming our education policy, cognizant of the needs of the various regions of the state, and with the full participation of all of the stakeholders in the process. That simply hasn\u2019t been done. There are too many golden calves, resulting in winners and losers with every partial-reform effort enacted. Too often the losers were a set of students in one part or the state or the other, or worse, everywhere. Educators are smart people by nature and experience. This is a solvable problem.\n\n13. Mass shootings and gun violence plague America. What can or should the Legislature do, if anything, to address this problem in Illinois?\n\nWe\u2019ve had selected success and failure with this issue in Illinois. It\u2019s both heart-breaking and frustrating to see our state on the national news every night reporting the most recent tally of shootings and killings in Chicago. The city has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, and despite that, there are no shortage of guns or tragic carnage there. The General Assembly has also already tightened gun regulations to be some of the toughest in the country.\n\nThe other side of the equation is policing and prosecuting those misusing firearms. For instance, I have worked closely with our DuPage State\u2019s Attorney, Bob Berlin, on a variety of legislative measures, including enhancing penalties for those who commit crimes and then jump bail. Historically, DuPage has seen as much as 50% of felonies committed by individuals from outside the county, so laws like this one would give our prosecutors the tools they need to discourage crime locally.\n\n14. Do you favor or oppose term limits for any elected official in Illinois? Please explain.\n\nI am in favor of term limits. Legislators do need enough time to become effective and not let the permanent establishment of staff operate the government. In the State of Illinois, with the way legislative maps are gerrymandered, elections do not serve the function as term limits as it was intended. I believe strongly in a Citizen Legislature for a carefully prescribed period of service.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason a statewide official should serve more than 2 terms (8 years). And 8-10 years for Legislators in the State Senate or General Assembly is plenty. Controlled, centralized power for too long of a period is a recipe for corruption: we are watching this play out on our television screens as more and more long-serving members of the Illinois General Assembly are charged with various federal crimes.\n\n15. Everybody says gerrymandering is bad, but the party in power in every state \u2014 Democrats in Illinois \u2014 resist doing anything about it. Or do we have that wrong? What should be done?\n\nYou have it right. It is bad. Fortunately, more and more, the people of Illinois view gerrymandering to be unconstitutional and wrong. I drafted and championed a Fair Maps Amendment, presented as a citizen initiative, because of the block put on Fair Maps by the Democratic Party of Illinois. (We had over 10,000 signatures gathered, before being abruptly halted by the coronavirus.)\n\nEvery few years, you see cynical attempts by electorally vulnerable Democrats to file fair maps amendments, knowing full well these efforts will never see the light of day. We saw it in 2016 when then-Rep. Jack Franks was allowed to bring his amendment to the House Floor (where it garnered 105 votes), with the understanding that the Senate would not take it up. And we saw Ms. Costa Howard do the same thing this year, filing another dead-on-arrival amendment just two months before the deadline.\n\nWhat should be done? The media, private industry, and good-government groups should coalesce behind a citizen initiative that meets the requirements of the Illinois Constitution. My Fair Maps Amendment is one legally rock-solid way to meet those stringent requirements. Any system would be better than the current one.\n\n16. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Chicago is investigating possible official corruption by state and local officials. This prompted the Legislature to pass an ethics reform measure to amend the Lobbyist Registration Act (SB 1639). It was signed into law in December. What\u2019s your take on this and what more should be done?\n\nAs I noted previously, we need an all-of-the-above approach to ethics reform, starting with term limits. There are plenty of ideas out there, and if we need more, we can look to the many other states that are known for clean government, like Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\n17. When people use the internet and wireless devices, companies collect data about us. Oftentimes, the information is sold to other companies, which can use it to track our movements or invade our privacy in other ways. When companies share this data, we also face a greater risk of identity theft. What should the Legislature do, if anything?\n\nIllinois currently has some of the toughest laws in the country around information privacy. Even so, we can always be open to addressing the privacy challenges presented by tech advancements. For instance, the issues relating to Tik Tok and its undisclosed scraping of user data may present areas for us to legislate in Illinois, if the federal government does not act.\n\nThe General Assembly is severely lacking in the experience necessary to meet the challenges presented by emerging technology: I bring unique training and experience in computer science and telecommunications to bear on these issues. Voices like mine are missing from the General Assembly.\n\n18. The number of Illinois public high school graduates who enroll in out-of-state universities continues to climb. What can Illinois do to make its state universities more attractive to Illinois high school students?\n\nEvery Illinoisan deserves the opportunity to attend college or a trade school, and to graduate without debt. A big reason people leave Illinois for out of state institutions is the cost of education here. We are not as competitive as other state university systems. In my district, many students choose universities in Indiana, Iowa, or Missouri, instead of staying here. With few financial incentives available, U of I is also difficult for many of our best students to attend. Other states have aggressively recruited in Illinois and provided financing, to cherry pick our best students.\n\nParents also have a role in how students make these choices. They want what\u2019s best for their children, and because of the problems afflicting Illinois, many parents urge their kids to go elsewhere. Illinois needs to live up to the standard that \u201canything is possible\u201d to pursue and prosper here. This is another area where our state\u2019s horrible fiscal condition is negatively affecting us. All this adds up to students choosing less expensive, top-flight schools in other states, with better fiscal management and opportunity.\n\n19. What is your top legislative priority with respect to the environment?\n\nI\u2019m a husband and father of 2 little boys. Clean air and clean water are our most important environmental considerations. I am proud to have been one of the few Republicans regularly rated 100% by the Illinois Environmental Council.\n\nAs well, being the only person with an Electrical Engineering background in the General Assembly, I repeatedly worked with environmental groups to responsibly move Illinois to low- and zero-emissions energy. Illinois is recognized as a national leader in the field today, due to our efforts on that front.\n\n20. What historical figure from Illinois, other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybody\u2019s big on Abe), do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain.\n\nI\u2019d choose the \u201cGreat Communicator,\u201d Ronald Reagan, since I can\u2019t pick Abraham Lincoln. Growing up, we knew President Reagan as a calm, upbeat presence for our country. He fought hard for his principles, but he united folks across partisan lines and was focused on getting things done. We could use more leaders like him today.\n\n21. What\u2019s your favorite TV, streaming or web-based show of all time. Why?\n\nAll-time would probably be Doctor Who. Some seasons are better than others, but the fact that the whole main cast changes every few years keeps up the variety of the show. You get something to latch onto with each crew. The show is wickedly funny and creative, and often bends your brain.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-the-Great", "page_content": "Peter suffered from bladder and urinary-tract problems, and in January 1725 [Old Style] he began having trouble urinating. Doctors removed a litre of \u201cputrid\u201d urine, and a fever ensued. Days later Peter died, at age 52. An autopsy reportedly found that gangrene had developed around his bladder.\n\nIn 1689 Peter wed Eudoxia , but the marriage ended in 1698. He later became involved with the future Catherine I , a Baltic woman who had been taken prisoner during the Second Northern War . They married in 1712, and in 1724 she was crowned empress-consort. After Peter died in 1725, she became empress.\n\nPeter\u2019s father, Tsar Alexis , died when Peter was four years old. At age 10 Peter became joint tsar with his half brother and, because of power struggles, often feared for his safety. He did not receive the usual education of a tsar. He grew up in a free atmosphere and especially enjoyed military games.\n\nPeter the Great modernized Russia \u2014which, at the start of his rule, had greatly lagged behind the Western countries\u2014and transformed it into a major power. Through his numerous reforms, Russia made incredible progress in the development of its economy and trade, education, science and culture, and foreign policy.\n\nPeter was the son of Tsar Alexis by his second wife, Natalya Kirillovna Naryshkina . Unlike his half-brothers, sons of his father\u2019s first wife, Mariya Ilinichna Miloslavskaya , Peter proved a healthy child, lively and inquisitive . It is probably significant to his development that his mother\u2019s former guardian, Artamon Sergeyevich Matveyev , had raised her in an atmosphere open to progressive influences from the West.\n\nPeter I , Russian in full Pyotr Alekseyevich , byname Peter the Great , Russian Pyotr Veliky , (born June 9 [May 30, Old Style], 1672, Moscow, Russia\u2014died February 8 [January 28], 1725, St. Petersburg), tsar of Russia who reigned jointly with his half-brother Ivan V (1682\u201396) and alone thereafter (1696\u20131725) and who in 1721 was proclaimed emperor (imperator). He was one of his country\u2019s greatest statesmen, organizers, and reformers.\n\nYouth and accession\n\nWhen Alexis died in 1676, Peter was only four years old. His elder half-brother, a sickly youth, then succeeded to the throne as Fyodor III, but, in fact, power fell into the hands of the Miloslavskys, relatives of Fyodor\u2019s mother, who deliberately pushed Peter and the Naryshkin circle aside. When Fyodor died childless in 1682, a fierce struggle for power ensued between the Miloslavskys and the Naryshkins: the former wanted to put Fyodor\u2019s brother, the delicate and feebleminded Ivan V, on the throne; the Naryshkins stood for the healthy and intelligent Peter. Representatives of the various orders of society, assembled in the Kremlin, declared themselves for Peter, who was then proclaimed tsar, but the Miloslavsky faction exploited a revolt of the Moscow streltsy, or musketeers of the sovereign\u2019s bodyguard, who killed some of Peter\u2019s adherents, including Matveyev. Ivan and Peter were then proclaimed joint tsars, and eventually, because of Ivan\u2019s precarious health and Peter\u2019s youth, Ivan\u2019s 25-year-old sister Sophia was made regent. Clever and influential, Sophia took control of the government; excluded from public affairs, Peter lived with his mother in the village of Preobrazhenskoye, near Moscow, often fearing for his safety. All this left an ineradicable impression on the young tsar and determined his negative attitude toward the streltsy.\n\nOne result of Sophia\u2019s overt exclusion of Peter from the government was that he did not receive the usual education of a Russian tsar; he grew up in a free atmosphere instead of being confined within the narrow bounds of a palace. While his first tutor, the former church clerk Nikita Zotov, could give little to satisfy Peter\u2019s curiosity, the boy enjoyed noisy outdoor games and took especial interest in military matters, his favourite toys being arms of one sort or another. He also occupied himself with carpentry, joinery, blacksmith\u2019s work, and printing.\n\nBritannica Quiz Emperors and Empresses from Around the (Non-Roman) World Quiz\n\nNear Preobrazhenskoye there was a nemetskaya sloboda (\u201cGerman colony\u201d) where foreigners were allowed to reside. Acquaintance with its inhabitants aroused Peter\u2019s interest in the life of other nations, and an English sailboat, found derelict in a shed, whetted his passion for seafaring. Mathematics, fortification, and navigation were the sciences that appealed most strongly to Peter. A model fortress was built for his amusement, and he organized his first \u201cplay\u201d troops, from which, in 1687, the Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky Guards regiments were formed\u2014to become the nucleus of a new Russian Army.\n\nEarly in 1689 Natalya Naryshkina arranged Peter\u2019s marriage to the beautiful Eudoxia (Yevdokiya Fyodorovna Lopukhina). This was obviously a political act, intended to demonstrate the fact that the 17-year-old Peter was now a grown man, with a right to rule in his own name. The marriage did not last long: Peter soon began to ignore his wife, and in 1698 he relegated her to a convent.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Sophia and her faction tried to use it to their own advantage for another coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, but events this time turned decisively in Peter\u2019s favour. He removed Sophia from power and banished her to the Novodevichy convent; she was forced to become a nun after a streltsy rebellion in 1698. Though Ivan V remained nominally joint tsar with Peter, the administration was now largely given over to Peter\u2019s kinsmen, the Naryshkins, until Ivan\u2019s death in 1696. Peter, meanwhile continuing his military and nautical amusements, sailed the first seaworthy ships to be built in Russia. His games proved to be good training for the tasks ahead."}, {"url": "https://www.peoplepill.com/people/peter-breen-1/", "page_content": "Peter Breen is a former Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives who represented the 48th district from 2015 until 2019.
