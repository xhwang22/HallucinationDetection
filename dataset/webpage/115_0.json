As a celebrity in the public eye, a name is part of your image, a part of your brand. So it follows that coming to a decision on your brand name for the rest of your career is kind of like getting a tattoo. It\u2019s permanent, and if you want to change it, you have to erase it and start over. Here are 15 Korean celebrities with sometimes whimsical, sometimes strange, unique, or moving stories behind their stage names.\n\nUhm Hong Sik -> Yoo Ah In\n\nYoo Ah In\u2019s original name is Uhm Hong Sik. Asked why he uses a stage name, Yoo Ah In said his original name is a bit too country, and he chose his name Ah In based on the German word for one \u2013 eins.\n\nKim Bo Suk (jewel) -> Kim Ji Suk\n\nKim Ji Suk might seem like the actor\u2019s real name because it\u2019s so ordinary, but Kim Ji Suk\u2019s actual name is Kim Bo Suk, which means \u2018jewel.\u2019 It turns out, the actor\u2019s entire family has unusual names, given by their grandfather, based on the places that they were born: Kim Buk Kyung (Beijing), Kim Sin Sa (Sinsa-dong, also means \u2018gentleman\u2019), etc.\n\nBecause his mother thought Kim Ji Suk and his older brother Sin Sa might get made fun of, their names were changed to Kim Ban Suk (which incidentally means foundation) and Kim Bo Suk (jewel).\n\nKim Tae Ho -> Choi Jin Hyuk\n\nWhile Kim Tae Ho wasn\u2019t a bad name for an actor, the \u201cInfinity Challenge\u201d producer is also named Kim Tae Ho, and any internet search of the name brought up the producer\u2019s name first. So the actor switched to Choi Jin Hyuk. SEO is everything.\n\nKim Ji Eun -> Kang Ye Won\n\nKang Ye Won first acted under her real name, Kim Ji Eun. However, following a 2002 film in which she took on a role that required a lot of skin exposure, she decided to throw away the name and start over with the name Kang Ye Won. Her name carries the corresponding Chinese characters for strength, art, and core.\n\nIn Kyo Jin\n\nDo Yi Sung -> In Kyo Jin\n\nWhile In Kyo Jin acted under his stage name Do Yi Sung for 10 years after his 2000 debut, he was unable to make a hit, and with a changing of agencies, he changed his name as well, returning to his birth name.\n\nKim Yeon Woo\n\nIm Hak Chul -> Kim Yeon Woo\n\nAt the time of his debut, Kim Yeon Woo \u2013 who was revealed last week as Cleopatra on \u201cKing of Mask Singer\u201d \u2013 was trying to think of a stage name with musician Yoo Hee Yeol. There happened to be a cafe that they frequented called Yeon Woo, which has a somewhat sweet connotation, so they decided on that for his stage name, a perfect pair for his sweet voice.\n\nPark Hyun Bin\n\nPark Ji Woong -> Park Hyun Bin\n\nThe main singer at Park Hyun Bin\u2019s label was Jang Yoon Jung, so the agency asked her who the most popular actor was at the time. When she named Hyun Bin, the agency decided to give Park Ji Woong the name Park Hyun Bin, so he would become as popular a singer as Hyun Bin is an actor.\n\nJung Ji Hoon -> Rain\n\nWhen Rain was recording his debut track, it was raining a lot, so Park Jin Young gave Jung Ji Hoon the name \u2018Rain.\u2019\n\nLee Seung Hwan -> Seo Kang Joon\n\nSeo Kang Joon took the name of Ha Jung Woo\u2018s manager at the time.\n\nJung Yong Joon -> Jang Hyuk\n\nJang Hyuk also took the name of a very well-known manager.\n\nJun Hye Rim -> Ha Ji Won\n\nPrior to her debut, Ha Ji Won was trying to think of a stage name, and in the end, she went with a name her manager gave her. But it wasn\u2019t just any name! It was the name of the manager\u2019s first \u2013 and unrequited \u2013 love.\n\nHa Jung Woo\n\nKim Sung Hoon -> Ha Jung Woo\n\nHa Jung Woo was actually a stage name considered by actor Kim Sung Soo, who in the end decided not to take the name because a director thought it sounded like a \u201990s porn actor\u2019s name. Later, label mate Kim Sung Hoon (Ha Jung Woo) took up the name.\n\nMa Dong Suk\n\nLee Dong Suk -> Ma Dong Suk\n\nMa Dong Suk\u2019s nickname during his school years was \u2018devil\u2019 Dong Suk (ak-ma Dong Suk), because he\u2019d always playfully throw punches at his friends, an act that later gave birth to the name Ma Dong Suk. Nowadays, apparently even his mother calls him Ma Dong Suk.\n\nGong Ji Chul -> Gong Yoo\n\nGong Yoo said at the beginning of his career when receiving a \u2018new star\u2019 award, \u201cMy actual name is Gong Ji Chul, but I\u2019m acting under the name Gong Yoo, taking the surnames of both of my parents.\u201d He went on to say that he would become an actor that doesn\u2019t become a burden on his parents\u2019 names.\n\nJo Won Joon -> Jo Jin Woong\n\nJo Jin Woong also honors a parent with his stage name, which is simply the name of his father. Jo Jin Woong was originally active under his own name Jo Won Joon while a play actor, but ended up later taking his father\u2019s, in order to place upon himself a higher level of responsibility and give himself encouragement to work harder and do well by his father\u2019s name. Joking, Jo Jin Woong\u2019s father told him, \u201cYou\u2019re even going to borrow my name? Pay a fee if you want to use it.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/ha-jung-woo.html", "page_content": "About\n\nKnown for his role as serial killer Je Yeong-min in the 2008 South Korean thriller The Chaser, this popular actor also starred in such films as Love Fiction, The Terror Live, and My Dear Enemy.

The famous movie star was reported to have used Propofol for several years under the name of his younger brother, also an actor.\n\nAccording to \u201cNews A,\u201d the actor was introduced to the plastic surgery clinic through Chae Seung Juk, the former president of Aekyung Group. Prosecutors are questioning Chae Seung Juk as well as the employees of the clinic, which is said to be a hotspot for celebrities and businessmen. They are also looking into whether anyone else at the clinic acquired drugs under a false name.\n\nOn February 18, media outlets began reporting that the name of the person who had acquired Propofol at the plastic surgery clinic was \u201cKim Sung Hoon\u201d and that he had ordered the drugs under the name of \u201cKim Young Hoon.\u201d Kim Sung Hoon is actor Ha Jung Woo\u2019s real name, and Kim Young Hoon is the name of his younger brother.\n\nThese reports added that in addition to Chae Seung Juk, the third-generation heir of Doosan Group was also being investigated for illegal injection of drugs. This particular plastic surgery clinic came under suspicion from prosecutors when it appeared that many of its patients were using Propofol. Propofol is used as a sleep inducer and anesthetic and is classified as a psychoactive drug in South Korea, which makes it illegal to use for anything other than surgical procedures.\n\nOn the evening of February 18, Ha Jung Woo\u2019s agency, Walkhouse Company, released an official statement on the reports.\n\nThe statement reads:\n\nFor many years, Ha Jung Woo was concerned about a scar on his face. In January 2019, he was introduced to the director of a clinic that is famous for its laser scar treatment. That director was very eager to help Ha Jung Woo with his scar treatment. Ha Jung Wo received the strong laser treatment about ten times between January and September 2019. Every time the treatment took place, the clinic director judged that the patient should be put to sleep. There was absolutely no case of drug abuse. After seeing some results from the treatment, he stopped going to the clinic last fall. We will now explain the issue of \u2018receiving the treatment under his actor dongsaeng [younger brother, but can also refer to any younger acquaintance]\u2019s name.\u2019 From the very beginning, the clinic director advocated for privacy and told him to wear a mask and a hat when he came for treatment. In this context, the director asked Ha Jung Woo for the names and personal information of an entertainment agency representative dongsaeng and his manager. Ha Jung Woo assumed this was vaguely related to privacy protection, and because it was a doctor who was requesting it, he gave the information without much suspicion. He does not know what exactly the hospital did with the information, but he never intended to hide the fact that he was receiving treatment. Even though the hospital director requested it, he is deeply reflecting on the fact that he gave someone else\u2019s personal information in this situation. He also apologizes sincerely to his fans for the misunderstandings that this has caused. Fortunately, we have text messages from the past few months that confirm Ha Jung Woo\u2019s appointments at the clinic, as well as conversations between him and the hospital director about the treatment and any follow-up procedures. The text messages will clearly show that he only went to the hospital with the goal of treatment in mind. We ask that people refrain from releasing unconfirmed reports. The agency will eagerly comply with any requests from investigators. For public artists, it is not helpful to have their names put out by the media in connection with controversial issues. Since our artist did not have anything on his conscience, we hoped that it would naturally die down. However, since the rumors kept spreading, we have decided to put out a statement. We would like to apologize for causing concern to the fans and others who have always trusted and supported Ha Jung Woo. Thank you.\n\nSource (1) (2) (3)"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/ha-jung-woo", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nHa Jung-woo (Kim Sung-hoon) was born on 11 March, 1978 in Seoul, South Korea, is an Actor,film director,screenwriter,film producer.

Later on, he had his first debut in a sitcom, Honest Living, and first debut film, Madeline. He acted in a few drama series like H.I.T and Lovers in Prague. In 2005, his acting career began to shine through featuring himself in Yoon Jong Bin\u2019s The Unforgiven and Kim Ki Duk\u2019s Time. Since his major acting role in Na Hong Jin\u2019s The Chaser, he has been acting in many action and thriller films like The Yellow Sea, Nameless Gangster, The Berlin File, and The Terror Live. He also acted in romantic comedy films like Love Fiction. He also hold the role as the director as he had his first directional debut film, Fasten Your Seatbelt, in 2013.\n\nOn 18 December 2013, Ha Jung Woo attended the film screening of The Terror Live at the BAFTA, London. You can check out the review on The Terror Live through here. A group of press, including myself, participated in the group interview to ask the actor himself some interesting questions. The group interview transcript, transcribed by Hangul Celluloid, can be found through here. Thank you, Hangul Celluloid for taking the time to transcribe an hour interview with Ha Jung Woo.\n\nInterview with Ha Jung Woo\n\nAs he enters into the room, he has the charismatic personality that made my eyes wide open with admiration. In the group interview, most of us asked him about both acting and directing career including a few key examples of film including The Terror Live and his upcoming second directed film, Chronicle of a Blood Merchant. Most of the answers which he gave were straightforward and in-depth understanding about his career and plans as both actor and director. Throughout the interview, it was both laughter and serious aura in listening and learning about his growing career.\n\nWe asked him about the numerous roles he played in noticeable films in terms of how he selected the roles, how he works together with directors, and what experiences were when portraying the characters in films. With a few key examples of films like The Berlin File, The Chaser, Behind The Camera, and My Dear Enemy, Ha Jung Woo is always have a full of curiosity of the character that he\u2019s going to play in these films. He wanted to learn more about these characters by asking the directors a lot of questions. Wanting to know something is definitely way to learn and grow his acting career. At the same time, he took the initiative to put into the characters\u2019 shoes and bring them to life with senses of realization. Ha Jung Woo also learn a lot from the directors he had worked together with. He understood the directors\u2019 filmmaking style and perspectives while he was given the opportunities to build up his own characters.\n\nCharismatic Ha Jung Woo talks about his experiences as actor-director\n\nWith that in mind, this lead him to be the director with his debut directed film, Fasten Your Seatbelt. The reason why he decided to do directing is because that he always wanted to be an actor-director. It was definitely the right time for him to take on the role as the director. To him, the challenge that he faced while directing Fasten Your Seatbelt, from his experiences as an actor, it affected his expectations with the actors. Yet, with experiences and conversations with the directors he had worked with, he stated that communication is vital on set and off set. I do agree with that communication is needed in sharing and collecting great ideas in making films amazing. It is also important to support each other and giving others the opportunities to express their thoughts.\n\nAs for the upcoming films, Kundo and Chronicle of A Blood Merchant, he shared his interesting experiences that is interesting and funny. He had a hard time acting in Kundo because of the hot weather and he has to wear layers of clothing. It was a very hot and tiring experience that he will never forget. For Chronicle of A Blood Merchant, at first he was given to act in this film but, later, thanks to the word-of-mouth about his directing skills in Fasten Your Seatbelt, he has the golden opportunity to direct again. In the future, he wants to play Hamlet on stage since he has studied theater before. Hopefully, when his schedule is not really packed, he will play not only in films and drams but also on stage. Based on the films that he had acted and directed, it is definitely a step-by-step memorable experience for him in slowly polishing and shining his capabilities.\n\nQ&A Session with Ha Jung Woo after the film screening of The Terror Live\n\nLater, after the film screening of The Terror Live, the Q&A session with Ha Jung Woo began by asking him about being involved in this film. In order not to bore the audiences, he tried his very best not to make repetitive moves within the setting that has multiple cameras around him. For 3 months, he also prepared in acting the role as a newcaster before going on the filming set by watching news, reported by Sun Seok Ki, repetitively to learn the gestures and traits. In terms of cinematography, he explained in detailed about how the shots were taken as he stated that the film comprises of 21 chapters. Each chapter has different shots and these are combined together in order to make the film more lively while not making the scenes too boring.\n\nThe audiences also took part in asking him about his characters in not only The Terror Live but also other films like The Berlin File. Although most of the audiences asked him about The Terror Live, some questions were interesting such as the meaning behind the ending scene of the film. In his opinion, Ha Jung Woo also further stated that, based on the question which is asked by the audience, The Terror Live has nothing to do with political aspects in Korean society. This film is fictional film. He was calm and steady in answering the questions without any hesitations.\n\nThe night ended well for this year\u2019s Year of the 4 Actors with a great film and a great actor who share his passion about his ambitions as both actor and director. He has the charismatic personality and charming looks but he also does have the sense of seriousness in learning every single bit within his own surroundings. He has plenty of plans which are part of his learning process in building up his ambitions with great determination and commitment. By exposing himself to learn more, his career as actor-director will continue to grow.

He put his acting experience to good use during this time, appearing in 10 promotional films for the military. Kim Sung-hoon made his acting debut in the 2002 SBS sitcom Honest Living and his feature film debut in the 2003 film Madeleine. For the next few years, Kim's acting career was relatively low-key, appearing in several supporting roles, but not receiving a lot of attention. In 2005, Kim signed with talent agency SidusHQ and on their recommendation adopted the stage name \"Ha Jung-woo.\" He then appeared in his first starring role in the indie film The Unforgiven, a blistering critique of the physical and psychological violence within military ranks. Ha Jung-woo is also an Artist. Though it began as a hobby in his university days, Ha began painting in earnest in 2007. His paintings, all done in a Hybrid of Pop art and Expressionist styles, have been displayed in several solo art exhibitions. Critics have said his paintings, with their strong colors and interesting composition are reminiscent of those by American Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. \"Life as an actor is like living through an invisible war. Paintings soothe me and make me rational. It is too extravagant to say that painting is my hobby; it is rather a way for me to survive as an actor,\" said Ha. Ha's breakout came in the 2008 film The Chaser, in which he played a psychopath character loosely based on serial killer Yoo Young-chul. The movie became a huge hit at the Korean box office, raking in over 5 million ticket sales, while also garnering high praise from critics and numerous awards from local award-giving bodies. American Director Martin Scorsese, rumored to be attached to a Hollywood remake of The Chaser, has complimented Ha as having as much potential as his The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Ha followed this up with a portrayal of a charming scoundrel in My Dear Enemy that same year, showcased his versatility and elevated his status as one of the most sought-after actors in the Korean film industry. From 2008-2009, he took on diverse but compelling roles in The Moonlight of Seoul, Boat, and Take Off. Take Off, based on the Korean national ski jumping team, became one of the biggest box office hits of 2009. Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time was Ha's third collaboration with longtime friend Director Yoon Jong-bin, also starring acclaimed veteran actor Choi Min-sik. This was followed shortly by the unconventional romantic comedy Love Fiction opposite Gong Hyo-jin. Both were box office hits.

Their journey was chronicled in the documentary 577 Project, denoting the total distance covered in kilometers. Ha was in charge of three aspects of the production including planning, acting and casting. He said he did it to thank fans for their support after he won back-to-back Best Actor awards at the 2010 and 2011 Baeksang Arts Awards.

He made his directorial debut in 2013 with comedy flick \"Fasten Your Seatbelt\" and has produced numerous films including \"A Single Rider\" (2016).\n\n\n\nThis time, the actor took on the roles of a hero against impending catastrophe and a co-producer for the disaster action film \"Ashfall,\" which premiered last Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe film is set in a fictional disaster where volcanic Mount Paektu, located on the North Korea-China border, is about to erupt.\n\n\n\nNoting that disaster film scripts usually catch his eye, the actor expressed that he was drawn to this film in particular because the story was about an existing active volcanic.\n\n\n\n\"The topic of the disaster itself was plausible since it has been brought up in Korea previously. And to put it in a film with cinematic imagination sounded very interesting,\" Ha said during the interview with The Korea Times, Friday, at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, Seoul.\n\n\n\n\"Especially, Mount Paektu is not a place where you can visit easily, so I felt there would be more stories to it and felt more drawn.\"\n\n\n\nThe story revolves around explosive disposal specialist Cho In-chang (Ha) on a mission to stop the imminent explosion with the help of North Korean double agent Rhee Jun-pyung (Lee Byung-hun) who has been imprisoned in North Korea.\n\n\n\nHa said he wanted badly for Lee to take the role from the start. He sent the script to Lee, who was shooting the hit drama \"Mr. Sunshine\" at the time, and made a personal call to make sure he read it.\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to work with him, in anything honestly,\" the actor said. \"So, I was looking for ways to work together. Then, I found out about the Ashfall project and contacted him first.\"\n\n\n\nAdding that Lee was the right person to share the burden of leading a film, Ha expressed the chemistry between the two worked out very well, especially with Lee's passionate energy in acting.\n\n\n\n\n\nA scene from the film showing agent Cho In-chang (Ha) with North Korean double agent Rhee Jun-pyung (Lee Byung-hun).
