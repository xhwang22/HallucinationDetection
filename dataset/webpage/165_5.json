For the best part of an hour we were all contributing to a mountain of hype for a molehill of reward. It was moderate rugby league fare in Adelaide, a match full of errors, indiscipline and injuries. And then out of nowhere the greatest sporting contest in the country delivered, as it always seems to. The final quarter played host to tries and lead changes to both teams, a yellow card, and a prop out-marking a fullback under a high ball. It was classic Origin. And being classic Origin, the Maroons somehow prevailed with their backs to the wall. Queensland is not a state, it\u2019s a state of mind. There were heroes everywhere you looked in Maroon, from player of the match Cotter, to the unflappable youngsters Walsh, Cobbo, and Tabuai-Fidow. Billy Slater is a man with a plan. Recriminations could get ugly for the Blues. They stole defeat from the jaws of victory last series, and now they\u2019re one-down with a trip to Brisbane to come. For all the star names in blue jerseys there was a lack of cohesion, penetration, and imagination. Latrell Mitchell\u2019s likely return will help with much of that, but the circumstances could also prompt Brad Fittler to be more decisive. Pressure from the media in the next few days could demand it of him. But that is for another day. Tonight it is all about the marvellous Maroons and their refusal to accept defeat. Thanks for joining me tonight. I\u2019ll see you back here in a couple of weeks for game two.

He\u2019s studiously avoiding chewing his tongue off and murmuring bullshit.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 13.27 BST Phil Gould has just nailed it on the telly, speaking for about a minute, uninterrupted, breaking down the result. Queensland just played the perfect brand of Origin football. Hard-working forwards. Confident and creative halves. And speed. I\u2019ve been saying for two years that the young fullback is a superstar in the making and he certainly covered himself with glory tonight. It was that simple. Queensland defended better when they had to. They attacked better when they had to \u2026 In the end, New South Wales got three tries, two of them pretty scrappy efforts. They looked clunky, they didn\u2019t look confident with the ball at all. Queensland just wore them down with Origin football and mentality. It was a wonderful Queensland performance.\n\nUpdated at 13.31 BST\n\n31 May 2023 13.21 BST Reece Walsh has just given a flawless interview to Darren Lockyer after his superb Origin debut, all while holding his two-year-old daughter in his arms.

It was so good to get the win and how we stuck in there and fought hard in the second half especially. A man down, and just stuck in the fight. We spoke about staying in the fight and keep turning up for each other. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been speaking about all week at training and we did it in the end.\u201d Asked about the highlight, Cotter was decisive: \u201cIt would have to be big Lindsay Collins getting up over Tedesco stop sealing the game, how good!\u201d COLLINS GOES \ud83c\udd99#Origin pic.twitter.com/48JV0tKU8e \u2014 NRL (@NRL) May 31, 2023\n\nUpdated at 13.17 BST\n\n31 May 2023 13.13 BST Reuben Cotter \u2013 Player of the Match For his all-action performance, including a game-high 48 tackles, Queensland forward Reuben Cotter is named player of the match.

They dominated possession and territory. They played against 12 near the end, and at a time when their opponents were already scrambling with injuries and HIAs. Their inability to turn ascendancy into opportunities will generate plenty of debate this week.

We had a lot of training he put people in different positions. You never know with head knocks and everyone going down in different injuries, everyone was ready to go different positions and we scrambled well.

Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP\n\nUpdated at 13.16 BST\n\n31 May 2023 13.05 BST Maroon too good. Far better attacking game. Had less ball, (and even less players for ten minutes), yet created more tries. Guile and speed. Deserved winners. NSW had more than enough possession, but looked clunky and slow all night.

Outplayed for most of the night, starved of the ball, denied options on the bench, and then down to 12 men for the final ten minutes, they repeatedly came up with the big plays when it mattered. State of Origin is utterly compelling. Always. Blues players look dejected after conceding a try.

Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 13.19 BST\n\n31 May 2023 13.03 BST 80 mins: They can\u2019t. Crichton passes the ball out of play on the left wing and Queensland begin to celebrate.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 13.02 BST 79 mins: Queensland\u2019s forwards put in another shift of a set before DCE accepts contact near the line on the last. NSW have 100 metres and 90 seconds to salvage something. More than 48,000 people filled the stands at Adelaide Oval for Game 1. Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 13.13 BST\n\n31 May 2023 13.01 BST 78 mins: Another failed short kick-off, this time for offside, and Queensland are nearly home. Quite how, I don\u2019t know. This result will be a hammer blow for NSW.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 13.00 BST TRY! Queensland 26-18 NSW (Munster, 77) Ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous. Queensland\u2019s forwards go to work and drill their way down the field. Cherry-Evans kicks on the last, hoisting the ball high \u2013 and PROP Lindsay Collins wins the aerial duel with James Tedesco \u2013 lands, offloads to the supporting Cameron Munster and the Maroons cannot believe what\u2019s happening. Holmes misses the extras, but nobody really cares any more. This is absurd.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.57 BST 75 mins: The short kick-off is knocked forward. Queensland ball. Five minutes to go. Three of those with 12 men.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.56 BST TRY! Queensland 22-18 NSW (Tabuai-Fidow, 74) I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it. Queensland, with 12 men, and square pegs in round holes all over the place are back in front. For four tackles nothing much looks on, then Cameron Munster drifts from the middle to the left like a surfer on a wave, waiting for his moment to fire the pass wide to Tabuai-Fidow. He executes perfectly to isolate his man one-one-one. The step wrongfoots Addo-Carr, then the afterburners are turned on and the 21-year-old glides at breathtaking speed across the turf and under the posts. Holmes adds the conversion with ease.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.53 BST 72 mins: Hang-on\u2026 Queensland recover the short drop-out and scamper to halfway in no time. The ball spins right to Walsh who is flown into by Crichton at serious speed. Blimey, that was a collision. But there\u2019s a whistle Queensland\u2019s way. The Maroons get a full set in attacking territory. What can they do with it? All the ball players are busy probing but there\u2019s no space to exploit until they shift the ball left where Taulagi has a sniff of a break until the Blues get bodies across. Trbojevic is done for the night with his concussion, and now Taulagi is ordered off for a test. Queensland\u2019s bench is empty. Ben Hunt is playing centre.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.50 BST 70 mins: NSW are rampant now. They turn on the afterburners for a set then hunt Walsh with intensity to force a kick-chase drop out. This is not looking good for the 12-man Maroons.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.49 BST Yellow Card! (Flegler, 69) 69 mins: Trbojevic takes the kick return and runs straight into Flegler\u2019s shoulder! Ouch. The Queenslander is placed on report and sent to the bin! That is devastating for the Maroons. The Manly flyer departs for an HIA. And Nicho Hynes makes his Origin debut.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.45 BST TRY! Queensland 16-18 NSW (Crichton 68) Back come the Blues off the back of a scrum fed by To\u2019o! Koroisau, Haas, again the battering approach comes up short. This time they go right but Addo-Carr can\u2019t find room. Again they have to rely on Cleary\u2019s boot \u2013 and this time it works! The bomb close to the line draws a pack, spills out NSW\u2019s way and in no time it\u2019s in Crichton\u2019s hands from Luai to dive over in the left corner. Cleary kicks his side in the lead with a clutch conversion. Stephen Crichton celebrates scoring a try. Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images Stephen Crichton of the Blues runs the ball during game one. Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 13.03 BST\n\n31 May 2023 12.42 BST 65 mins: 30m out becomes a set restart 20m out. The Blues are building. Haas looks strong, so does Martin, and after pounding the middle NSW cut left, where there\u2019s an overlap \u2013 can they find it? No! And Cobbo is inches away from an intercept try but he knocks on!\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.40 BST 64 mins: Queensland will be happy with a series of sets exchanged in midfield either side of halfway\u2026 until DCE takes his eye off a routine pass and knocks on. This is such an uncharacteristic night of Origin footy. Can NSW capitalise?\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.39 BST 62 mins: Another NSW set ends with Cobbo calmly dealing with a Cleary bomb. The Blues need a plan B. So many sets have ended tamely tonight despite NSW\u2019s ascendancy. Perhaps an occasion for Nicho Hynes? NSW Blues Nicho Hynes before Game 1. Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP\n\nUpdated at 12.41 BST\n\n31 May 2023 12.37 BST 60 mins: Solid restart set from Queensland, pinning NSW deep in their own half. Massive 20 minutes coming up.\n\n\n\n31 May 2023 12.36 BST TRY! Queensland 16-12 NSW (Cobbo, 58) One half-chance is all Queensland require! Rope-a-dope stuff from the Maroons. Cotter starts it all with his steal in midfield, then the experienced halves get to work, absorbing tackles then spreading the ball to the right to Walsh who accepts contact and simultaneously throws a majestic cutout pass to Cobbo, who still has two men to beat. He turns on the afterburners, steps on the outside, skips past Luai and To\u2019o and slides over in the corner, kicking up his heels to avoid the sideline. Unbelievable try. So, so, so against the run of play. How do they do it? Of course Holmes slots over a massive touchline conversion. Over to you Blues. Selwyn Cobbo of the Maroons scores his second try.

Photo / Getty\n\nState of Origin I - New South Wales v Queensland, Adelaide Oval, Wednesday, 10.05pm\n\nWhat\u2019s on?\n\nIt\u2019s State vs State! The great rivalry between New South Wales and Queensland continues with game one taking place on Wednesday night in Adelaide. Yes Adelaide! The rugby league hotbed that brought us two glorious seasons of the Adelaide Rams including that amazing three-game winning streak they had in 1998. An odd choice to kick off the series.\n\nHow can I watch?\n\nCoverage starts on Sky Sport 4 at 9pm, with kickoff scheduled for 10.10pm. Live streaming is available on Sky Sport Now. Bear in mind that Origin matches have a rich and vibrant history of starting way past their planned kickoff time as the players take a few extra moments to shout at the walls in the changing room and slam a fist into the palm of the other hand.\n\nThe Alternative Commentary Collective\u2019s Mad Monday crew of Dai Henwood, Ben Hurley, Chris Key and Manaia Stewart will have full commentary on Sky Sport 6.\n\nWill there be biff?\n\nAhh for the days of Wally Lewis and Mark Geyer standing toe-to-toe in the rain. It\u2019s unlikely in the modern game. It rarely escalates beyond a scuffle, a fray if you\u2019re lucky. But expect replays of vintage biff to pad out the unscheduled 20 minutes of broadcast time pre-kickoff while the players are wall-shouting.\n\nSo, no present-day biff?\n\nSorry.\n\nBig selection calls?\n\nThere are a few new faces. Warriors fans will of course be aware of the new Queensland number one Reece Walsh playing his first Origin game after making the squad last year. He is the side\u2019s only debutant. New South Wales will start two newcomers in Bulldogs prop Tevita Pangai Junior and Hudson Young, the Raiders second rower. They also have two on the interchange - Nicho Hynes and Stefano Utoikamanu.\n\nNSW centre Latrell Mitchell was been ruled out the opener with a calf injury after sustaining the injury at training. Mitchell will be replaced by 18th man Stephen Crichton, while Matt Burton will join the squad as the new 18th Man.\n\nThe Blues (but not that blue)\n\nNew South Wales will wear a darker strip in game one, which they\u2019ve done twice before. But for some reason this time it\u2019s caused \u2018outrage\u2019 according to Aussie media outlet news.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageously stupid. No one likes it,\u201d a furious Phil Rothfield, not a noted fashion expert, said on NRL 360. According to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s David Riccio, jersey sales have reached almost $2 million for the NSWRL. So it can\u2019t to that bad.\n\nTevita Pangai Junior, Nicholas Hynes and Hudson Young of the Blues...Dark Blues. Photo / Getty\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nFour different winners in four years. Will it be five? Queensland got their hands back on the shield last year after winning game three. The good news is there hasn\u2019t been a sweep since 2010.\n\nQueensland have 23 series titles to NSW\u2019s 16 (with two series drawn). The Maroons have bagged 67 matches to the Blues 57.\n\nHow can I sound like I know what I\u2019m talking about?\n\nThe bookies are backing the Blues as the slight favourites. But yet again whichever of the two playmakers, Nathan Cleary and Daly Cherry-Evans, is more on point with their kicking game might carry the day.\n\nWho should I cheer for?\n\nOrigin claimed a spot in Kiwi hearts with some ding-dong battles in the halcyon days of the 1980s. Queensland felt like underdogs, while New South Wales had bigger names but seemed a bit flash.\n\nIt was a spell that peaked in 1991 when legendary Kiwi coach Graham Lowe became the first non-Australian to coach an Origin side, guiding the Maroons to a 2-1 victory.\n\nIn truth it doesn\u2019t really matter who New Zealanders cheer for in Origin.

That is, in Queensland.\n\nIn game one, when the Tom Trbojevic-led Blues reigned 50-6, it was not only the fact that the 44-point hammering happened, but that it happened in Townsville.\n\nIn game two, when Brad Fittler\u2019s side won 26-0 and kept the Maroons scoreless for just the third time in Origin history, it was all the more memorable because it was the first time Queensland have been beaten to nil at their home ground of Suncorp Stadium.\n\nAnd in game three, if NSW secure their first 3-0 series win since 2000 on Wednesday night and break the record for most points scored in a series, the bright lights of full-time delight will actually be blinding because they shone on the Gold Coast.\n\nIf the logistical challenges of Covid-19 have delivered a silver lining for NSW, it is this: no team has ever lost all three Origin games on home soil. It is unsurprising this is the case given an entire series is rarely played in one state. And the opportunity would never have arisen had 2021 proceeded as planned, with the games scheduled to be played at the MCG, Suncorp Stadium and ANZ Stadium respectively.\n\nEven as recently as three days ago, Newcastle\u2019s McDonald Jones Stadium was all set to host the dead rubber. But the pandemic had its way and now the chance beckons. \u201cIt would be a big part of history I think if we\u2019re able to do that,\u201d Fittler said on Tuesday. \u201cThinking about that, it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d He qualified it, of course, with: \u201cUntil they do that, you just win another series, that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nStill, the records beckoning are copious enough to list. Australian Associated Press has conveniently compiled them: a further 29 or more NSW points will break the record for most scored by a team in an Origin series; one more Trbojevic try will see him equal Ryan Girdler\u2019s Origin series record of five set in 2000; Queensland have scored just six points across two games and need another 10 points to beat their lowest series total set in 1992; NSW\u2019s current 70-point differential is already superior to the 62-point record margin the Blues set in 2000, meaning even an eight-point loss would leave them sharing that feat; a 48-point NSW win would see them equal Queensland\u2019s 118-point differential, amassed over their eight straight series wins, in just one series.\n\nIt does not make pretty reading for Paul Green, who was handed the unenviable task of emulating predecessor Wayne Bennett\u2019s stirring underdogs-to-victors performance in 2020 and whose position as Maroons coach is under intense scrutiny to the point that captain Daly Cherry-Evans admitted the result could impact both their jobs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not winning games of footy the coach and playing group, in particular the leaders, come under the most scrutiny,\u201d Cherry-Evans said. \u201cIf we get a win tomorrow night it\u2019s going to help Greeny retain his job \u2013 and players like myself \u2013 but I\u2019m really confident in where we are and what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cGreeny\u2019s doing the best job he can and unfortunately the results haven\u2019t reflected the hard work he\u2019s put in, but it comes with the territory when you\u2019re down 2-0 in the series. I might be a little crazy, but I think I\u2019m going to win every game I play and tomorrow night\u2019s no different.\u201d\n\nAnything can happen, but there is something about this iteration of NSW. It has shades of the Queensland side that dominated for eight years from 2006-2013. Different names, obviously, but a team full of stars that can be a star team. Talk of a Blues dynasty may yet be premature, but change-room culture gets a big wrap for a reason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty special, some of the best players in the game at the top of their game coming into a team together and have all bonded well,\u201d James Tedesco said after game two.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no egos, which is a huge thing. Everyone is just happy to do their role and take a lot of confidence from club footy. It\u2019s cool to be a part of, everyone is working for each other. That\u2019s what we talked about all week and in both camps, having that bond to the guy next to you, it shows on the field \u2026 it\u2019s awesome to be a part of.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/rugby-league/nrl/state-of-origin/results/", "page_content": "The 2023 State of Origin kicked off on May 31 in Adelaide.\n\nThe Maroons have a 1-0 series lead after stirring come-from-behind 26-18 win, scoring two tries in the final 10 minutes while down to 12 men.

But the Blues coach held his nerve all week and now has his mojo back as NSW dominated their old foes to level the State of Origin series with a thumping 44-12 Game 2 victory.\n\nIn Sydney Billy Slater pulled a card from the Cameron Smith playbook and slowed the ruck. The Blue cogs got sticky, sending Cleary off his kicking game. Without their talisman \u2013 and a Plan B by Fittler \u2013 it all unravelled. Fittler swung the axe, picked a running side with a majority-Penrith spine and put starch back in the defensive line.\n\nOrigin is NRL football in overdrive. Both teams were rushing in, Queensland smelling blood, NSW desperate to save the series. Both teams went close to scoring early but were foiled late. Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo charged down a Cameron Munster kick and regathered but the ball beat them over the sideline. A Munster kick to Selwyn Cobbo was diffused on the goal line minutes later.\n\nTwo Queensland strips in two tackles gifted NSW the opening two points. By inches or miles, NSW were determined to win this battle, if for no other reason than they needed to. But the soft points backfired. With breath back in their lungs, Ben Hunt stabbed a pass to Harry Grant who found Kalyn Ponga. The rubberman fullback skipped a beat, bent into the defence and spat the pip into the arms of Felise Kaufusi who jinked in-out and harbour bridged an arm over the stripe.\n\nThere was renewed starch in the Blue wall. Recalled renaissance hitman Jake Trbojevic made an immediate impact, mixing brutality with class, as he upended Cobbo into the turf and apologised as he did it. Queensland returned fire, doing the unthinkable by driving human tractor Payne Haas back in his opening charges.\n\nJunior Paulo came on for the Blues at 25 minutes, bent the line, won a six-again and slipped an offload within his first two runs. Despite Daly Cherry Evans and Munster rushing him, it bought Cleary a split second to jag a low kick on the diagonal to Origin debutante Matt Burton on the charge. With Cleary\u2019s conversion, NSW returned to the lead 8-6.\n\nMunster had been at his mesmeric best in Game 1 and again he had spiders on him. At the 30-minute mark he and Hunt combined with fast hands to rubberband man Ponga who loomed into the line like a Lighthorseman out of the dust at Beersheeba. He surged sideways, curved around Stephen Crichton and slung a pass back inside to \u2013 who else? \u2013 Munster. Queensland had their noses back in front.\n\nCameron Munster runs in to score for Queensland.

On the next play the Blues went left and fast hands from Cleary to Jarome Luai to Burton put Brian To\u2019o in in the corner. Cleary sliced the ball between the uprights to give NSW a 14-12 lead at the break.\n\nWith Kafusi cooling in the sin bin, the Blues surged after the oranges. Cameron Murray, his head strapped but his mind clear, got repeat line-speed and fast play the balls. James Tedesco was everywhere, returning every kick with precision and splitting the line with ease. The pressure eventually told as repeat raids down the right side found Cleary with time and an overlap out wide. He floated a three-man cut-out to Daniel Tupou who crossed untouched.\n\nThe gamebreaker came out of nowhere. Lu\u2019ai skipped, hopped and goose-stepped past a poor Jeremiah Nanai tackle and a fatigued Dane Gagai. He bounced through and scored to put the Blues 14 points clear with 20 minutes to play. Four minutes later Cleary dropped the ball cold in a tackle but Burton saved his blushes on the next play with a man-on-man strip on an out-of-sorts Gagai. Cleary demanded the ball and rammed home his redemption, weaving behind the tired Queensland defence to plant the ball down and start the celebrations.\n\nAt 32-12, Blue murder was on the cards and Cleary took the knife and buried it to the hilt with a twist, dummying past Hunt to cross under the black dot and register a double and bring up 22 individual points, the most by a NSW player since Ryan Girdler. Minutes later Angus Crichton, another enforcer recalled by Fittler, finished the rout with another four-pointer before the siren sounded and the slow march to a decider at Suncorp began.\n\nFittler pumped the air and shook each of his men\u2019s hands but there were no embraces. With a Game 3 in the Brisbane cauldron and a baying Queensland crowd to be countered, the job is only half-done for both sides. Origin history is dotted with great escapes but when it comes to deciders, Fittler knows all too well the game and the fans, will take no prisoners."}]}
