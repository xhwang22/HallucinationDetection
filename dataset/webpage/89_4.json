Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}, {"url": "https://blueseum.org/Bert+Deacon", "page_content": "Milestones\n\nVideo\n\nBert Deacon holds a special place among the legends of the Carlton Football Club. Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old. The football world was rocked to its core by the news, and there was widespread grief at the loss of one of football\u2019s favourite sons \u2013 a man whose dignity and integrity transcended club loyalties and brought him genuine admiration. Winning and losing mattered much to Bert Deacon, but so did how the game was played.The Deacon family tradition continued at Preston with his brother Bill acting as President from 1983 to 1987, a period that saw the club become the first in V.F.A. history to take out premierships at the Firsts, Seconds and Thirds levels in 1983 and again the following year.

After all, Deacon had just come off a stellar season, having taken out the 1947 Brownlow Medal, represented Carlton in its eighth premiership and earned Victorian and All-Australian selection.\n\nHow well Dudley remembers the moment. \u201cMy mother was blind, and when Bert won the Brownlow I was sitting with Mum in the bedroom talking to her one night and she said, \u2018You should paint a portrait of Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Dudley explained.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 and she said \u2018I think it will be wonderful for you\u2019. I then said \u2018How do I do this?\u2019 and she said \u2018Go and see him\u2019.\u201d\n\nDudley made his way to 2 Hawker Avenue, Preston, where Bert and Jean then lived. \u201cWhen I got there this particular night, around about seven o\u2019clock, Bert was already in bed because he was injured - he\u2019d injured his leg playing football, but he and Jean just welcomed me so much. It was great and I felt so proud,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI then asked Bert if he would pose for the big portrait and he said \u2018I\u2019d be very happy to do that\u2019. He sat for the portrait about eight times and I remember in one sitting he began to smile, exposing this toothless gap. He was painted sporting grey trousers and navy blue blazer with the white V on the pocket and included in the painting is a trophy Bert also won for best afield for Victoria.\n\n\u201cTowards the end Bert said, \u2018You know I really love this painting and I\u2019m going to tell everybody about the greatest artist in the world\u2019, and he did. He sent many people to me to have their portraits painted. He was just great. No wonder I cried when he went to heaven.\n\nThough Bert and his wife Jean were thrilled with Dudley\u2019s gift, they had nowhere in their small home to hang the sizeable canvas. For a brief period the portrait found a wall in the city sports store of the former Collingwood footballer Ron Todd, but at some point in 1948 it was returned to Dudley\u2019s home and stored in a shed \u2013 which is where the work unfortunately came to grief.\n\nAs the artist explained, the painting toppled on to a steel table which pierced the canvas beyond repair.\n\nThe story might have ended then and there, were it not for this reporter\u2019s chance viewing of a photograph of the original portrait in a scrapbook in Jean\u2019s keep. Jean revealed that Dudley, now in his 80s, was the artist responsible and was alive and well in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThe question then begged. Sixty years on, would Dudley be up for the job of repainting the portrait from the photograph of the original? Remarkably, Dudley explained that the very thought had recently crossed his mind and that yes, he would commit to the task of recreating the image of Deacon, who died suddenly while serving Carlton as club secretary back in 1974.\n\nAnd so it was that the new version of the old Bert Deacon was this week unveiled by Dudley in the presence of Bert\u2019s widow, Jean and son Robert. The portrait is basically true to the original, but boasts one slight embellishment - Dudley has painted in Bert\u2019s \u201947 Brownlow, which can be seen dangling from the trophy.\n\n\u201cTo think that 60 years on I\u2019ve brought that painting back to life,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a great story?\u201d\n\nDudley has also just completed a work of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road, based on a press photograph Bert handed him years before.\n\n\u201cBert had given me a copy of this photograph, which carried a handwritten message in the top left hand corner \u2013 \u2018To my friend Dud - regards, Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Drew said.\n\nRegrettably the photograph was later stolen and all was thought lost . . . until early last year when Jean again came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cI went out to Jean\u2019s house and sat down with her, during which time she showed me the family photo album . . . that\u2019s where I came across another copy of this photograph,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Jean, you must let me borrow this. I want to paint this picture\u2019. That happened about a year and a half ago\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the past nine months, Drew, now in his early 80s, has put brush to canvas to recreate the Deacon image. The paint was still drying when he recently unveiled the canvas.\n\n\u201cBert actually told me that the Richmond fellow in front of the marking contest is George Smeaton and Jack Wrout is sandwiched between them,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\u201cRon Savage is the Carlton player watching on, but I\u2019m not sure of the identity of the other Richmond player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Drew is somewhat circumspect when asked what will become of the Bert Deacon artworks. Perhaps a Carlton-friendly benefactor might see fit to purchase the paintings and make them available on permanent loan to the Club.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the life of a painting,\u201d said the man who has also painted the portraits of such luminaries as Archbishop Daniel Mannix, King O\u2019Malley and \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.\n\nBut there can be no doubting the strength of the lifelong bond Dudley and Bert forged from the moment they met at the house in Hawker Avenue back in \u201948.\n\n\u201cI had a friendship with and a great admiration for this fellow, and his wife Jean,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cBert and I became great friends and I could tell you many stories about him. He was a wonderful man. The day he died I remember picking up a paper. It was all over the front page and I just cried.\n\n\u201cOne night we met in the city and we were on our way to my parents place in Albert Park for dinner. We caught the tram here as he didn\u2019t have a car then, nor did I. And I remember saying to him, I should have been as tall as you Bert, and he said to me \u2018Dud, diamonds were never made as big as bricks\u2019. So that made me feel good and every time I see someone bigger than me I think of the diamond.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://victoriancollections.net.au/items/5d5229e121ea6c157ceeb51e", "page_content": "Carlton Football Club\n\nDinner to Mr H R Clover player Career : 1920-24, 1926-31 Debut : Round 2, 1920 vs. Richmond, aged 25 years, 46 days Carlton Player No. 346 Games : 147 Goals : 396 Guernsey No. 1 Last Game : Semi Final, 1931 vs. Collingwood, aged 36 years, 180 days Height : 185 cm (6 ft. 1 in.)

But even before he took the field for Carlton, Clover had to conquer the odds on the battlefields of France in World War 1. From Maryborough in central Victoria, Horrie enlisted in the 1st AIF in September 1915. After basic training, he embarked for France with reinforcements for the 7th Battalion in January of 1916. Soon pitched into the horrors of trench warfare, he fought and survived until September of that year, when he was transferred to a machine gun company and promoted to the rank of Corporal. On Christmas day, 1916, Horrie was struck down with acute appendicitis. He was evacuated to a field hospital for emergency surgery, where the doctors discovered that his appendix was gangrenous and that his life was in danger. He was immediately transferred to London for specialist treatment, and months of recuperation. Pronounced unfit for further front-line service, he was repatriated back to Australia in August 1917, and honourably discharged in May of the following year \u2013 six months before the Armistice. Having recovered, and keen to have a crack at senior football, Clover trained with Richmond and Melbourne before Carlton gave him an opportunity at VFL level. And how he delivered! In his first match in 1920 \u2013 ironically, against Richmond - he kicked four goals from centre half-forward, and hit the post three times! By the end of his first season at Princes Park, Clover was one of Carlton\u2019s drawcards. Former Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was just one of the many Carlton fans who were captivated; \u201che was the most artistic of high marks, unforgettable at half-forward,\u201d said Menzies. Horrie could kick a football, too. A balanced, deceptively quick mover, he was a glorious running drop-kick for goal. Playing against Richmond again at Princes Park in July, 1921, he let fly with a monster kick that was later measured at 86.26 metres \u2013 that\u2019s 94 yards, 2 feet in imperial terms! And there are numerous other instances where he roosted the ball more than 70 metres. In round 12 of 1921, he slotted 13 goals in a game against St Kilda; a club record which still stands today. The Blues made the finals in third place in 1921 and battled through to meet Richmond for the Premiership. Then the heavens above the MCG opened up on the day before the decider, turning the ground into a quagmire. In what was to be Clover\u2019s only Grand Final appearance, Richmond won a slogging, mauling contest by four points. While Premiership glory eluded him, Horrie was Carlton\u2019s top goalkicker in three of his first four seasons, including 1922, where his total of 58 was the competition\u2019s best. He was appointed captain of the Blues that same year, and in 1923 took on the dual role of captain-coach. Over 1924 / 1925, he suffered more debilitating illness that prevented him from playing all season. Unable to pull on his football boots, he took on the job of Club Secretary, and continued in that position even after returning to the field in 1926. When he did eventually resume, he formed a new, powerful Carlton forward set-up with a young Harry \u201cSoapy\u201d Vallence at full-forward. Twice more \u2013 in 1926 and 1928, Clover\u2019s brilliance and accuracy in front of goal saw him at the top of Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking, and in 1929 \u2013 aged 34, he was honoured with the captaincy of Victoria against WA in his ninth and final game in the Big Vee. show_image.php?id=205 Horrie Clover retired as a player in 1931 after 147 games. His total of 396 goals is still ranked fifth best in Carlton\u2019s proud history (only displaced for fourth when Brendan Fevola broke through in 2007/2008) \u2013 and it should be remembered that all but a handful of his games were played at centre half-forward, not in the goal square. In 1932 he was elected Vice-President of the Carlton Football Club, but retired after one year. In February 1935 on learning of Terry Ogden's the serious illness, Clover and Newton Chandler offered their services for a blood transfusion for the club's wing man. After a blood test Chandler's blood was accepted. However, Ogden passed away the next month. Clover stood again in 1935, was elected \u2013 and spent twenty unbroken years serving his beloved Blues. He even took on the Presidency in 1956, aged 60, and was as vigorous and determined as ever in his two years in the job. Carlton Football Club mourned deeply when Horrie Clover passed away on the first day of January, 1984. Three years later, he was among the first to be inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame. Testament to his stature in the game as a whole, he was elected to the AFL Hall of Fame in 1996; and May 2000 saw him named as one of four emergencies in Carlton\u2019s Team of the Century. A champion in every sense of the word, he spent 37 years of his remarkable life at Princes Park. Footnote The Argus published an article on Maryborough, April 12 1930, it said; \"Clover has been the leading half-forward in League ranks for some time. It takes a specialist to fill the position capably, and the Carisbrook man does this admirably. Like good wine he has improved with age, and besides being one of the greatest half forwards that has ever appeared on a football field, he is about the best all round kicker that has ever played the game. He excells in punting, drop, and place kicking. He is a great marksman and a splendid exponent, one of the greatest the district has produced, besides being a fair cricketer also.\" When Clover returned to football in 1926, The Argus mentioned that they thought it was the first time a member of the Permit and Umpire Committee had played in a League game. 13 GOAL AWARD Round 12, 1921 At the Carlton AGM held on Monday 27 February 1922, Horrie Clover \"was presented with ball used on the occasion, the St.Kilda club having generously donated it to the Carlton officials, who had it mounted for the purpose.\" (Age February 22 1922) 1922 The Art Of Forward Play Horrie wrote an article for the Sporting Globe August 30 p7 To read click here> http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article184798404 1928 Idol of Carlton Crowds - Australia's Best Centre Half Forward The Sporting Globe's football writer W.

For that reason he deserves a line to himself. He played the game like a sportsman, was a glorious high mark, and could cover a great distance by either drop, punt, or place kick - a remarkable accomplishment. Many players have been notable kicks in two aspects of the game, yet none have equalled Clover in the three branches. His nearest rival as an all-round kick, though not quite as certain in his efforts, was Frank Caine, of Carlton, who, like Clover, also hailed from the country.\" 1933 Coming Football Champion Melbourne, Saturday A special warning was issued to the Victorian Football League delegates last night by Mr. D. H. Crone, a Carlton delegate, not to angle for a certain \"coming\" champion that the Carlton Club had signed up that day. At first delegates were a little puzzled at the statement, but when it was explained that Horrie Clover, former champion half-forward, had that day become the father of of a son they burst into sustained laughter. It was only by persistent ringing of the bell by the chairman that order was restored. (News (Adelaide) May 20 1933 p3) 1933 - The Place Kick A letter to The Argus via the Huon Times about the lack of place kicking expertise in the VFL.

After all, Deacon had just come off a stellar season, having taken out the 1947 Brownlow Medal, represented Carlton in its eighth premiership and earned Victorian and All-Australian selection.\n\nHow well Dudley remembers the moment. \u201cMy mother was blind, and when Bert won the Brownlow I was sitting with Mum in the bedroom talking to her one night and she said, \u2018You should paint a portrait of Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Dudley explained.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 and she said \u2018I think it will be wonderful for you\u2019. I then said \u2018How do I do this?\u2019 and she said \u2018Go and see him\u2019.\u201d\n\nDudley made his way to 2 Hawker Avenue, Preston, where Bert and Jean then lived. \u201cWhen I got there this particular night, around about seven o\u2019clock, Bert was already in bed because he was injured - he\u2019d injured his leg playing football, but he and Jean just welcomed me so much. It was great and I felt so proud,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI then asked Bert if he would pose for the big portrait and he said \u2018I\u2019d be very happy to do that\u2019. He sat for the portrait about eight times and I remember in one sitting he began to smile, exposing this toothless gap. He was painted sporting grey trousers and navy blue blazer with the white V on the pocket and included in the painting is a trophy Bert also won for best afield for Victoria.\n\n\u201cTowards the end Bert said, \u2018You know I really love this painting and I\u2019m going to tell everybody about the greatest artist in the world\u2019, and he did. He sent many people to me to have their portraits painted. He was just great. No wonder I cried when he went to heaven.\n\nThough Bert and his wife Jean were thrilled with Dudley\u2019s gift, they had nowhere in their small home to hang the sizeable canvas. For a brief period the portrait found a wall in the city sports store of the former Collingwood footballer Ron Todd, but at some point in 1948 it was returned to Dudley\u2019s home and stored in a shed \u2013 which is where the work unfortunately came to grief.\n\nAs the artist explained, the painting toppled on to a steel table which pierced the canvas beyond repair.\n\nThe story might have ended then and there, were it not for this reporter\u2019s chance viewing of a photograph of the original portrait in a scrapbook in Jean\u2019s keep. Jean revealed that Dudley, now in his 80s, was the artist responsible and was alive and well in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThe question then begged. Sixty years on, would Dudley be up for the job of repainting the portrait from the photograph of the original? Remarkably, Dudley explained that the very thought had recently crossed his mind and that yes, he would commit to the task of recreating the image of Deacon, who died suddenly while serving Carlton as club secretary back in 1974.\n\nAnd so it was that the new version of the old Bert Deacon was this week unveiled by Dudley in the presence of Bert\u2019s widow, Jean and son Robert. The portrait is basically true to the original, but boasts one slight embellishment - Dudley has painted in Bert\u2019s \u201947 Brownlow, which can be seen dangling from the trophy.\n\n\u201cTo think that 60 years on I\u2019ve brought that painting back to life,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a great story?\u201d\n\nDudley has also just completed a work of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road, based on a press photograph Bert handed him years before.\n\n\u201cBert had given me a copy of this photograph, which carried a handwritten message in the top left hand corner \u2013 \u2018To my friend Dud - regards, Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Drew said.\n\nRegrettably the photograph was later stolen and all was thought lost . . . until early last year when Jean again came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cI went out to Jean\u2019s house and sat down with her, during which time she showed me the family photo album . . . that\u2019s where I came across another copy of this photograph,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Jean, you must let me borrow this. I want to paint this picture\u2019. That happened about a year and a half ago\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the past nine months, Drew, now in his early 80s, has put brush to canvas to recreate the Deacon image. The paint was still drying when he recently unveiled the canvas.\n\n\u201cBert actually told me that the Richmond fellow in front of the marking contest is George Smeaton and Jack Wrout is sandwiched between them,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\u201cRon Savage is the Carlton player watching on, but I\u2019m not sure of the identity of the other Richmond player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Drew is somewhat circumspect when asked what will become of the Bert Deacon artworks. Perhaps a Carlton-friendly benefactor might see fit to purchase the paintings and make them available on permanent loan to the Club.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the life of a painting,\u201d said the man who has also painted the portraits of such luminaries as Archbishop Daniel Mannix, King O\u2019Malley and \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.\n\nBut there can be no doubting the strength of the lifelong bond Dudley and Bert forged from the moment they met at the house in Hawker Avenue back in \u201948.\n\n\u201cI had a friendship with and a great admiration for this fellow, and his wife Jean,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cBert and I became great friends and I could tell you many stories about him. He was a wonderful man. The day he died I remember picking up a paper. It was all over the front page and I just cried.\n\n\u201cOne night we met in the city and we were on our way to my parents place in Albert Park for dinner. We caught the tram here as he didn\u2019t have a car then, nor did I. And I remember saying to him, I should have been as tall as you Bert, and he said to me \u2018Dud, diamonds were never made as big as bricks\u2019. So that made me feel good and every time I see someone bigger than me I think of the diamond.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/adams-claims-copeland-as-pendlebury-makes-it-12-top-three-finishes-20201013-p564n1.html", "page_content": "Collingwood vice-captain Taylor Adams' career-best season has reaped a maiden best and fairest crown.\n\nThe hard-nosed midfielder claimed his first All-Australian team berth earlier this year and was on Tuesday named the recipient of the 2020 Copeland Trophy.\n\nTaylor Adams.

Carlton signed Deacon in March 1941, one day before his residential address in Preston, which had previously been unallotted, became part of Fitzroy's zone.[1] He joined the army during World War II, and from 1942 until 1945 played most of his football for services teams, including acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a 1945 services competition in Darwin. However, he also made his league debut with Carlton and played eight games between 1942 and 1944 whenever he was stationed in Melbourne.\n\nDeacon returned permanently to Melbourne in mid-1945. He played a few games for Preston, then was cleared to and Carlton and played there permanently for the next seven years. Adept at all key positions, he quickly established himself at centre half back with Carlton. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 and 1947, and in the latter in a year which he won the Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. He was the first Carlton player to win the award.\n\nDeacon was held in extremely high regard throughout the league for his quality key position play in the years immediately following the war. In 1945, despite having played only half of the season, the Age sportswriter Percy Beames lauded Deacon's \"great versatility and sustained brilliance through each game\", and said he was perhaps the best key player since the early days of Laurie Nash.[2] Deacon was also noted as a very fair player, and one of the few remembered for gentlemanly behaviour in the notoriously violent 1945 VFL Grand Final \u2013 when he helped his 17-year-old opponent Ron Clegg, who had been concussed in a behind-the-play incident, first to face the right direction to take a free kick, then to protect him from joining the outbreaking violence.[3]\n\nDeacon struggled with injuries in his last couple of years with Carlton.

His father was a Premiership player with South Melbourne in 1918, and Chooka himself won a flag with Carlton in 1947. When Chooka's son Scott Howell played in the Blues\u2019 1981 Premiership team, the Howells became the only family to have produced VFL Premiership footballers in three successive generations.\n\n\n\nWayne Johnston - 1979-1990\n\n\n\nA brilliant, hard-running, aggressive mid-fielder in four Carlton Premiership teams, Wayne Johnston was a player ahead of his time.

A Premiership Captain in 1947, Henfry won the Club Best & Fairest twice in his 84-game career with the Blues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian Gallagher - 1964-1972\n\n\n\nOver eight seasons, Gallagher was an integral part of the greatest first ruck of all. He developed an instinctive, almost telepathic combination with champion ruckman John Nicholls and ruck-rover Serge Silvagni in an era when this trio were the platform for two Carlton Premierships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Fitzpatrick - 1975-1983\n\n\n\nAt 191 cm and 91 kg he gave away height and weight to many opponents, but he was clever, athletic and an outstanding mark. Adept at assessing his opponents' strengths and weaknesses, he was a fierce competitor who hated being beaten. Three-time Premiership player, including two as Captain.\n\nInducted in 1993:\n\nFrank Gill - 1929-1942\n\n\n\nRegarded as one of the very best in an era of star full-backs, Frank Gill was a Carlton stalwart for 14 seasons.

A brave and skillful player who was part of two Premiership teams, he continued to serve the Blues for many years after his wonderful playing career ended.\n\nStephen Kernahan - 1986-1997\n\n\n\nThe numbers are impressive enough; 251 games, 738 goals, All-Australian, twice captain of Carlton Premiership teams, three times club Best & Fairest, captain (and leading goal-kicker) for eleven seasons in a row - yet this fabulous record only goes part of the way toward explaining why Stephen 'Sticks' Kernahan is revered as one of this proud club's greatest players and most inspirational leaders.\n\nInducted in 1994:\n\nCharlie Davey - 1927-1937\n\n\n\nA passionate Blues supporter from birth, Charlie Davey represented the Navy Blues in 143 games, kicking 121 goals and Captaining the Club in 1935.\n\n\n\nOllie Grieve - 1942, 1944, 1946-1952\n\n\n\nFor seven seasons immediately after World War II, Carlton\u2019s champion custodian of the goal square was Oliver Kelvin \u2018Ollie\u2019 Grieve \u2013 a brilliant, close-checking defender who was a glorious high mark and a powerful, driving drop-kick.\n\n\n\nTrevor Keogh - 1970-1981\n\n\n\nA clever player, Keogh was not a penetrating kick but rarely wasted a possession able to pinpoint players and put the team to better advantage with smart disposal. A Premiership player in 1972 & 1979 and a dual Best & Fairest winner.\n\nGeoff Southby - 1971-1984\n\n\n\nSouthby arrived at Carlton in late 1970 as a 20 year-old and was a revelation from his first practice game.

In a marathon 18-year AFL career that began at Essendon and flourished at Carlton, Harry played 332 senior games and kicked 190 goals between 1980 and 1996.\n\nInducted in 1996:\n\nJim Francis - 1934-1943\n\n\n\nFrancis was barely tall enough for a key position at 183 cm and 80 kg, but he was athletic, extraordinarily versatile, and a booming right foot kick.

With his spindly frame, his socks down around his ankles and his trademark mop of unruly hair, Hunter ran into, and flew over packs from all angles to take spectacular marks week after week. Absolutely fearless in his pursuit of the football, he never shirked the fiercest of physical clashes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dean - 1984-1998\n\n\n\nThroughout his 248 games with the Navy Blues \u2013 including the '87 and '95 Premierships \u2013 \u2018Deanie\u2019 (later also dubbed \u2018Helmet\u2019 for his mullet haircut, or \u2018The General\u2019 for his on-field leadership) was one of the most popular Carlton players of his era.\n\nInducted in 1999:\n\nLaurie Kerr - 1950-1959\n\n\n\nIf three words were needed to sum up Laurie Kerr as a footballer, then they would surely be speed, aggression and courage. A blisteringly-quick winger, centreman or half-forward flanker, Kerr was a star player in a bleak period for the Blues from 1950 to \u201959, and later, an influential figure in the Carlton Football Club for more than thirty years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Hall - 1963-1973\n\n\n\nKevin \"Racehorse\" Hall was a solid, reliable, often inspirational member of three Premiership teams for the Blues, and later, a valuable and long-serving committee and board member.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Alvin - 1984-1994\n\n\n\nEasily distinguished on the field by his long, shoulder-length hair, Alvin played 218 games and kicked 95 goals. A member of the 1987 Premiership side, he represented Victoria on six occasions.\n\nBrett Ratten - 1990-2003\n\n\n\nBrett Ratten\u2019s career at the Carlton Football Club is a story of talent, determination, courage, and loyalty. Destined to be a champion of the club and of the game, he joined Carlton\u2019s Under-19 squad as a 16-year-old schoolboy in 1988 and retired after 255 games for the Navy Blues, including the 1995 Premiership.\n\nGreg Williams - 1992-1997\n\n\n\nOne of the most brilliant and controversial players of all time, Greg \"Diesel\" Williams was twice rejected by Carlton as a youngster because he lacked natural leg speed. Nevertheless, he went on to carve his name into AFL history as a champion centreman at Geelong and Sydney, before returning to Princes Park and Premiership glory with the Blues. For sheer ball-getting ability, tenacity, and pin-point disposal by hand or by foot, Diesel Williams had few peers.\n\nInducted in 2000:\n\nGarry Crane - 1964-1976\n\n\n\nRenowned for his boundless courage, perseverance, and sheer ball-getting ability, Garry Crane was an outstanding big-occasion player for the Navy Blues in a celebrated 13-year career between 1964 and 1976.\n\n\n\nJim Buckley - 1976-1990\n\n\n\nJimmy Buckley played his first senior game in guernsey number 16 at the tender age of 16 years, 6 months and 18 days, making him the equal-youngest Blue of all. In a career stretching 15 seasons, Buckley would play in three Premiership teams and won the Best & Fairest award in 1982.\n\n\n\nWayne Harmes - 1977-1988\n\n\n\nA true utility, he was perhaps at his best in a back pocket, yet never failed to produce wherever he was asked to play. Just 177 cm tall, his barrel chest and solid legs meant he tipped the scales at 85 kg. He was surprisingly quick for his build, a safe mark, and a dangerous near goal, and he loved bursting through packs to set up play at both ends of the ground.\n\n\n\nMichael Sexton - 1990-2000\n\n\n\nOne of Carlton\u2019s brightest stars in the last decade of the 20th century was Michael Sexton; a skilled, resolute defender who was born in New Guinea and grew up in Bendigo.\n\nInducted in 2001:\n\nIan Collins - 1961-1969 & 1971\n\n\n\nA courageous, uncompromising back pocket in the Blues' 1968 Premiership team, Ian Collins went on to serve as Secretary-Manager and President through some of Carlton Football Club's most successful, and later, most turbulent times.\n\n\n\nDavid Glascott - 1981-1991\n\n\n\nWith his slender build, his longish blonde hair and his baby face, he seemed anything but a star VFL footballer. But looks are often deceiving, and in Glascott\u2019s case, the fresh face and spindly legs belonged to a determined and skillful midfielder who was a valuable member of three Carlton Premiership teams.\n\n\n\nAndrew McKay - 1993-2003\n\n\n\nA warrior at half-back for the Blues for 11 seasons, he was resolute, reliable and most of the time, utterly impassable. His career began with a Grand Final defeat in his debut year, then soared to redemption only two seasons later. From then on, through the near-misses of 1999 and 2000, and into the looming catastrophe of the first decade of this troubled century, Andrew Ian McKay stood \u2013 and still stands \u2013 as an all-time great of the Carlton Football Club.\n\nInducted in 2006:\n\nJack Worrall - 1902-1909\n\n\n\nThe first-ever coach of a VFL club.

Highly skilled, athletic and as tough as teak, he played 167 games and kicked 7 goals for Carlton in a celebrated career that stretched over 13 seasons between 1913 and 1925. Two of those matches were Grand Final victories; in 1914 over South Melbourne and in 1915 over Collingwood.\n\n\n\nJim Baird - 1941-1943 & 1945-1951\n\n\n\nJim Baird was a two-time VFL Premiership player for the Carlton Football Club, and one of the great all-round sportsmen of the post-World War II era.\n\n\n\nBryan Quirk - 1965-1975\n\n\n\nOne of Carlton's greats, Bryan Quirk was the football equivalent of a champion greyhound. A tall, beautifully balanced, long-kicking winger or half-forward, he arrived at Carlton at the dawn of the Barassi era, and carved out a celebrated, if unlucky career.\n\n\n\nSyd Jackson - 1969-1976\n\n\n\nA gifted, courageous aboriginal footballer who was a star in two Carlton Premiership teams. In 2005 he was named in the AFL Players Association Indigenous Team of the Century, and in 2006 he became the Carlton Heroes\u2019 inaugural inductee into the Carlton Hall of Fame - an honour that everyone who saw him play would agree, was richly deserved.\n\n\n\nPeter McConville - 1978-1985\n\n\n\nWidely regarded for his consistency and his versatility, the powerful barrel-chested utility was a key factor in Carlton's golden run of three Premierships in four years from 1979 to 1982.\n\n\n\nAlex Marcou - 1979-1986\n\n\n\nAlex Marcou was a member of Carlton\u2019s fabled mosquito fleet of brilliant small men of the 1970\u2019s and \u201880\u2019s, and a three-time Premiership rover for the Blues.\n\n\n\nFraser Brown - 1989-2000\n\n\n\nThe shaggy-haired Brown, who wore #20 in 177 games for the Blues, was a tough and fair midfielder with the occasional stint forward. He was a solid 'inside' midfielder with creative disposal, but lacked a yard in pace. And when we say 'solid' we mean 'brick solid' given his 90 kilo, 181 cm frame. He formed an amazing engine room with other Legends Greg Williams and Brett Ratten, providing considerable ball winning ability to the Carlton teams of the 1990's.\n\n\n\nKen Sheldon - 1977-1986\n\n\n\n\u201cBomba\u201d Sheldon was an important member of Carlton\u2019s famed mosquito fleet of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. Just 178 cm and 76 kg, he was a nippy, courageous rover who became a versatile utility as his career progressed.\n\nInducted in 2011:\n\nRon Barassi - 1965-1971\n\n\n\nIn a VFL career in which he played 254 games and kicked 329 goals, he wore our Navy Blue guernsey in 50 games, kicked 35 goals, and coached six seasons for two memorable Premierships. More importantly, he had swept away the complacent attitudes that existed before his arrival, and built the platform for Carlton's dominance in the next decade.\n\n\n\nVin Gardiner - 1907-1917\n\n\n\nMore than 90 years after he played his last match for the Blues, Gardiner still ranks tenth overall in our club\u2019s list of all-time career goals. Described as the \u2018biggest kick, inch for inch\u2019 of his era, Gardiner led Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking in seven of his eleven seasons, and was also the VFL\u2019s leading scorer in 1911.\n\n\n\nJohn Goold - 1963-1970\n\n\n\nA brilliant, flamboyant, two-time Premiership player for Carlton during the Barassi years in the \u2018swingin\u2019 sixties,\u2019 John William Crosbie Goold became almost as famous for his dapper appearance off the field, as for his exploits on it.\n\n\n\nAnthony Koutoufides - 1992-2007\n\n\n\nThroughout the history of VFL/AFL football, few individual players have actually changed the game. However, such was the impact of Anthony Koutoufides - \u201cKouta\u201d to the masses of Blues supporters he thrilled during his celebrated 15-season career at Princes Park between 1992 and 2007 \u2013 that today he is recognised as the prototype of the 21st-century footballer.\n\nDavid Parkin - 1981-1985 & 1991-2000\n\n\n\nAmong the most respected figures in the long history of the Carlton Football Club, David Parkin was already a household name at Hawthorn when he arrived at Princes Park in 1981 to coach the Blues to three Premierships in fifteen interrupted seasons.\n\nInducted in 2013:\n\nDavid Rhys-Jones - 1985-1992\n\n\n\nRhys-Jones' rare football talents were sometimes lost in his all-too-frequent Tribunal visits. Not so at Carlton, the club to which the 1987 premiership player and Norm Smith Medallist committed in 108 matches (after 76 with the Swans).\n\nInducted in 2016:\n\nScott Camporeale - 1995-2005\n\nA member of Carlton's 1995 premiership team in his debut season, the man endearingly known as 'Campo' went on to play 233 games in the navy blue, earning All-Australian selection and a club best-and-fairest award in 2000.\n\nMil Hanna - 1986-1997\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Hanna quickly became a cult figure among the Carlton faithful in a celebrated 11-season career which included the famous 1995 premiership. The curtain came down on Mil\u2019s 190-game Carlton career in 1997, but the boy from East Brunswick still maintains his love for the club with which he shares a deep-rooted territorial link.\n\nIan Robertson - 1966-1974\n\nRenowned for his running capacity and prodigious, penetrating kicking, Robertson was a fixture in a famed centreline comprising Bryan Quirk and Garry Crane through what was arguably Carlton\u2019s greatest era. The grand final triumphs of 1968, \u201970 and \u201972 would crown a 125-game Carlton career for Robertson, whose later football life involved gamecalling for the Seven Network.\n\nJack Wrout (dec.) - 1936-1944\n\nThe late Wrout first embarked on a senior League career at North Melbourne in 1931, but after 53 games in six seasons with the Shinboners, became increasingly frustrated with a lack of opportunity. In 1936, Wrout crossed to Carlton and emerged as a star forward in the Blues\u2019 1938 grand final team, which broke the Club\u2019s record 22-year premiership drought. Five years later, he took the honors as his club\u2019s leading goalkicker.\n\nInducted in 2018:\n\nBrent Crosswell - 1968-1975\n\nRecruited to the club from the Tasmanian convict locale of Campbell Town, Brent Crosswell is remembered as a prodigious if enigmatic football talent \u2013 a genuine star in the star-studded Barassi-coached Carlton teams of the late 1960s/early \u201970s.\n\nThough his career would fall two games adrift of 100 in dark Navy, \u2018Tiger\u2019 impacted tremendously on football\u2019s grandest stage, as a member of the Blues\u2019 drought-breaking Grand Final victory of 1968 and perhaps their most famous of all Grand Final triumphs in 1970.\n\nLance Whitnall - 1997-2007\n\nThe son of Carlton\u2019s 66-game player Graeme, Lance Whitnall was considered the heir apparent to Stephen Kernahan as the club\u2019s pre-eminent tall forward \u2013 a lofty task to be sure, but one to which Whitnall committed with purpose from the outset.\n\nIn 216 games through 11 seasons from 1997, Whitnall - or \u2018Big Red\u2019 as he was endearingly dubbed \u2013 capably served in Carlton\u2019s front half, until a persistent knee problem at just 28 brought premature end to his on-field tenure.\n\nInducted in 2023:\n\nPercy Bentley - 1941-1955\n\nSince the formation of the VFL in 1897, only David Parkin has coached the Carlton Football Club more times than Percy Bentley - and few have served the Blues longer and with greater distinction than the former Richmond champion.\n\nBentley commandeered Carlton to the famous Premierships of 1945 and 1947 Premierships, then dedicated most of the remaining years of his life to the football club as Vice-President.\n\nFor Bentley, Carlton was everything.\n\nAdrian Gleeson - 1986-1996\n\nHailing from the rolling green fields of Koroit in Victoria's western districts, Gleeson fast earned a reputation as one of Carlton's truly durable small men, and a more than handy successor to the retiring Rod Ashman.\n\nIn tandem with the Blues' runners - the likes of Craig Bradley, Mark Naley and Fraser Murphy, Gleeson savoured Premiership success in 1987 and would capably serve his club through 176 games as a player before committing his time and substantial energies at board level.\n\nChris Judd - 2008-2015\n\nChris Judd joined Carlton from West Coast in a hail of publicity - and from the outset validated the club's greatest recruiting coup since Ron Barassi.\n\nNamed captain in his maiden season with the Blues, Judd reinforced his status as one of League football's truly great players of the early 20th century - landing the John Nicholls Medal for Carlton's Best & Fairest on three occasions, as well as the Brownlow Medal for the competition's preeminent player, through 145 quality games - before giving back at board level as a Carlton director.\n\nCarlton Football Club Hall of Fame Legends:\n\nIn 1997, to coincide with the opening of the Legends Stand at Princes Park and the newly-introduced Legend component of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Carlton elevated nine of its own Hall of Fame Inductees to Legend status for the first time.\n\nAccordingly, Craig Bradley, Bert Deacon, Bruce Doull, Alex Jesaulenko, Wayne Johnston, Stephen Kernahan, John Nicholls, Stephen Silvagni and Harry Vallence were elevated following a vote of Club supporters.\n\nToday, a total of 14 Carlton Inductees are recognized as Legends, with Ken Hands having been elevated in 2006, Robert Walls in 2011, Geoff Southby in 2013, Sergio Silvagni in 2016 and David McKay in 2021.\n\nElevated in 1997:\n\nCraig Bradley\n\nBert Deacon\n\nAlex Jesaulenko\n\nBruce Doull\n\nWayne Johnston\n\nStephen Kernahan\n\nJohn Nicholls\n\nStephen Silvagni\n\nHarry Vallence\n\nElevated in 2006:\n\nKen Hands\n\nElevated in 2011:\n\nRobert Walls\n\nElevated in 2013:\n\nGeoff Southby\n\nElevated in 2016:\n\nSergio Silvagni\n\nElevated in 2021:\n\nDavid McKay\n\nElevated in 2023:\n\nHorrie Clover\n\nIan Collins"}, {"url": "https://spiritofcarlton.com.au/2021/09/20/images-emerge-of-blues-first-brownlow-medallist/", "page_content": "A SEQUENCE of four photographs of Carlton\u2019s inaugural Brownlow Medallist Bert Deacon in full flight have surfaced almost three quarters of a century after the much-admired centre half-back earned the game\u2019s most coveted award.\n\nCaptured in an unknown suburban parkland, the photos show Deacon in his long-sleeved Dark Navy guernsey (possibly carrying the original No.14 on the back) and highcuts, magnificently executing the game\u2019s basics \u2013the high mark, the field kick and the art of \u201cselling the candy\u201d.\n\nThe images, which do not carry a photographer\u2019s name, were stored in a box of miscellaneous football images in the keep of Peter Valentino, a former volunteer at the State Library of Victoria, who graciously availed copies to the Club.\n\nPeter believed the photographs were captured for the national magazine Sporting Life (published from 1947 to 1957) and the Australian pictorial magazine Pix (published from 1938 to 1972).\n\nThey are thought to have been taken in 1948 \u2013 the year after Deacon, with 23 votes, earned the Brownlow by two from St Kilda centreman Harold Bray.\n\nTo complete his stellar year, Deacon also featured in Carlton\u2019s famed one-point Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947 and tied with the then Carlton captain Ern Henfry for the club\u2019s Best & Fairest award.\n\nHenfry also featured on the front cover of the May 1951 edition of Sporting Life, a copy of which Peter also supplied.\n\nBoth Henfry and Deacon featured in Sporting Life\u2019s Teams of The Year (a forerunner to All-Australian teams) \u2013 Henfry in 1947 and \u201949; Deacon in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949."}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/712053/moment-24-deacons-brownlow-medal", "page_content": "24. 1947 - Bert Deacon's Brownlow Medal\n\nVIEW THE 25 GREATEST MOMENTS HUB HERE\n\nThe man who would be Carlton\u2019s first Brownlow Medallist deftly adjusted the dial of his trusty bakelite radio. Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}, {"url": "https://australianfootball.com/Players/player/bert%20deacon/6771", "page_content": "Pre 1965 stats are for selected matches only\n\nAFL: 5,074th player to appear, 2,223rd most games played, 5,597th most goals kickedCarlton: 574th player to appear, 160th most games played, 497th most goals kicked\n\nSomewhat surprisingly for a club with such an illustrious pedigree, it took Carlton 27 years to come up with its first Brownlow Medallist in the shape of virtuoso centre half back Bert Deacon.\n\nAs fair as he was talented, Deacon began and finished his senior career with VFA side Preston. He joined the Blues in 1942, and was a key member of premiership teams in both 1945 and his Brownlow year of 1947. Strong overhead and brilliant at ground level, he effectively constituted the first line of attack for the Blues, with his superb anticipation frequently enabling him to intercept the ball and return it with interest, almost invariably to his team's advantage.\n\nIn 1952, Deacon returned to his original club Preston as captain-coach. He was regarded as having \"an excellent rapport with his players\",\u00b9 but it was not until he began to coach the team from the sidelines that this began to bear fruit. In 1955 the Bullants qualified for the finals for the first time since the war, and although they would not win a premiership for another eight seasons there is little doubt that Deacon was instrumental in laying a foundation of professionalism on which his successors were able to build.\n\nIn 1958, Bert Deacon returned to Carlton as vice-president, and later served as club secretary.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney"}, {"url": "https://www.afl.com.au/news/503359/the-story-of-dudley-drew-and-the-lost-painting-of-bert-deacon", "page_content": "\n\nDudley Drew talks to CFC TV about his memories of his friend Bert Deacon, and about the painting he has just completed of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road.\n\nClick here to view the video\n\nBack in 1948, a budding Melbourne artist named Dudley Drew was trying to eke out an existence in his adopted profession when, on the advice of his dear mother, he resolved to paint somebody famous.\n\nDudley\u2019s Mum volunteered the name of Carlton centre half-back the late great Bert Deacon. After all, Deacon had just come off a stellar season, having taken out the 1947 Brownlow Medal, represented Carlton in its eighth premiership and earned Victorian and All-Australian selection.\n\nHow well Dudley remembers the moment. \u201cMy mother was blind, and when Bert won the Brownlow I was sitting with Mum in the bedroom talking to her one night and she said, \u2018You should paint a portrait of Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Dudley explained.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 and she said \u2018I think it will be wonderful for you\u2019. I then said \u2018How do I do this?\u2019 and she said \u2018Go and see him\u2019.\u201d\n\nDudley made his way to 2 Hawker Avenue, Preston, where Bert and Jean then lived. \u201cWhen I got there this particular night, around about seven o\u2019clock, Bert was already in bed because he was injured - he\u2019d injured his leg playing football, but he and Jean just welcomed me so much. It was great and I felt so proud,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI then asked Bert if he would pose for the big portrait and he said \u2018I\u2019d be very happy to do that\u2019. He sat for the portrait about eight times and I remember in one sitting he began to smile, exposing this toothless gap. He was painted sporting grey trousers and navy blue blazer with the white V on the pocket and included in the painting is a trophy Bert also won for best afield for Victoria.\n\n\u201cTowards the end Bert said, \u2018You know I really love this painting and I\u2019m going to tell everybody about the greatest artist in the world\u2019, and he did. He sent many people to me to have their portraits painted. He was just great. No wonder I cried when he went to heaven.\n\nThough Bert and his wife Jean were thrilled with Dudley\u2019s gift, they had nowhere in their small home to hang the sizeable canvas. For a brief period the portrait found a wall in the city sports store of the former Collingwood footballer Ron Todd, but at some point in 1948 it was returned to Dudley\u2019s home and stored in a shed \u2013 which is where the work unfortunately came to grief.\n\nAs the artist explained, the painting toppled on to a steel table which pierced the canvas beyond repair.\n\nThe story might have ended then and there, were it not for this reporter\u2019s chance viewing of a photograph of the original portrait in a scrapbook in Jean\u2019s keep. Jean revealed that Dudley, now in his 80s, was the artist responsible and was alive and well in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThe question then begged. Sixty years on, would Dudley be up for the job of repainting the portrait from the photograph of the original? Remarkably, Dudley explained that the very thought had recently crossed his mind and that yes, he would commit to the task of recreating the image of Deacon, who died suddenly while serving Carlton as club secretary back in 1974.\n\nAnd so it was that the new version of the old Bert Deacon was this week unveiled by Dudley in the presence of Bert\u2019s widow, Jean and son Robert. The portrait is basically true to the original, but boasts one slight embellishment - Dudley has painted in Bert\u2019s \u201947 Brownlow, which can be seen dangling from the trophy.\n\n\u201cTo think that 60 years on I\u2019ve brought that painting back to life,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a great story?\u201d\n\nDudley has also just completed a work of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road, based on a press photograph Bert handed him years before.\n\n\u201cBert had given me a copy of this photograph, which carried a handwritten message in the top left hand corner \u2013 \u2018To my friend Dud - regards, Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Drew said.\n\nRegrettably the photograph was later stolen and all was thought lost . . . until early last year when Jean again came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cI went out to Jean\u2019s house and sat down with her, during which time she showed me the family photo album . . . that\u2019s where I came across another copy of this photograph,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Jean, you must let me borrow this. I want to paint this picture\u2019. That happened about a year and a half ago\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the past nine months, Drew, now in his early 80s, has put brush to canvas to recreate the Deacon image. The paint was still drying when he recently unveiled the canvas.\n\n\u201cBert actually told me that the Richmond fellow in front of the marking contest is George Smeaton and Jack Wrout is sandwiched between them,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\u201cRon Savage is the Carlton player watching on, but I\u2019m not sure of the identity of the other Richmond player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Drew is somewhat circumspect when asked what will become of the Bert Deacon artworks. Perhaps a Carlton-friendly benefactor might see fit to purchase the paintings and make them available on permanent loan to the Club.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the life of a painting,\u201d said the man who has also painted the portraits of such luminaries as Archbishop Daniel Mannix, King O\u2019Malley and \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.\n\nBut there can be no doubting the strength of the lifelong bond Dudley and Bert forged from the moment they met at the house in Hawker Avenue back in \u201948.\n\n\u201cI had a friendship with and a great admiration for this fellow, and his wife Jean,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cBert and I became great friends and I could tell you many stories about him. He was a wonderful man. The day he died I remember picking up a paper. It was all over the front page and I just cried.\n\n\u201cOne night we met in the city and we were on our way to my parents place in Albert Park for dinner. We caught the tram here as he didn\u2019t have a car then, nor did I. And I remember saying to him, I should have been as tall as you Bert, and he said to me \u2018Dud, diamonds were never made as big as bricks\u2019. So that made me feel good and every time I see someone bigger than me I think of the diamond.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://blueseum.org/Bert+Deacon", "page_content": "Milestones\n\nVideo\n\nBert Deacon holds a special place among the legends of the Carlton Football Club. Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old. The football world was rocked to its core by the news, and there was widespread grief at the loss of one of football\u2019s favourite sons \u2013 a man whose dignity and integrity transcended club loyalties and brought him genuine admiration. Winning and losing mattered much to Bert Deacon, but so did how the game was played.The Deacon family tradition continued at Preston with his brother Bill acting as President from 1983 to 1987, a period that saw the club become the first in V.F.A. history to take out premierships at the Firsts, Seconds and Thirds levels in 1983 and again the following year. Bill's widow, Maisie has had the honour of the Preston and now Northern Bullant No. 1 membership for many years50 Games : Round 15, 1947 Vs Footscray100 Games : Round 2, 1951 Vs Footscray"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/5860917", "page_content": "Infobox afl player | firstname = Bert\n\nlastname = Deacon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage size = 150\n\nbirthdate = 8 November 1922\n\nbirthplace =\n\nheightweight = 180cm, 79 kg\n\noriginalteam = Preston, Victoria\n\ndead = alive\n\ndeathdate =\n\ndeathplace =\n\ndebutdate = Round 7, 1942\n\ndebutteam = Carlton\n\ndebutopponent = Footscray\n\ndebutstadium = Yarraville Oval\n\nplayingteams = Carlton (1942-1951)\n\n* 106 games, 7 goals\n\ncoach = notcoach\n\ncoachingteams =\n\nstatsend = 1951\n\ncareerhighlights =\n\n* 1947 Brownlow Medal winner\n\nBert Deacon (8 November 1922 - 1973) was an Australian rules football er who played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Amongst the players recruited from Sydney is a player who kicked the winning goal in a VFL grand final, a Norm Smith medallist, eleven premiership players and a couple of record-holding goal kickers. It is a record of achievement that deserves more kudos.\n\nIn comparison, although one must preface this by stating I don\u2019t have an intimate knowledge of rugby league recruiting, this figure of 80 players from Sydney to the VFL/AFL would presumably be larger than the combined number of rugby league players recruited from Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin rugby league clubs to the NRL.\n\nDecade by decade- number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL/AFL\n\n1897-1909 \u2013 4 players\n\n1910s \u2013 6 players\n\n1920s \u2013 12 players\n\n1930s \u2013 10 players\n\n1940s \u2013 2 players\n\n1950s \u2013 7 players\n\n1960s \u2013 1 player\n\n1970s \u2013 5 players\n\n1980s \u2013 11 players\n\n1990s \u2013 9 players\n\n2000s \u2013 11 players\n\n2010-11 \u2013 2 players\n\nIn 2012, there are 20 players who have been recruited from Sydney who are on AFL lists. Eight of these twenty have debuted in league football.\n\n1897-1910\n\nSydney\u2019s first player: Bob Kenny\n\nBob Kenny was the first player recruited from a Sydney club to play in the VFL. He debuted in 1899 and played just two games for St Kilda. He was followed soon after by John Stephenson, who was recruited from the Balmain football club and played 10 games for Essendon in 1907. Marshall Herbert, a recruit from Redfern, was the most successful of these early Sydney recruits, as he played 51 games with the Pies from 1908 to 1910. At this stage it should be noted that the only major football code that competed with Australian football in Sydney for players was rugby union, as rugby league was not played in Sydney until 1908.\n\n1910s\n\nThe 1910s was a decade that resulted in the recruitment of two Sydneysiders who had a significant impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYERS: Bob Merrick and Chris Laird. Recruited from East Sydney, Merrick established a goal-kicking record for his adopted Victorian team of Fitzroy in 1919 when he kicked a total of 12 goals in a match. This feat of 12 goals in a match was never bettered by any other Fitzroy player in the history of that club. Bob headed Fitzroy\u2019s goalkicking list each year between 1919-22.\n\nThe other Sydneysider to have an impact in the big league during this decade was Chris Laird. He was recruited from the eastern suburbs club of Paddington and is one of the few players in the history of the game to live the dream of kicking a clutch goal in a grand final with just vital seconds remaining in the match. Laird changed the fortune of the 1918 VFL grand final when he kicked the winning goal for South Melbourne with less than a minute remaining in the match.\n\n1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw a twofold increase over the previous decade in the number of players from Sydney making the transition to the best Australian football competition in the land. Six Sydneysiders played in the VFL in the 1910s and as many as twelve Sydneysiders were recruited in the 1920s.\n\nFred Davies, who was another recruit from Sydney\u2019s Eastern Suburbs, was the pick of the\n\nSydney recruits in this decade. His most notable achievement was being named as the captain of Fitzroy in 1934. Nevertheless, few of the other Sydney players had a large impact during this decade.\n\n1930s\n\nTen players from Sydney made the transition to the VFL in the 1930s. The pick of the players was Newtown\u2019s Reg Garvin.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Reg Garvin\n\nBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,\n\nReg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in\n\n1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club. Reg GarvinBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,Reg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club.\n\n1940s\n\nThe 1940s was a decade in which there was a noticeable drop-off in the numbers of high quality players making their way from Sydney clubs to the VFL, obviously due to WWII. Ron Hall, from St George, was one of only two players recruited from Sydney to the VFL in the 1940s. The other player was Arthur Richardson, who played just five games for the Swans.\n\n1950s\n\nThe 1950s was another decade in which only a small number of Sydney players were recruited to the top league. One of the recruits, however, had a large impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Roger Duffy \u2013\n\nAnother Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). Roger Duffy \u2013Another Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951. He was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states. Duffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). His premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). 1960s\n\nThe 1960s was Sydney footballs lowest point in terms of the number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL. Barry Fitzgerald was the only player recruited directly from a Sydney club to the VFL during this decade. And he played just 35 games for Fitzroy. 1970s\n\nThe 1970s can be viewed as a decade of revival for football recruiting from Sydney. Whilst the 1960s was a low point in terms of player recruitment, the 1970s saw the recruitment of two stars of the game \u2013 Mark Marclure and Michael Byrne. STAR PLAYER:Mark Maclure\n\nMaclure played junior football for East Sydney and also won the Sanders Medal as the best player in Sydney\u2019s reserve grade competition as a 17 year old. From there he tried out with Carlton\u2019s under 19s team and was eventually lured to Carlton by their master recruiter Bert Deacon. Of all the players to have been recruited from Sydney, Mark Maclure is the player who can boast as having the greatest CV. On top of his list of achievements is being a member of three premiership teams (1979, 1981 and 1982). Maclure is the only player recruited from a Sydney football club to have played in as many as three VFL/AFL premiership teams. On top of this, he was the captain of his AFL club (in 1986), won his club\u2019s goal kicking award (1979 and 1985) and played over 200 games for his beloved Blues. STAR PLAYER: Michael Byrne\n\nMichael Byrne is Sydney born and raised, having come through the ranks of local Sydney football on the northern beaches and then playing for the Sydney club of North Shore. Byrne\u2019s induction into football was a tough one, as he played in the ruck for North Shore in the bloodbath Sydney grand final of 1976 at Trumper Park. This match was infamous in Sydney football for being punctuated by rolling brawls involving almost every player on the ground. After he left Sydney, Byrne became a premiership player with Hawthorn in 1983 and he produced on the big day, as he was the 2nd highest goal kicker for Hawthorn in the grand final after the legendary Leigh Matthews. Playing during Hawthorn\u2019s greatest era. Byrne also had the honour of being runner up for the club\u2019s best and fairest in 1984. 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of the Sydney Swans into the VFL competition and it was a decade in which there was a large upswing in the numbers of players recruited from Sydney. Only one player (1960s) and five players (1970s) made the transition to the top league in the two previous decades, but 11 players made the transition in the 1980s. Amongst these players was St George\u2019s Mark Roberts, who was a premiership player with North Melbourne in 1996. 1990s\n\nThe 1990s was a remarkable decade in terms of the contribution of Sydney footballers to the AFL. It was the starting point for the careers of three Sydneysiders who played over 200 games of AFL football. The three players from Sydney who pulled on the guernsey in over 200 games of AFL football were Mark McVeigh [pictured left] (Essendon), Lenny Hayes (St Kilda) and Greg Stafford (Sydney and Richmond). McVeigh and Hayes were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club and Greg Stafford was recruited from Western Suburbs. STAR PLAYER: Lenny Hayes\n\nHayes became the first player from Sydney to win the Norm Smith medal. His last quarter performance in the 2010 grand final for the Saints was one for the record books, as he willed his team back into the contest by obtaining 11 possessions as well as kicking an inspiring goal from 50 metres out.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Nick Davis\n\nNick Davis, recruited from Ramsgate juniors, didn\u2019t have the longevity of career that Hayes, McVeigh or Stafford had, but he produced one of the defining moments in finals history and arguably the Swan\u2019s greatest moment outside the 2005 grand final when he kicked four goals in the last quarter of the 2005 semi-final against Geelong. That blitz of goal turned the match around and secured the Swans a vital 3-point victory and the passage to a grand final victory. 2000s\n\nTwo exceptional footballers were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club in the 1990s (Lenny Hayes and Mark McVeigh), and the feat was replicated in the noughties, as two further Pennant Hills juniors of exceptional talent, Jarrad McVeigh and Kieran Jack, made their transition to the AFL. STAR PLAYER: Jarrad McVeigh\n\nMcVeigh won the Sydney Swan\u2019s best and fairest award in 2008. This was a noticeable feat as McVeigh became the first player to be recruited from a local Sydney football club to win the award. It took 26 years after the club started in Sydney for a Sydney local to win the award, yet it only took a further two years for the next Sydney local to win the award when Kieran Jack was deemed Sydney\u2019s best and fairest player in 2010. STAR PLAYER: Kieran Jack\n\nJack started his career for the Swans as a dogged tagger in 2007, yet it was only three years later that he won the club best and fairest award. Displaying unbridled determination, Kieran Jack won the award in 2010 largely because he had become a vital attacking option for the Swans. In his best and fairest year of 2010, Jack kicked 21 goals whilst still largely working in the midfield. In 2012, he is in contention for All-Australian selection as he continues to combine attacking flair with an ability to win the contested ball. Many may question if the introduction of the Swans has been a success, yet from a recruiting viewpoint for Sydneysiders it has been. Only one player from Sydney in the 80 years prior to the Swans introduction into the Sydney sporting landscape played over 200 games of top grade football. Since the Swans moved to Sydney there have been three 200 game players from Sydney . The players recruited from Sydney clubs in the years ahead will be following in the footsteps of exceptional footballers such as Roger Duffy, Michael Byrne, Lenny Hayes and the McVeigh brothers amongst others. Over the journey, the record of Sydneysiders at the top level is far better than what many would presume is the case\u201c there have been premiership players, club captains, club coaches, and best and fairest winners. Sydneysiders have achieved at the highest level of the Australian game, but just not with all the fanfare of players from other cities.

The clock carries a silver-plated plaque upon which are inscribed the following words;\n\nCARLTON FOOTBALL CLUB\n\nEqual Best & Fairest\n\n1947\n\nWon by\n\nBert Deacon\n\n\n\nThe inscription on the mantel clock.\n\nAccording to the Carlton Annual Report of that year, only the trophies to Deacon and Henfry were presented in that year, along with an award to Jack Bennett for Most Consistent Player.\n\nAs the then secretary Harry Bell reported: \u201cApart from the two above-mentioned trophies your Committee decided to suspend all other club awards, as in their opinion the 21 players in the Final games had contributed equally in bringing the flag to Carlton, and therefore they felt that all should share equally in the other trophies, with the result that at the Annual Meeting, each of the remaining 18 players will be presented with a trophy to mark the winning of the premiership\u201d.\n\nFor almost 60 years, the clock sat on the mantelpiece in the loungeroom of the Deacon family home at 146 Wood Street, Preston. According to Bert\u2019s son Bob, \u201cthe clock was there from the time Dad and Mum built the house in 1950 until the day we moved after Mum died about seven years ago\u201d.\n\n\n\nDeacon's mantel clock.\n\nIn clearing the house after the death of their mother Jean, Bob and his older brother Brian resolved to share items with family friends. An old friend of Jean\u2019s from Kerang was given the mantel clock, but recently on-sold it to a dealer in Moonee Ponds. The dealer then arranged for the clock to go under the hammer through an auctioneer in Woodend last Sunday, by which time the Deacon boys were alerted.\n\n\u201cYou give the item away in good faith and you don\u2019t think any more of it \u2013 and then you get an email the Friday before the sale with an image of the mantel clock in the auction room,\u201d Bob said.\n\n\u201cBrian and I weren\u2019t happy that the item had ended up in an auction house and we initially thought the clock might have been stolen until we did a bit of investigating. The auctioneer to his credit was going to withdraw the item until it was determined the clock hadn\u2019t been stolen so I then instructed him to bid on the Deacon family\u2019s behalf, and it\u2019s such a relief that the item is now back with the family.\u201d\n\nFrom 1942, Bert Deacon represented the Carlton Football Club in 106 senior matches through a ten-year career interrupted by war. On January 3, 1974, he died of a heart attack in Balnarring, and at the time of his death officiated as Carlton secretary.\n\n\n\nThe famous Bert Deacon in action for Carlton.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Bert\u2019s prized football artefacts have been lost to the Deacons. The coveted Brownlow Medal was stolen from Jean\u2019s purse (together with her father\u2019s war medals) in a kitchen break-in while she was gardening out the front of the Wood Street home. None of the medals were ever recovered, and a Brownlow replica is now in the keep of Brian\u2019s son.\n\nBob proudly protects the VFL certificate awarded to his father for winning the prized football trophy \u2013 and now the mantel clock.\n\nSo what will become of the item? According to Bob, it will be offered as a perpetual trophy to the winner of the Bert Deacon Golf Day tournament, which has been held at Flinders on the Wednesday between Christmas and New Year since 1950.\n\n\u201cIf the golf day folds, the clock will again be returned to the family,\u201d Bob said.\n\n\u201cBut for as long as it\u2019s in circulation, Dad will be remembered.\u201d"}]}
