That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/cooke-hope-1940", "page_content": "Citation styles\n\nEncyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nWithin the \u201cCite this article\u201d tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.

Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html", "page_content": "Hope's loneliness and confusion grow over the years, and so does her spiritual quest. Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/13/archives/hope-cooke-assails-india-over-sikkim.html", "page_content": "The former Hope Cooke, the American\u2010born Queen of Sikkim, who left her husband and the palace in the Himalayan kingdom in July, 1973, and returned to New York, has issued a statement \u201cappealing to India for the safety of my husband and family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an act of colonialism, violating solemn treaties, India has seized the ancient and peaceful land of Sikkim,\u201d she said in a statement Friday night. \u201cIndian troops have attacked the residence of the chief of state in a bloody assault and are now holding him prisoner.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the legislature in Sikkim voted to abolish the monarchy and seek full statehood in India.

The inflexible codes of behaviors as outlined for women in Brahmanical texts were also responsible for the low status of women in India.

INTRODUCTION\n\nSikkim, a small and beautiful state nested in the Himalayas is a landlocked state bounded on 3 sides by the international border Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal in the North-East, East and West respectively and south by the Darjeeling district of West Bengal. It has a total population of 540851 (according to the 2001 Census) of which 47% are female. The Himalayan state of Sikkim became part of Indian Union in 1975 as a 22nd state. It has a total area of 7096 square km[1] which is the smallest compare to the other adjoining states of the Himalayas its has a total population of 6,10,5772 persons out of which 47.09% consist of women population(Census; 2011).\n\nIt\u2019s clear that women are lesser in number compare to men, which also makes them to be in a minority group[2]. Throughout the world the women group has been widely subjugated and excluded from political, social and economic sphere, in which Sikkim is no such exception. On the other hand, it is to be elucidated beyond the two self-explanatory words, \u2018Women Empowerment\u2019[3] refers to complete emancipation of women from socio-economic shackles of dependency and deprivations, \u2018to give strength and confidence\u2019 to realize an individual \u2018potential and capabilities\u2019. Apart from the various facets of women empowerment that needs to be addressed for a rounded out development are listed here they are as follows:\n\nHuman Right or Individual Rights\n\nSocial Empowerment of Women\n\nEducational Empowerment of Women\n\nEconomic and Occupational Freedom\n\nEmpowerment through Legal Knowledge\n\nPolitical Empowerment of Women\n\nEmpowerment \u201cimplies the equal distribution of power between those who have more power and who have less power\u201d[4]. The term also denotes increased control over the lives, bodies and environment that is in decision making, economic self reliance, legal rights to inheritance, equal treatment and protection against social discrimination (Kishore; 2004 in Dighe and Wadhwaniya; 3013) In past Sikkim under monarchy had no schemes to empower he local women they had no roles to play in major decision making process, the old law gave no rights to women it was basically about the men and the king. However women played an active role in agricultural, household activities etc., along with male members and some cases contributed more than male members but were confined to private sphere when it came to public sphere in lowest level like village meetings.\n\nIn that manner, it becomes important to critically study the role of women, their status in Sikkimese society and also to analyze their pursuit towards empowerment with the aid of state intervention in one hand and themselves in the other. In which former provides a platform by being a facilitator for the latter.\n\nII. PAST WOMEN POSITION: POLITICIAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EXCLUSION\n\nWomen\u2019s relative status, however, varied from one ethnic group to another. Their social position in the State seems to be better than that in the rest of the country. At the economic, social, ritual, religious and political levels the women have equal rights with the men as claimed. A woman is considered to be an asset in the household and commands a bride price, but she has no rights of inheritance. It is only when a daughter remains unmarried that parents customarily transferring some property to her. The status of women in Sikkim \u2013 their economic contribution, socio-cultural autonomy, authority, involvement in the decision-making process within the household \u2013 varies across communities. The practice of polyandry among tribal communities could be one of the variables explaining the higher value attached to women. Similarly, local religious practice also plays a role in influencing the states of women (Dhamala, 1985). During the monarchical period most parts of state was controlled by the landlords (the Kazis) who \u201cacted as a barons\u201d[5] in order to collect taxes for king and rule with an iron grip where no women hold the post of landlords and neither in the kings ministry and the people had to suffer the atrocities in the form of forced labour (Sinha 2008) especially peasant women they were utilized for pleasure by the landlords with the aid of its henchmen. Socially they were exploited and legally they didn\u2019t have any right.\n\nHowever, with the help and support of Chogyal king Palden Thndup Namgyal along with his American Queen Hope Cook who started to endorse the national identity of Sikkim in International level and which made the two Sikkimese women i.e. Gayatri Devi Gurung and Chum Dorji Wangmo, travelled to Manila to attend a conference on women\u2019s leadership organized by the Associated Country of the Women World where they represented the Sikkim social welfare society where they displayed items like Sikkimese national flag, thanka (religious painting), booklets about Sikkimese historical background etc[6]. On the other hand such initiatives bring a little impact on Sikkimese community and bring a positive impact in future. However, after such development in the year 1969 suddenly \u2018Sikkim Durbar on 15th March commenced a proclamation of scrapping Sikkimese citizenship from women who marries outsiders[7] (non-sikkimese). One of the victims of such proclamation was Ruth Karthak Lepchani who was debarred from her ancient property/asset, simply because she married non-sikkimese (Indian male) who belongs to Muslim Community. Though she revolted against that by forming a political party i.e. Sikkim Independent Front in 1966. But the Sikkim Government alleged her of spreading rumours against the King (Himalayan Observers in Basnet: 1974). Later, she was forced to leave the kingdom and never in her life to return to her birth place. Therefore, the above cited incident clearly marked that women were dominated and barred politically, economically and socially during monarchy. After the proclamation has been issued by the Durbar for general public from that day onwards women had no rights over property inheritance legally, which was the major gust to the women community. Thus, it was social injustice in the form of gender inequality.\n\nPaljor Namgyal Girls School was started by the Scotland Missionary to educate girls in 1968 but there were only eleven (11) girls in metric who mostly belong to the town and no such opportunities were available in villages (Savatri Rai: 2011). That\u2019s why in the sphere of eduction literacy among women was very low as compare to boys in Sikkimese society. while in PNG, Tashi Namgyal Academy school where at town had ample of students who enrolled for primary education. The enrolment of girl child in education were very low as many would dropout or due to early marriage so once they get married they didn\u2019t have any chance to continue their studies. That time the state didn\u2019t have open school for such married girls where they could have easily continued their further studies. During the year 1996 United Nations, Sustainable Development Department of Food and Agriculture Organization (FOA) conduct a report on Gender in Development and Socio economic relations in Sikkim which found that the women condition in Sikkim was poor where higher education for boys child was preferred more than the girls, and the reason for that was required household work, taking care of siblings and early marriage (Sikkim Development Report 2003). Due to the old law of Sikkim property inheritance for women was limited especially when she marries an outsider and there was a notable gap between urban educated women and their rural counterparts, and the relative opportunities available to each other[8].\n\nIII. PRESENT SCENARIO\n\nWomen constitute nearly 47 per cent of the total population of Sikkim. Compared to other parts of the country, the social position of women in Sikkim is better. Fortunately still now the instances of female infanticide or dowry related deaths have not been reported[9]. Women\u2019s participation in decision -making process is more than most of the other states in India. Even their number in government services is greater than that of Sikkimese men (Lama: 2001). In the year 1990\u2019s series of women empowerment policies was initiated by the government to improve, to uplift the status of women from the grass root level. Like \u2018Small Family Scheme\u2019 which encourage women to delay in early marriage and continue their studies. Not only that the policy provides an incentive of Rs 2,000 if she marries after the completion of 21 years, an additional incentive of Rs 5,00 if she marries at the age of 22 and if she marries at the age of 23, an additional incentive of Rs 1,000 is paid to her. So far the said scheme has covered over 1,200 children (Lama: 2001).\n\nWomen constitute nearly 47 per cent of the total population in Sikkim. Sikkim\u2019s sex ratio (the number of females per 1,000 males) which had been declining between 1931\u201318 has begun to show improvement over the past three decades. In 2011, there were 889 women for every 1,000 men in Sikkim. Sikkim\u2019s work participation rate is almost 51 per cent. While the figure for males in Sikkim is 60 per cent as against the national figure of 53 per cent, the female work participation rate at 40 per cent is much higher than the national average of around 26 per cent. There has been a shift in the occupational trends for both men and women. With the enhancement of educational opportunities and opening up of employment avenues in the state, the dependence on the primary sector has decreased drastically over the past forty years. The state government has been promoting rural livelihoods by creatively investing in ecotourism, organic farming, and a host of other potentially high-income generating activities. Availing these new opportunities, rural women are now increasingly involved in income-generating activities like food processing, trading agricultural products, handicrafts and weaving. In urban areas, women are making their mark in new fields such as consultancy, marketing, interior decoration, beauty clinics, handicraft, food processing and readymade garments. Notwithstanding this occupational diversification, agriculture continues to be the main source of employment for women 59 per cent of women workers are engaged in agriculture-related work where earnings are typically low and uncertain. Women have also benefited in terms of greater employment opportunities from the emergence of developmental projects and the expansion of the private sector. Women are also actively undertaking entrepreneurial roles. Under a new scheme of the state government \u201cEducated Women Unemployed Co-operative Society\u201d (EWUCS) administered by the Department of Co-operative Societies, women are venturing into the field of contract work and construction. At the same time, rural women are actively participating in employment provided by MGNREGA as indicated by the fact that the state has a total of 163,593 enrolled workers, out of which 53 per cent are men and 47 per cent women. The participation of rural women in self-help groups (SHGs) under the Swarna Jayanti Grameen Swarozgar Yojana is also commendable and outscores the participation of men. Of the total SHGs formed till January 2012, 72 per cent are all-women SHGs.\n\nGovernment jobs: \u2013 The state government has a provision of 30 per cent reservation for women in posts and services to be filled by direct recruitment under the state government and public sector undertakings. This has certainly benefitted the educated women of Sikkim in gaining socio-economic empowerment, which is instrumental in achieving gender equality. However, women continue to be under-represented at the highest levels of bureaucracy. Overall, in spite of reservation, women represent only 21 per cent of total officers in the Groups A and B category. The general trend, however, indicates that steadily women are coming out of traditional shackles and embracing the emerging opportunities open to them.\n\nPanchayat and Municipal Corporation:- Sikkim, one of the youngest states in the Indian Union, has made a slow yet steady progress in terms of the political participation of women. The stipulated reservation of one-third seats for women in Panchayats was increased to 40 per cent, and later enhanced to 50 per cent in 2011. The percentage of women in Panchayats, which increased from 36% in 2005 to 42% in 2010\u201311, has gone up to 52% after the 2012 elections. The zilla Panchayat figures indicate a similar trend. These numbers suggest that the process of democratic decentralization has begun in a fair manner in Sikkim. However, political empowerment in the real sense is far from complete.\n\nFemale (education) literacy rate: \u2013 Education plays an important role in advancing women\u2019s freedom and enhancing their position in society. Over the past 30 years, women in Sikkim have witnessed phenomenal changes in their literacy profile. In both rural and urban areas, the female literacy rates are higher than the national average. Female literacy rates more than tripled from 22% in 1981 to 76% in 2011.\n\nPolicies of Government: \u2013 The Government of Sikkim has introduced various policies, plans and programmes for improving the status of women and empowering them. The state established the \u2018State Commission for Women\u2019 (SCW) as a statutory body under the State Commission for Women Act, 2001 to safeguard the rights and legal entitlements of women. It began implementing the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act in 2007. The Act is aimed at providing speedy solutions to the victims of domestic violence by involving protection officers and voluntary organizations as service providers. The state government has appointed eight legal providers who are working towards protecting the rights and interests of women by providing of legal, medical, financial and other forms of assistance under the provisions of the Act. Also implemented and enforced are the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006; the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 as amended up to Act No. 44 of 1986; the Sikkim Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Rules, 1990; the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961); and the Implementation of Pre-natal Diagnostic Technique (PNDT) Regulation and Prevention of Misuse Act, 1996. In line with the Supreme Court\u2019s Vishaka Guidelines, the state government has made it mandatory to set up complaint cells against sexual harassment in all government departments and institutions as well as in private organizations. Similarly, the Women and Child Development Division of the Social Justice, Empowerment and Welfare Department has adopted various strategies for empowering women through education and awareness generation. Training programmes have been set up for women in floriculture, knitting, tailoring and beautician courses. Two working women hostels (Deorali and Namchi) have been established to provide secure and economical accommodation to working women in the state. The state has introduced a Short Stay Home Scheme for the welfare of distressed women.\n\nIn the domestic sphere though Sikkimese society is not known for women domination in the form of dowry, sati, female infanticide etc. But there is usually presence of Domestic Violence and Violence against women by the study conducted by Society for Promotion of Art, Culture, Education and Environment Excellence (SPACE)[10] which highlights \u201cthat 50 percent of women are tattered by men and almost 4.8 percent by their in laws/relatives with the approval of their husband\u201d (SPACE; 2002) and according to their research strongly recommended for the constitution of body (Government and NGO\u2019s) which will guarantee protection of women from domestic violence. There are various milestones which show the empowerment of women in Sikkimese society. Like the formation of Nayuma Women\u2019s Cooperative Society (NWCS) was one of the major milestones in the empowerment of women in Sikkim. And it became the first women cooperative in Sikkim which has women members belonging to the urban and rural areas. It is pro women society which and their end is to benefit the women of Sikkim by employing educated and uneducated women of urban and rural areas. Another milestone is in the form of NGO Mamtalaya situated at Tadong, East Sikkim, actively participated in protecting women in distress and provide short stay home which works as a rehabilitation centre and runs side by side with Sikkim State Commission for Women. Therefore, such body\u2019s provides a platform where women empowerment in social sphere is assured. Such positive attitude of women community in Sikkimese society promises better scope for social capital[11] in building mutual trust and cooperation in achieving common goals providing positive effect in the society. Further, paving way for women community to their quest towards empowerment.\n\nDespite the main gains there are few areas of concern regarding women position in Sikkimese society. There are three predominant communities in Sikkim like, Nepalese ethnicity largerly Hindu, whereas the Bhutia ethnicity and the Lepchas are predominantly Buddhists. In spite of the extension of Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 in Sikkim, the Bhutias and Lepchas of Sikkim are still governed and guided by their customary laws with respect to succession, inheritance, and marriage. Like Sikkimese Nepalese, the social systems of Sikkimese Bhutias and Lepchas have a patriarchal structure. All property, both movable and immovable, belongs to the father or male head of the family. Women have no legal rights in the family property, except their personal belongings and ornaments. Bhutia and Lepcha women may, however, acquire property by way of gift or under a will from their fathers or other relations. Under the Married Women Property Regulations Act, 1962, if Bhutia or Lepcha women marry outside their community, they shall surrender their rights to such property.[12] The Sikkim Succession Act, 2008 is progressive to the extent that it gives unmarried daughters the right of inheritance to an equal share in the father\u2019s property along with the sons and wife. According to the Act: \u2018When a male Sikkimese who dies having at the time of his death an interest in the property or has self acquired property, the property shall devolve to the extent of his interest by survivorship upon the surviving members of his family which includes his wife, sons and daughters if unmarried in equal proportion\u2019. On the other hand, the Act reinforces traditional practices of inheritance by stating that: \u2018Where female heir or descendent marries a person who does not possess Sikkim Subject Certificate/COI or has acquired foreign citizenship, such female heir/ descendent shall follow the personal law of her husband and as such shall not acquire any interest in the property\u2019. Similarly, in the case of divorced women, the Act says: \u2018An abandoned or divorced woman having liability to take care of the children and has no source of income, shall have the right to a share in equal proportion along with other heirs to the property as per the law provided that where woman has deserted her husband with or without children and has remarried shall forfeit her right to her share in the husband\u2019s property\u2019. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports show that crime against women in Sikkim is relatively low, numbering 48 cases and accounting for a mere 0.02 per cent of the total cases of the country in 2008, which is also the lowest among the north-eastern states. The figure for 2009 shows the lowest number of cases (41) of crime against women in Sikkim among all the states in India.[13] According to another recent survey by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 16 per cent women in Sikkim are victims of domestic violence. One in every six women in Sikkim has experienced spousal sexual violence. Among women in the age group of 15\u201349 years in Sikkim, 19 per cent have experienced physical violence, while 4 per cent have experienced sexual violence. In all, 21 per cent women have experienced sexual and physical violence, including 22 per cent of married women. The Report states that women whose husbands consume alcohol and get drunk are much more likely to experience violence. Only 32 per cent[14] of women who have experienced violence have sought help. Almost three out of five women have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence. Abused women most often seek help from their own families and friends. The Family Counselling Centre (FCC) run by a non-governmental organization, the Association of Social Health in India (ASHI) and the State Social Welfare Board (SSWB) is an active organization working for women\u2019s rights in the state. The victims generally come to the centre with complaints like adultery, torture and harassment by husbands and in-laws, desertion by husband, and alcohol-related maltreatment.\n\nIn wrapping up, women in Sikkim have a relatively better position as compared to their national counterparts and have benefitted, especially in the last decade, from educational and livelihood opportunities provided by the state government. However, as Sikkim strives for gender equality, there are certain areas of concern. A majority of women in Sikkim still have little respite from the drudgery of agricultural work. They continue to be under-represented in the highest levels of bureaucracy and in the legislative assembly. They also have a long way to go in getting an equal share in property and decision-making in public spheres. There is a need for an interventionist policy and a systematic onslaught against this social malady. Effective implementation of women-related programmes and legislations needs to be ensured in Sikkim. Proper awareness regarding their rights and privileges and access to information among women will help further accelerate gender equality and promote gender justice in the State.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWomen of Sikkim over the years have changed significantly due to global flow of ideas and cultural interactions which is driven by communication, technological revolution and with flourishing tourism and cooperative society. At the same time there is strong initiative from the state government in bringing change in the grass roots levels to empower the women.\n\nThe journey of women in the state of Sikkim has both highs and lows though they have not suffered as much as their counterparts in rest of India still gender inequality persist in the form of women property inheritance, domestic violence, a women cannot be pipon \u201cvillage head\u201d in north district of Sikkim where traditional system of governance \u201cZumsa\u201d exist. It needs more responsible women cooperative society and caring Mamtalaya in rural parts of state and more state intervention in gender issue for empowerment of women. Lastly Sikkimese women are in progress to reach real empowerment which should come out from women itself helping in their quest of real empowerment.\n\nV.

That indeed it is. Even today, there are only around 6,50,000 people living in the state. However, much less known about Sikkim to the rest of India - and also the world - is the exceptionally steady and silent progress in improving the lives of ordinary people that the state has recorded over the past two decades.\n\nHow did Sikkim achieve this? The obvious answer is that Sikkim, like many countries in the world, has ensured that policies that promote economic opportunities go hand-in-hand with policies that ensure an equitable expansion of health, education, nutrition and essential basic social services.\n\nLess obvious is the critical role of political leadership in ensuring improvements in the lives of people. Ensuring that the additional tax revenues from economic growth are invested in expanding human capabilities does not happen automatically. Chief Minister Pawan Chamling - the longest serving Chief Minister of any Indian state - has prioritized investments in health, education and infrastructure like no other political leader has. After all, ensuring adequate funds for the social sectors is as much a function of the funds available as it is of making it a political priority. Very few political leaders in India and elsewhere recognize the importance of investing in people as Chamling does.\n\nWhat goes even more unnoticed is the role that women have played in Sikkim's development success. Traditionally women have enjoyed greater freedom in Sikkim than in many other parts of the country. The Sikkim Human Development Report revealed that the state had the best gender parity performance among the northeastern states, with female labour force participation at 40 per cent, much higher than the national average of around 26 per cent. In recent times, with the support of the state, they have played an active role in various spheres of life.\n\nSikkim's women have exercised leadership by taking advantage of the available educational and development opportunities. This is revealed by the progress on multiple indicators from NFHS 3 to NFHS 4 recorded by Sikkim. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4), 41 per cent women in the state have 10 or more years of schooling - much better than the country's average of 36 per cent. Only 15 per cent women, age 20-24 years, were married before age of 18 years as against the national average of 27 per cent. There are only 3 per cent teenage pregnancies in the state placing Sikkim as the best among the northeastern states. The infant mortality rate in the state is 30 against national average of 34. Sikkim has improved its performance with regard to safe delivery remarkably by 43 per cent points from NFHS 3 to 97 per cent in NFHS 4, the best in northeastern states.\n\nSikkim, along with Meghalaya, occupies the top two positions in the best performing region of Northeast on women's empowerment index comprising of participation of women in household decisions, ownership of land, cell phones and bank account, and instances of spousal violence.\n\nWomen in Sikkim are more empowered to take decisions than women in other parts of the country. According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, 85 per cent women have the freedom of movement, including to market, health facility and places outside the village or community compared to national average. Almost all (95 per cent) of currently married women in Sikkim participate in household decisions as against national average of 84 per cent. Nearly 80 per cent women in the state have mobile phones for personal use against 46 per cent at the national level. Close to two-thirds (64 per cent) of women in Sikkim - as against just over half 953 per cent) of women across India - have a bank or savings account that they themselves operate. Only 3 per cent ever married women have ever experience spousal violence as against 29 percent nationally - the lowest across Indian states.\n\nSikkim has, however, many things to worry about. This includes creating jobs for its young people within the state, improving the quality of education, protecting residents from natural disasters, expanding infrastructure and so on. Equally worrisome is the sharp decline in total fertility rate (TFR) - 1.2 in 2015-16 - which is well below the replacement level of 2.1. This sharp decline in TFR might have also contributed to the worsening of the female-to-male ratio at birth from 984 in 205-06 to 809 in 2015-16.\n\nThe reduced TFR is not good news as it may result in an age-structural transformation wherein Sikkim, like Kerala, will have to address the challenges of an aging population. This could get manifested in the short supply of workers as well as a further decline in the sex ratio. With shrinking active labour force, Sikkim's economy could experience loss in economic output and possibly a decline in income levels. There could also be an increase in the elderly dependency ratio and morbidity levels on account of a rise in non-communicable diseases. Sikkim will have to mobilize the resources needed to extend financial support of the elderly and make provisions to address, in particular, their health care needs. It will also have to deal with the challenge of declining fertility rates.\n\nThese challenges may not come as a surprise to the political leadership in Sikkim. They should not given how well Chief Minister Chamling and the executive are connected the people. Given the track record, it may be safe to predict that Sikkim might be the first Indian state to offer solutions to the rest of India - and the world."}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/Hope_Cooke", "page_content": "American wife of the last king of Sikkim (born 1940) Template:SHORTDESC:American wife of the last king of Sikkim (born 1940)\n\nHope Cooke (born June 24, 1940) was the \"Gyalmo\" (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f0b, Wylie: rgyal mo) (Queen Consort) of the 12th Chogyal (King) of Sikkim, Palden Thondup Namgyal.[1] Their wedding took place in March 1963. She was termed Her Highness The Crown Princess of Sikkim and became the Gyalmo of Sikkim at Palden Thondup Namgyal's coronation in 1965.[2]\n\nPalden Thondup Namgyal eventually was the last king of Sikkim as a protectorate state under India. By 1973, both the country and their marriage were crumbling; soon Sikkim was merged into India. Five months after the takeover of Sikkim had begun, Cooke returned to the United States with her two children and stepdaughter to enroll them in schools in New York City. Cooke and her husband divorced in 1980; Namgyal died of cancer in 1982.[3]\n\nCooke wrote an autobiography, Time Change (Simon & Schuster 1981) and began a career as a lecturer, book critic, and magazine contributor, later becoming an urban historian. In her new life as a student of New York City, Cooke published Seeing New York (Temple University Press 1995); worked as a newspaper columnist (Daily News); and taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Birch Wathen, a New York City private school.[4]\n\nEarly life and family\n\nCooke was born in San Francisco to John J. Cooke, a flight instructor, and Hope Noyes, an amateur pilot. She was raised in the Episcopal Church.[5] Her mother, Hope Noyes, died in January 1942 at age 25 when the plane she was flying solo crashed.[6][7]\n\nAfter her mother's death, Cooke and her half-sister, Harriet Townsend, moved to a New York City apartment across the hall from their maternal grandparents, Helen (Humpstone) and Winchester Noyes, the president of J. H. Winchester & Co., an international shipping brokerage firm. They were raised by a succession of governesses.[6] Her grandfather died when she was 12, her grandmother, three years later. Cooke became the ward of her aunt and uncle, Mary Paul (Noyes) and Selden Chapin, a former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. She studied at the Chapin School in New York and attended the Madeira School for three years before finishing high school in Iran.[8]\n\nMarriage to the Crown Prince of Sikkim\n\nThe King and Queen of Sikkim (1966)\n\nIn 1959, Cooke was a freshman majoring in Asian Studies at Sarah Lawrence College and sharing an apartment with actress Jane Alexander. She went on a summer trip to India and met Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim, in the lounge[9] of the Windamere Hotel in Darjeeling, India. He was a recent widower with two sons and a daughter and, at age 36. They were drawn to each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. Two years later, in 1961, their engagement was announced, but the wedding was put off for more than a year because astrologers in both Sikkim and India warned that 1962 was an inauspicious year for marriages.[1]\n\nOn March 20, 1963, Cooke married Namgyal in a Buddhist monastery in a ceremony performed by fourteen lamas. Wedding guests included members of Indian royalty, Indian and Sikkimese generals, and the US Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith.[1] Cooke renounced her United States citizenship as required by Sikkim's laws and also as a demonstration to the people of Sikkim that she was not an \"American arm\" in the Himalayas.[10] She was dropped from the Social Register but the marriage was reported in National Geographic magazine. The New Yorker followed the royal couple on one of their yearly trips to the United States.[1] Although her husband was Buddhist, Cooke did not officially convert from Christianity to Buddhism though she had practiced Buddhism from an early age (Henry Kissinger once remarked \"she has become more Buddhist than the population\").[11][12][5] Namgyal was crowned monarch of Sikkim on April 4, 1965. However, their marriage faced strains, and both had affairs: he with a married Belgian woman, and she with an American friend.[1][6]\n\nAt the same time, Sikkim was under strain due to annexation pressures from India. Crowds marched on the palace against the monarchy.[13] Cooke's husband was deposed on April 10, 1975 and confined to his palace under house arrest.[14] The couple soon separated. Cooke returned to Manhattan, where she raised her children, Palden and Hope Leezum.[15] In May 1975, Representative James W. Symington (D-MO) and Senator Mike Mansfield (D-MT) sponsored private bills to restore her citizenship;[16] however, after the bill passed the Senate, several members of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration objected, and the bill had to be amended to grant her only U.S. permanent resident status before it could gain their support and pass Congress.[10][17][18] President Gerald Ford signed the bill into law on June 16, 1976.[19][20] By 1981 she still had not been able to regain U.S. citizenship.[21] The royal couple divorced in 1980, and Namgyal died of cancer in 1982 in New York City.[22][23][24][25][26]\n\nLater life\n\nWith child support from Namgyal and an inheritance from her grandparents, Cooke rented an apartment in the Yorkville area of New York City.

Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/18/archives/hope-cooke-from-queen-of-sikkim-to-regular-new-yorker.html", "page_content": "\u201cI am no longer in a state of suspense,\u201d Mrs. Namgyal said, brushing her short, reddish\u2010brown hair out of her eves. \u201cI know now that we will be able to stay here and we just want to get on with our lives.\u201d\n\nYesterday she was wearing a chocolate\u2010colored T\u2010shirt, white cotton slacks and canvas espadrilles.

Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://www.historyofroyalwomen.com/the-royal-women/last-gyalmo-sikkim-hope-cooke/", "page_content": "\u201cThe Fairytale Turned Nightmare?\u201d reads the headline of the New York Times from May 1981 referencing to a lesser known American woman who married into a royal family. That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university.

My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last.

Now the war of 1965 and the arrival of Hope Cooke, the new queen of Sikkim, had thrown the relationship between India and Sikkim into a flux, and China was waiting to exploit the weaknesses.\n\nIn 1964, Palden Thondup, the Chogyal, had married Hope Cooke in a glamorous royal wedding in the Himalayas. The western world was enamoured by the fairy-tale romance between Hope, a young all-American girl from Brooklyn, and the royal from Sikkim. Their wedding had all the ingredients of a Hollywood romance. Hope was compared to Grace Kelly, the film actress who had married the king of Monaco.\n\nThe wedding was a high-profile event that drew ambassadors from nine nations, including the newly appointed US ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith. The list of dignitaries was long and included Indian leaders, bureaucrats and key socialites of Sikkim. Indira Gandhi was one of the attendees. Hope Cooke had put the obscure, tiny Buddhist kingdom on the world map. But Hope would also cause the unsettling of India\u2013Sikkim relations, perhaps instigated in no small measure by China.\n\nIn 1962, when China and India were at war, Hope, whom Palden Thondup was then courting, had written a cheque to the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s Defence Fund.\n\nThe war of 1962 was an outcome of differences between India and China over the boundary they shared, which excluded the border involving Sikkim. At that time, the war completely bypassed Sikkim since China was also consciously cultivating support amongst the Sikkim royals.\n\nIndia did not take kindly to China\u2019s interactions with the royals. An increasingly aggressive and expansionist China, which had taken over Tibet, was suspected to have its sight on Sikkim and there were concerns that a military thrust could follow a brief diplomatic parry. When Tashi Namgyal, Palden\u2019s reclusive father, passed away in December 1963, an official note of condolence arrived for Palden Thondup from Peking. Similarly, when Palden was crowned as the king in 1965, Zhou Enlai was among the first leaders to congratulate him. On both occasions, India did not take to the gestures kindly.\n\nIn 1965, the stand-off between the Chinese and Indians at the Sikkim-Tibet border had ironically resulted in increasing tensions between India and Sikkim. As India\u2019s protectorate, Sikkim\u2019s defence was in Delhi\u2019s hands. But Delhi\u2019s statement saying that it would not allow China to violate \u201cIndia\u2019s border\u201d had bothered the Chogyal. On the advice of Nari Rustomji, the Indian political officer and his dewan, the king issued a statement reiterating Sikkim\u2019s independent identity in the dispute between India and China.\n\nHope did not believe in shrouding her opinions in diplomatic tact and publicly aired her disenchantment about the treatment Sikkim got from the Indian government. She felt India\u2019s statement was typical of the arrogance that India had shown towards Sikkim until then.\n\nThe princess attracted ire from the Indian establishment as she rapidly grew into an advocate of greater autonomy for Sikkim. While China and India traded accusations, Hope Cooke and her sister-in-law, Coocoola, decided to vent to the media in the UK. While the two women had their personal differences, they bonded over their dislike for India and the way it had undermined Sikkim\u2019s identity during the 1965 war.\n\nCoocoola would tell Hope, \u201cThey [Indians] are calling Sikkim an area of India and talking about the border as the India-China border. The nerve. We\u2019ve got to stop this. We\u2019ve got to remind people of Sikkim\u2019s identity before it gets lost.\u201d But unable to garner support for her cause in London, Hope returned to Sikkim disillusioned.\n\nPolitics and war weren\u2019t the only things getting her down. Her life in the kingdom was unhappy and friendless. Her marriage was a strained mess as a result of her husband\u2019s philandering ways which left Hope depressed and lonely.\n\nAs the distance between the Gyalmo and the Chogyal widened, the one person in Gangtok who was a bright spot for Hope was their friend Sagat Singh.\n\nThe royal couple had grown close to the general since he was posted in the kingdom and would meet him often in the evenings. Hope found solace in Sagat\u2019s company and occasionally found herself flirting with him. Interestingly, though Hope and Sagat shared vastly divergent views on the India-China-Sikkim situation, the friendship between the general and the royals continued to grow despite the stand-off with China at the Sikkim border during the 1965 war.\n\nHope and Sagat had divergent views on the India-China-Sikkim situation. Hope believed that the Indian government overplayed the Chinese threat, using it as a pretext to deny Sikkim its political freedom and true identity. Sagat, who headed the Indian state\u2019s military forces deployed in Sikkim, felt that the Chinese presence across the border was an imminent threat to Sikkim and the surrounding Indian territory, which needed to be countered militarily. Their differing perceptions, however, did not affect their friendship.\n\nHope found the general to be wickedly charming. Sagat\u2019s phone calls announcing his return to Gangtok from the field posts were a \u201csource of happiness\u201d for her. \u201cOur general\u201d, as she referred to him, was always around to help the couple. Once, when in Delhi, Hope received a desperate call from the Chogyal. Their son Palden was terribly ill. Within an hour, the general helped arrange a plane for Hope from Delhi to Siliguri, from where the Chogyal\u2019s car took her to Gangtok.\n\nWhen Hope finally arrived at the palace, the general was around with the Chogyal. Sagat remained a family friend: a military mate to Chogyal and a close companion to Hope. Sagat would invite her to the parties held by the local infantry battalions and the two would often spend quite a bit of time together.\n\nThe Chogyal was an honorary major general of 8 Gorkha Rifles, the regiment to which Sagat belonged, and had always felt at home with his officer mates from the Indian army such as Sagat and his senior, General Sam Manekshaw, who commanded the Eastern Command of the army.\n\nInterestingly, one day during the war, while his wife was expressing her unequivocal disapproval of the Indian government, the Chogyal, attired in his Indian army uniform, with the emblem of crossed Gorkha khukris pinned on the epaulettes on his shoulders, decided to appear for a media interview. \u201cOne\u2019s really not quite sure what they [China] want to do...I don\u2019t think they meant an all-out war, so one assumes it was really to tie down Indian troops in this part of the world from maybe going across to the Pakistani side.\u201d\n\nThe bonhomie that the royal couple shared with the military in Sikkim was in stark contrast to the bitterness with the civil administration. One of the reasons for the disenchantment of the royal couple with the Indian government \u2013 and the opening this created for China \u2013 was the lack of chemistry between the couple and the appointed civil services administrators sent to Sikkim. On the other hand, Hope and Thondup\u2019s relations with the army in Sikkim remained those of mutual respect. Hope later wrote in her autobiography that the Indian army was largely respectful towards the people of Sikkim, which endeared the locals towards them.\n\nExcerpted with permission from Watershed 1967: India\u2019s Forgotten Victory Over China, Probal Dasgupta, Juggernaut Books."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/16/archives/hope-cooke-separated-from-the-king-of-sikkim-is-living-on-the-east.html", "page_content": "Hope Cooke, the Sarah Lawrence debutante who became the Queen of Sikkim in the Himalayas, has left her husband, the King, and is living almost unnoticed on Manhattan's East Side.\n\nMiss Cooke, 33 years old, has been separated from King Palden Thondup Namgyal, 49, since last July. \u201cShe was unhappy here and so she left,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nMiss Cooke, whose marriage was an international event in March, 1963, has enrolled her two children in a private school here.

They might need someone to speak for them.\n\nAn advocate is someone who speaks up for others. An advocate might find information, go to meetings as a support person, or write letters for another person.\n\nYou can be an advocate for your child.\n\nAdvocating for your child\n\nIf you think your child is at risk of harm, isn\u2019t having their needs met, or is being denied their rights, you might need to advocate for them.\n\nYou know and understand your child better than anyone else. If people are making decisions for and about your child, you can help to make sure these decisions are in your child\u2019s best interests.\n\nIf you need to, you can get support from other people to help you advocate for your child. You could ask a family member, friend, volunteer or professional advocate to help you.\n\nHow to advocate for your child: steps\n\nStep 1: understand the issue\n\nMake sure you have a clear understanding of the issue your child is facing. For example, your child\u2019s school might be having difficulty managing your child\u2019s behaviour. So the school has decided that your child can\u2019t take part in the learn to swim program.\n\nStep 2: think about what you want for your child\n\nThinking about your child\u2019s needs will help you decide what you want for your child. It\u2019s important to keep an open mind because there might be solutions that you haven\u2019t thought of. Try to get plenty of information so that you can make an informed decision about what to do. You could ask other people what they think.\n\nFor example, you might want your child to take part in the learn to swim program. Or you might want extra supervision while your child is at the program.\n\nStep 3: present a solution\n\nPresenting a solution is more effective than complaining. For example, you might say, \u2018If my child\u2019s behaviour continues to be a problem, I could come to the learn to swim program to help supervise\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider whether your solution might have negative consequences for your child. For example, if you went to the program to supervise, would your child be embarrassed?\n\nAnd you could think about timing. For example, would it be better for your child take part in the learn to swim program now or do it next term instead?\n\nAdvocating for your child: tips\n\nKnow your child\u2019s rights\n\nYou\u2019ll be more effective as an advocate if you know your child\u2019s rights and the rules of the system you\u2019re advocating in \u2013 for example, your state\u2019s education laws and the school\u2019s policies, or the medical support your child is entitled to.\n\nIt\u2019ll also help to find out who\u2019s responsible for what in your child\u2019s school or other services your child uses. This way you\u2019ll know who to talk to and what you can expect.\n\nIf you have time, it can help to get familiar with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which applies in Australia. You can also check the laws in your state and territory at Youth Law Australia.\n\nStay calm\n\nIf you stay calm and polite, people will be more open to your point of view. It\u2019s often best to ask questions and make suggestions rather than demand things. For example, you could make a demand like \u2018Give my daughter a place on the school cricket team\u2019. But a suggestion might be more persuasive: \u2018If my daughter gets a place on the cricket team, it\u2019ll be great for the school\u2019s reputation for treating boys and girls equally\u2019.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to stay calm, ask for a moment so you can calm down and gather your thoughts. If this doesn\u2019t work, you could ask for a short break, or stop the meeting and arrange another appointment.\n\nGet organised\n\nPrepare for meetings and take a list of points and questions to meetings. It also helps to keep written records of meetings, emails and phone calls. Include the date and time, who you spoke with or met, and what you discussed. You can also keep relevant information and reports that support your case.\n\nYou could keep all these documents on your computer, in a folder, or both.\n\nGet support\n\nSpeaking to other parents who\u2019ve had similar experiences or joining a support group can help you with useful information and emotional support. You can also get support from a volunteer or paid advocate, who can explain the law and your child\u2019s rights. This person can go to meetings with you too.\n\nAdvocacy services have professional advocates who can work with you to advocate for your child. You can find advocacy services in your area by contacting your local community centre, local council, library or neighbourhood house.\n\nHelping children advocate for themselves\n\nFrom an early age, children can advocate for themselves by saying no or making simple choices.\n\nBut self-advocating might be hard if your child doesn\u2019t understand the situation, the processes or their rights, or doesn\u2019t feel confident to speak up. These situations might come up when your child starts school or goes to the GP, for example.\n\nHere are some ways to help children advocate for themselves.\n\nBuild your child\u2019s confidence\n\nYou can build your child\u2019s confidence by giving them responsibilities and letting them do age-appropriate things on their own \u2013 for example, going to the local shop to buy some milk, or walking the dog.\n\nYou can also encourage your child to feel confident to speak up if they feel something isn\u2019t right. One way to do this is by reading stories with your child about characters who stand up for themselves and others.\n\nListen to your child\n\nActively listening to your child shows that you care and are interested in what they have to say.\n\nYou can show your child that you\u2019ve heard and understood by summarising what they\u2019ve said. For example, \u2018Have I got this right? You feel angry because children in your class throw balls of paper at you when the teacher isn\u2019t looking\u2019.\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand what your child is saying, ask questions and talk about it until you do.\n\nSupport your child to speak up\n\nYou can support your child by preparing them to express their point of view and ask for what they need. For example, you could help your child write down what they want to say to the teacher about the other children\u2019s behaviour. Or you could do a role play of this situation with your child. As part of the role play you could show your child how to be calm and polite.\n\nYou can also help your child work out who they need to talk to about an issue. You could explain why this is the best person to talk to and what your child might expect the person to do or say.\n\nIf your child has any negative consequences from being an advocate for themselves, it\u2019s important to back them up. For example, if a teacher is annoyed with your child for mentioning that other children throw balls of paper, you could ask the teacher for an appointment to discuss the issue.\n\nAs your child practises speaking up for themselves, they\u2019ll become more confident about expressing their point of view."}, {"url": "https://picryl.com/collections/himalaia-india-bhutan-nepal-tibet", "page_content": "PICRYL is the largest media source for public domain images, scans, and documents.

Children are neither the property of their parents nor are they helpless objects of charity. They are human beings and are the subject of their own rights.\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out the rights that must be realized for children to develop to their full potential.\n\nThe Convention offers a vision of the child as an individual and as a member of a family and community, with rights and responsibilities appropriate to his or her age and stage of development. By recognizing children's rights in this way, the Convention firmly sets the focus on the whole child.\n\nThe Convention recognizes the fundamental human dignity of all children and the urgency of ensuring their well-being and development. It makes clear the idea that a basic quality of life should be the right of all children, rather than a privilege enjoyed by a few.\n\n\n\nInterested in learning more about child rights? Take this short course to transform your understanding of child rights and a child rights approach, introduce you to UNICEF\u2019s mandate as it relates to child rights, and inspire you to apply a child rights lens to your everyday work and life.\n\n\n\nThe importance of children\u2019s rights\n\nThere are many reasons for singling out children's rights in a separate human rights Convention:\n\n\n\nChildren are individuals\n\nChildren are neither the possessions of parents nor of the state, nor are they mere people-in-the-making; they have equal status as members of the human family.\n\n\n\nChildren start life as totally dependent beings\n\nChildren must rely on adults for the nurture and guidance they need to grow towards independence. Such nurture is ideally found from adults in children's families, but when primary adult caregivers cannot meet children's needs, it is up to the State as the primary duty bearer to find an alternative in the best interests of the child.\n\n\n\nThe actions, or inactions, of government impact children more strongly than any other group in society\n\nPractically every area of government policy \u2013 from education to public health \u2013 affects children to some degree. Short-sighted policymaking that fails to take children into account has a negative impact on the future of all members of society.\n\n\n\nChildren's views should be heard and considered in the political process\n\nChildren generally do not vote and do not traditionally take part in political processes. Without special attention to the opinions of children \u2013 as expressed at home and in schools, in local communities and even in governments \u2013 children's views go unheard on the many important issues that affect them now or will affect them in the future.\n\n\n\nMany changes in society are having a disproportionate, and often negative, impact on children\n\nTransformation of the family structure, globalization, climate change, digitalization, mass migration, shifting employment patterns and a shrinking social welfare net in many countries all have strong impacts on children. The impact of these changes can be particularly devastating in situations of armed conflict and other emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe healthy development of children is crucial to the future well-being of any society\n\nBecause they are still developing, children are especially vulnerable \u2013 more so than adults \u2013 to poor living conditions such as poverty, inadequate health care, nutrition, safe water, housing and environmental pollution. The effects of disease, malnutrition and poverty threaten the future of children and therefore the future of the societies in which they live.\n\n\n\nThe costs to society of failing its children are huge\n\nSocial research findings show that children's earliest experiences significantly influence their future development. The course of their development determines their contribution, or cost, to society over the course of their lives."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/13/archives/hope-cooke-assails-india-over-sikkim.html", "page_content": "The former Hope Cooke, the American\u2010born Queen of Sikkim, who left her husband and the palace in the Himalayan kingdom in July, 1973, and returned to New York, has issued a statement \u201cappealing to India for the safety of my husband and family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an act of colonialism, violating solemn treaties, India has seized the ancient and peaceful land of Sikkim,\u201d she said in a statement Friday night. \u201cIndian troops have attacked the residence of the chief of state in a bloody assault and are now holding him prisoner.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the legislature in Sikkim voted to abolish the monarchy and seek full statehood in India.
