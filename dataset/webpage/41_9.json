The Groundlings are a famous improv and sketch comedy group based in Los Angeles. The Groundlings School has been the training ground for some of the funniest people in Hollywood. After completing the advanced school level, participants may join the Sunday company. If a comedian is successful in the Sunday spot, they will be asked to join Groundlings main company.\n\nWho is the most famous Groundlings alumni? Funnyman Will Ferrell tops our list. Before making his way to \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Ferrell performed with Groundlings in 1995, along with Jennifer Coolidge, Chris Katan and Cheri Oteri. Other \u201cSNL\u201d vets that got their start at Groundlings include Kristen Wiig, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, Chris Parnell, Maya Rudolph and Taran Killam.\n\nIn 1981, Groundlings debuted their first alternative show, Paul Reubens' \u201cPee Wee Herman Show.\u201d The show played at midnight and featured Reubens, Phil Hartman and John Moody. The show quickly became a huge hit prompting HBO to make it the focus of a comedy special, which somehow led to the popular kids program \u201cPee Wee's Playhouse.\u201d\n\nAre you impressed by all of the great talent that has come through Groundlings?

Thank you for having me.\n\nWhat cosmic comedy forces first brought you into The Groundlings universe?\n\nThe first time I ever saw a Groundling perform was on the British version of the TV show Whose Line Is It Anyway? when Karen Maruyama was in the cast. She was side-splittingly hilarious, and I promised myself that if I ever made it from Australia to Los Angeles, I would make a beeline for The Groundlings. When I finally did make it to Los Angeles and saw a show at The Groundlings for the first time, it was love at first sight!\n\nHow long did you perform with The Groundlings before you were promoted to Main Company Member?\n\nMy first class in Basic Improv was with the amazing Kevin Berntson in 2011 and I was invited into the Main Company in 2016, so I trained for five years in total.\n\nDid you start writing your own sketches right away? Or did you begin by supporting your fellow Groundlings' sketches?\n\nThe skill we hone at The Groundlings is to write your own character-based sketches that you will perform in. So you start writing your own sketches right away in the Writing Lab and Advanced Lab levels at The Groundlings School. It's an exhilarating process because the aim is to write something that only you can perform and that you have as much fun as possible doing in front of a live audience.\n\nDo you have a notebook or tape recorder to note the crazy, normal events of the day as possible sketch subjects?\n\nAbsolutely! I have a notebook, an audio recording app on my phone, and I surreptitiously take pictures and videos of people on my phone's camera that all serve as inspiration for creating characters or moments between people that can be the seed for a sketch. They are all just little snippets and I do it all from a distance so hopefully no one knows that they're being recorded! But you never ever know where the next piece of inspiration is going to come from, and you have to record it or it disappears from your mind. Most if not all my best characters come from observing real people and relationships.\n\nWhen did you become a Groundlings teacher?\n\nI first started teaching in 2016, shortly after being invited into the Main Company.\n\nWas it your idea to teach a Groundlings workshop at 16th St. Actors Studio in your home country?\n\nNot at first. 16th Street Actors Studio already had a great relationship with The Groundlings because an incredible founding member of The Groundlings Phyllis Katz had previously taught there. I happened to be back in Melbourne one year and the opportunity came up to teach while I was there, so it was a happy accident, but now whenever I go back to Australia, I love to let 16th Street Actors Studio and other improv and theater schools in Australia know that I'll be there because I love to bring The Groundlings style of improv and sketch to Australia. I think Australians have such a relaxed and playful attitude towards improvisation and characters. Australians just love to take the piss, so The Groundlings style works extremely well with the Australian sense of humor.\n\nDo you slip into your Australian drawl whenever you're with your fellow Aussies?\n\nYes, and I love it. And it's not just the accent. When I'm back in Australia teaching or performing, suddenly I have access to a whole vocabulary that I can't really use in the U.S. because no one would know what the hell I'm saying. So, it's a joy to let all those references and cultural allusions fly.\n\nWhat spurred you into coming to the U.S. in the early 2000s?\n\nThe adventure. And I wanted to be in a place where there was a critical mass of improv and sketch theaters that I could really dig into. I'm still on my adventure decades later.\n\nWho were your comedy idols growing up?\n\nIn the early 90s, there was a TV show in Australia called Fast Forward. It only ran for four seasons but it's probably the best sketch comedy show to ever come out of Australia, and every episode is burned on my brain. The performers were brilliant: Steve Vizard, Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Magda Szubanski (the three of whom went on to do Kath & Kim), Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, Peter Moon. They were like the Australian Saturday Night Live and I still feel inspired by them.\n\nHow old were you when you decided you wanted to be on stage?\n\nI think I saw a blank stage at a shopping mall when I was six and instinctively got up on it.\n\nWhat is the one thing a teacher or director told you that you adhere to to this day?\n\nI had Jim Rash as my director in Writing Lab at the Groundlings, and he had this extraordinary way of taking simple information and making it hilarious when it was put through the lens of a character. I remember thinking, \"Oh, you don't have to push the information and write witty dialogue. If you just write something simple and truthful, the characters and the relationship and the emotion can take care of the comedy.\"\n\nYour \"Breakfast in Bed\" sketch in GROUNDLINGS ROYAL WEDDING had me holding my sore stomach from all the laughter your non-verbal reactions caused. Do you have an especially favorite sketch that you wrote that went exceptionally well beyond your wildest imaginations?\n\nThanks! I wrote 'Breakfast in Bed' with Patty Guggenheim, and I love writing with her because we tend to write these intense relationship sketches together that don't need much dialogue. Probably my favorite sketch is called 'Jazz' about a man who is performing a variety show celebrating jazz at the Hampton Inn when suddenly in the middle of his act he can't get the lid on his CD player to close. It's another sketch with minimal dialogue and it's a fun character to play because he's really going through a tough moment but has to sing and dance through it which gets the audience on board. When I first started writing the sketch, all I knew was that I had a busted old boom box from Goodwill, but I've since performed the sketch at The Groundings and at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal. I could never have predicted that!\n\nIn GROUNDLINGS HALLOWEEN, you closed the show with \"Song Improv.\" Channeling The Doors' Jim Morrison, you wonderfully sing an improv-ed version of \"This Is the End,\" topping off your rocker act with gymnastic flips and tumbles. Is gymnastics one of your special skills on your resume? What other special skills do you have?\n\nYes, I love to throw in gymnastics whenever I can because it's so surprising to the audience if you can make it organic to the scene. You have to throw whatever you can at it to make the audience laugh! Ball skills, juggling, pratfalls, none of which I can do! But I love to sing and dance, so those are skills I love to throw at it.\n\nAny plans for a new edition of THE GALE?\n\nYes, I'm hoping THE GALE comes back soon. Chris Eckert does an amazing job of directing that show so I'm excited for the new edition.\n\nWould you share some good memories of your Superman stint on Modern Family?\n\nIt was such a juicy line that the writers had written for my character and when we came to rehearse it with me dressed up as this sad classically trained actor in a Superman costume doing a kids party, Ed O'Neill kept breaking. The writers had fun with the character and brought him back several more times to place him with the other families on the show, so it was such a joy to play such a sad man several times in the Modern Family world!\n\nThank you again, Michael! I look forward holding my sore stomach again with you on stage.\n\nMy pleasure! Thank you and see you at The Groundlings."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-12-22/racial-reckoning-groundlings-leonard-robinson-covid-comedy", "page_content": "Part of a year-end series revisiting the subjects of some of our most popular arts articles of the year.\n\nActor and comedian Leonard Robinson has no problem with Tom Cruise\u2019s recent on-set rant about COVID-19 safety. After being shut in and shut down for so long, he gets why any behavior that could compromise a successful return to set or stage would be upsetting.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is follow these protocols!\u201d Robinson said. \u201cEven if you believe COVID is a hoax, your paycheck doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRobinson would know. He\u2019s prepping to return in January to the Season 5 set of Issa Rae\u2019s HBO comedy \u201cInsecure,\u201d in which he plays the recurring role of Taurean Jackson. He\u2019ll be required to test up to five times a week, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months ago, Robinson tested three times before spending two days on the set of a forthcoming Kristen Bell film, \u201cQueenpins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had more testing days than shoot days,\u201d he said.\n\nRobinson is also a main company member of the Groundlings, the sketch and improv comedy troupe that this summer, along with Upright Citizens Brigade, came under fire for a lack of diversity and inclusion. As one of three Black main company members, Robinson spoke with The Times in July about his belief that the Groundlings could and would do better in the future.\n\nFive months later, Robinson said the company has made meaningful strides. It has hired an equity and inclusion consultant who regularly holds educational and training sessions on Zoom. More attention is paid to bias when it pops up in the classroom, either with students or staff. Recruitment efforts have been amped up, as have scholarships, and the company is making room for more people to get seen onstage, he said.\n\nLeonard Robinson will return to the set of HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d in January. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nRobinson landed his first Groundlings directing gig overseeing the company\u2019s inaugural attempt at livestreaming sketch comedy via Zoom for the annual holiday show.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for me as a director was, in a strange way, just convincing them that it could be done,\u201d Robinson said, adding that throughout the pandemic the company has done Zoom improv. But sketch, with its reliance on a script and its need for a more structured narrative, was far more difficult to pull off.\n\nDespite the obvious pitfalls of performing live without physical human interaction, Robinson said that Zoom sketch comedy has its silver linings. The Groundlings\u2019 physical theater holds 99 seats; the Zoom theater is infinite. The holiday shows, Robinson said, were watched by about 300 people each night, some from Brazil, South Africa and Germany.\n\nThe chat room morphed into a raucous forum for laughter, commentary and communication during the shows. Even the actors were able to chime in from time to time. The more lively a chat room, the more Robinson and the cast knew a particular sketch was hitting its stride.\n\n\u201cAs much as everybody loves bingeing on Netflix, that relationship is not interactive,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cTV doesn\u2019t talk back to you, it doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nDirecting Zoom shows, Robinson said, does have one very specific quirk: \u201cEvery scene is your close-up, which is exhausting.\u201d\n\nWith your face in the Zoom box, there is no room to have a false moment, and because the show is streaming live, nothing can be hidden in an edit. Robinson had a limited amount of Zoom views to choose from. Two boxes, or a full grid? Maybe three? How about four?\n\n\u201cWe basically pushed Zoom way past the limits of what it\u2019s intended to do,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nDuring a recent livestream, audience members in the chat room clearly enjoyed a series of sketches grounded in the coronavirus-era world of online communication. Jokes that tapped into the possibilities of digital miscommunication and faux pas were particular favorites.\n\nThe shows worked so well, Robinson said, that the Groundlings will likely do a few more sketch shows before summer arrives, at which point hopes are high that maybe, just maybe, actors and audiences can return to the theater. For Robinson that means doing regular stand-up at the Comedy Store in addition to his work with the Groundlings.\n\nUntil then, Robinson said, \u201cI\u2019ll perform as many shows online as they\u2019ll let me.\u201d"}]}
