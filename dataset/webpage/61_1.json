That December, he made his European debut against Red Star Belgrade, scoring his first professional goal to tie the game late on at 2-2.\n\nAfter three years with Strasbourg, following a second relegation to Ligue 2 in that spell, Gameiro was sold to Lorient for \u20ac3m, despite strong interest from Marseille.\n\nAt Lorient, the young striker exploded. Before leaving for PSG in 2011, he managed to rack up 50 goals in 108 appearances for the mid-table side where his consistent scoring record prompted a push for his inclusion in the national team.\n\nHowever, an injury just before the March international break in 2010 prompted France coach Raymond Domenech to decide against selecting the striker. That summer, with Gameiro again not selected, France put up an appalling display at the World Cup in South Africa as they were knocked out in the group stages after a shock defeat to the hosts.\n\nFollowing Domenech\u2019s departure, Laurent Blanc brought Gameiro in for France\u2019s EURO 2012 qualification matches, the striker making his debut against Belarus as a second-half substitute in August 2010.\n\nHis scoring form remained consistent for Lorient into the 2010/11 season, and despite reports that Les Merlus had accepted bids from Valencia and Bordeaux in January, Gameiro stayed in Brittany until the summer when PSG secured his services for around \u20ac11m plus bonuses. Two years, one Ligue 1 title and 19 league goals later, Gameiro signed for Sevilla for a fee of \u20ac10m.\n\nUnder manager Unai Emery, Sevilla and Gameiro managed an incredible hat-trick of Europa League titles between 2014 and 2016, with Gameiro scoring the game-winning penalty against Benfica in 2014, and the equaliser against Liverpool in 2016, just 17 seconds into the second half. In that final year with Sevilla, Gameiro managed 10 goals in 15 games in Europe, and posted the tournament\u2019s top minutes-per-goal ratio.\n\nAfter scoring 39 goals in 92 games for Sevilla, Gameiro, aged 28, joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, for an initial fee of \u20ac32m, rising to \u20ac40m after add-ons. In his first year at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n, he managed 16 goals in all competitions from 46 games, followed by a further 11 from 37 games in his second season, after the Madrid club made the move to their new stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nAged 30, Gameiro joined Valencia and showed no signs of slowing down playing 55 games in all competitions, scoring 12 goals. The 2019/20 season saw his highest shot conversion rate (0.33) and the highest non-penalty xG per shot (0.25) in La Liga, beating the likes of Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann.\n\nThen, as the world awaited a first full season since the COVID-19 pandemic, Gameiro, now out of contract, re-joined Strasbourg, 13 years after leaving for Lorient. His arrival was met with shock among Strasbourg fans and Ligue 1 pundits alike \u2013 it all seemed to come out of nowhere. Yet, this signing was not a sentimental \u2018last hurrah\u2019 for K\u00e9vin \u2013 he had unfinished business in Alsace.\n\nIn his first season back, Gameiro helped Strasbourg take their push to Europe to the very last match, and contributed to one of the most potent attacks in Europe, which only PSG bettered in terms of goals in Ligue 1 up to March.\n\nAs a younger man, Gameiro was known for his gut-busting energy, pace and efficiency inside the box. His eye for goal was clear as soon as he burst onto the scene at Lorient, and this carries through to the present day.\n\nEven if he has lost a yard of pace as he approaches his mid-thirties, K\u00e9vin still knows where the back of the net is and, in his second stint at Strasbourg, has shown he can pick a pass as well (\u00e0 la Antoine Griezmann in Didier Deschamps\u2019 World cup line-up), finding space and putting balls on a plate for his fellow attackers, Habib Diallo and Ludovic Ajorque.\n\nThis season, the 35-year-old has five goals from 12 starts in a Strasbourg team that look well off the pace, showing there might be yet more to come. After all, the only Frenchmen who can claim to have scored more goals in Europe\u2019s top five leagues since the year 2000 are Karim Benzema and Thierry Henry."}, {"url": "https://www.football-espana.net/2021/07/19/kevin-gameiro-completes-strasbourg-return-from-valencia", "page_content": "Former French international Kevin Gameiro has completed a full circle career move by returning to Strasbourg from Valencia.\n\nThe 34-year-old was released by Los Che as part of the move, to allow him to rejoin the Ligue 1 club on a free transfer, and sign a two year contract at Stade de la Meinau.\n\nGameiro had struggled to make a consistent impact at the Estadio Mestalla following his \u20ac16m move from Atletico Madrid ahead of the 2018/29 La Liga season.\n\n13 years since leaving the club that developed him, Kevin Gameiro has officially rejoined Racing on a two-year deal!

In 2004, Gameiro completed his move to the Alsatian club joining as a youth player.\n\nClub career\n\nStrasbourg\n\nUpon arrival, Gameiro was inserted onto the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. He spent the entire 2004\u201305 season playing with the team. Gameiro featured in 20 matches and scored four goals. In 2005, with Dugu\u00e9p\u00e9roux now managing the team, Gameiro made his professional debut on 10 September 2005 in a match against Paris Saint-Germain appearing as a substitute in the 59th minute of a 1\u20130, Ligue 1 defeat.

With Strasbourg trailing 2\u20130 late in the match, Gameiro scored his first professional goal for the club in the 79th minute. In the final minutes of play, he scored the equalizing goal to draw the match at 2\u20132. The stalemate ensured Strasbourg won the group and the team later advanced to the Round of 16 where they suffered elimination losing 4\u20132 on aggregate to Swiss club FC Basel. A month later, Gameiro converted his third goal of the season in the team's 4\u20130 victory over Nancy in the Coupe de France. In league play, Gameiro scored his first career league goal on 4 February 2006 in a 2\u20131 loss to Lens. Three weeks later, his season was cut short after rupturing ligaments in one of his knees following a tackle from Troyes midfielder Blaise Kouassi. The injury required six months of rehabilitation, which resulted in Gameiro missing the Coupe Gambardella competition, which the Strasbourg under-19 team won, defeating Lyon 3\u20131 in the final at the Stade de France. Overall, Gameiro's season was a success, however, due to the club focusing more on Europe, the team suffered relegation to Ligue 2 for the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nDue to undergoing rehabilitation on his knee, Gameiro made his debut with Strasbourg in Ligue 2 late in the season on 19 September 2006 in the club's 2\u20130 loss to Auxerre in the Coupe de la Ligue. He scored his first goal two months later in a 2\u20130 victory over Istres. Through the rest of the season, Gameiro alternated between the bench and the starting eleven. He only scored two goals, against Gueugnon and Istres, again, for the rest of the season as Strasbourg achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 courtesy of the club's 3rd-place finish. In his first full season as a professional, Gameiro scored six total goals in 36 total appearances. He scored in back-to-back matches during the early portion of the season against Auxerre and Toulouse, but went cold mid-season scoring only two goals. He scored his final two goals for the club in the final two matches of the season against Caen and Marseille. Strasbourg lost both matches., causing Strasbourg to again suffer relegation to Ligue 2.\n\nLorient\n\nGameiro training with Lorient in 2010 Gameiro training with Lorient in 2010\n\nDespite strong interest from Marseille, on 17 June 2008, Gameiro agreed to a four-year deal with Brittany-based outfit Lorient. The club paid Strasbourg a transfer fee of \u20ac3 million for his services. Gameiro was given the number 9 shirt and installed as the club's head striker. He made his club debut on 9 August 2008 playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 victory over Le Mans. Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 defeat to Valenciennes.

Lorient went undefeated in the four matches. In the Coupe de France, Lorient reached the Round of 16. Gameiro scored goals against Alen\u00e7on and Tours in the Round of 64 and Round of 32, respectively. Gameiro continued his consistency during the spring portion of the season scoring goals against Sochaux, Grenoble, Marseille, and Nancy. Gameiro scored a double against the latter club. He finished the season with 39 total appearances and 13 goals. Lorient finished the season in 10th, tied for the club's highest finish ever in the first division.\n\nGameiro continued his rise in French football in the 2009\u201310 Ligue 1 season. He scored on his season debut on 8 August 2009 in a 2\u20131 win over Lille and converted another goal the following week against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw.

Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 3\u20130 humiliation of Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. The following week, Gameiro scored in a 1\u20131 draw with Toulouse. His consistent form prompted analysts to declare that Gameiro should be considered for the French national team, however, prior to the friendly against Spain on 3 March, Gameiro picked up an injury, which led to coach Raymond Domenech not considering him for the squad. Gameiro finished the 2009\u201310 campaign by scoring seven goals in the final nine league matches. He scored a brace against Saint-\u00c9tienne and converted opening goals in wins over Bordeaux, Grenoble, and Lille. In the six matches he scored in, Lorient won five and ultimately finished the campaign in 7th place; the club's highest finish in Ligue 1 ever.\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Gameiro remained consistent.

In December, he played a part in all three goals in the team's 6\u20133 loss to Lille. Gameiro scored the team's opening goal in the 7th minute, netted his second just before half-time, and assisted on Lynel Kitambala's in the second half. In January 2011, Gameiro was the subject of intense transfer speculation. On 4 January, it was reported that the striker had reached an agreement on a contract with Spanish club Valencia. Despite the reported agreement, Lorient president Lo\u00efc F\u00e9ry declared that while personal terms had been agreed, Valencia had never sent in a transfer fee offer for the player. Later in the month, French media reported that Lorient had accepted a bid from fellow Ligue 1 club Bordeaux. Bordeaux officials, however, revealed that Gameiro's preference was to play for Valencia. Ultimately, Gameiro remained with Lorient following the closure of the transfer window as Fery declared \"our priority has always been to keep Kevin with us\". Despite the speculation of a possible transfer, Gameiro remained potent on the field of play. Beginning in late January, he proceeded to go on a tear scoring seven goals in the team's four ensuing league matches. On 29 January, Gameiro scored both goals in a 2\u20130 win against Brest. In the next two weeks, he scored goals in a home win over Caen and an away defeat to Monaco. The impressive tally of goals culminated on 19 February 2011 when Gameiro scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 victory over Bordeaux.\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nGameiro playing for Paris Saint-Germain in 2011 Gameiro playing for Paris Saint-Germain in 2011\n\nOn 10 June 2011, media reports confirmed that Paris Saint-Germain had reached an agreement with Lorient for the transfer of Gameiro. The striker had previously favored a move to either Paris Saint-Germain or Valencia. Two days later, following a successful medical, the transfer was confirmed by Paris Saint-Germain. Gameiro agreed to a four-year contract and the transfer fee was priced at \u20ac11 million with future bonuses to be added later.

Gameiro's next goal came 29 March against Montpellier; 2013's final Gameiro goals were both scored against Gameiro's former outfit Lorient on 26 May.
