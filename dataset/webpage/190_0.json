The Zulu drummer and vocalist Christine Cadette, 23, cited Paramore\u2019s Hayley Williams as a key inspiration. \u201cBut also,\u201d she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t really relate because, at the end of the day, she\u2019s a white cis female, so there\u2019s not really any females that look like me doing exactly that.\u201d\n\nScout Cartagena, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, reflected on the lack of diversity within the underground that inspired them to start Break Free Fest in 2017. \u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s just been a struggle to see people on the stage who looked like me, or were talking about things I cared about,\u201d they said. A typical sight was \u201csome suburban punk white kid, talking about a breakup.\u201d As Cartagena, 30, put it, \u201cI just wanted more.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cmore\u201d has arrived in waves during the past decade. The short-lived but hugely impactful G.L.O.S.S., from Olympia, Wash., brought a vociferous trans-feminist perspective to hardcore. Zulu situates the genre on the spectrum of progressive Black thought. The band\u2019s 2019 debut EP, \u201cOur Day Will Come,\u201d opened with a sample of Nina Simone discussing the importance of Black pride, and juxtaposed searing blast beats and walloping breakdowns with a snippet of a 1962 Malcolm X speech in which he posed the question \u201cWho taught you to hate yourself?\u201d\n\nOn \u201cA New Tomorrow,\u201d both the songs as well as \u201cCr\u00e9me de Cassis,\u201d a lovely mid-album spoken interlude by the poet Alesia Miller, drive home the importance of celebrating Black joy even when considering Black pain. In \u201cFrom Tha Gods to Earth,\u201d Lei and Cadette trade off bellowed lines that first look back to slavery (\u201c400 years and still/Here I am/I won\u2019t forget\u201d) but then ahead to a time when \u201cClouds part and hope seeps through.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think that because we\u2019re in a heavy band, we\u2019re talking about Black struggles, they expect us to be angry about it, but really there\u2019s things that we can enjoy and things that we do celebrate,\u201d Cadette said. \u201cZulu is not about aggression and all that; it\u2019s about love.\u201d\n\nFor Cartagena, Lei\u2019s buoyant performance style is a welcoming beacon. \u201cI say they have the best moves of any frontperson onstage \u2014 just, like, sliding and moon walking and just moving their shoulders,\u201d they said. \u201cIt just reminds me of my people.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1028075914-bane-at-franklin-music-hall", "page_content": "Bane, a hardcore punk band, began as a side project between Aaron Dalbec (then of Converge) and Aaron Bedard (who had previously sang for the Worcester, Massachusetts hardcore band Backbone). They went into the studio in December of 1995 with a few friends and released a 5 song demo. The next year saw the release of their first EP, and many shows throughout central Massachusetts.

The members were drummer Brendan Canty (b. March 9, 1966, Teaneck, New Jersey, U.S.), bass player Joe Lally (b. December 3, 1963, Rockville, Maryland), vocalist-guitarist Ian MacKaye (b. April 16, 1962, Washington, D.C.), and vocalist-guitarist Guy Picciotto (b. September 17, 1965, Washington, D.C.).\n\nFormed in 1987, the band emerged from the Washington, D.C., punk scene. All four members had already played in local bands; MacKaye had been a member of influential hardcore band Minor Threat and cofounded the independent label Dischord Records in 1980. By the time Fugazi had released its full-length debut, 13 Songs, in 1989, it had established a unique sound: building from the raw energy of 1980s hardcore bands such as Black Flag, Fugazi created its own brand of intricate song structures and stop-and-start dynamics, often fueled by call-and-response exchanges between dual singers MacKaye and Picciotto.\n\nThe group quickly developed a reputation for its integrity and its grassroots ethos. Despite lucrative offers from major labels, Fugazi remained self-managed and self-produced, releasing all its albums on Dischord. The band refused to charge more than $6 for admission to its exclusively all-ages shows and kept the price of its CDs under about $12\u2014gestures intended to keep Fugazi accessible to its loyal fan base. Especially in light of the popular explosion of alternative and punk bands in the 1990s, Fugazi\u2019s adherence to the punk movement\u2019s original do-it-yourself populist stance earned the band a great deal of respect among its peers.\n\nOver the course of the 1990s, on albums such as Repeater (1990), Steady Diet of Nothing (1991), In on the Kill Taker (1992), Red Medicine (1995), and End Hits (1998), Fugazi retained its churning rhythms and raw emotion, but its song structures became more varied and its lyrics more oblique and less overtly political (the band had sometimes been criticized for being too didactic and politically correct in its earlier efforts). Fugazi became known for its intense live performances, marked by consistently tight sets and the magnetic stage presences of MacKaye and Picciotto. Onstage, the band utilized its trademark sound\u2014the buildup of extreme tension followed by calm\u2014to draw its audience into a visceral, emotional experience. Yet Fugazi stood out among its contemporaries in its opposition to slam dancing (the aggressive body-jarring collisions that were the preferred dance form of fans of hardcore).\n\nIn 1999 a documentary about the band, titled Instrument, was released, followed in 2001 by both a full album, The Argument, and an extended-play CD, Furniture. Shortly after a performance in London in 2002, the band announced an \u201cindefinite hiatus.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/magazine/plants-protest.html", "page_content": "MaRy J. BLigE oN tHe BeAuTy oF VuLNeRabiLiTy\n\nBlige is now 51, with 9 Grammy Awards, two Academy Award nominations and three Golden Globe nominations, with a hit for seemingly every era of hip-hop and R.&B. since her debut. She was 17 and living in public housing in Yonkers, N.Y., when she sang Anita Baker\u2019s entire \u201cRapture\u201d album to the music executive Andre Harrell, which led to her record deal. She has spent the ensuing years longing for love on records, finding and losing it in front of the world. Where so much of popular music has been geared toward showing just enough vulnerability to bolster your own fierceness, Blige\u2019s particular brand of honesty and approachability brings out something tender in listeners and collaborators alike. Read More\n\n/ One of Mary J. Blige\u2019s earliest lyrics, from her breakout sophomore album, \u201cMy Life,\u201d encapsulates the theme that has become central to her 30-plus year career: \u201cHow can I love somebody else/If I can\u2019t love myself enough to know/When it\u2019s time/Time to let go?\u201d It is a question that went beyond the tendency of pop and R.&B. songs of the time to look outward (Why won\u2019t you love me?), or to focus purely on the singer\u2019s desires (I need romance) and turned the gaze inward, acknowledging the work to be done on the self first. The lyric also introduced one of Blige\u2019s hallmarks: She doesn\u2019t provide her listeners with answers to life\u2019s big questions, instead complicating the inquiry itself, time and again. More than a guide, she is a fellow traveler.\n\nDuring the heyday of mid-\u201990s New York hip-hop, when gritty, gun-toting street narratives dominated the culture, Blige\u2019s vocals helped add nuance to the image of city life and the relationships that governed it. She softened Method Man on his devotional \u201cI\u2019ll be There for You/You\u2019re All I Need to Get By\u201d and added uptown swagger to Jay-Z\u2019s Mafioso flow on \u201cCan\u2019t Knock the Hustle.\u201d In the early 2000s Blige brought soul to Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cI Try\u201d and a sense of ease and warmth to Common\u2019s \u201cCome Close.\u201d In the years since, Blige\u2019s list of featuring spots has grown to include Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Kid Cudi and Wyclef Jean. If you want a track to have real feeling, you call Mary.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, Blige appeared alongside some of the biggest names in hip-hop, past and present, and sang about her joy and her heartbreak. She performed her bouncy club anthem \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d (wherein she gifts us with the word \u201cdancery\u201d), and then her ballad \u201cNo More Drama\u201d with a kind of controlled anguish, ending sprawled out on the stage in an act of triumphant depletion. As her peers rapped about their own enduring greatness (Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cStill D.R.E.\u201d) and offered broader affirmations for their people (Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cAlright\u201d), Blige kept the show grounded in raw, introspective emotion, even while clad in Swarovski crystals and thigh-high boots.\n\nThis February Blige also released her 15th studio album, \u201cGood Morning Gorgeous,\" her first since her divorce from the music producer Kendu Isaacs was finalized in 2018.The production of the album feels in step with current trends, with features from Anderson .Paak and songwriting assistance from H.E.R., but the substance of the songs is classic Blige: honest about her failures and unabashed about her desire to be loved. On the Starz show \u201cPower Book II: Ghost,\u201d Blige currently plays Monet, the calculating, occasionally murderous wife of an incarcerated drug kingpin. Blige has said that the character reminds her of women she grew up around: sole providers willing to do whatever it takes to survive in a ruthless, male-dominated world.\n\nBlige and I spoke on Zoom the Friday after her Super Bowl performance, in a moment of relative calm before she traveled to Cleveland to perform at N.B.A. All Star Weekend. Though her music is often informed by pain, Blige is more interested in taking stock of life\u2019s fluctuations and grabbing whatever joy is within reach along the way.\n\nSo many songs on your new album feel really contemporary but also so genuinely Mary \u2014 \u201cRent Money,\u201d \u201cFailing in Love,\u201d \u201cHere with Me.\u201d How do songs like that begin for you, from a writing perspective? A song begins from an experience, a feeling. Feeling, like, empty, or depleted \u2014 what does that mean? What word can define feeling that way? Getting nothing back in return \u2014 I think that would be \u201cRent Money.\u201d And \u201cFailing in Love\u201d is what I seem to keep doing. I\u2019m single, and I\u2019m cool with it now, but the relationship thing, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with it. That\u2019s where \u201cFailing\u201d came from: Sometimes I feel like I failed when it comes to love. \u201cHere With Me,\u201d that\u2019s just how I want to feel \u2014 I want to be with someone. I want to feel someone and be with someone and be able to sing those lyrics, you know?\n\nOne of your hallmarks is how personal you are in your music. During something like your decade-plus marriage, how do you decide how much of yourself to put in your songs, and how much to hold back? Well, I\u2019m not going to say anything that I don\u2019t want to say. You\u2019re not going to find out anything about me that I don\u2019t want you to find out.\n\nThe world is always \u201cGimme more, gimme more, I need gossip, I need this, I need that\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m not going to give you gossip. I\u2019m just going to give you what I know I can confirm, what I know I can stand and talk about and not feel like I don\u2019t have anything left. What I give is what people deal with, what we go through every single day.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid of the world, not at all \u2014 I\u2019ve been going through hell since I was little. I\u2019m not afraid to say, OK: I\u2019m going through this, and I need help just like everybody else on Earth needs help. But I\u2019m not going to give up nothing that I don\u2019t want to give up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m comfortable. People in this world can\u2019t force me to do anything.\n\nIs that something you\u2019ve believed from the beginning, or is that a part of your evolution as a songwriter? From the beginning. Ever since I was a little kid, you cannot force me to do things. If you try, it\u2019s always a bad experience for you and me.\n\nThere\u2019s this assumption that the thing that makes you so powerful is that you lay it all out. But in reality, one thing that makes you so powerful is that you know which parts of you are going to touch other people. I don\u2019t think people care about the details too much! They just care about the part that they can relate to directly with you. \u201cMe too, girl, me too.\u201d They don\u2019t even care about how you got on that floor. They just know that you were down there \u2014 with them. I just give them enough to say, \u201cMe, too. I\u2019m hurting too.\u201d\n\nIt feels like this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. I got a divorce, you know: OK, Mary, how\u2019d you get through this? Because the world saw you go through all this. It\u2019s an assignment for me to do that. It might not be everybody else\u2019s assignment. But there are a lot of women who love me and respect me and follow me, and want to know \u2014 not the details, but how to get to the other side. How did you get to the other side with class and dignity when everybody was tearing you down and teasing you, and the person that you were with was destroying you? I made a way that\u2019s like, Whatever your truth is, speak it.\n\nYou have a philosophy in terms of what you reveal. Do you have one on a language level? Do you ever cross something out because it\u2019s just not a Mary kind of word? I do. There are certain things I would never say. And I don\u2019t like to be too literal. \u201cFailing in Love\u201d is an experience. \u201cRent Money\u201d is an experience. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cMy rent is due, so the song is called \u2018Rent Money\u2019\u201d \u2014 it was like, Everything is due.\n\nI was thinking about Roy Ayers\u2019s \u201cEverybody Loves the Sunshine,\u201d which you sample on \u201cMy Life.\u201d The lyrics of that song are pretty straightforward \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cbees and things and flowers.\u201d And that\u2019s what I love about it! That was the first song I really heard, when I was 4 years old. When you think of the sunshine, you think of bees and trees \u2014 it\u2019s very A-B-C, 1-2-3. It\u2019s not literal, it\u2019s just plain and simple. I like to write like that, too, plain and simple. Because people get it. Something in the color of that music, something in the keys, something that just drives me crazy in a good way. It has so much medicine and healing. They didn\u2019t have to say anything else but just bees and trees and flowers, and I\u2019m in. \u201cWhatever drug y\u2019all are taking, I\u2019m taking, too.\u201d\n\nYou said you love the color of that song. What color is that song to you? That\u2019s gold. There\u2019s something very regal and shiny about it.\n\nYou often mention colors in relation to your songs. I hadn\u2019t realized that you\u2019re a synesthesia person. When you listen to music, do you often see colors? Every time. As soon as it comes on, I can tell you what color it is.\n\n\u201cGood Morning Gorgeous\u201d is what color? Purple. It\u2019s royal, an arrival of something new and powerful.\n\nAnd \u201cReal Love?\u201d \u201cReal Love\u201d is light, like a sunny-day sky blue. Almost all the songs on \u201cMy Life\u201d are blue. \u201cBe Happy,\u201d blue. \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d blue. \u201cDon\u2019t Go,\u201d blue. \u201cI\u2019m The Only Woman,\u201d dark blue.\n\nThe new album\u2019s themes feel very 2022: positive affirmations, self-care, vulnerability, the benefits of talk therapy. Your openness made you so beloved, for decades. But were there ever opportunities or things that didn\u2019t come to you, because you were so real? A lot of people don\u2019t come to me. A lot of people run away from me, because I\u2019m so open. Everybody\u2019s not ready to be open! That\u2019s the professional downside: A lot of people will run. And a lot of people will stay, because they want to get to the other side. If I weren\u2019t getting to the other side, everybody would be running. People run when they\u2019re not ready to get to the other side, to get out \u2014 when it\u2019s comfortable. I\u2019m always in a place where it\u2019s uncomfortable, because I\u2019m always trying to get to the other side of any kind of self-hatred, negativity, self-pity. And not everybody\u2019s ready.\n\nWhen you say people, do you mean other artists, or listeners? I mean some peers, some friends. They\u2019re not ready. Some people run. What I love about doing this is you get to see who is who. The one who is just in it for who you are \u2014 famous, or whatever \u2014 you see them run when it gets hard. But the ones that love you stay, and they hurt with you, heal with you, cry with you. That\u2019s the beauty of vulnerability. It weeds out all the B.S.\n\nGrowing up listening to your music, you always seemed to be one of the girls in the boys\u2019 club \u2014 so affiliated with hip-hop, which was so male-dominated. Because of that, when you were the only woman onstage at the Super Bowl, it felt very natural. Was that something you gave any thought to, being the only woman? Well yeah, of course. I\u2019m always in that situation. Because hip-hop is such a male-dominated field, and I happen to be the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. But I\u2019ve never had a problem, a run-in, any negativity, with my male peers, ever. They love me, they respect me, they call on me. I know how to carry myself. I love that about myself, that I can handle myself with these men.\n\nIn the studio, has it ever been difficult to be so vulnerable about things like your romantic experience, in such a male-dominated setting? Not at all. Most of them are like, \u201cMe too, I\u2019m going through it too!\u201d That\u2019s another thing \u2014 you\u2019d be surprised what vulnerability can bring. It just opens everybody up. And it\u2019s beautiful because now we can all get some healing together. Now we can write this song together. Like me and Anderson .Paak writing \u201cLove Without the Heartbreak\u201d \u2014 that was a heavy session! But he can relate. Doing the whole \u201cMy Life\u201d album with my brother Puff \u2014 that was a lot. He was going through what he was going through, and I was going through what I was going through.\n\nHas it ever felt like some kind of negotiation when you were the only female voice on a track with men who were, perhaps, expressing negative views about women on the same song? Well, I know who I am. I know they aren\u2019t talking to me. Even when I didn\u2019t love myself, I knew they weren\u2019t talking to me. These are my friends and my brothers, and they\u2019re talking about whoever they\u2019re talking about, and that\u2019s on them. Whatever they have to come through, they have to come through. I don\u2019t like men speaking negatively about women, but I\u2019m not everybody\u2019s boss, I\u2019m not your mother. I\u2019m your friend. So that\u2019s between you and God and whoever you\u2019re speaking about.\n\nWhen I was younger, that wasn\u2019t something that was on my mind. What was on my mind was making a hot record, a record that we can both relate to together. Like \u201cYou\u2019re All I Need.\u201d That\u2019s a beautiful song. Method Man\u2019s speaking highly about women.\n\nI\u2019m always struck by hearing you talk about your ascendant years \u2014 how, behind the scenes, you didn\u2019t feel that you were all that, that you were beautiful, that you were as great as everybody said you were. During those years, what was the thing that kept you creating? The fan base, the love for the music, that was my survival. I didn\u2019t have anything else. I was a girl from the hood who didn\u2019t really have much. And then when I got something \u2014 which was love from people who didn\u2019t even know me \u2014 it was like, wow, OK.\n\nIt was the only thing that made me feel good. Everything else about me was like, Yeah, whatever. It was always hard to see myself as a beautiful person \u2014 because of so many things I don\u2019t want to talk about that happened in life, from childhood to being a young adult in the music business. The music and the people and the fans and the money \u2014 the things that came with it \u2014 helped me to cover up everything else.\n\nIn the \u201cMy Life\u201d documentary, you said that Diddy helped you see yourself as a real artist. What is your definition of a real artist? In my case, a person who\u2019s not afraid to give of oneself to heal, or to help someone else heal. A person who\u2019s not afraid to experiment.\n\nThe reason I say that about Diddy is that I was afraid to bring some of the songs to him for the \u201cMy Life\u201d album. And that was my first experience as an artist speaking from a place of hurt, a place of \u201cI need help.\u201d And I was afraid to go to him, because I didn\u2019t know how he was going to receive it. Because, you know, the \u201cWhat\u2019s the 411?\u201d album was not like that. And when I brought it to him, he went crazy. That\u2019s when I knew: OK, this is what I do. This is what I do as an artist. I\u2019m an artist. Puff believes in me, and he sees me. He told me that \u2014 he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a real artist now.\u201d\n\nAs 2022 Mary, do you have anything you wish you could have said to 1998 Mary? If she would have listened to me \u2014 because she wasn\u2019t listening to anyone \u2014 I would tell her that you have no idea what the future holds for you. I need you to get ready. But you can\u2019t tell her to get ready. Because she ain\u2019t ready.\n\nI think about the years in the late 2000s, early \u201910s, when it seemed like R.&B. took a back seat to music that was more dance focused, electronic focused. And those are the years when you went to London and put out the amazing \u201cLondon Sessions,\u201d which feels like a bridge to current trends. How did you feel during those years, when everybody was trying to make songs for a different kind of club? I felt normal. But I was feeling forced by the labels to do something that would move the needle more, on the charts or whatever. Try this, try that. I could have just kept making the type of music I was making, but the labels wanted dance remixes. I felt like I was being pushed to do things I didn\u2019t want to do, but you know, when the label speaks, sometimes you have to do what they say, because it\u2019s their money. I got in a lot of trouble fighting for the R.&B. singles I wanted to keep. It didn\u2019t hurt anything, but it didn\u2019t help anything either.\n\nBut sometimes, dipping your toe into that genre \u2014 like the songs with Disclosure, or Kaytranada and BADBADNOTGOOD \u2014 doesn\u2019t feel like you got lost. In those songs, no, because I was doing what I wanted to do. I picked Disclosure because I thought they were hot! I saw a video of theirs, and I was like, Who is this? It felt like they knew where we came from, they were sampling everything we were sampling. They knew their history, hip-hop music and R.&B. And Kaytranada, he\u2019s us. I like to do stuff when it feels like I\u2019m not alienating who I am and where my music history comes from. I like to stay where my world is not crossing over to theirs \u2014 they\u2019re crossing over to me.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nAngela Flournoy is the author of the novel \u201cThe Turner House.\u201d She has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Academy in Berlin.

Smith\u2019s debut album with her band \u2018Horses\u2019 is widely lauded as one of the greatest albums to come out of the American punk rock movement.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Gloria: In Excelsis Deo\u2019.\n\nDebbie Harry, Blondie\n\nYears active: 1974\u20131982, 1997\u2013present.\n\nWho they are: Pioneers of the American punk rock and new wave scenes in the 1970s. Founded by lead singer Debbie Harry with guitarist Chris Stein, the band is known for combining an eclectic mix of genres, including punk, pop, disco, rap, and reggae. They were considered an underground band until breaking into the mainstream, with the release of their internationally successful \u2018Parallel Lines.\u2019 The band broke-up in 1982, but re-formed in 1997 \u2013 touring and playing at big festivals like Glastonbury \u2013 and have released eleven studio albums in total.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Heart of Glass\u2019.\n\nSiouxsie Sioux, Siouxsie and the Banshees\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYears active: 1976\u20131996, 2002.\n\nWho they are: The unofficial founders of post-punk. Formed after singer Siouxie Sioux met her future bandmate Steven Severin at a Roxy Music concert, Siouxsie and the Banshees were initially lumped into a scene that journalists dubbed the \u2018Bromley Contingent\u2019. That said, the band had very little in common with Sex Pistols aside from geography and a drive to push musical boundaries.\n\nWhile all of the punk bands around them courted label attention from the start, Siouxsie and the Banshees didn\u2019t sign a record deal until 1978; with the backing of Polydor, they finally released their debut single \u2018Hong Kong Garden\u2019 that same year. At the time, reviewed in NME, Paul Rambali praised it for \u201cthe most original, intoxicating guitar playing I heard in a long, long time\u201d. Recorded in one week, their debut album \u2018The Scream\u2019 is now regarded as a landmark post-punk album; documenting the suburbia they grew up. Up until the band disbanded in 1996 (Siouxsie and bandmate Budgie later turned their attention to the Creatures) The Banshees released constantly innovative music; pushing the limitations with every release.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Spellbound\u2019\n\nBeth Ditto, Gossip\n\nYears active: 1999\u20132016.\n\nWho they were: A three-piece from Washington, USA, Gossip stormed gained international success for their critically-acclaimed debut album \u2018Standing in the Way of Control\u2019. Frontwoman Ditto \u2013 self-described as a \u201cfat, feminist lesbian from Arkansas\u201d \u2013 is well known for her energetic, frenetic and sweaty performances. Currently pursuing a solo career, alongside working in fashion, Ditto has been outspoken about LGBTQ+ equality throughout her career and has done a great deal for promoting body image positivity. She doesn\u2019t shave her armpits or use deodorant \u2013 once reportedly saying \u201cI think punks usually smell\u201d \u2013 and caused mild controversy when she told NME in 2006 that she ate squirrels as a kid.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Standing in the Way of Control\u2019.\n\nPoly Styrene, X-Ray Spex\n\nYears active: 1976\u20131979, 1991, 1995\u20131996, 2008.\n\nWho they were: A punk band from London. Self-described as \u201cdeliberate underachievers\u201d, the band only released one album, the punk rock classic \u2018Germfree Adolescent\u2019, with uncredited saxophone parts from on-off band member Lora Logic, before breaking up in 1979. They re-formed to play various one-off gigs, including a sellout show at the Brixton Academy in 1991, and also got back together to release a second album, \u2018Conscious Consumer\u2019, in 1995. They were considered one of the most exciting and innovative band\u2019s on the British punk rock scene, with a progressive and feminist outlook, and known for their anti-consumerism themes in their songs. Poly Styrene tragically died from breast cancer in 2011, aged 53.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Oh Bondage Up Yours!\u2019\n\nThe Slits\n\nYears Active: 1976\u20131982, 2005\u20132010.\n\nWho they are: Making raucous punk with a feminist lean, The Slits\u2019 music was defined by joyful mayhem; nodding heavily to the backing vocals of French y\u00e9-y\u00e9 bands, a relaxed strain of dub, and a general apitude for do-it-yourself scrappiness. Their 1979 debut album \u2018Cut\u2019 \u2013 which featured Ari Up Viv Albertine and Tessa Pollitt in a rose garden wearing loincloths and covered in mud \u2013 is both playful and pointed, refusing to play the part of the \u2018Typical Girls\u2019 who were often ignored or sidelined in the punkscene. Listening to \u2018Cut\u2019 today, its enormous influence on the Riot Grrrl movement of the 90s is obvious, and it\u2019s rightly regarded as a classic of the era.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Shoplifting\u2019\n\nBrody Dalle, The Distillers\n\nYears active: 1998\u2013present.\n\nWho they are: An punk bank formed in LA by Brody Dalle, who was brought up in Australia. Dalle\u2019s is known for her distinctive, raspy voice. The group released three albums The band recently got back together to play their first show in 13 years in San Diego, California.\n\nBest Track: \u2018City of Angels\u2019.\n\nCourtney Love, Hole\n\nYears active: 1989\u20132002, 2010\u20132012.\n\nWho they were: An American alternative rock band founded by frontwoman Courtney Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson. The group\u2019s early works \u2013 like debut album \u2018Pretty on the Inside\u2019 \u2013 were heavily influenced by the LA punk scene. In their later years, the band opted for a more mainstream rock sound. In total, Hole released four studio albums. The band\u2019s line-up frequently changed throughout the years, and included bassist Kristen Pfaff between 1993 until her death from a heroin overdose in 1994 \u2013 just two months after the death of Love\u2019s husband and Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. Love\u2019s songwriting for Hole often addressed gender issues and scholars have credited her for reflecting the third-wave feminist movement in her tracks in the 1990s.\n\nBest Track: Teenage Whore.\n\nKim Shattuck, The Muffs\n\nYears active: 1991\u2013present.\n\nWho they are: A punk band created in Southern California in 1991, led by singer and guitarist Kim Shattuck. The band broke-up in 1999, but re-formed to release a fifth album \u2018Really Really Happy\u2019, before splitting again. Three core members of the group, including Shattuck, later got the band back together, putting out a sixth album \u2018Whoop Dee Doo\u2019 in 2014, and playing gigs. Shattuck briefly played bass for the Pixies on their European tour in 2013.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Kids in America\u2019.\n\nThe Donnas\n\nYears active: 1993\u20132012, currently on hiatus.\n\nWho they are: An all-woman punk rock band based in Palo Alto, California. Currently on hiatus, the band has released seven studio albums. Their sound is influenced by Ramones, Kiss, AC/DC, and The Runaways.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Take it Off\u2019.\n\nPussy Riot\n\nYears active: 2011\n\nWho they are: A Russian protest punk rock group founded in Moscow. The group, which has around 11 female members, are known for its provocative guerrilla performances in public places, which are posted online and often protest against Russian president Vladimir Putin and his repressive policies. Pussy Riot gained international attention when three of its members were arrested in March 2012 \u201chooliganism motivated by religious hatred,\u201d after they held a performance in Moscow\u2019s Cathedral of Christ the Savior. While one member was released in October 2012, the other two remained served 21 months in prison before they were let out in December 2013. The group members are outspoken supporters of feminist and LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nBest Track: \u2018Police State\u2019.\n\nDream Wife:\n\nYears active: 2016 \u2013 present.\n\nWho they are: An all-female, punk-pop three-piece from Brighton \u2013 and one of the most exciting bands in the UK right now. The band are known for their sweaty, frenetic and moshing performances, where they frequently urge all the \u201cbad bitches\u201d to come to the front and take up space. They\u2019re full of catchy melodies and addictive riffs \u2013 and are outspoken feminist issues, including stopping women being sexually assaulted at gigs, and should Dream Wife released their eponymous debut album in January this year. Read NME\u2019s five-star review here.\n\nBest Track: \u2018F.U.U.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://matthewsheahan.com/2023/06/04/new-yorks-most-punk-band-leaves-the-stage/", "page_content": "In the early 2000s, I picked up a copy of the punk rock newspaper The New York Waste, and paged through the show listings, record reviews and other articles. I came across a comic strip, \u2018Last In Line for the Gang Bank, the GG Allin Story,\u2019 a comic biography of late punk rock musician GG Allin.\n\nGG Allin was a legendary punk rock performer known for his obscene and violent performances. His posthumous notoriety has grown in recent years but at the time his legend was more restricted to a smaller circle of punk rock die-hards.\n\nHoly shit, I thought, someone is writing a comic-strip biography of GG Allin\u2019s life and that is the coolest thing ever!\n\nI read this comic strip religiously in every issue of the New York Waste. At the bottom of every comic in a small banner or border was a web address that looked somewhat cryptic. Unable to resist, I fired up my large desktop computer at home (this was several years before smart phones became publicly available) and visited the web address to find it was for a band called World War IX. Their guitar player, Justin Melkmann, was the man behind the GG Allin comic.\n\nBased on the strength of this awesome comic alone, I made a mental note to see World War IX play at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI first saw the band play at CB\u2019s Basement, a smaller, downstairs venue attached to the legendary CBGB\u2019s. They were the kind of raw, no-frills garage punk rock that I can never get enough of. They brought a loud punk sound with catchy tunes and, importantly, a sense of humor.\n\nAfter their set, I found their guitar player, Justin, and told him that I liked his comic, and that World War IX was playing great music. I was in the process of getting my band Blackout Shoppers off the ground and we promised to stay in touch.\n\nFast forward a few months, and Blackout Shoppers and World War IX were playing shows together frequently, and the first recordings that Blackout Shoppers ever had for sale was a split 7-inch record with World War IX called \u2018Larceny Armageddon,\u2019 playing off the names of our bands.\n\nPeople have been arguing over what constitutes \u201cpunk\u201d since 1975. If you ask 100 punk rock fans for a definition of punk, you will get 100 different answers. We can agree maybe on two key attributes that make a band punk: an aggressive, often purposely offensive style of rock, and a base level of honesty with its fans and the general public.\n\nMany punk bands try to act as if they are completely above the fray, that because they play this tyle of music they exist on a higher moral plane than those that play more lucrative genres. I can tell you first-hand that punk musicians harbor all the same egos and insecurities that the rest of the rock world has. As much of a joy as it is to play music, there comes a time in every band member\u2019s life when they look at other bands and say to themselves, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have what they have?\u201d or otherwise questions or gripes about their position in the entertainment industry food chain.\n\nWorld War IX has a case for being New York\u2019s punkest band of the last few decades. It played a raw, aggressive punk rock style that evolved but never mellowed, and it was very honest with its fans. Especially as told through Justin\u2019s comics, World War IX narrated its own journey with all the pitfalls and aggravations that come with keeping a band afloat for years. Lineup changes, issues with drugs and alcohol, job worries and marriages and the weight of the world that is crushing at times have all been illustrated with humor, grit and ultimately gratitude.\n\nAs World War IX embraced its creativity, I had the opportunity to share the stage with them as a member of Blackout Shoppers and other bands, and I also had the chance to play villains in several of their music videos for Cutlass Supreme, Carrera con el Diablo and Bender Royale. I cannot think of an instance when I had a bad time at a World War IX show, or had a bad time with a member of World War IX.\n\nI felt great joy when my friend Philthy Phill became their singer. A super-creative soul who has embraced the arts of writing, stand-up comedy, and music while surviving in New York, Phill was a natural choice when the band was looking for a singer once more. It was a sign that the forces of the world had brought on a confluence of punk rock perfection when Phill was on the mic. His departure from New York is what got Blackout Shoppers back on stage and playing again regularly after a few years on semi-hiatus.\n\nPhill was replaced on singing duties by Johnny C., previously of the band Citizen Blast Kane. A few years later, World War IX decided to call it quits. There wasn\u2019t any big drama or dispute over money (there is no money in punk rock!), but there comes a time when a band just feels it has run out of road and needs to move on and do other things. That time came for World War IX, and the band decided last year that they would play a final show this January at Otto\u2019s Shrunken Head.\n\nWorld got out that WWIX was breaking up and having a final show. People from all over the country made plans to fly to New York for the event. The band invited all their former members to return to play one last time. Most importantly, Philthy Phill would be coming in from Indiana.\n\nThe night arrived for World War IX to say a loud farewell. Otto\u2019s was packed and first on the stage was Cash Bribe, featuring WWIX bass player Brian Jackson on bass. Cash Bribe kicked things off with hardcore fury that blended old school Black Flag with heavier distortion and more metal-sounding riffs, truly a modern hardcore band building on gritty, guitar-fueled punk.\n\nAll but one of Dr. Ex and the Break-Ups are World War IX alumni, and Dr. Ex took the stage next to play classic garage rock with a more punk rock treatment; imagine Question Mark and the Mysterians after an all-night drug orgy with The Kinks. The jean jackets, white-frame sunglasses, and keyboard-infused rock set them apart from the rest of the night\u2019s entertainment.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s Loafass was next, and beer flew everywhere as things were getting heated up. Loafass brings a funk-influenced punk-hardcore sound and their work is a testament to the longevity of music that is made with the intention of having a good time. Loafass has been around for more than 25 years; and they are the same intense fun they were when I first saw them in 2003.\n\nMy band Blackout Shoppers were next, and before we started, I mentioned to the audience that while the four of us as a band have nearly 200 years of bad decisions under our belts, one of the soundest decisions any of us have ever made was befriending World War IX. \u201cWorld War IX, you are the best, we are Blackout Shoppers.\u201d\n\nThen it was time for World War IX to take the stage. What followed was a chaotic masterpiece of a punk rock sendoff. It was a loud, demented family reunion that was extremely energetic and sweaty, and amazingly raucous fun. The songs were delivered with the kind of energy punk rock is famous for. It was a sweet relief to see one of my favorite bands of all time go out with a the kind of impressive roar that its history deserved. World War IX left the stage a battered, beer-soaked mess. It left the New York punk scene better than it found it. We are grateful for having been there to listen."}, {"url": "https://www.gamesradar.com/dc-comics-july-2022-solicitations-covers/", "page_content": "DC's July 2022 solicitations are full of the summer month's traditional emphasis on hotdogs, baseball, and fireworks ... just without the hotdogs and baseball.\n\nBut look up, it's bringing the fireworks.\n\nSo what's happening in July?\n\nBoth core Batman titles - Detective Comics and Batman - get brand new creative teams and brand new storylines.

For the better part of two decades, they've cemented their reputation as freethinking songwriters, road warriors, and community builders, creating a catalog of diverse music and a loyal audience who\u2019ve grown alongside them through the years. That evolution continues with Heart is the Hero, the band's eighth studio album. Recorded analog to 16-track tape, this latest effort finds its three creators embracing the chemistry of their acclaimed live shows by capturing their performances in real-time direct from the studio floor with nary a computer in sight. An acoustic-driven album that electrifies, Heart is the Hero is stocked with songs that target not only the heart, but the head and hips, too.\n\n\n\n\"We love records that come from the era of less tracks and more care,\" explains co-founder Oliver Wood. \"When you use a computer during the tracking process, you have an infinite number of tracks at your disposal, which implies that nothing is permanent, and everything can be fixed. Tape gives you limitations that force you to be creative and intentional. You don't look at the music on a screen; you listen to it, and you learn to focus on the feeling of the performance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThroughout Heart is the Hero, those performances are matched by the visceral storytelling and songwriting chops that have turned The Wood Brothers into Grammy-nominated leaders of American roots music, even as their music reaches far beyond the genre's borders. The stripped-down swagger of \"Pilgrim'' underscores Oliver's reminder to slow down and experience each moment as an interactive observer, rather than a passive tourist. A similar theme anchors \u201cBetween the Beats,\" where Oliver draws upon a meditation technique \u2014 maintaining one's focus on the space between heartbeats \u2014 to reach a new level of presence. The gentle sway of country soul gem \u201cRollin\u2019 On,\u201d featuring horns by Matt Glassmeyer and Roy Agee, expounds on the time-honored tradition of love as the guiding light through darkness, while \u201dMean Man World\" finds Chris Wood singing about his responsibilities as a father whose young daughter is poised to inherit an uncertain future. \"Line Those Pockets'' is a universal call for mercy and understanding over materialism. \"Everybody's just trying to be happy, so put your money away; line those pockets with grace,\" the band sings in three-part harmony during the song's chorus, which emphasizes compassion over cash as the world's true currency. Together, these songs offer a snapshot of a spirited, independent-minded group at the peak of its powers, always pushing forward and seeking to evolve beyond what\u2019s come before.\n\n\n\n\"There's still acoustic guitar, upright bass, and percussion on this album \u2014 things people use all the time \u2014 but we're always thinking, 'How can we make this sound like us, but not like something we've already done?'\" Oliver says. \"Sometimes, the only way to do that is to get weird.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat sense of exploration pumps its way through Heart is the Hero like lifeblood. Arriving on the heels of 2019's Live at The Fillmore, 2020's Kingdom In My Mind, and Oliver Wood's solo album Always Smilin' \u2014 all of which were released on Honey Jar Records, the band's independent label\u2014 Heart is the Hero is bold, bright, and singularly creative, a fully realized collective effort ultimately greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps that's to be expected from a group whose willingness to experiment has earned acclaim from Rolling Stone and NPR, as well as an annual touring schedule of sold-out music halls and theaters on both sides of the Atlantic. Ask The Wood Brothers, though, and they'll tell you to expect the unexpected.\n\n\n\n\"We are never satisfied if we are not searching for new musical recipes,\" says Jano Rix, nodding to the uncharted territory that Heart is the Hero covers. Chris Wood agrees, adding, \"We are one of those bands that isn't easily categorized. We know what our strengths are, but we can\u2019t help but push the envelope, as well. It\u2019s too much fun.\""}]}
