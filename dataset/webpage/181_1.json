Her voice manifests this diversity to its advantage: Koorax does not sound like a Brazilian singer or an American singer or a jazz singer or a pop or Latin singer. She sounds like she can sing just about anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtitle this set \u201cThe Dedication Album\u201d: the soothing and seductive opening version of Jobim\u2019s \u201cLigia\u201d is dedicated to Stanley Turrentine; \u201cMan Alone\u201d to Jimmy Scott; \u201cBlauauge,\u201d a duet with composer Friedrich on piano, to Art Farmer; and the title track to Mark Murphy (whose 1988 Milestone session, September Ballads, inspired this Dance ).\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \"Love Dance,\" performed with Azymuth, Koorax transforms one of Brazilian composer Ivan Lins\u2019 finest moments into one of her own finest moments, too. She sails with this smooth fusion band, letting the last few notes of a phrase throatily fade in a husky whisper (like Stan Getz on sax), sharpening and rounding notes\u2019 edges, then exploding like brilliant sunlight to close.

Also like Purim, Koorax has been tinted by classic jazz harmonies and phrasings\u0097and not just by vocalists (though Ella Fitzgerald and Shirley Horn are obvious influences), but particularly by horn players and pianists too.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoorax's impending greatness is evident from the very first cut, \"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\" which she dedicates to Miles Davis, who famously interpreted this ballad, and to Keith Jarrett. She radiates her \"ooo\" vocal sound to resound, then fade like a trumpet (which happens again later in her dedication of \"She Was Too Good To Me\" to Don Sebesky and Chet Baker, perhaps the song's most famous interpreter). Its closing is stunning and stratospheric; it dawns on you afterwards that you simply cannot sing \"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\" at least its last line, any better than this.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoorax also revisits two classics from Brazil's legendary composer Antonio Carlos Jobim: two versions of \"You Were Born to Be Mine (Absolut Lee),\" unfurling its introduction as long and elegant as a gown for a royal ball, then swimming in the liquid pools of Jobim's soft, almost hidden rhythms (\"dedicated to Jobim, of course!\"); and a dramatic \"How Insensitive,\" dedicated to Purim.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoorax fronts a piano trio led by Jurgen Friedrich with bassist Sergio Barroso and drummer Cesar Machado. They stretch out on the up-tempo numbers, particularly the middle passages of \"Walking Down the Street\" and \"Absolute Lee,\" and shift rhythms into a churning undertow beneath \"How Insensitive,\" but for the most part their instrumental support is dedicated entirely to the vocalist.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Ithamara Koorax on the web."}, {"url": "https://www.allaboutjazz.com/album/the-best-of-ithamara-koorax-ithamara-koorax/", "page_content": "\u00d7 Welcome to All About Jazz!\n\nWe sent a confirmation message to .

It seems constructed to honor legendary Brazilian vocalist Flora Purim and her husband/bandleader/percussionist Airto. This Brazilian Butterfly soars and flutters while multiple percussionists (often as many as four on the same song, most often led by the late and legendary Dom Um Rom\u00e3o, with Koorax frequently flailing away among them) knit together, pull apart, then reweave hot thick blankets of Brazilian rhythm.\n\nRom\u00e3o's \"Amor Em Jacuma occasions an international jazz jam as Ron Carter's thoroughly upright acoustic bass and Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba's roiling piano set table for a solo helping of meaty trombone from Raul de Souza of Brazil. Pianist Francesco Gazzara lovingly renders Hancock's title tune, especially in his solo, which builds up chords then reconsiders their construction in equal parts musical architecture and alchemy. Koorax breathes her most romantic vocal, and it's hard to imagine that many mortals can resist her languid invitation to \"Stay awhile... which just seems to float throughout the air forever, like... a Brazilian butterfly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining material seems specifically composed and arranged to stress test Koorax's four-octave range. She swings joyously from the framework of Milton Nascimento's \"Escravos de Jo, a melodic abstraction airy and inscrutable\u0097not packed full but no less complex\u0097as Joni Mitchell's Shadows & Light collaborations with Pat Metheny and Jaco Pastorius. Her voice soars above the Afro-macumba chant \"Lamento Negro and streams bright as dawn to open \"Fica Mal Com Deus, then completely changes tone and color by digging into the low notes with the growling fury of a blasting trumpet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opening \"O Vento and closing \"Frenetico drive Koorax's Brazilian journey further into outer space: Her voice intricately navigates the thorny, shimmering thicket of electric piano and four percussionists in \"O Vento and hangs in \"Frenetico, where the background frame of congas, bass drum and cymbal (not her voice) emerges as the lead instruments. Each is an excellent vehicle for discovering, then remembering, that Brazilian Butterfly is Koorax's most fertile adventure in exploring the boundaries of contemporary Brazilian vocal music."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/album/brazilian-butterfly-mw0001483151", "page_content": "It took three long years to record Brazilian Butterfly, by Rio de Janeiro vocalist Ithamara Koorax. It was worth the wait. A look at the cast on this enigmatic set reveals a cast of all-stars. That said, the treasure is bittersweet on at least one level. Three of Brazil's greatest musicians -- and integral parts of this album -- all passed away after these sessions were recorded: the inimitable drummer and percussionist Dom Um Rom\u00e3o, bassist Manuel Gusm\u00e3o, and percussionist Eloir de Moraes. The core band on most of these sides includes Rom\u00e3o, electric pianist and keyboardist Paula Faour, and other electric bassist Jorge Pescara and/or acoustic and arco bassist Gusm\u00e3o. That said, there are a slew of guests on the record as well, including Azymuth, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Ron Carter, Nelson \u00c2ngelo, Raul de Souza, Thiago de Mello, Jos\u00e9 Carlos \"Bigorna\" Ramos, the Francesco Gazzara Group on one cut, and numerous others. Produced by Arnaldo DeSouteiro, who also did many of the album's arrangements and played percussion on some tracks, the set was recorded live in Brazil with the exception of \"Butterfly,\" which was cut in Italy with Gazzara's group. According to DeSouteiro, Dom Um Rom\u00e3o did the only overdubs, layering percussion on the tracks where he also played drums, and on the title track where Koorax fronted Gazzara's band in Italy.\n\nMusically, this is the showcase for Koorax's voice that fans have been waiting for, and it awaits a wider audience who need only to hear this once to be enthralled and entranced by its sophistication and heart. She is a diverse, adventurous, and utterly gifted vocalist who cannot be reined in by the stereotypical categorization of what the current generation calls a \"female jazz singer.\" Here she digs deep into Brazilian and Latin and even African and Cuban folk forms, modern and classic samba, electric jazz, vocalese, and more -- anything to allow the song itself to come through. Does that make Brazilian Butterfly a fusion record? Yes, but not any kind of fusion outing you've ever heard. People who need categories will call this \"world fusion\". But in truth, this set creates something new and should perhaps be called \"organic jazz fusion\", or \"new Brazil.\" There are so many elements woven into a tapestry so colorful, so brilliantly melodic, harmonically adventurous and multi-textured, it cannot be contained in any preset box. That said it has a very classic feel to it. One can hear traces of the early CTI sound here, but that is in the elegance, grace, and soulfulness of the grooves rather than in the musical style, for which there is no equivalent. The production and sound quality of this disc are simply gorgeous. From the opening track, the mysterious ambience that is Dorival Caymmi's \"O Vento\" beckons. Ramos' flute and Rom\u00e3o's shimmering cymbals introduce it, along with percussion by DeSouteiro and de Moraes; the listener can hear the spacious tantalizing strangeness in this mix. Koorax begins singing languidly, as if from a distance, seamlessly bridging the instruments and a creating certain lushness even before the rest of the band enters. Over eight minutes in length, there are fine solos by Faour and Ramos before Koorax and Rom\u00e3o trade up call-and-response vocal improvisation. (Rom\u00e3o is not a singer, but he was such a genius that his voice was as skilled a percussive instrument as his hands and feet.) Koorax engages him in this solo and even gets guttural; it is startling and entrancing, and could have gone on for another five minutes it's so inventive. It is followed by \"Escravos de J\u00f3,\" with de Moraes doing his own vocal improvisation and rap as Koorax digs deep into a modally constructed, almost droning samba melody. Carlos Fuchs adds his acoustic piano to the electric one by Faour, and the layered percussion by Koorax, de Moraes, Rom\u00e3o, and DeSouteiro give it an almost hallucinatory feel. The funky fretless bassline and hi hat work with de Souza's trombone on Rom\u00e3o's \"Amor em Jacum\u00e3\" makes it an utterly contemporary and forward-looking jazz tune. Here is where DeSouteiro evokes the beautiful arrangements of the early CTI groove tunes. Rubalcaba's taut piano solo offers a knotty and funky groove even in counterpoint with the bassline and \u00c2ngelo's shimmering, acoustic guitar work as Rom\u00e3o lays down breaks against a spacious yet kinetic four-piece percussion section! Koorax's voice rises and glides above that intimidating group with ease. Her voice is as rhythmic as Rom\u00e3o's kit. She phrases to suit the song: her chameleon-like quality is what gives her a unique identity. She doesn't play the fragile beauty on these tracks, she gets into the vamps and grooves as much as the players do: check her wailing soprano solo near the end of this cut for evidence of her ability to solo with any instrumentalist. The band pushes a steady, funky, airy, Latin-cum-samba groove behind her.\n\nEach track on Brazilian Butterfly uncovers a new mystery, reveals a hidden treasure, proving, of course, that Koorax is virtually limitless in her abilities. The interplay between Rom\u00e3o and Faour's keyboards and Pescara's bass on \"Lamento Negro\" puts it all in high gear. Rom\u00e3o gives voice to his approval and Koorax is so heavy and deep in the cut that she's downright funky, but Brazilian funky, which means of course that it isn't only about chop, it's about chops in the song. Her reading of Herbie Hancock's \"Butterfly\" is a completely new interpretation. Arranged by and co-produced by Gazzara in Italy, his utterly haunting nylon string guitar and Rhodes and acoustic piano work present this beautiful jazz tune in an almost ethereal way. His manner of adorning Koorax's voice is not as strident as what is heard on the rest of the recording, but that said it serves a wonderful purpose in showcasing her voice in a context she is very familiar with as a wonderful singer of ballads. The Italian, Spanish, and soul touches he and his band play underneath her interpreting of those lyrics allows her to inhabit the song fully and, perhaps even Hancock would agree, make it her own. This is only the first half of the recording and it's already better than any vocal record issued in 2006.\n\nThe latter half is the same wondrous, seamless, classy yet gritty amalgam of seemingly disparate elements that work marvelously as a whole: there are fine solos by many performers on this set, as Koorax and DeSouteiro allow plenty of room for improvisation as long as it fits the songs like a glove. But the real treasure here -- and one that unfortunately not many Americans have had the real pleasure of encountering -- is her voice. Her confidence is legion. If all you ever heard from this disc was Geraldo Vandr\u00e9's \"Fica Mal com Deus,\" with its driving rhythms and her voice punching right through them to add yet another layer to them, you'd be left dumbstruck. The song is outstanding. Her chant-like vocal, which introduces \"Noite de Temporal,\" another of the three tunes here by Caymmi, offers more of that \"world music\" vibe to the mix, but in the best possible manner: the fretless and arco basses playing off one another, the tribal drums and double percussion of DeSouteiro and Sidinho Moreira in the extended intro are deceptive, because as Faour's keyboards enter, this sounds like an ancient song being brought into the new world, Killer reggae piano, funk electric bass, bowed classical folk lines, and Koorax's voice coming out of the ether of antiquity and into the flesh in the present is worth the price of admission alone. The album's final track, \"Fren\u00e9tico,\" is very special since it is a duet. Koorax and de Moraes engage in a work of pure improvisation with only their voices and percussion instruments. De Moraes does his own awesome and effective take on scat as Koorax uses her voice as an effect, a percussion instrument with chatters, skitters, swoops, and washes of guttural onomatopoeia. It's almost nine minutes long and goes by in a flash; it's a hell of a way to close what is already your greatest recording, stamping it so individually it becomes almost iconoclastic. It cannot be touched. On Brazilian Butterfly, Koorax has set a new bar for jazz vocalists who come after her. As she does, they will need to embody many traditions and musical histories, root them in the tradition, and be able to comfortably combine as well improvise seamlessly with and between them. Thus far, Brazilian Butterfly is the jewel in Koorax's crown and a watermark in the 21st century, not only for Brazilian jazz, but for jazz and world music as a whole."}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/917354-Ithamara-Koorax-Brazilian-Butterfly", "page_content": "This album is dedicated, with endless admiration and love, to the memories of the legendary arranger Maestro Gaya and his wife Stellinha Egg, the most important singer of Brazilian Folk Music ever!

My concentration, of course, was on lyric singing, classical music, mostly European music.\n\nAmong Ithamara's accompanists are guitarist John McLaughlin (on \"Man Alone,\" his first recording backing a vocalist), Azymuth (\"Love Dance\"), Marcos Valle (a duet performance of his composition \"Flame\"), and Gonzalo Rubalcaba (offering piano backing on \"La Puerta\" and Jobim's \"Amparo\"). Other tunes are Jobim's \"Ligia,\" \"Someday,\" \"Blauauge,\" and \"I Loved You\" (composed by the brilliant arranger Claus Ogerman).\n\nFor this new album--inspired by Mark Murphy's 1988 Milestone session September Ballads--Koorax and her producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro assembled a phenomenal international cast as well as a challenging, inspiring repertoire. Singing in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Koorax has chosen unexpected beauties from Brazilian masters including Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonfa, Marcos Valle, and Ivan Lins; from Claus Ogerman and pianist Jurgen Friedrich; and even Vernon Duke (a tender reading of \"April in Paris,\" recorded as a duet with Bonfa just a few months before his death).\n\nIthamara's extraordinary follow-up CD, Love Dance: The Ballad Album, will certainly establish her artistry in the most convincing possible terms. It was just voted #5 Best Beyond Album in the 2003 Down Beat Readers Poll, behind only the latest discs by Norah Jones, Steely Dan, Radiohead and The Roots. Love Dance was also acclaimed as one of the Top 10 Vocal Albums for 2003, by the critics of the prestigious The Independent Weekly.\n\nBack in 2000, Ithamara was voted for the first time one of the world's best jazz singers by Down Beat, also appearing as #3 Best Beyond Artist, behind only Sting and Carlos Santana, and ahead of such heavyweights as Tom Waits, Stevie Wonder and Joni Mitchell. Serenade In Blue (featuring Deodato, Jay Berliner, Azymuth, Dom Um Romao, Kevin Jasper, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Nelson Angelo) was voted #7 Best Beyond Album in that same 2000 Down Beat Readers Poll.\n\nAlthough Rio de Janeiro-based vocalist Ithamara Koorax has long been established as a recording artist in her native Brazil as well as in Europe and Japan, it wasn't until 2000 that American listeners were introduced to her unique vocal stylings on Milestone's Serenade in Blue. That release helped position her for a 4th-place finish in the Female Singer category--behind Cassandra Wilson, Diana Krall, and Dianne Reeves--in the 2002 Down Beat Readers Poll.\n\n\"But when I was around 18 or 19, I started earning money by singing ad jingles and doing backup vocals for many Brazilian pop stars. I realized then I wanted to do something else. I had become familiar with singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Elis Regina. But the most important influences on my singing were Elizeth Cardoso [the uncredited singer in the original Black Orpheus soundtrack], Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn, and Flora Purim.\"\n\nKoorax's reputation as a controlled and expressive vocalist spread quickly and her voice became a very hot commodity in studios all over Rio. Her first solo recording \"Iluminada\" launched her into the limelight when the song was included as the theme for one of Brazil's popular novelas (soap operas). The soundtrack went platinum and her career never looked back.\n\nIthamara soon began performing with the likes of Hermeto Pascoal, Edu Lobo, Azymuth, and Martinho da Vila, and returned several times to the hit parades with more novela theme songs. (In Brazil, everything stops for the evening soaps whose soundtracks become instant hits because of the hammering TV exposure. Inclusion in a novela is a very prestigious gig.)\n\nDescribing this emerging new voice, one of Brazil's top popular music critics, Tarik de Souza, wrote: \"Possessing a rare vocal range, Ithamara... exercises her well-crafted instrument in stylistic schools that run from Barbra Streisand and Johnny Mathis to Elis Regina, Yma Sumac, and Elizeth Cardoso. But she does so in her own way, alternating delicate intimacy with heated passion... a dazzling, heady lesson in vocal techniques.\"\n\nThen her fame spread halfway around the world. \"In 1991 the novelas had given me so much exposure,\" Itha recalls, \"even tourists were crowding my gigs.

The CDs she eventually released in Japan, including Luiza (1994), Rio Vermelho (1995, which, by the way, included Jobim's last recorded performance), and Almost in Love/Ithamara Koorax Sings the Luiz Bonfa Songbook (1996, featuring Bonfa, Ron Carter, Larry Coryell, Sadao Watanabe, and Eumir Deodato), have all been prominently recognized on Japanese best-seller and best-of lists.\n\nIn testimony to Ithamara's talent, composer and guitar legend Bonf remarked, \"It's an honor and a privilege to work with such a great artist as Ithamara, one of the best singers in the world.\" Jobim himself referred to her as \"simply one of the best singers on the scene.\"\n\nOn another front, her acid-jazz version of the Jo?o Donato/Caetano Veloso tune, \"The Frog,\" became a dancefloor hit in Europe in 1994, anticipating later collaborations with Dom Um Romeo (formerly with Sergio Mendes, Frank Sinatra, and Weather Report, among others), including an appearance on Rom?o's much-acclaimed albums Rhythm Traveller (1998), Lake of Perseverance (2000) and Nu Jazz Meets Brasil (2002), as well as on Brazil All-Stars' Rio Strut (2003) for Milestone Records.\n\nLater that same year, in an able display of her versatility, she recorded the first Brazilian album in the drum 'n' bass genre, Bossa Nova Meets Drum 'n' Bass, and participated in a recording of works by Brazilian classical composer Hekel Tavares.\n\nIthamara's Milestone CDs--both the new Love Dance and its predecessor Serenade in Blue--grew out of her desire to be known, not as a Brazilian singer of Brazilian music, but \"as a singer--period.\"\n\nLove Dance is a very personal record in which the musicians made deeply personal contributions, as composers and accompanists, to their friend and colleague Ithamara, who turned in some of her most affecting performances to date.

Jazz writer Ira Gitler introduced us. Ithamara was in town briefly to sing and had postponed her flight by a day just to make the soiree, which was softly lit and jammed with jazz legends. Singers Helen Merrill and Annie Ross were there. So were Joe Wilder, Teddy Charles, George Wein and about 50 other jazz luminaries. Ithamara was as lovely and as outgoing as her voice is on recordings, and what you see on stage is what you get when you have an animated conversation with her. Ithamara's latest CD, Bim Bom: The Complete Joao Gilberto Songbook, typifies her grace. The CD is an exuberant tribute to the bossa nova and the beat's low-key, unassuming inventor.\n\nIn Part 2 of my interview with Ithamara, the singer talks about recording on Bim Bom with guitarist Juarez Moreira, what she discovered about Gilberto's melody lines, recording with Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfa, and why all of her proceeds from Bim Bom are being donated to the Dizzy Gillespie Fund:\n\nJazzWax: You enjoy the sound of the acoustic guitar, don\u2019t you?\n\nIthamara Koorax: I do. I should have learned to play it, but I only studied classical piano. I feel fortunate for having had the chance to play with so many great guitarists. After I played with Luiz Bonfa and Larry Coryell on Almost in Love in 1995 and 1996, I invited Jay Berliner to record on my Serenade in Blue album. I grew up listening to his albums with Charles Mingus, Milt Jackson and George Benson. Then, John McLaughlin recorded with me as a guest artist on Love Dance. Now I'm working with Juarez Moreira.\n\nJW: How did you and guitarist Moreira work together on your new album?\n\nIK: We did the recordings in three days. Juarez lives in Belo Horizonte and I live about 270 miles away in Rio de Janeiro. So I sent him sheet music of the songs and a CD with a few tracks of Gilberto songs that weren\u2019t familiar to him.\n\nJW: Did you record together in the same studio?\n\nIK: Yes, yes. When I booked the studio, Juarez came to Rio, and on the first day we rehearsed for six hours. Then we did two six-hour studio sessions for two consecutive days. All of the tracks were recorded face to face in the studio, and most of the songs were first takes.\n\nJW: No overdubbing?\n\nIK: I don't like to overdub vocals unless I'm doing electronic projects and working with programming and sequencers, which was not the case here, of course. So what I sang with Juarez is what you hear on the album. On a few tracks, Juarez felt he should add a second guitar for the solos, to not lose the groove of the rhythm guitar.\n\nJW: What input did arranger and your long-time producer Arnaldo DeSouteiro have on the album?\n\nIK: As usual, Arnaldo was essential. He suggested tempos, helped us find the best keys, prepared the basic arrangements and then asked Juarez and me for suggestions. He kept us focused on the spontaneity and asked us to not over-rehearse or lose the creative vibe. [Photo: Ithamara, Luiz Bonfa and Arnaldo DeSouteiro]\n\nJW: How did Arnaldo work with Juarez?\n\nIK: Arnaldo knows how to create and sustain a happy mood in the studio. At the same time Arnaldo also is a perfectionist, which is why he has worked with so many great artists, including Joao Gilberto [pictured]. In just a couple of hours, it seemed as though Juarez and I had been friends for decades. Arnaldo also interacted a lot with engineer Geraldo Brandao, who already knew how Arnaldo wanted my voice to sound. Everything clicked, and the bonding made the mix sessions easy and joyful.\n\nJW: What did you discover about Gilberto's music that may come as a shock to some readers?\n\nIK: What I discovered is that Gilberto\u2019s music was much more difficult to sing than I imagined. As a singer you have to deal with so many things at the same time with Gilberto\u2019s [pictured] songs. You need to be subtle, you need to sing softly, but you also need to deal with rhythm\u2014all at once. And it all happens so quickly that you can't think about it. You only need to do it.\n\nJW: You worked with Antonio Carlos Jobim. What was he like in the studio?\n\nIK: Jobim was very important to my career because he gave me a great deal of support in my early years. For my first album, Ao Vivo (JVC) in 1993, I included four or five Jobim songs. After his sister Helena Jobim, a poet, gave him a copy of my CD, he called to congratulate me. He said, \"Next time, please invite me.\" So in 1994 when I started working on my second CD, Red River (Paddle Wheel), I selected three Jobim songs and took him up on his kind offer.\n\nJW: What did he say?\n\nIK: His only request was, \"Please book a studio with a good Steinway!\" Actually, we did only one session together, in October 1994. Those were some of the most special six hours I have ever experienced in my life. He was very kind and was telling jokes the entire time. I felt he was trying to make me feel relaxed. Then, out of the blue, he suggested that we do a song titled All That's Left Is to Say Goodbye, which isn\u2019t among his most famous songs. He said it was special to him, because he had recorded it with Astrud Gilberto on The Astrud Gilberto Album, her debut album in 1965. This was such a compliment. [Pictured: Ithamara and Antonio Carlos Jobim]\n\nJW: Did you know the song?\n\nIK: Yes, but I wasn't intimately familiar with Astrud's version at the time, even though I owned a copy of the album. I loved the version that Swedish singer Monica Zetterlund made of the song during her live recording with Bill Evans after their famous studio date in 1975. [The song is called Samba in discographies.]\n\nJW: What happened next?\n\nIK: We clicked. After we recorded All That's Left Is to Say Goodbye, we had lunch. Then we recorded two more songs. But Jobim wasn't totally satisfied with his performance. He said, \"I need to go to New York next week, but we'll record again as soon as I come back to Rio\". I was thrilled. One of the songs was titled Absolut Lee, and I started to study it. But he died in New York in a hospital after complications from surgery to remove a tumor. Nobody knew he had cancer, so Brazil was in a state of shock when he died.\n\nJW: How did you feel?\n\nIK: I felt devastated and decided to include only All That's Left Is to Say Goodbye on my album. The other songs I recorded with Jobim remain unreleased. I added other Jobim songs to the play list: Correnteza, a song Jobim co-wrote with Luiz Bonfa, who came in to play guitar on the track, and Zingaro, which I recorded with bassist Ron Carter [pictured].\n\nJW: How did Luiz Bonfa differ from Jobim?\n\nIK: Both had what I call \"sophisticated souls.\" Both were gentlemen and geniuses. They worked together often in the 1950s and 1960s in Brazil, and both performed at the famous Bossa Nova at Carnegie Hall concert in 1962. Soon after both were signed to Verve by producer Creed Taylor.\n\nJW: You recorded an entire album with Bonfa, yes?\n\nIK: Yes. Almost In Love: Ithamara Koorax Sings the Luiz Bonfa Songbook (Paddle Wheel), which was a Top 15 album on the Japanese charts. The title track is a lush bossa nova that Bonfa wrote for Elvis Presley, who had a Billboard Top Pop chart hit with it. I was fortunate to record once again with Ron Carter as well as with Sadao Watanabe and Larry Coryell on that album.\n\nJW: What was Bonfa like?\n\nIK: Bonfa and I were neighbors for 10 years in Rio. We used to meet at least twice a week, sometimes just to chat. There were times when he would pick up his guitar as soon as I arrived at his home to show me new tunes he was working on. He wrote a couple of songs especially for me, which was a huge honor, especially because he was so reclusive, like Joao Gilberto.\n\nJW: Did you perform in concert together?\n\nIK: Bonfa loved to appear by surprise at my concerts, bringing his guitar and offering to sit in. The first time he did that, he entered the backstage, asking from the wings: \"Don't you want to hire a guitarist for this band?\" The musicians who played with me at the time recognized him instantly, of course, and were blown away. They felt so intimidated by his presence that they feared performing without a rehearsal. Bonfa was like a god to them. [Photo: Luiz Bonfa, Ithamara and John McLaughlin]\n\nJW: What did you do?\n\nIK: I started that concert by going off-stage and taking Bonfa on stage by the hand. As I led him out, I said to the audience, \"We have a very special guest tonight, and he will start the show playing his song Manha de Carnaval from the movie Black Orpheus. When the audience realized Bonfa was there, they started to scream. He played superbly, of course, and we got a standing ovation on the first song! I'll never forget that night.\n\nJW: You do quite a bit of touring.\n\nIK: I'm just back from my third European tour this year. I performed at 47 concerts overseas in 2009, for a total of 82 concerts if you include my gigs in Brazil. My goal is to sing all over the world, I want to conquer new audiences all the time. That's why I do concerts for 1,500 people in Finland and 4,000 people in open-air jazz festivals in Korea. Last month I performed for the first time at jazz festivals in cities where I had never been before like Belgrade, Indija and Sofia, and people loved my music.\n\nJW: I hear that the proceeds from Bim Bom are going to charity?\n\nIK: Yes. I'm always involved in charities and benefit projects. I'm donating all of my revenue from Bim Bom's sales to the Dizzy Gillespie Memorial Fund of the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, N.J. I sing to give love to the people and receive love back. God gave me a gift. I can't disappoint Him.\n\nJazzWax tracks: Ithamara Koorax's Bim Bom: The Complete Joao Gilberto Songbook features 11 songs composed by the creator of the bossa nova beat. Gilberto wrote only 11 songs that he and others have recorded. Joining Ithamara is acoustic guitarist Juarez Moreira. The liner notes are by Ira Gitler.

Despite being good friends and incredible musicians, Hancock and Marsalis had very different ideas about what constituted good jazz, and bad music.\n\nBut entertainment value aside, it was also a fascinating look into the way that perceptions of genre have made an impact on the development of jazz over the years.\n\nWynton and Herbie: Background\n\nThe story really starts a year earlier, at the 26th Grammy awards in early 1984 \u2014 but first, a little background on our two players.\n\nHerbie Hancock is one of the most important American musicians in the last 50 years, not just in jazz. He grew up playing classical piano but was introduced to jazz in high school. He went on to release some really incredible solo albums and played in one of the legendary Miles Davis lineups in the 1960s alongside Tony Williams on drums. Importantly, Hancock then went on to be a pioneer of jazz fusion in the 1970s, especially with the record Headhunters. This was all while Miles Davis was pushing into jazz-rock fusion, alongside players like John McLaughlin and Zoe Zawinul.\n\nWynton Marsalis is younger than Herbie and played with Herbie Hancock\u2019s band early in his career. In the 1980s \u2018The Young Lions\u2019 \u2014 a group of players that included Marsalis and his brother Branford \u2014 were tearing up the jazz world. There were all exceptional players, but they basically ignored the fusion and free jazz movements at the time, almost exclusively embracing older jazz styles, especially bebop and hard bop. Neo-bop is sometimes used to describe the music they played, although we\u2019re really stretching the genre names at that point.\n\nTurmoil at the Grammys\n\nSo back to February 1984, at the Grammys.\n\nWynton performed and won two statues that night: best solo jazz instrumental performance best solo classical music performance. Wynton has always kept a foot in both camps.\n\nHerbie Hancock had a good night as well, winning the Grammy for best R&B performance for Rockit, which he also performed on the night.\n\nRockit was a pop smash, coming from Hancock\u2019s experimentation with synths, drum machines, and other staples of pop production. Rockit\u2019s music video was also important, later winning 5 MTV video music awards. Along with Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller, Rockit was one of the first music videos by a black artist to be played on MTV, which made it much easier for other black artists to get on the platform.\n\nBut back to Wynton\u2019s Grammys. His acceptance speech included a slightly controversial line. In accepting the Grammys, he thanked:\n\n\u201cCharlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Louis Armstrong \u2014 all the guys who gave an art form to the American people that cannot be limited by enforced trends or bad taste.\u201d\n\nWere Wynton\u2019s enforced trends and bad taste referring to Hancock? Or maybe Miles Davis, who\u2019d recently returned from a hiatus with a series of funk albums? Was Wynton condemning them for abandoning jazz? Miles thought so \u2014 he was later quoted saying:\n\n\u201cHe sounded to me like he\u2019s supposed to be the savior of jazz \u2014 Sometimes people speak as though someone asked them a question. Well, nobody asked him a question.\u201d\n\nWynton Marsalis later said Miles and Herbie weren\u2019t in his sights, but Wynton has also said he likes drama, so he probably knew he\u2019d ruffle some feathers.\n\nHerbie and Wynton sit down\n\nJump ahead a year, where Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis are sitting down for a joint interview with Musician magazine. The Grammys are directly discussed early on\n\nThere\u2019s a great exchange later where Marsalis fleshes that out.\n\nIn a different exchange, Hancock does a good job of outlining the more open view on the relationship between genres.\n\nThat final quote I\u2019ll include from the interview is the one I enjoyed the most, but remember that these two men have a lot of respect for each other, so there\u2019s no hostility here.\n\nThey\u2019re nothing if not blunt.\n\nTwo friends disagree\n\nBesides the entertainment of a bit of drama, the interview illustrates something fascinating. These two, absolute giants of the genre, have two completely different opinions on what constitutes musical artistry.\n\nEven if you think Wynton is the inspector general of the jazz police, there\u2019s no denying his skill. And even if you think Herbie Hancock is a fame-hungry sellout, you\u2019d have a hard time arguing against him being one of, if not the most influential jazz player of the last 50 years.\n\nAs it\u2019s put in the original article, \u201cMarsalis is in a bind: while he does not respect what Hancock respects, he cannot help respecting Hancock.\u201d\n\nAs far as the actual definition of , we\u2019re probably a long way past it referring to a singular genre. Knowing that a piece of music is , , or doesn\u2019t really tell you anything about the music. These are some of the broadest possible categories, and jazz should be considered the same. Whether that includes tunes like Pharaoh\u2019s Dance , Rockit, or Lingus is up to you.\n\nThe importance of argument\n\nThe fact is, Wynton comes up short in the interview on a few occasions. It\u2019s hard to say that pop music is a lower form of art than jazz in a room with Herbie Hancock, who\u2019s been successful in both styles.\n\nBut I do want to defend Wynton, not for his opinions, but for how important it is for him to have them. Lots of opinions about jazz are controversial, but those debates about the meaning and importance of jazz are what give its relevance over time.\n\nIt\u2019s not about saying who was right or wrong after the fact \u2014 instead, we should try to understand how people related to their music at the time it was being created, in order to really understand the true history of jazz, not some idealised history we think it should have had.\n\nTo get a real sense of this idea, you should read the article for yourself. You\u2019ll find the full interview in the anthology Keeping Time: Readings in Jazz History .\n\nMarsalis and Hancock also spend a lot of time in the interview talking about the place of race in jazz. That\u2019s not my story to tell, and they do a good job of it on their own."}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/4594656-Herbie-Hancock-Featuring-Wynton-Marsalis-Ron-Carter-And-Tony-Williams-Quartet", "page_content": "Recorded at CBS Sony Studios,\n\nShinanomachi, Tokyo, Japan\n\n\n\nMastered at Precision Lacquer\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\n\n\nThis Is A Digital Recording, Recorded Using\n\nThe Sony PCM 1610 Digital Recording Process.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1982 CBS Inc./\u2117 1982 CBS Inc./Manufactured by Columbia Records"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Ithamara-Koorax", "page_content": "Ithamara Koorax (born 23 May 1965) is a popular Brazilian pop-jazz singer.\n\nContents\n\nIthamara Koorax was born in Rio de Janeiro, and has worked with such artists as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Luiz Bonfa, Ron Carter, Larry Coryell, Elizeth Cardoso, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, John McLaughlin, Sadao Watanabe, Hermeto Pascoal, Marcos Valle, Peter Scharli, Jay Berliner, Edu Lobo, Martinho da Vila, J\u00fcrgen Friedrich, Claus Ogerman, Dave Brubeck, Jo\u00e3o Donato, Dom Um Rom\u00e3o, Thiago de Mello, Mario Castro-Neves, Raul de Souza, Chris Conway, Eumir Deodato, Lou Volpe, Laudir de Oliveira, Rodgers Grant, Gil Goldstein, Art Farmer, Eddie Gomez, the groups Azymuth, Gazzara and Os Cariocas, the big bands Amazon and Rio Jazz Orchestra, and the Symphony Orchestras \"Petrobras\" and \"Jazz Sinfonica\".
