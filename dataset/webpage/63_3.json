T. PACAUD (Megantic):\n\nMr. Speaker, the debate, through the speeches which have already been made, has rohbed me of arguments which I intended to offer the House, and I shall therefore willingly curtail my remarks somewhat.\n\nThe question of the food supply which is raised by this motion involves considerations which are of the utmost importance both to our country and to our Allies. No other question, Sir, has stirred and aroused the people of Canada more fervently, moire deeply or more unanimously. This intense feeling which has been growing and spreading steadily since the outbreak of war may easily be explained by an impartial survey of conditions as they have existed and still exist in Canada at this time. On the one hand we have the prohibitive prices, which deny to the masses the very necessaries of life, with the accompanying hardships and misery. On the other hand we have the revolting disclosures that have been made from time to time concerning the hoarding of food, the cold storage opera-1SJ\n\ntions, the nefarious greed of the profiteers. These, Sir, are the outstanding facts which cannot he denied. Mr. O'Connor has exposed them to the public. We had the story of the bacon manipulations; we had the egg disclosures; and more recently, and through another source, we heard of hundreds and hundreds of pounds of chicken left to rot in cold storage at Winnipeg. I hese may serve as illustrations of what i3 going on in Canada on a very large scale. Sir, in the face of such disclosures, nothing effective was done or attempted to be done by the Government to remedy snch an evil. Are we not tempted, Sir, to laud the patience of the Canadian people in the face of euch provocation from the men who daily exploit them', from the Government who refuses to protect them?\n\nWhat has the Government done? A Food Board was created and a Food Controller was put in control. The Order in Council creating this board gave the Controller clearly defined powers. He had the right \" to govern the prices of any article of food and to supervise the storage, .the distribution, the sale and the delivery of these articles.\" Why were not these powers exercised, exercised especially in the cases which have been brought to the attention of the public by the High Cost of Living Commissioner?\n\nInstead of taking immediate steps to curtail this open exploitation of the public, the Government, through its commissioner, preferred to follow the easier course of preaching economy to the people. Under the circumstances which I have related, I say that these mere words, followed by no effective action, may have satisfied the cold storage magnates, but they certainly have not satisfied the people of this country.\n\nWe have in Canada an abundance of food, sufficient not only for our own needs, but the greater bulk of which is exported to allied countries. This brings me to another phase of this same question-the campaign of production which the Government has so fervently prosecuted of late. To this campaign all loyal Canadians will give their hearty support. We all recognize that upon the success of our devotion to food raising depends in a large measure the victory of our hoys at the front. We -know that the world faces to-day a food situation which is nothing short of appalling. We know that the supply is not sufficient to feed the world's armies, let alone the civilian population. But, Sir, this is not all. We have had occasion ^ to hear the representatives of. Britain making to us an appeal,-\n\nan appeal which will surely be heard and responded to, and which has thrilled each one of us in a patriotic determination to strive every nerve to do what is requested of us. Lord Rhondda, the British food controller, for one, has made his plea quite clear. \"We look,\" he says, \"to the resources of Canada and the indomitable energy of Canadians for an answer that will shatter Germany's threat of starvation.\" He tells us, that it is vital for the United Kingdom and the Allies to obtain from Canada foodstuffs in far larger quantities than under peace conditions. His frankness even goes so far as to recall to us that an increased export of food supplies must be forthcoming, even though the achievement of this task entails diversion of,effort from other enterprises. It is Canada's duty to prove her efficiency and her determination. This plea must not be left unanswered. May I be permitted to confess that these words of the British food controller are comforting to those of us who through motives which cannot be challenged, opposed a measure which wre sincerely believed if put into operation would decidedly diminish if not defeat our effectiveness in this war, by laying aside the most formidable weapon which could have been used against the enemy. We faced a storm of abuse and slander, but these attacks did not deter us from what we believed was our plain duty. We have at least the consolation of knowing that our conception of duty was shared, in some measure at least, by the brightest minds of Britain. What we need to-day, is a larger acreage and higher yields for the years to come. We need to increase our productive capacity, the problem is with us, and it must be solved. Upon its solution, to my mind, depends the success of our allies and ourselves in this war. To achieve our purpose, it is obvious that we need farm labour. It is not less obvious that it is a national necessity that we should remove the duties on farming implements. The Government have started in their task by means of the registration of the man power of the Dominion. I believe that, though that is a good step in the right direction, it has come a little late; it should have been done at the very beginning of the war. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope, that in its results it may procure more information and attain better results for Canada and for the Empire than has been achieved by the now famous National Service cards of a year ago.\n\nMr. J. IE. FONTAINE (Hull) (translation) : Mr. Speaker, I am perhaps a little\n\naudacious in rising to take part in this debate, since I have just entered this Parliament, and am in nowise familiar with Parliamentary procedure; nevertheless,\n\nwhen the voters of Hull county, which I have the honour to represent, elected me by acclamation on the 19th of last November,\n\nI gave them my solemn promise that I would seize upon every opportunity offered to protest against the exorbitant cost of living and try to bring it down if it were possible to do so. It was reserved, Mr. Speaker, for the right hon. leader of the Opposition, to afford me this opportunity in bringing about this debate this afternoon; for him who, in contrast to the hon. gentlemen seated on the other side of the House, has always been the protector and the defender of the people against the trusts and the monopolists.\n\nIt is useless, I believe, for me to say that the present cost of living has reached a price so high that the consumer is forced ti deprive himself even of necessaries of life. I could mention things, foods like flour, bacon, eggs, which have surely increased 50 and even 100 per cent. If, at least, Mr. Speaker, salaries had increased in proportion; but I see, by the reports of the Labour Gazette which I have here before me, that salaries have not been increased by more than 15 to 17i per cent. There has been a general protest. I remember, in the city of Hull, where I reside, on the other side of Ottawa, hearing Mr. Watters, the president of the Labour Unions of Canada, denounce the Minister of Labour (Mr.'Crothers) and even denounce the Prime Minister of this country because the workingmen could not procure the necessaries of life with the low salaries they were paid.\n\nIn the face of these protests the Government thought they would calm public opinion by appointing what they called a Food Controller, and it was then that the Government told us of the appointment of Mr. Hanna. Everybody was satisfied, the people believed that the .Government was sincere and that by their appointing a Food Controller we could at least earn enough to enable us to buy the necessaries of life. The irony of it, Mr. Speaker ! The Controller was well and duly appointed; he was given spacious offices, and it is said that his suite was furnished with luxury and that he was given a staff, both very numerous and very expensive-if I believe the gentlemen who have preceded me-and still he was not controlling; the cost of living was soaring all the time.\n\nA moment ago I heard my hon. friend, the Minister of Customs, say that the appoint-\n\nment of the Controller did not aim at control. My iLord! we were well aware of it, he never did control! His duty consisted simply in seeing that no food was wasted. Could he have forgotten what my hon. friend from Meg-antic (Mr. Pacaud) said a while ago? Haven't we learned, in the last few days, through the newspapers, that a large ..quantity of foodstuffs, hoarded in storage warehouses in order to boost prices, had been sent to the incinerator in the city of Winnipeg? Well! if the duty of the Food Controller was to prevent the waste of foodstuffs, why did he allow such .an enormous quantity of food to find its way to the garbage heap? Is it because those implicated are the friends of the Government? I ask you that, Mr. Speaker."}, {"url": "https://www.lipad.ca/members/record/68071fca-03f2-4f7c-b33c-2ed63bb08327/2/", "page_content": "Mr. LUCIEN TUEOOTTE PACATJD (Megantic):\n\nMr. Speaker, in availing myself of this opportunity of discussing the Treaty of Peace, it seems hardly needful for me to say that I fully recognize and appreciate not only the vastness of the problems involved, but also the far-reaching consequences which they will ultimately have on the future of Canada. Laying aside for the time being the reservations and the criticisms which a perusal of this document may suggest to one, I feel prompted at the very outset of my remarks to recall the magnitude of the task of those whose mission was to draft this Treaty, to pacify a world which had, during four years of war, suffered the greatest carnage known in history. I could not better illustrate the thought which I wish to convey, Mr. Speaker, than by citing\n\nthe word of a great French writer and statesman: That during the seven months which preceded, the signing of this Treaty it was as if humanity had been placed on the dissecting table so as to better discover the mystery of its new organism and of its new life, to detect and to stamp out from its very soul the venom which had poisoned it in the past and nearly brought it to its downfall. This was the lofty purpose which the representatives of the great powers had in view, and to what extent their efforts were crowned with success a study of the document which is now the subject of this debate can alone enlighten us.\n\nA Treaty, Sir, which has for its object the re-modelling of a whole world, when presented for ratification to this Parliament -though I strongly hold, as others have done before me, that this ratification is alike dangerous and unnecessary-should not at least have prompted the Government to pursue the course which they had intended to pursue-to snatch from any individual member of this House the time and opportunity to study this Treaty with the care and attention which the interests of this country demand. Such hasty action, Sir, as it was intended to impose upon us was not justified, in my opinion, on any ground of reasoning, and furthermore, may I add, it was in direct contradiction of the attitude which had been taken by the governments of France, of Great Britain and of the United States where the statesmen seem to respect more clearly the privileges and the rights of Parliament than the genr tlemen who for the time being are occupying the treasury benches of this House.\n\nWishing, Mr. Speaker, to curtail my remarks as much as possible, I will endeavour as briefly and as clearly as I can to lay before the House the general conclusions which I have reached and which will explain the vote I intend to cast on this most important matter. It is a fact that this Treaty has been severely criticised and in some quarters unmercifully assailed by men of outstanding character and reputation in all the allied countries. Let us not be surprised at this divergence of view on the part of men who are not responsible for the framing of this instrument, when we recall that the Treaty itself is but the result of a compromise between those who had the responsibility of drafting it.\n\nBearing this thought in mind, what do we find in this Treaty? We find features which will assuredly have the hearty support of the interested people. We find clauses which do not live up to our expectations;\n\nwe find others, again, which seem to shatter the very hopes of those who have sacrificed so much, by endangering the safety and future freedom of action of the countries which they indirectly affect.\n\niSir, what appeals to me most strongly in this Treaty is that in it are to be found, though modified and amended, the principles which prompted and inspired the famous fourteen articles of President Wilson, which at the time of their pronouncement on the 8th of January, 1918, stirred the Allied world, and commanded its hearty and enthusiastic support. What are these principles? Could they not, when considered in their last analysis, be reduced to the following three political axioms:\n\n1. That each part of the final settlement should be based on justice, under reserve of dispositions the most proper to guarantee permanent peace.\n\n2. That no territorial settlement should be made that does not comply with the interests and advantages of the populations involved in the said settlement.\n\n3. That each well-defined nationality should see its aspirations realized in the fullest measure.\n\nMr. Speaker, looking over this Treaty from cover to cover, though we may perceive that these axioms were not always rigorously adhered to, can we not proclaim that it is through the instrumentality of these principles that new nations have come to life, endowed with the blessings of freedom, at last delivered from the yoke of oppression? Unfortunately, Sir, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that great as has been the advance in the right direction, there are still many flaws in this Treaty, regrettable omissions which we may hope soon to see remedied and adjusted. I am frank to admit that for myself I should have liked at this moment, when we are witnessing the births of nations, the resurrection of Poland, the transfer of Alsace-Lorraine to its rightful owners, to see also the final settlement of the Irish question. I only hope and pray that the bitterness engendered through centuries of struggle in that country may soon disappear through the influence of freedom, generously accorded to her people.\n\nThese, Mr. Speaker, are the three considerations which the study of this Treaty from its larger aspect have suggested to me.\n\nI now come to the last and most important point which I wish to raise, as many others have done who preceded me. Is it necessary for this Parliament to ratify this Treaty? What would be the consequence of our ratification or of our .abstaining from ratify-\n\nmg the Treaty? In what direction lies the surest safeguard of Canadian interests, which we are here to protect? These questions have been raised and fully discussed in the course of, this debate. I unhesitatingly range myself with those who have argued, to my mind so well and so conclusively, that ratification by this Parliament is unnecessary and that whatever may be our action in this House, the Treaty will remain unaffected. No amount of sophistry, from whatever quarter it is launched, can, in my opinion, effectively veil this truth: that in the authority within the British Empire to which belongs exclusively the right to declare war in the name of the Empire-the King and his constitutional advisers-is alone vested the power to make peace for that Empire. What, therefore, are the motives that have prompted this Government to such hasty action-to the calling of a special session to ratify a Treaty that needs no ratification by us? It is in the Covenant of the League of Nations, and especially in Article X, that we may find a reason for their action.\n\nI do not wish, Mr. Speaker, to he understood as being opposed to the principle of the League of Nations. I strongly believe that permanent peace cannot be hoped for without the closest co-operation between the democratic nations of the world. These nations are called upon to protect and to defend two principles: the principle of justice inherent in the aspirations of their people, and the principle, too often forgotten, of mutual respect among all nationalities. In the defence of these principles, and to better assure that peace and justice may in the future triumph in the world, we are now erecting a new organism representing alike nationalities and democracies-an organism which is embodied in the Covenant of the League of Nations. But, Sir, could we not have attained this same high purpose through other means than by those which bind this country in the future to abide by the decision of a Council in which we shall not be represented-a decision which may be so far-reaching in its consequences as to have the effect of dragging us into a war, of conscripting our young manhood and our wealth for the purpose of protecting the territorial integrity of other nations, and this without giving to our Parliament the right to deliberate and to decide on the merits of the case?\n\nThe Government, by forcing us to ratify a Treaty though no good can be derived from such action and though no necessity is apparent for it, are only taking advan-\n\ntage of the reluctance that a member may have to reject it on general grounds, in order that they may better pursue their old policy of imperialism in disguise-always ready to raise an altar to Canadian autonomy, but never failing to undermine in action what they so highly praise and proclaim in words.\n\nThis, Mr. Speaker, is the situation as it presents itself to me. It is grave and critical, endangering, as it does our future freedom of action. By the adoption of Article X we are stripping this Parliament of its most valued prerogative; we are placing the Canadian people at the beck and call of a Council not responsible to the nation for its actions. By one stroke of the pen we are mortgaging our freedom, receiving practically nothing in return.\n\nOur prospects under this arrangement are not bright. Let us at least comfort ourselves with the hope that the prophecy of President Poincare of France may yet be realized, when he said that \"real and permanent peace will not emerge from any single instrument of peace, but will be the outcome of a never-ceasing and collective effort on the part of the allied and associated powers.\"\n\nMr. FRANK B. STACEY (Fraser Valley): Mr. Speaker, as I recall the words of the hon. gentleman who leads the Opposition (Mr. McKenzie) in his opening remarks this afternoon, with regard to what should he the characteristics and qualifications of those who take part in this debate, I assure you that it is with the greatest hesitation that I rise to offer any observations whatever upon the subject which is occupying the attention of this House.\n\nWhen Parliament assembled a week ago I had no intention of making any remarks upon this subject. I mistakenly assumed that the language of the document which we are now considering would be couched in legal and technical phraseology and that an ordinary man would have difficulty in understanding it and should, perhaps be silent when the time for discussion came.\n\nBut I found that what is, to my mind, the very heart of the document was capable of interpretation by an ordinary layman or workingman like myself. While I do not presume to discuss the question from the standpoint of its constitutionality, I purpose offering some observations as to the Treaty, especially that part of it called the Covenant of the League of Nations, as it appeals to the ordinary man, to the .man in the street, to the man who is not versed in the technicalities of legal inspection and\n\ndiscussion, But as it is, I believe, regarded by the great majority of ordinary men and women who are interested in knowing something about the real, practical meaning of this Covenant of the League of Nations. I shall not pretend nor attempt to speak respecting the Treaty of Peace itself.\n\nIt strikes me-and I believe it appeals in this way to hundreds of thousands of our citizens-that after five years of agony, heartaches, carnage and immeasurable destruction, the allied nations conceived an idea, that grew into a plan, which was finally formulated into a document, which gives greater promise and 'hope of a lasting peace in this world than has ever before been seen or known by men in the long and chequered history of humanity. The preamble itself is a remarkable and striking statement, a tribute alike to the high spirit of the signatories, and, under the circumstances, to their magnanimity as victors.\n\nI shall presume to offer a few remarks on the article that has been referred to so frequently, not only this evening, but on previous occasions, namely, Article 10. As I have intimated, I have not had a legal training. I do not pretend to read into this Treaty possible difficulties; I do not pretend to be able to discuss the constitutional difficulties which may arise, which are possibly real and genuine and which this nation may have to face in the future. But I remember this, that objection has1 been taken to Article 10 by hon. gentlemen opposite because its .provisions may involve us in conflicts in some far-away section of Europe, or in some distant portion of South America. We must not forget to-day that the world is very small, so small that Jules Verne's book has long since been thrown into the bonfire, and it is quite possible that there are within this Chamber hon. gentlemen who themselves may voyage around the world in less than eight days. All those manifestations and conditions which obtained a generation ago are changed. If distance is to be measured by time, the Atlantic ocean is not any larger than some of our great Canadian lakes used to be. Why should not Canada have a place in the League of Nations? During half a century or more we have grown out of a national infancy and childhood and youth into a young manhood; we have been under the protection of the great Mother Country, and there is, I am sure, no disposition on the part of any one to-day to 9 p.m. break with England. She has, in *a sense, led us by the hand until now, reaching the stage of manhood, we\n\nare, I trust, prepared to take our place beside her, shoulder to shoulder, in every great plan which looks towards the peace, prosperity and happiness of the world. Hon. members opposite have to-day been searching the pages o.f history to ascertain some precedent for the action that is now proposed to be taken. As I see it, we are not reviewing history, we are making history; we are not following precedents, we are establishing precedents. And, why should we not, as a self-governing nation, be prepared, at this stage in our history, to assume our place and take our full measure of responsibility at this critical time in the history of the world?\n\nIn my province, which province by the way sent more than 10 per cent of her total population to the front, there were, during the course of the war-I regret to say this, but I want to be honest-a few men who apparently did not realize the duties of citizenship. True they claimed and desired all the privileges of citizenship in my province; they claimed the right to the franchise; they sought the protection of the British navy and also, the protection of the allied forces, including the protection of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. But for one reason or another they did not enlist. Sometimes they had a fluttering around the heart; sometimes they thought they had a flatfoot, and occasionally we found them obsessed with the idea that they needed a change of climate. For the benefit of their health or for the advantage of their pocket, they concluded that a trip across the line to the 'south would be of advantage to them, and so they went. At any late, they failed to join up, and we had in our province a few men who, while they desired all the privileges of citizenship, refused to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nI fear lest there may be some spirit akin to the foregoing in the action of those gentlemen here or elsewhere who would like to have the full protection afforded this country by the ratification of the Treaty of Peace, including the League of Nations and including Article X-who would like to have all the advantages and all the privileges, without assuming the responsibilities and obligations which are embodied in that article. It was very aptly pointed out by the hon. member for Megan-tic (Mr. Pacaud), if I mistake not, that this proposition is the application of the idea and principle of co-operation-national co-operation. This is true. I cannot conceive of the Canadian Parliament or the\n\nCanadian people refusing to approve of the Treaty of Peace, especially with regard to this Covenant of the League of Nations. The preamble, I may say, is a marvellous introduction to a state paper that will take its place by the side of any state paper in the annals of human history. I shall read two or three sentences:\n\nIn order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security -by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war.\n\nI call attention to the three succeeding clauses:\n\nBy the prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations; by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among governments; and by the maintenance of justice and the scrupulous respect of all Treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another.\n\nAs I understand it, Mr. Speaker, these three last clauses that I have read contain the very reasons which led 32,000 of our young men five years ago to rush to Val-cartier. These three clauses give the reason why, a little later in the dark and awful days of the four years that followed, over half a million more of their brothers and sisters went to their aid. The reason is found in this preamble. There is no additional reason to be ascertained; it lies here and here alone. But the words of this preamble are words and only words. They are great words; they will be historic words, and will ever be read as an expression of high statesmanship and of splendid ideas.; but they are words only. The essence, the acid test of this preamble, is found in Article X. You cannot make use of the preamble legitimately, reasonably, logically, without also accepting Article X. 1 believe in my heart, Sir, that it would be an example of the very personification of audacity for any man or any Parliament to say: \"We refuse to approve of Article X,\" and then have the nerve to proceed to approve of the remaining two hundred pages. In the days of. the future should the storm break over our heads or over the head of some other small nation, we are united in our aim to speedily bring the struggle to an end and protect the weaker nation. I claim that there is a greater probability, amounting almost to a certainty, of actual peace than could possibly be secured without the provisions of Article X. And should the storm break and troubles come, then we are prepared to do our share. I take it, Mr. Speaker, that Article X of this Covenant means in\n\nsubstance, in commonplace phraseology stripped of all legal technicalities, that we believe in peace and want peace. It means that we want peace ourselves and want peace for all nations of the world; and because we want it and because we bate war, we are willing to co-operate with other nations in keeping the world's peace so far as may be humanly possible. Is it not reasonable and sane, iand comparatively sure, that with these provisions and with these ideas there is greater probability of peace than if we and all others refused to say \"We shall bind ourselves together in the joint interests of humanity.\" Moreover, is it not a laudable aim for any young nation just entering upon its maturity to ally itself with the very highest civilization of the globe in its determination to be, in a very broad sense, the safeguard and advocate of the peace and prosperity and liberty of the world?\n\nThere is one view of this question that has not been presented to this House. It may not, strictly speaking, be involved in the letter of the Treaty, indeed, I am willing to admit, that it is not; but it appears to me to be a question of very great and serious import. And not only in my humbly judgment but, I believe, in the judgment of the great bulk of the citizens of Canada the question is agitating their minds: They are thinking and speaking about the matter which I am going to venture to introduce to this- House now.\n\nI shall assume that this Parliament will ratify the Treaty of Peace; I shall assume that otir country is entering upon a new era, upon a new and larger life. She has won by the valour of her sons upon the battle field and by the statesmanship of her legislators in the councils of the nations a very high place in the world's record of great deeds. The world over the magic word Canada\" upon the shoulder straps of every Canadian soldier from the humblest private to General Sir Arthur Currie, has been both the pride of the wearer and the admiration, if not indeed the envy, of every observer. With these facts and results behind us, and with a future that one can hardly overestimate ahead of us, and entering now upon a larger national life my problem is: How shall we the Canadian people so relate ourselves to the new conditions and to the new national life to ensure that our country will become not merely great in population or in wealth, but in all those higher attributes of mind and spirit which alone are the assured factors in national prosperity? This, Sir, is the question that has been in my mind and\n\nwhich is in the minds, I have reason to believe, of our best citizens and I believe also, although not expressed as yet, in the minds of the members of this House.\n\nWhere is the Canadian citizen who has not been thrilled, who has not even been moved to tears at the recital of deeds of unparalleled heroism by our soldiers overseas? And of equal courage and matchless devotion of our daughters as they have taken their places in ministering to the needs of those who have been wounded? How can we, I repeat, in view of all these things, so relate ourselves to the future that we shall be equal to the increased responsibilities and obligations which are resting upon us as a nation? If there is any phrase or single sentence that better embodies or suggests the answer to my query than another, it is this: The character and the development of our Canadian citizenship. I am well aware of the fact that this is neither the time nor the place to discuss that question at length, but I shall venture to give a few moments to it because of the reasons I have assigned.\n\nIf I might express in the most general terms my appreciation of the character and the qualities suggested in the term \" Canadian citizenship \" I would do it by referring to four main factors which contribute to such a true and desirable Canadian citizenship. First, in our homes we shall be compelled through youthful inquiries in the future to lay greater emphasis upon patriotic principles and the relation of the family to national life than we found it necessary to do prior to 1914.\n\nThen there is the Canadian press. I suppose that in referring to it I am treading upon sacred ground-or otherwise.. I cannot help but feel that, notwithstanding the very efficient service rendered by the Canadian press to Canadian ideals and to the true spirit of Canadian citizenship, there is one thing that I would fain see changed and changed for the better. I do not think that the cynical spirit sometimes continued almost to exaggeration by the press is conducive to the development of the highest type of Canadian citizenship and ideals. I come to another factor that enters vitally into the character and development of our Canadian citizenship and that. Sir, is found in our school system. We are coming to a day of change. The best citizens behind our public schools realize . that mistakes have been made in the past and that some change is necessary. Throughout this land there is an idea that the day is not far distant when the passing of an examination\n\nwill not be regarded as the be-all and end-all of our public school life. Greater attention must be given to the expression of the individual as a factor in our national life. But speaking of our educational work as a great factor in our national life, I place special emphasis upon the opportunities and obligations of our Canadian colleges.\n\nI do riot now refer to the technical institution which furnishes our country with experts either industrial, economic, professional or scientific. I have in mind the college of liberal arts whether for ladies exclusively or the university course for both sexes leading to the Bachelor's degree. These institutions are in the main turning out not professors or scientific or economic experts but citizens who will take their place in the ordinary ranks of domestic or commercial life, but who, by reason of their extraordinary educational advantages, should be more than ordinary citizens. That is to say, the main objective of the college of liberal arts should not be scholarship but citizenship. The latter must become the goal, the former, a means of reaching it. Our country's future will be largely determined by the ideals of citizenship inspiring our people. The great opportunity and business of the college and university is to project upon society broadminded, or rather spacious-minded, men and women, well-balanced and sane, who will become big citizens. Our country's supreme need to-day, to-morrow and for all time, is not so much bright scholars as big citizens. We need more bigger, broader, better citizens, and the college system or curriculum which fails to produce the goods must either be changed or ultimately go to the scrap heap. The citizen does not exist for the college, but the college for the citizen. Education is of real value only as it qualifies for, and results in, good citizenship. Many a good citizen has never had a college life, but a good citizen is always a truly educated man, nevertheless. Perhaps I can best explain my meaning by the following illustration: A\n\nfew weeks ago I ran across a man in my province who, from the standpoint of the schools, would be called an uneducated man. In fact, Sir, he himself claimed to be an uneducated man and deplored the fact most sincerely and heartily. But I found that he could give me the name and the characteristics of every plant that grew in that district. He could tell me the names and describe the uses of all the trees in that section of the country. If a bird flew by or alighted upon a tree he could\n\ntell me its name and give me all its characteristics. If he saw the footprint of an animal on the ground he could tell me its name and describe its habits-in fact, he was a reliable authority on the entire flora and fauna of that district, and yet he claimed to be an uneducated man. As I said, from the standpoint of the schools, he was uneducated. He knew little of mathematics, less of literature, I doubt if he could spell the word \"philosophy,\" and he thought he knew nothing of science. Moreover, Sir, he was a good citizen, inasmuch as he took his part in the great war faithfully and well. And last June, when the whole of the West between the Bed river and the Pacific was threatened with an incipient Soviet revolution resulting in some of its leaders being imprisoned and not, as the hon. the leader of the Opposition described the other day as being driven to prison because they were labour leaders-far from it, and let me say that the records of the courts have vindicated the position I took here last June and take here to-night-during that unsettled month this man acted as a steadying force in the community. He counselled against rocking the boat. He was a sort of moral and social anchor during the troublous times of last June. He counselled quietness, and steadiness, while some so-called scholars counselled otherwise. That man, Sir, was a good citizen, and from the standpoint of Canadian citizenship well-educated, although from the viewpoint of the schools, he would not perhaps, in the past at least, be so designated. My argument comes to this point: that our university life must so shape itself to meet the demands of the coming generation that the great aim of every college of liberal art in this Dominion, from ocean to ocean, would be nothing less than to turn out the very highest type of Canadian citizenship that can be produced within its walls. This man to whom I refer, I think, illustrated better than any one I have ever met the thought that was given expression to by John Milton two hundred and fifty years ago, and I doubt if his definition has ever been excelled, when he said:\n\nI call therefore a complete and generous education that which enables a man to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously, all the offices, public and private, both in peace and war.\n\nNow, I come to discuss, for a few moments only, another factor, another great force, in the creation of a right ideal of Canadian citizenship. I have briefly\n\ntouched upon the home, more briefly upon the press, and perhaps at greater length upon the college. But, Sir, there is still another factor which plays a most important part in the development of that type of citizenship which will enable us as a people and as a nation to take our place and maintain it in the days to come through the new relations that are put upon us. I refer, Sir, to the influence, and the power, and the work of the church. The college man says a good citizen must be an educated citizen. I agree with him, I accept his statement. The church-man will say a good citizen must be a Christian citizen. I do not deny the statement, I am inclined to agree with him. iBut, Sir, I believe this country has come to realize that notwithstanding all they have done in the past the churches of this land must lay more stress, more time, and more energy, upon those means which tend towards the development of a high ideal of Christian citizenship. That church, individual or denominational, will take its place in the Canadian life which, in the largest degree promotes a true and strong citizenship, and not very much longer will there attach to the cloth as such any special recognition or any inherent authority in the social world.\n\nThe churches of our realm have done a grand work for the Empire during the past four or five years; but they have a greater work to do from ocean to ocean in seeking upon all occasions to inject into the minds of their people the paramount importance of Canadian citizenship. I said a few moments ago that the college existed for the citizen, and not the citizen for the college. I go further and say that the church exists for the citizen, and not the citizen for the church. That church will take its place and do its work that sets before its people the highest type of true Canadian citizenship. It is not the cut or the colour of the leader's garb that to-day has or to-morrow will have any influence along the line of real leadership. It is not what is below a man's collar that makes for citizenship, but what is above it. What is above it is of prime importance; what is below vit is of very minor importance.\n\nThe ratification of this Treaty of Peace, including the Covenant of the League, of Nations, Mr. Speaker, will take place, I believe. That means that we are entering upon a new era with a new and a larger life. Our responsibilities are great, our obligations are heavy, but our resources are\n\nalmost boundless. With faith in our future and with confidence in one another and with a sincere purpose to give the very-best that is in us to our country and to posterity, I believe that we can and will not only take our place but maintain that position in the world's great League of Nations.\n\nOn the motion of Hon.

T. PACAUD (Megantic):\n\nMr, Speaker, in rising to take part in this debate, I do so with no intention of discussing at any length the resolutions presented to us for our consideration. I do not pretend to be able to handle this great question, involving as it does so many important features of financial intricacies. But, Sir, the discussion that has been going on, the speeches which have already been delivered during this debate, have cleared the air considerably. They have dissipated many misapprehensions which have been expressed throughout Canada during the last few months concerning the financial standing of the Canadian Northern Eailway system, apparently intended to justify in the eyes of the people of this country the action this Government intended to take in this matter. But the speeches in this debate have been of greater value to the people and have given us a great deal of the inside history of the Canadian Northern railway. The hon. member for Calgary (Mr. Bennett), in his eloquent and most interesting speech, told us that a great deal more could be told to this House and the country if only the proper means could be taken to achieve this end. For my part, I should like to have the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nAt the outset let me say I absolutely agree with the opinion which has been expressed during this debate that a third transcontinental railway was an ultimate\n\nnecessity for this country, if it was not actually a present and immediate necessity. These words to me are words of hope and confidence in the future of this country. It is a policy which has been adopted, it is a hope which I believe is shared by the vast majority of Canadians. But, Sir, this fact alone does not justify us in acting hastily with regard to the resolutions now submitted to us. To-day this Parliament is called upon once more to come to the assistance of the Canadian Northern railway to the extent of $45,000,000. We have been generous to this railway enterprise in the past. We are told that, by this agreement to-day, we are becoming a partner. Then, I say, Sir, it is our first duty as representatives of the people to see what this new partnership means for the people; for we know just what we are going to pay, but we do not know so fully what we are to receive for our money. I go further and say I believe it is our duty, before even discussing the merits of this resolution, to know the men with whom we are called upon to deal. We have been told in this debate that Messrs. Mackenzie and. Mann have given ample evidence of pluck and courage. That is true, and it cannot be denied; and we may say without fear of contradiction that they have shown special zeal in looking after their own interests. For this we cannot blame them-far from it. But their action during the experiences we in this House have had with them should bring us to the view that we also have interests to protect-the interests of the people of Canada. And if we were to go back and review our dealings with these men and the results of those dealings, they could be summarized in one word; that that word would spell 'deception.' Last year we voted millions to the Canadian Northern, but we voted them upon one condition, because we were told that that money would be sufficient to complete the line. To-day these men are again at the door of Parliament seeking new assistance. Last year we were told that if we voted these millions we would have one-tenth of the stock of the Canadian Northern railway. But we have not one-tenth of the stock of the Canadian Northern railway. And' when to-day the Solicitor General comes forward and tells us that by this new arrangement we are to have a two-fifths proprietorship, I ask, what greater guarantee we have this year than we had last year that these terms will eventually materialize? With these fact.? before us, I\n\nclaim that we should pause and we should investigate. Let us know upon what grounds we were deceived last year; we may then be able to prevent a repetition of such actions. Sir, there is no need to hurry this proposal through. Thebe is no financial crisis before us such as has been so vividly portrayed to us by the Tory press of Canada. The Canadian Northern railway can meet their liabilities- Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann tell us so. And these resolutions tell us so, for they stipulate that not a dollar of this $45,000,000 shall go to meet the liabilities of this company. Therefore we can pause and we can investigate, and that is our duty under the present circumstances.\n\nOne word about the security we are to receive for this money. In the first place, we are told that we are to have a mortgage on the stock of the subsidiary companies; but we are told that ten of these companies are already mortgaged for $18,000,000. We are told that we are to get a floating mortgage on the property of the Canadian Northern railway. But we see that that property is also mortgaged to the extent of $312,000,000. Then, we are also to have a mortgage on the property of subsidiary companies, but this is limited and will not cover the whole amount of the $45,000,000 we are asked to vote, but every one of these subsidiary companies will have the right to give a mortgage only for that part of the $45,000,000 which is to be expended in the territory in which it operates. And lastly we are to have forty per cent of the common stock of the Canadian Northern railway. As has been said, though we are giving the bulk of the money, we are getting a junior partnership and will have no control. To me this is not satisfactory. The Solicitor General (Mr. Meighen), tells us this is the best security we could have. The hon. member for St. Antoine (Mr. Ames) tells us that it is a splendid bargain. ,But, immediately after, the hon. member for Calgary (Mr. Bennett), rises, and after a four hour speech giving the history of the Canadian Northern railway, he warns us: Do not act hastily, for the basis of these resolutions is deception, and deception again. I say it is our duty to look into these matters; and these contradictions iwe have heard from the other side of the House afford us much stronger reasons for investigating this matter before proceeding any farther.\n\nWhat has been the result as it has developed from the discussion which we have heard? What will be the position of\n\nCanada? We are told, and it is the only conclusion which we may draw from the arguments which we have heard in this House during this debate, that if we ado.pt these resolutions, if this measure goes through, Canada will be 'fourth mortgage behind an enterprise which is1 already soaked with watered securities and watered stock. For my part I cannot accept these proposals and I intend to vote against them.\n\nThere are many other points upon which I would have liked to have touched, which only go to strengthen my conviction that the Government have not safeguarded sufficiently the interests of the people of Canada. If we give assistance that assistance should be coupled with an assurance that the money which we are voting will be used to pay the debts, to complete the line so that these gentlemen will never have to again return to this House for further assistance. I do not believe that that assurance is guaranteed to us in the resolution. Finally, and this is my last grievance, I fail to see why the Government did not exact from the Canadian Northern railway what the Parliament of 1884 exacted from the Canadian Pacific railway under circumstances similar to those of to-day. These promoters-, if they wish to impress faith and confidence in their enterprise upon us sitting here as representatives of the people, should first pledge their personal wealth to the final success of their own work and undertaking."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/lucien.pacaud/2169997", "page_content": "Lucien Pacaud\n\nDiplomat politician\n\nSeptember 21, 1879 (age 80) Trois\u2010Rivi\u00e8res, Mauricie, Canada\n\nHe represented M\u00e9gantic in the Canadian House of Commons from 1911 to 1922 as a Liberal member.

His father, then a notary in Saint-Hyacinthe, had fought at Saint-Denis and Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu and had been imprisoned in the Montreal jail. He had later moved to Saint-Norbert d\u2019Arthabaska (Norbertville). Through unknown circumstances, however, Ernest was born in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, where he is believed to have attended an English elementary school \u2013 probably the French and English academy run by G. W. Lawler. On 4 Sept. 1861 he began his classical studies at the S\u00e9minaire de Nicolet, and he completed them on 16 May 1868. He was then articled as a clerk to his uncle \u00c9douard-Louis*, a lawyer in Arthabaskaville (Arthabaska), which was the principal town of the Arthabaska district and had a population of about 800. The Pacaud family, with notary Philippe-Napol\u00e9on and his brothers \u00c9douard-Louis, merchant Charles-Adrien, and businessman Georges-J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, exercised considerable political influence in the district. Their houses were centres of Rouge ideas. At the home of his lively uncle \u00c9douard-Louis, the gathering place for members of the local \u00e9lites, Ernest met Wilfrid Laurier*, who was eight years his senior; the boundless admiration he felt would develop into a firm friendship over the years. It was he who persuaded Laurier to run for Drummond and Arthabaska in the 1871 provincial election. Laurier would later observe that Ernest \u201cchanged my life and fixed it upon the unfailing object of all my thoughts and aspirations.\u201d According to Charles Langelier*, during the Fenian invasion of 1870 [see John O\u2019Neill*] Pacaud set aside his legal work and joined the militia as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-Colonel Louis-Charles-Auguste Lefebvre de Bellefeuille, brigade major for the district of Saint-Hyacinthe. This service would earn him the medal awarded by Queen Victoria in 1899 to veterans of the 1866 and 1870 Fenian raids.\n\nPacaud was called to the bar on 8 July 1872 and quite naturally decided to set up in Arthabaskaville. Practising on his own, he argued cases before all the courts. He was undeniably successful \u2013 around 1877 he estimated his annual income at approximately $4,000 \u2013 but his true passion was politics. He played an important role in the rise of Laurier. At the time of the Pacific Scandal [see Sir Hugh Allan*], he encouraged him to take the plunge into federal politics under the leadership of Alexander Mackenzie*. The federal election of February 1874 coincided with a provincial by-election in Drummond and Arthabaska. Laurier ran for the House of Commons and Pacaud for the Legislative Assembly. The two men conducted a strenuous campaign side by side. Laurier was elected, but Pacaud lost to William John Watts. He was at Laurier\u2019s side again in the fall of 1877, when his friend went down to defeat in Drummond and Arthabaska and then won a resounding victory in Quebec East.\n\nThese were decisive years. In Arthabaskaville Pacaud had his initiation into politics, establishing contacts and sometimes friendships with future leaders of Quebec society. Among these associates of his uncle and Laurier were Joseph Lavergne, Louis Fr\u00e9chette, Laurent-Olivier David*, Joseph-Xavier Perrault, Charles Langelier, Lawrence John Cannon*, Hector Fabre, and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lemieux*. He also discovered his true vocation: journalism. On 5 Oct. 1877, at Laurier\u2019s urging and his, some of their friends launched Le Journal d\u2019Arthabaska. It began as a pro-Laurier election sheet but, with Pacaud\u2019s enthusiasm and federal government contracts, it became a militant regional newspaper. Journalism is \u201ca thankless profession, to be sure,\u201d Pacaud observed, but he found it exhilarating. During these years he diluted his Rouge ideas with Laurier\u2019s pragmatic liberalism and, under the influence of the small anglophile community of Arthabaskaville, he began to imitate the ways and lifestyle of a British gentleman.\n\nOnce the Liberals were in power at both Quebec and Ottawa, they wasted no time in placing their men in the key administrative posts. On 14 June 1878 Henri-Gustave Joly\u2019s government offered Pacaud the positions of protonotary of the Superior Court, clerk of the Circuit Court, and clerk of the crown for the District of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. Its gesture was a recognition of his competence, his past services, and the need to guarantee the future. There was no reason why he should refuse an offer that, in his view, \u201cwas honourable, represented a sort of promotion in my profession, and brought in a handsome income.\u201d In carrying out his duties he demonstrated genuine efficiency and strict political neutrality: no meetings or political discussions were held in the protonotary\u2019s office or the clerk\u2019s office. He had not withdrawn from political life, however. His appointments were the result of a decision by the Liberal leadership to disseminate the party\u2019s ideas and to organize its support in the Trois-Rivi\u00e8res region. The naming of an assistant to Pacaud in May 1879 coincided with the appearance of La Concorde, a newspaper which came out in a weekly and a tri-weekly edition. It displayed a moderate Liberalism and, as implied by its name and its motto, \u201cThe country\u2019s interests before party interests,\u201d its aim was to unite moderates of all political stripes around an honest and prudent government, that of Joly. The paper had a particular focus on the development of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and on the political concerns of Pacaud\u2019s brother-in-law Arthur Turcotte, the speaker of the Legislative Assembly. Pacaud assumed responsibility for La Concorde\u2019s political thrust and seems to have worked at organizing the party. The defeat of the Joly administration in October 1879 brought a reversal in his fortunes. The Conservatives of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res called for his dismissal, and Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau*\u2019s government relieved him of his duties as protonotary and clerk on 20 Feb. 1880. By the 25th Pacaud had returned to the practice of law, in partnership with his brother Auguste in Pacaud et Pacaud at 15 Rue des Forges in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. On 19 April he became editor of La Concorde and he proved to be a fiery polemicist, thoroughly conversant with the mysteries of politics.\n\nBy the spring of 1880 the Liberal press, cut off from lavish government contracts both at Quebec and at Ottawa, was in trouble. Le National of Montreal had ceased publication in 1879 and L\u2019\u00c9claireur of Quebec in March 1880; La Concorde was struggling with financial problems. Only the Montreal papers La Patrie and L\u2019Union survived the d\u00e9b\u00e2cle, but their radicalism was damaging to the party. Joly and Laurier raised money from their friends to found a newspaper at Quebec that would counterbalance Joseph-Isra\u00ebl Tarte\u2019s Le Canadien. The first issue of L\u2019\u00c9lecteur appeared on 15 July 1880. Laurier, Charles-Antoine-Ernest Gagnon, and Charles Langelier and his brother Fran\u00e7ois* helped with the paper, but it lacked an editor who could take on Tarte. Laurier, who wanted to keep control of its content, designated his friend Pacaud. On 18 December Pacaud assumed the editorship and became one of the main organizers of the Liberal party at Quebec. His aim was to bring moderate Conservatives into a coalition with moderate Liberals, and his strategy consisted of undermining the credibility of the Conservative right wing: the clique around Louis-Ad\u00e9lard Sen\u00e9cal* and the ultramontanists associated with the Cercle Catholique de Qu\u00e9bec. His candidacy in Bellechasse in the spring of 1882 against Guillaume Amyot*, who soundly defeated him, seems to have been dictated more by circumstances than by desire for a parliamentary career. Pacaud had a talent for polemics and a genius for organization. L\u2019\u00c9lecteur pursued the ultramontanists: it opposed the Jesuits who wanted a university, and supported division of the diocese of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (which its bishop, Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lafl\u00e8che*, fought against) and the introduction of state control over insane asylums.\n\nDespite his intense activity, Pacaud did not neglect his personal interests. He gradually tightened his grip on Plamondon et Compagnie, a partnership that had been publishing L\u2019\u00c9lecteur since 1 July 1882. Its principals were Pacaud, Joseph Plamondon, a tanner, Joseph Archer Jr, a lumber merchant, and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Joseph Auger, an accountant. Pacaud had subscribed one-third of the capital of $1,500. He owned one-third of the equipment, valued at $1,000, and drew a monthly salary of $100. When the agreement expired on 1 July 1883, Pacaud and his friend Charles Langelier became the sole partners. At that time L\u2019\u00c9lecteur was still a small business; Pacaud served as publisher and, with Ulric Barthe, as editor, Eug\u00e8ne Leclerc* acted as general factotum, and Arthur Marcotte as printer and accountant. Deprived of government contracts, it struggled along and from time to time Pacaud called on the generosity of Laurier, who apparently took steps to stabilize the company. On 1 May 1885 Langelier withdrew from it and was replaced by Barthe, but this arrangement was a pure formality. The two partners would declare in a document notarized on 10 July 1889 that \u201cthe name of Monsieur Ulric Barthe appears in the articles of incorporation for the ownership of the aforementioned newspaper only as a gesture of courtesy and for appearance\u2019s sake.\u201d Where had Pacaud found the money to become the sole owner of L\u2019\u00c9lecteur? From Louis-Ad\u00e9lard Sen\u00e9cal, according to the ultramontanists; from Laurier, according to Liberal rumours. Whatever the case, Pacaud was henceforth the newspaper\u2019s proprietor and had to answer to no one but Laurier.\n\nBy 1885 Pacaud was respected as a person, formidable as an opponent, and influential as a power in the Liberal party. His headquarters on Rue de la Montagne (C\u00f4te de la Montagne) occupied a single dusty room with a faded screen marking off a secluded area for the two editors and the rest given over to the factotum. Small in stature, always correctly but unpretentiously dressed, ever polite and courteous, Pacaud was full of exuberant friendliness, contagious good humour, and feverish activity. Generous and loyal to a fault, this man who could not remember having missed an election campaign since 1867 had learned over the years to keep private morality separate from political morality. He would use the scaffold in Regina [see Louis Riel*] to propel Honor\u00e9 Mercier* into power. On 17 Nov. 1885, the day after Riel was hanged, L\u2019\u00c9lecteur appeared with a black border. Pacaud was a member of the Comit\u00e9 National de Qu\u00e9bec and amongst those who wanted to transform the nationalist movement in the province into a political party. He was the organizer and treasurer of a coalition that brought together Liberals, Conservatives, and ultramontanists. By his editorials, which were both rallying calls and war cries, by his carefully framed speeches packed with statistics, by his caustic and fiery wit, and by his ability to size up a situation quickly and take action, he disarmed more than one opponent and played a powerful role in securing the Parti National\u2019s election victory of October 1886.\n\nThe formation of Mercier\u2019s government late in January 1887 placed Pacaud at the centre of political power. As publisher of L\u2019\u00c9lecteur and organizer and treasurer of the Parti National, he became an \u00e9minence grise, an effective political power-broker, and the main dispenser of patronage. His first move was to consolidate the government press. On 26 March he founded Belleau et Compagnie to take over publication of L\u2019\u00c9lecteur and of La Justice, which a group of National Conservatives (Guillaume Amyot, Louis-Philippe Pelletier*, and Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Belleau) had launched in January 1886. The company had two partners, Belleau and the printer Arthur Marcotte, who in fact was only a front for Pacaud. Plamondon et Compagnie, which continued to own L\u2019\u00c9lecteur, assumed responsibility for its political thrust. The Compagnie d\u2019Imprimerie Provinciale did the same for La Justice. The establishment of Belleau et Compagnie made economies of scale possible: the separate editorial offices of the two papers were in the same building, which provided a room and services for their common use, as well as a lawyer\u2019s office for Louis-Philippe Pelletier, the president of the Compagnie d\u2019Imprimerie Provinciale. It also facilitated an equitable allocation of government contracts. Well fed at the public trough, L\u2019\u00c9lecteur diversified and improved its material, with Louis Fr\u00e9chette, Napol\u00e9on Legendre, Arthur Buies, and James MacPherson Le Moine* contributing signed articles. But it remained a newspaper of opinion, concentrating on politics and written for the \u00e9lite, with a circulation of less than 5,000.\n\nIn a new office \u201cliterally papered,\u201d according to Rodolphe Lemieux*, \u201cwith portraits, emblems, [and] political sketches recalling the great periods of Liberal struggle in Canada,\u201d Pacaud, who was writing less and less, drew with Ulric Barthe the broad outlines of an editorial policy. He had only two ambitions: the victory of his party and the success of his newspaper. His tireless energy was placed at their service. He quickly sensed trends in public opinion, anticipated Mercier\u2019s wishes, and put together schemes that brought results. Along with Charles Langelier at Quebec and Cl\u00e9ophas Beausoleil and Raymond Pr\u00e9fontaine in Montreal, he was the master chef of Mercier\u2019s kitchens, resuming on behalf of the Parti National the political brokerage system of his Conservative predecessors. He appointed office holders, selected candidates in the ridings, awarded contracts and speeded up payment of government accounts, collected kickbacks, paid the premier\u2019s bills, and to please the ultramontanists could use his pen as a holy-water sprinkler. Pacaud\u2019s lifestyle and that of his friends became luxurious. So much power and shady dealing aroused passions. His opponents saw him as an unscrupulous agitator, the second-hand dealer of \u201cofficial\u201d patronage. In May 1889 Calixte Lebeuf and La Patrie denounced \u201cPacaud and his gang.\u201d With the approach of the 1890 elections, rumours of scandal multiplied. An affair involving John Patrick Whelan, a contractor who reportedly had obtained contracts through bribes or kickbacks, was said to be only the tip of the iceberg. In April 1890 Lebeuf gave Pacaud a stern rebuke: \u201cIt is openly said that this government is the most corrupt ever to sully the panelled walls of the legislative building; that everything there is for sale; that there are no principles, no honesty, no trust, no honour.\u201d Nevertheless, Mercier won the 1890 election with an increased majority. But cracks were beginning to appear: the ultramontamst press, concerned about the rampant corruption, and Pelletier\u2019s La Justice, which objected to state control of asylums, took an independent position on certain questions, particularly on the loan that the premier was going to negotiate in Paris.\n\nWhile he was away Pacaud settled a number of irritating matters. He cut off government contracts to the ultramontamst papers and had Pelletier ousted from the presidency of the company that published La Justice. He manoeuvred the government into paying damages of $175,000 to Charles Newhouse Armstrong, a contractor who had been excluded from the Baie des Chaleurs Railway Company. This transaction gave rise to rumours that were confirmed by an inquiry launched in August 1890 by the Senate railway coinmittee. Pacaud was believed to have pocketed some $100,000 and distributed it to friends. There was a huge scandal. Mercier repudiated Pacaud. Lieutenant Governor Auguste-R\u00e9al Angers* appointed a royal commission of inquiry, which held hearings in October 1891. Pacaud declared that he had used the money to pay election expenses, to underwrite the operations of certain newspapers, including the Waterloo Advertiser and the Quebec Daily Telegraph, and perhaps, inadvertently, to pay off a few personal debts. On 16 December the commission concluded \u201cthe transaction between Armstrong and Pacaud . . . was fraudulent, contrary to law and order.\u201d Angers dismissed Mercier as premier and in the election that ensued the Conservatives swept the Liberals from office. Pacaud faced two charges, one in the Superior Court for having masterminded the fraud connected with the Baie des Chaleurs Railway Company, and the other in the Court of Sessions of the Peace for having conspired with Mercier to award a contract to Joseph-Alfred Langlais for supplying stationery in return for a 20 per cent commission on government purchases. He was acquitted by both courts, but thereafter the Liberals made him confine his activities to journalism.\n\nLaurier, now the leader of the party, deplored Pacaud\u2019s mistakes but was unstinting in his help, friendship, and advice. The editorial line he laid down for him can be summed up in three points: maintain a united front within the Liberal party, go easy on the Catholic bishops, and tone down personal attacks. \u201cIt is time,\u201d he wrote to Pacaud on 27 Nov. 1894, \u201cfor you to turn over a new leaf, and for your newspaper from now on to have its own style, a superior style, beyond and above the vulgarities of our country\u2019s press. No more personal abuse, no more diatribes, no more invective.\u201d However, the hotheaded editor could not always curb his sudden changes of mood. His editorial of 28 Jan. 1896 sharply criticizing Bishop Michel-Thomas Labrecque for requiring Catholics to vote only for candidates who would support the remedial legislation on the Manitoba school system [see Thomas Greenway], deeply upset Laurier. Other articles on the rights of the church with regard to schools, and the serial publication of Le clerg\u00e9 canadien: sa mission, son \u0153uvre, a pamphlet by Laurent-Olivier David that had been condemned by the Congregation of the Index, brought episcopal wrath down on Pacaud\u2019s head. On 27 Dec. 1896 the cur\u00e9s read from the pulpit a collective letter by the bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Quebec that forbade the reading of his newspaper. The Liberal leadership decided to put up a fight. Pacaud changed the paper\u2019s name and the next day, on the same presses and with the same staff, he published Le Soleil. He appealed to the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda and, to cover his tracks, the Compagnie d\u2019Imprimerie de Qu\u00e9bec was set up, with Pacaud as the principal shareholder. Bishop Labrecque\u2019s next punitive move was to forbid the reading of Le Soleil. Apostolic delegate Rafael Merry del Val lifted the ban during his stay in Canada in 1897. From then on Pacaud had smooth sailing in Laurier\u2019s wake. He supported the Laurier-Greenway settlement of the Manitoba school question, held forth on the many varieties of imperialism, spoke out against the pitfalls of too much provincial autonomy, attacked the nationalism of Henri Bourassa* and Joseph-Isra\u00ebl Tarte, and argued in favour of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Quebec Bridge Company.\n\nBut Pacaud was prematurely worn out. In July 1903 he fell seriously ill. Confined to his bed, he dictated articles and sketched out editorials. A stay in Florida did not help him. Back in Quebec, he turned to Laurier to reorganize Le Soleil in the interests of the party and his family. The ill feeling between factions in the party made it difficult to settle the question. Judge Philippe-Auguste Choquette* was hoping to buy the paper and turn it into a pro-Laurier publication, but Simon-Napol\u00e9on Parent*, who was then premier of Quebec, opposed the idea. Laurier preferred that Le Soled \u201cbe the organ of no one in particular, but that its sole mission be to defend the party.\u201d He imposed his choice. In early December 1903 the Compagnie de Publication \u201cLe Soleil,\u201d made up of Liberals of all shades, including Choquette and Parent, bought the paper for about $112,000.\n\nErnest Pacaud, who according to Laurier was \u201cnot only the heart and soul of this enterprise,\u201d but had \u201cincorporated [it] into his own person,\u201d died reassured about the future of his life\u2019s work. He left behind the memory of a devoted and sincere friend, a loyal party-member, and a courageous fighter.\n\nMich\u00e8le Brassard and Jean Hamelin"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/pacaud_edouard_louis_11E.html", "page_content": "PACAUD, \u00c9DOUARD-LOUIS (baptized Louis-\u00c9douard), lawyer, public servant, businessman, and politician; b. 20 Jan. 1815 at Batiscan, Lower Canada, son of Joseph Pacaud, a carpenter, navigator, and merchant, and Ang\u00e9lique Brown; m. first 28 July 1841 Anne-Hermine Dumoulin at Yamachiche; m. secondly 2 July 1868, at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Fran\u00e7oise Dumoulin, in all likelihood his first wife\u2019s cousin; four daughters were born of these marriages; d. 18 Nov. 1889 at Arthabaskaville (Arthabaska), Que.\n\n\n\nLike his six brothers and four sisters, \u00c9douard-Louis Pacaud had the advantage of sound teaching; he undertook his classical studies at the S\u00e9minaire de Nicolet between 1826 and 1832, and on 25 May 1836, after studying law under Antoine Polette and Edward Barnard in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, he was granted his commission as a lawyer. He was practising there when the troubles of 1837\u201338 broke out, but unlike his brothers, Philippe-Napol\u00e9on, Charles-Adrien, and Joseph-Narcisse, he took no active part in the conflict. However, in January 1838 he got Judge Joseph-R\u00e9mi Valli\u00e8res* de Saint-R\u00e9al to release the brother of Louis-Joseph Papineau*, notary Andr\u00e9-Augustin, a participant in the battle at Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu. On 5 Jan. 1839 Pacaud also made a speech in defence of his friend and future brother-in-law Joseph-Guillaume Barthe*, who had been committed to prison and \u201csought the benefit of a writ of habeas corpus\u201d [see Jean-Roch Rolland*]. But by February 1840 he was writing to Ludger Duvernay* that he had come round to the plan of the union of the two Canadas, thus accepting the ideas of Louis-Hippolyte La Fontaine*.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1844 Pacaud continued to concentrate on his legal practice, gradually becoming one of the most respected lawyers in his region and an important figure in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. In February 1844 he was appointed bankrupt commissioner for this district, and took up his duties on 20 April. However, this office proved troublesome. The duties of the commissioner were regulated by three laws which came into effect in December 1843. Under the terms of this legislation, the commissioner was to receive a fee commensurate with his services, but a lawyer holding this office lost the right to practise. He also had to preside at the quarter sessions, to serve as a justice of the peace, and discharge \u201call the duties of the resident [judge] of the district during the latter\u2019s absences at the court of appeal.\u201d The office suited Pacaud but he was by no means satisfied with the remuneration, since for all these services he received \u201conly the emoluments deriving from bankrupt businesses.\u201d After numerous letters to the governor general and several petitions to the Legislative Assembly, Pacaud managed to obtain an annual salary of \u00a3200 for the period from August 1846 to January 1850, when he probably ceased to act as commissioner. He failed, however, to win fair payment for the period from 1844 to 1846. Being obstinate and determined, he even asked the assembly in June 1851 to pass an act authorizing him to institute proceedings against the government to obtain compensation for his past services.\n\nDuring the years 1836 to 1850 Pacaud sat on several committees, including one seeking to incorporate the town of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res in 1845, and his home became a meeting-place for its prominent citizens. He was also interested in business. In addition to lending money, from 1839 he took advantage of the proclamation of Lord Durham [Lambton*], issued in September 1838, which decreed that land grants would again be made to those in the militia in 1812 as a reward for their services. Since many militiamen did not want or for various reasons could not take possession of the land to which they were entitled, Pacaud undertook to buy their \u201cclaims\u201d at absurdly low prices. No exact estimate can be made of how much land he acquired in this way, but it is certain that by the end of the 1840s he owned several lots in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res itself; during this decade he also bought just over 3,200 acres in the counties of Drummond, M\u00e9gantic, and Nicolet, from which he received \u201cincome and rent.\u201d\n\nOn 1 May 1850 Pacaud ran in the by-election in M\u00e9gantic. He attributed his defeat by Dunbar Ross* to the intrigues of Charles-F\u00e9lix Cazeau, the secretary of the archdiocese of Quebec, who in his opinion had prompted the local clergy to intervene on behalf of the successful candidate. Embittered, Pacaud denounced this clerical interference in newspapers and drew a sharp reply from Cazeau. With the support of the editors of Le Moniteur canadien of Montreal, Pacaud stood as a Reformer in the December 1851 general elections in Nicolet. His 16-point political programme emphasized the abolition of the Legislative Council and of seigneurial tenure as well as the settlement of the Eastern Townships; some points showed a lawyer\u2019s concern for the codification of laws, the reform of the administration of justice, and compensation for jury duty. Dr Thomas Fortier won the election, however, and this second defeat put an end to Pacaud\u2019s attempts to enter the assembly.\n\n\n\nPacaud had settled at Montreal around mid May 1850 and opened a law office. He announced in at least two newspapers that he was buying \u201cclaims of militiamen, land in the Eastern Townships, [and] government debentures.\u201d He became a member of the Institut Canadien in Montreal, to which he donated more than 40 volumes in June 1850. According to Wilfrid Laurier*, with whom he formed a friendship towards the end of the 1860s, Pacaud had some success in business; apparently in the years 1850\u201353 he invested \u201chis money in copper mining operations,\u201d only to find himself \u201cruined\u201d after a staggering drop in prices. This reverse of fortune may explain why Pacaud returned to Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, probably in 1854, and organized \u201ca grand lottery\u201d of land \u201cfor building [projects] at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\u201d He put 10,280 tickets on sale \u201cat two dollars apiece\u201d for a draw on 28 Feb. 1855 for 150 lots which he owned. It is not known, however, whether this venture brought Pacaud the anticipated results. In any case he was not short of means. In the same period the H\u00f4tel du Canada was opened in a building belonging to him, and at the end of 1858 he had the \u201chuge\u201d H\u00f4tel Saint-Maurice built. In addition, in 1859 he was a partner with Louis-Ad\u00e9lard Sen\u00e9cal and S\u00e9v\u00e8re Dumoulin in the Compagnie de Navigation de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\n\nIn 1861 or 1862 Pacaud established himself in Arthabaskaville where he soon acquired an extensive legal practice. An eloquent counsel, possessing imagination and conviction, he sometimes found himself, in Laurier\u2019s words, supporting \u201cheresies before the court.\u201d He enhanced his reputation by successfully acting for his brother Philippe-Napol\u00e9on in a sensational two-year lawsuit (1864\u201366) against the parish priest of Saint-Norbert in Norbertville, which earned him the accolade of \u201cextraordinarily zealous\u201d from his opponents. Punctilious, and a man of principle, Pacaud even sued the Montreal Telegraph Company for $16 because it had failed to transmit a message in December 1870. That year he was a contributor to La Revue l\u00e9gale in Montreal, in which a number of case reports appeared over his signature.\n\nRemaining true to his habits, Pacaud in the end played an important part at Arthabaskaville in political, economic, and social affairs. At least twice, in 1871 and 1874, he was among those who urged Laurier to stand as a Liberal in Drummond and Arthabaska; on the first of these occasions he even took issue publicly with his parish priest. He participated in the movement to settle the region by lending money to settlers, as did his brother Georges-J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. Moreover, Pacaud did not fail to invest in land; between 1871 and 1884 he acquired no less than 550 acres in the county. In 1880 he helped found and served as president of the Syndicat Agricole d\u2019Arthabaskaville, its purpose being to develop production of beet sugar. He served as a town councillor for a period, and took part in most local activities. Pacaud was \u201creasonably well off,\u201d and his \u201chospitality [had] long since become proverbial\u201d; the intellectuals of the region gathered at his home.\n\nMade a qc on 31 May 1878, Pacaud was b\u00e2tonnier of the Arthabaska bar from July 1884 to May 1887, and also b\u00e2tonnier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of the province in 1885\u201386. One of the first legislative councillors appointed by the government of Honor\u00e9 Mercier*, Pacaud served for the division of Kennebec from 24 Aug. 1887 until his death in November 1889. He may have been ruthless as a lawyer and uncompromising as a small businessman; he stood out particularly for his activities in local and regional affairs.\n\nPierre Dufour and G\u00e9rard Goyer"}]}
