Gist graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit in 1987 where she had been an honor student.\n\nGist first won the tile of Miss Michigan USA in 1989 and went on to win the title of Miss USA on March 2, 1990 in Wichita, Kansas. She was the first contestant from Michigan to win the Miss USA (not Miss America) title and she also broke the five year streak of winners from the state of Texas. At 5\u201911\u201d Gist was also the tallest Miss USA. At the time of her crowning, she was a junior majoring in marketing and management at Northwood University in Midland, Michigan, from which she eventually received her B.A. degree.\n\nWinning the title brought Gist over $200,000 in cash and prizes and automatically earned her the opportunity to represent the United States in the Miss Universe pageant where she placed as first runner up to Miss Norway, Mona Grut.\n\nThroughout her reign as Miss USA, Gist captivated audiences with her stories of being from a single parent home where she had a number of siblings and having to overcome numerous financial and social obstacles. She described the family\u2019s frequent moves in some of the roughest neighborhoods in inner city Detroit and of her homes being frequently burglarized. Gist claimed that money was always scarce in her family and that poverty prevented her from taking dance lessons or learning the piano and violin. Her story contrasted sharply with the middle class backgrounds of most of her competition and of previous Miss USA crown holders.\n\nControversy, however, surrounded Gist\u2019s reign as Miss USA. Her conflicts with pageant officials became well known to the public by 1991. Toward the end of her reign she filed a $20,000,000 lawsuit against the Miss USA Organization for fraud. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.\n\nFollowing her reign, Gist co-hosted a program on the WORD gospel network. Carol Ann-Marie Gist is currently married with two children.

The Miss USA pageant has been held for 70 years, since 1952, and for 38 years a Black woman had never won. Miss Gist's win was not just important because she was a Black woman but because her background was not ideal. Miss Gist grew up in Motor City, Detroit, a city where she would jump out of garages in proof of her toughness, and divorced parents. Miss Gist needs to be applauded not only for her beauty and strength but also for her intelligence. Miss Gist attended Cass Technical High School and at the time of her win was a junior at Northwood University studying marketing. Miss Gist presents herself as an extremely hard worker and currently has two associate degrees and a dual bachelor's degree from Northwood, two master's degrees, one in sports admin and one in Kinesiology. In the Thirty-one years since the pageant Miss Gist has worked several jobs all befitting her competitive nature and talents in the arts.\n\nThe pageant life is tough with constant judgment and impact on self-esteem, but Miss Gist is quite known for positivity.\n\nIn an Interview with Jets magazine shortly after her win, Miss Gist stated \u201cHopefully the Lord\u2019s eyes will be upon me again.

Her family struggled financially so she could not do all the things she wanted like singing, dancing, and playing instruments like piano and violin. She did not have as much preparation as the other girls, but she was able to recognize that everyone was equal and worked just as hard as everyone else.

Carole Gist was the first African American Miss USA, while Vanessa Williams is the first African American Miss America, RHOA fans were reminded last night. Porsha Stewart tried to create a history debate with Kenya Moore Sunday. But Moore took her fan and blew Porsha\u2019s debate agenda into the wind, fabulously.\n\nCarole Gist has yet to comment about RHOA Reunion 2013 telecast (update below). But Porsha Stewart tried to evoke a history debate in last night\u2019s RHOA reunion. Porsha asked Kenya why she keeps on mentioning Vanessa Williams but not Carole Gist. Porsha then claimed Kenya allegedly said this season that she asserts to be the first Black Miss USA.\n\nKenya Moore, when offered an opportunity to respond to Porsha, declined. But last night, Kenya took to Twitter about the matter. Moore\u2019s fans claimed foul against Porsha.\n\nKenya retweeted one fan\u2019s correct comment \u201cyou always said you were the 2nd African American Miss USA but are the FIRST BROWN ONE and that means something.\u201d Kenya also tweeted another fan\u2019s remarks \u201cPorsha must be infatuated with @KenyaMoore. She love arguing with and insulting her.\u201d\n\nDespite Porsha\u2019s poor attempt at a history debate on a reality TV program, one thing is clear. Search results do go back that far, even for persons in the forties, despite Porsha\u2019s age comments this season.\n\nIn 1983, Vanessa Williams became the first African-American Miss America; she is now 50 years old. Carole Gist, now age 43, became the first African American woman to win the Miss USA title in 1990. And Kenya Moore, age 42, won the Miss USA title in 1993.

She won the title of Miss USA shortly after winning the title Miss Michigan. She captured the audience with her grace and poise as she became the first black woman to hold the title. She spent the next 31 years reinventing herself time and time again. We took some time to sit down with her and chat about what she has been up to and what\u2019s next. Take a peek into our conversation below.\n\nWhen did you fall in love with the performing arts?\n\nI was seeking attention. I wouldn\u2019t stop singing and dancing around the house and I became my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s entertainment. I remember getting up on the table and singing the song You Are My Starship. My mom saw that in me and got me involved with dance. I danced competitively. When I started to develop muscles not suitable for dance, I had to make the choice to continue dancing or play sports.\n\nHow did you prepare yourself for the Miss USA Pageant?\n\nI took the most unconventional way to get there. I competed in Miss Michigan, so former Miss Michigan wouldn\u2019t ask me to do it anymore. Michigan is not a big pageant state. In other states like Texas and Florida the prize package is significantly larger, almost the same as winning Miss USA. That prize money helps you pay for the car, the trainer, the coach. With the money I got, I could only get coaching for one weekend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI had a moment of doubt when I was in the registration area of Miss USA. I knew there were two other black girls but they weren\u2019t there yet and I felt so out of place. At that moment, someone came around like only your mom can do, so I know it was God sent. They grabbed me and said, \u201caht aht stand up tall, you have a right to be here just like anyone else, you are just as beautiful and talented, you just go out there and let your light shine.\u201d\n\nNegativity and doubt can creep in no matter what you are doing. Don\u2019t let it stay, whatever it is, shut it down and remember who you are.\n\nCarol Gist for the April 2021 BLAC\u00ae Spring Fashion Issue\n\nTell us about your time competing for Miss Universe?\n\nThe Miss Universe competition opened up my eyes. Meeting all the women from different countries, we shared things and worked out language barriers with pictures. We learned that we think the same, we have the same hopes and dreams. It wasn\u2019t a race thing or a nationality thing, it was just a woman thing.\n\nYou went to the Historical Detroit Cass Tech for High School. What did you study?\n\nI was a business administration Major with a performing arts minor. My mother had her own business; she was always working and hustling. I knew I would do something with business but I wanted my creative outlet as well so I was in choir.\n\nYou have spent your time wisely in school. How many Degrees did you achieve?\n\nI have two associates degrees and a dual Bachelor\u2019s degree Management and Marketing/International Business from Northwood University. I received my first Masters Degree in 2014, in Kinesiology in Sports Science. In 2020 I finished my second Masters Degree in Sports Administration. Both Master degrees were received at Wayne State University. My last one will be a PHD and I am seeing what it would take to be a Physical Therapist.\n\nI can\u2019t stay in one spot for too long or doing one thing for too long. I look forward to the next chapters.\n\nYou have held many titles over the last 31 years, can you list them for us?\n\nOf course, I was in:\n\nHotel Restaurant Management,\n\nA Host\n\nI sang\n\nVideo DJ Host on BET Network\n\nStay at home Wife and Mother\n\nTrack and Volleyball coach\n\nPersonal Trainer\n\nGroup Fitness Trainer\n\nManaging a staff of trainers\n\nPageant Coaching and Judging\n\nWellness Coaching\n\nTriathloner\n\nMakeup Artist\n\nNail Tech\n\nHair Stylist\n\nArcheress\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Carole Gist?\n\nI am still very competitive. My next thing is archery, I am on an all woman team called the Elite Angels. I am writing a few books. A majority of the content is based on a healing journey. That book will lead me into the next thing I want to do, conference speaking. I also want to travel. I want to unapologetically get up and go. I am focused on doing things because I want to not because I have to. I am pursuing my happiness everyday.\n\nCarol Gist for the April 2021 BLAC\u00ae Spring Fashion Issue"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/broadcast-legend-carole-simpson-reflects-shaping-history/story?id=75746492", "page_content": "In the midst of Black History Month, as the nation celebrates the leaders who helped shape the country, broadcast legend Carole Simpson is opening up about breaking barriers in the broadcast industry.\n\nIn 1988, Simpson made history as the first Black woman to helm a major network newscast when she became the face of ABC News' \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d weekend edition, which is a role she held for 15 years.\n\nABC News anchor Carole Simpson, who made history as the first Black woman to helm a major newscast, sits at the anchor desk in New York on April 12, 2002.
