He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Hugo/6000000016777506245", "page_content": "About Jean Hugo\n\nJean Hugo was the great-grandson of the poet, playwright, novelist, essayist, visual artist, statesman, human rights activist and exponent of the Romantic movement in France, Victor Hugo.

A talented artist and theatre designer, he was a schoolboy at Elizabeth College in Guernsey and made later visits to the island, of which he was very fond, including attending the inauguration of Jean Boucher's celebrated statue of the poet in 1914. The Library has a signed copy of his autobiography, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which he gave to Roger Martin, the curator of Hauteville House at the time of his visit in 1977; Roger Martin's ancestor was, coincidentally, one of Victor Hugo's 'poor children.' The photograph is courtesy of the Guernsey Press.\n\nBy Dinah Bott.\n\nJean Hugo was born in Paris in 1894, the son of Georges Hugo and his wife, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian. His wife\u2019s family owned a holiday home on the cliffs at Icart in Guernsey known as La Marcherie. From 1907 until 1910 Jean was at school at Elizabeth College in Guernsey. He enjoyed his time at school here greatly; he played football, was very good at boxing (his bony physique gave him a long reach !), did a great turn in the annual French school play, won prizes for French and Latin and excelled at art. He was in School House and during term time probably boarded. We do not know if he remained in Guernsey for the summer, although he did say in his memoirs that the Sundays he spent in Guernsey were among the best of his life. He recalled his school years in Guernsey in a beautifully written vignette in the second of his two biographical works, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which was published just before his death and takes his life up to 1945.\n\nAfter leaving College he attended sixth-form in Paris. Like his father he joined up as soon as he could, in 1914. He was wounded in May 1915 at La Targette in Pas-de-Calais, and rejoined the front in September 1915. He commenced then an extensive series of delicate sketches and drawings of operations in Artois, Verdun, and Picardy, which he continued until 1918. They depict war-torn landscapes and scenes of soldiers\u2019 lives at the front and behind the lines. Aside from their artistic merit they join his father\u2019s war sketches as being very valuable documentary evidence of WWI.\n\nHugo went on to mix with the artistic post-war elite, amongst whom he counted as great friends such luminaries as Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Max Jacob, Cecil Beaton and Eric Satie. As well as painting vividly in oils he illustrated books with watercolours and lithographs. He was particularly interested in the theatre and designed costumes and sets, for which he produced exquisite maquettes. His work was greatly appreciated in the UK and America, and he painted backdrops of Stratford-upon-Avon for the Quatercentenary of Shakespeare\u2018s birth in 1964 which are in the collection of the V&A. In 1931 he acquired an estate in Provence, the Mas de Fourques at Lunel, which remained his base until his death in 1984. He married twice, first to artist Valentine Grossman, and secondly to Laura Hope-Nicholson, by whom he had seven children.\n\nMaurice Sachs: \u2018Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and as far as we knew he had no enemies. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\u2019 La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris: Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316).\n\nProjected costume design for 'The Prince' by Jean Hugo, Les Cents Baisers, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, 1935.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter. His paternal aunt was the socialite Jeanne Hugo.His mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.Jean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this civil marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children: Charles Hugo (farmer), Marie Hugo (artist), Jean-Baptiste Hugo (artist), Ad\u00e8le Hugo (artist), Jeanne Hugo-Chabrol (teacher), Sophie Hugo-Lafont (librarian), L\u00e9opoldine Hugo (artist).Jean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period. Pierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un t\u00e9moignage (Rocher, France, 2007).PaintingsHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is a room dedicated to his paintings.Jean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains originality while evoking avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).He showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpeted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big Jupiterian eye, his olympism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chases the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"Gustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...]Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him.Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)Maurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316)Paul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\"ReferencesExternal linksNew York Times Obituary \u2013 June 23, 1984 \"Jean Hugo, Artist, Dies at 89\"Presentation of the Jean Hugo room at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier (in French) Archived 21 September 2014 at the Wayback MachineJean Hugo paintings on WikiArtJean Hugo collection at the Barnes Foundationwebsite of Jean Hugo's home, the Mas de FourquesPast auction results for Jean Hugo at Christie's\n\n\n\nBiography from Wikipedia (see original) under licence CC BY-SA 3.0"}, {"url": "https://deadorkicking.com/jean-hugo-dead-or-alive/", "page_content": "Jean Hugo Death\n\nJean passed away on June 21, 1984 at the age of 89 in Lunel, Languedoc-Roussillon, France.\n\nJean Hugo death quick facts: When did Jean Hugo die?

The great French novelist and poet Victor Hugo created two of the most famous characters in literature\u2014Jean Valjean, the ex-convict hero of Les Mis\u00e9rables, and the hunchback Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Known for the vast range and immense quantity of his output, Hugo was able during much of his long life to write as many as 100 lines of verse or 20 pages of prose each day.\n\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born in Besan\u00e7on on Feb. 26, 1802, the son of an officer in Napoleon\u2019s army. Hugo\u2019s father and mother did not get along, and most of his early years were spent in Paris, where his mother preferred to live. Hugo and his two brothers knew their father from occasional visits as a grand man in a splendid uniform.\n\nIn preparatory school, Hugo began to write. He won poetry prizes and wrote for a literary magazine he helped found. In 1821 the magazine failed. Hugo\u2019s mother died the same year. After a period of extreme poverty, Hugo was awarded an annual pension by Louis XVIII for his \u2018Miscellaneous Odes and Poems\u2019, published in 1822. He then married his childhood sweetheart, Ad\u00e8le Foucher.\n\nBetween 1822 and 1832 Hugo established himself as a major literary figure in France. He wrote poetry, novels, and plays and became a leader in the Romantic movement. (See also French literature.)\n\nIn 1830 his play Hernani was a spectacular success. By shattering the artificial rules that had previously governed the writing of French drama, Hugo brought new freedom to the French stage. His novel Notre Dame de Paris was published in 1831. Translated as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, it became vastly popular in many countries. In 1832 his play Le Roi s\u2019amuse, or The King\u2019s Diversion, on which Giuseppe Verdi later based his opera Rigoletto, was staged. Like so many of Hugo\u2019s works, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The King\u2019s Diversion were criticisms of social and political injustice. Another reason for writing the plays was to provide parts for the young actress Juliette Negroni, who became his mistress in 1833 and was to be his companion for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1841 Hugo was elected to the French Academy, and in 1849 he became a member of the National Assembly. An outspoken political opponent of Napoleon III, Hugo had to flee France in 1851.\n\nHe remained in exile until 1870. During that time he wrote some of his finest works. In 1862 appeared Les Mis\u00e9rables, one of the most popular novels of all time. Hugo\u2019s wife died in 1868, and Negroni moved into his home.\n\nAfter the fall of the empire in 1870, Hugo returned to Paris. There he lived the rest of his life as a literary idol. Huge crowds turned out to celebrate his 80th birthday. Hugo died in Paris on May 22, 1885, and is buried in the Panth\u00e9on."}, {"url": "https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/hugojean/jean-hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo (19 November 1894 \u2013 21 June 1984) was a painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter. His paternal aunt was the socialite Jeanne Hugo.His mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.Jean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this civil marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children: Charles Hugo (farmer), Marie Hugo (artist), Jean-Baptiste Hugo (artist), Ad\u00e8le Hugo (artist), Jeanne Hugo-Chabrol (teacher), Sophie Hugo-Lafont (librarian), L\u00e9opoldine Hugo (artist).Jean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period. Pierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un t\u00e9moignage (Rocher, France, 2007).PaintingsHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is a room dedicated to his paintings.Jean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains originality while evoking avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).He showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpeted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big Jupiterian eye, his olympism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chases the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"Gustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...]Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him.Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)Maurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316)Paul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\"ReferencesExternal linksNew York Times Obituary \u2013 June 23, 1984 \"Jean Hugo, Artist, Dies at 89\"Presentation of the Jean Hugo room at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier (in French) Archived 21 September 2014 at the Wayback MachineJean Hugo paintings on WikiArtJean Hugo collection at the Barnes Foundationwebsite of Jean Hugo's home, the Mas de FourquesPast auction results for Jean Hugo at Christie's\n\n\n\nBiography from Wikipedia (see original) under licence CC BY-SA 3.0"}, {"url": "https://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/articles/article/victor-hugo-and-guernsey-jean-hugo", "page_content": "Jean Hugo was the great-grandson of Victor Hugo. A talented artist and theatre designer, he was a schoolboy at Elizabeth College in Guernsey and made later visits to the island, of which he was very fond, including attending the inauguration of Jean Boucher's celebrated statue of the poet in 1914. The Library has a signed copy of his autobiography, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which he gave to Roger Martin, the curator of Hauteville House at the time of his visit in 1977; Roger Martin's ancestor was, coincidentally, one of Victor Hugo's 'poor children.' The photograph is courtesy of the Guernsey Press.\n\nBy Dinah Bott.\n\nJean Hugo was born in Paris in 1894, the son of Georges Hugo and his wife, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian. His wife\u2019s family owned a holiday home on the cliffs at Icart in Guernsey known as La Marcherie. From 1907 until 1910 Jean was at school at Elizabeth College in Guernsey. He enjoyed his time at school here greatly; he played football, was very good at boxing (his bony physique gave him a long reach !), did a great turn in the annual French school play, won prizes for French and Latin and excelled at art. He was in School House and during term time probably boarded. We do not know if he remained in Guernsey for the summer, although he did say in his memoirs that the Sundays he spent in Guernsey were among the best of his life. He recalled his school years in Guernsey in a beautifully written vignette in the second of his two biographical works, Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire, which was published just before his death and takes his life up to 1945.\n\nAfter leaving College he attended sixth-form in Paris. Like his father he joined up as soon as he could, in 1914. He was wounded in May 1915 at La Targette in Pas-de-Calais, and rejoined the front in September 1915. He commenced then an extensive series of delicate sketches and drawings of operations in Artois, Verdun, and Picardy, which he continued until 1918. They depict war-torn landscapes and scenes of soldiers\u2019 lives at the front and behind the lines. Aside from their artistic merit they join his father\u2019s war sketches as being very valuable documentary evidence of WWI.\n\nHugo went on to mix with the artistic post-war elite, amongst whom he counted as great friends such luminaries as Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Paul Eluard, Francis Poulenc, Max Jacob, Cecil Beaton and Eric Satie. As well as painting vividly in oils he illustrated books with watercolours and lithographs. He was particularly interested in the theatre and designed costumes and sets, for which he produced exquisite maquettes. His work was greatly appreciated in the UK and America, and he painted backdrops of Stratford-upon-Avon for the Quatercentenary of Shakespeare\u2018s birth in 1964 which are in the collection of the V&A. In 1931 he acquired an estate in Provence, the Mas de Fourques at Lunel, which remained his base until his death in 1984. He married twice, first to artist Valentine Grossman, and secondly to Laura Hope-Nicholson, by whom he had seven children.\n\nMaurice Sachs: \u2018Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and as far as we knew he had no enemies. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance.

She knew Guernsey well. She married a childhood friend, the controversial author L\u00e9on Daudet (1867-1942), who had plenty to say about Victor Hugo - very little of it complimentary. The marriage did not last long.\n\nBy Dinah Bott.\n\nJeanne Hugo, the granddaughter of the sublime Victor, and the spoilt child of the world of art and of letters, has received a long walrus-tooth formed into a paper-cutter. On one side is her monogram, \u2018JH\u2019 and on the other the inscription, 'Produit de la chasse de la Vega dans la mer polaire offert \u00e0 Mlle Jeanne Hugo par A E Nordenskjold.'/ (From the voyage of the SS Vega in the Arctic Ocean, presented to Mlle Jeanne Hugo by A[dolf] E[rik] Nordenskjold.) [Glasgow Evening Post, 5 June 1880.]\n\nL\u00e9opoldine Cl\u00e9mence Ad\u00e8le Lucie Jeanne Hugo was only eleven years old when this little article was written about her, the report of a gift from the leader of a famous Swedish scientific expedition to the Arctic. Her starring r\u00f4le along with her elder brother Georges in the immensely popular book of poetry that Hugo had published in 1877, L\u2019Art d\u2019\u00eatre grand-p\u00e8re, and the fact that Hugo was the children\u2019s guardian meant that for those who were admirers of \u2018the sublime Victor\u2019 they had the status from a very young age almost of royalty, basking in their grandfather\u2019s golden glow. As Jeanne grew she seemed to glide serenely through the fame. Always accompanied by her mother, her social life was enthusiastically documented in the newspapers.\n\nVictor Hugo died in 1885. The Hugo family had a close circle of friends, and Jeanne followed the family tradition by falling in love with one of them, L\u00e9on Daudet, the son of the very popular novelist Alphonse Daudet. Handsome, of the same age as the Hugo children, he was Georges Hugo\u2019s best friend. At the time, L\u00e9on Daudet seemed the perfect match, as many contemporary newspapers remarked. A marriage of love, both wealthy (although Daudet much less so than Jeanne), both from literary families, both brought up in the company of the greatest literary minds in contemporary France! Jeanne had to wait until she reached her majority to marry, as Victor Hugo, no doubt mindful of his late daughter L\u00e9opoldine, whom he had perhaps seen reborn in Jeanne, had inserted a proviso into his will that meant she would not receive the main part of her sizeable inheritance if she married earlier. Jeanne decided the marriage at Passy should be a civil one, out of respect for her grandfather; it attracted large crowds of onlookers and was attended by the glitterati, who heard long eulogies to Victor Hugo and comparatively little about the happy couple.\n\nAt the time L\u00e9on Daudet was a great admirer of Victor Hugo, and appears to have remained obsessed with him for years. From 1885 he attended medical school with Jean-Baptiste Charcot, the son of a world-famous neurologist and friend of his father\u2019s, Dr J-M Charcot. For a while they and Georges (who did not attend university) were great pals, having fun running amok in Paris, fighting, drinking, politically active republicans, getting into the newspapers for their outrageous behaviour; but then Daudet failed his exams. He mortally offended Charcot by claiming that he only passed his medical examinations because his father was their professor. Charcot never forgave him.\n\nAfter his marriage in early 1891 he published his first novel. His mother had hoped that marriage to Jeanne would quieten him down, but his political views changed and hardened. He became a monarchist; following the publication by his father in 1886 of Edouard Drumont\u2019s La France juive he had become virulently anti-Semitic. He was, however, able to remain close to Georges Hugo for some years despite Georges\u2019 many Jewish friends. Like his father Alphonse Daudet, L\u00e9on was passionate about politics, irascible and easily offended. He was prone to fighting duels.\n\nL\u00e9on and Georges were united in their dislike of Georges\u2019 stepfather, Edouard Lockroy, and in later life Daudet reserved nearly as much venom for Lockroy as he did for Emile Zola, one of his main b\u00eates noires (although he had known him too from childhood). Jeanne had a son by Daudet, Charles, but the marriage was soon in trouble. Daudet tells us that in 1885, he decided, while at Hauteville House sorting out Hugo\u2019s belongings with Georges, that he would one day write a novel:\n\nWe were submerged in relics. At that time I got the ambitious idea of writing a monograph about a genius, in his particular field, including a study of his entourage. But I didn\u2019t get around to writing The black star for eight years, until 1893, in that same house where I discovered, in 1885, the remains, the crumbs, the debris of Hugo\u2019s fat head. Although I tried to disguise reality as much as I could, something of the truth remained, and when Lockroy read the proofs (anyway he hated Hugo and Hugo hated him) it caused quite some drama. Hauteville House is fated to host scenes, and would have been a perfect place to be included in the remarkable book by Edouard Estauni\u00e9: Objects talk. [Nous \u00e9tions submerg\u00e9s de reliques. Des cette \u00e9poque, me venait par l\u2019ambiance l\u2019id\u00e9e ambitieuse d\u2019une monographie d\u2019un homme de g\u00e9nie, dans son cadre et dans son milieu, avec r\u00e9actions sur l\u2019entourage. N\u00e9anmoins je ne devais \u00e9crire L\u2019Astre noir que huit ans plus tard, en 1893, dan cette m\u00eame maison ou m\u2019\u00e9taient apparus, en 1885 les restes, les miettes et d\u00e9bris de la grosse t\u00eate de Hugo. Bien que je me fusse appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9former la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 autant que possible, il en \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 quelque chose, et la lecture des \u00e9preuves de L\u2019Astre noir par Lockroy \u2013 lequel d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9testait Hugo et \u00e9tait d\u00e9test\u00e9 de lui \u2013 fut l\u2019occasion d\u2019un joli drame. Hauteville-House est pr\u00e9destin\u00e9e aux sc\u00e8nes, et c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 un fameux d\u00e9cor pour le remarquable livre d\u2019Edouard Estauni\u00e9 : les Choses parlent.]\n\nHe wrote this novel, The black star, while sitting in Hauteville House with his wife, Victor Hugo\u2019s beloved granddaughter, only two years in to their marriage. Jeanne divorced him in 1895 and was awarded custody of the children, whom Daudet (who had issued a counter-divorce suit) was prevented from seeing for thirteen years by Edouard Lockroy. Jeanne then had a couple of failed engagements in quick succession, before marrying Dr Jean-Baptiste Charcot, all-round boys\u2019 own hero, in 1896. Daudet and Charcot fought a duel, inevitably. Charcot was livid that Georges, who refused to attribute blame for the divorce to either party, did not drop Daudet, as Jeanne had requested. In fact Georges took Daudet\u2019s side (perhaps because of his antipathy to Lockroy). He upset his mother by turning his back on her in the street. In 1898, when the family was attending the first performance of Victor Hugo\u2019s play \u2018La Grand\u2019m\u00e8re,\u2019 Charcot saw Georges with Daudet, stormed over to him, accused him of disrespecting his sister and slapped him so hard he knocked him down. Georges accepted the challenge, and he and Daudet both sent seconds, but Charcot changed his mind. The next day they were in court. Apparently Jeanne Hugo had been very upset that Georges continued to take L\u00e9on Daudet to visit Hauteville House, a place so special to her. Charcot said that he and Georges had been friends, but that Georges had refused to speak to him after the divorce. He, Charcot, had only wanted to help an unfortunate young lady rebuild her life. A horrible scandal, written up with relish by the newspapers who compared the two sides to the Montagues and Capulets. In the end the court decided it was six of one and half-a-dozen of the other, and fined Charcot 50 francs.\n\nSadly, Jeanne did not take into account her knight in shining armour\u2019s ambitions to be an explorer. She divorced Charcot for desertion, serving the notice when he set out for the South Pole, and in 1906 settled down with a Greek naval captain, Michel Negroponte, who died at the early age of 42 in 1914. Jeanne sent Canon Bourde de la Rogerie some money for the poor children of Guernsey in remembrance of him. She came to Guernsey in 1927 when after Georges\u2019 death she and his children handed over Hauteville House to the City of Paris.\n\nDaudet last spoke to Georges Hugo in 1903. He married his cousin and had another son, Philippe. He wrote a biography of Victor Hugo called The tragic life of Victor Hugo, which he claimed was based on material he had learnt from the family. Although Hugo\u2019s life was in many ways tragic, the same could be said of L\u00e9on Daudet, whose son Philippe fell in with the anarchists (the polar opposite to his father) and who committed suicide at the age of fourteen by shooting himself in the head with a gun he had been given in order to commit a political assassination. L\u00e9on Daudet would not accept this and was determined that his son had been murdered. He went to prison for libel, escaped, went on the run, was pardoned. He renounced his antisemitism in 1929, disliked the Nazis but was quite keen on Mussolini. He died in 1942, supporting the Vichy administration, having written 9000 articles and 128 books. The devil does indeed have some of the best tunes, because L\u00e9on Daudet was a brilliant writer. Jeanne, who was extremely proud of her heritage and spent a great deal of time safeguarding her grandfather\u2019s memory and estate, died in Paris in 1941.\n\nJeanne's autograph, along with those of other members of the Hugo entourage, is to be found in the Priaulx Library's The Album of Maggie Lelean.

The marriage did not last long.\n\nJeanne Hugo, the granddaughter of the sublime Victor, and the spoilt child of the world of art and of letters, has received a long walrus-tooth formed into a paper-cutter. On one side is her monogram, \u2018JH\u2019 and on the other the inscription, \u2018Produit de la chasse de la Vega dans la mer polaire offert \u00e0 Mlle Jeanne Hugo par A E Nordenskjold.\u2019/ (From the voyage of the SS Vega in the Arctic Ocean, presented to Mlle Jeanne Hugo by A[dolf] E[rik] Nordenskjold.) [Glasgow Evening Post, 5 June 1880.]\n\nL\u00e9opoldine Cl\u00e9mence Ad\u00e8le Lucie Jeanne Hugo was only eleven years old when this little article was written about her, the report of a gift from the leader of a famous Swedish scientific expedition to the Arctic. Her starring r\u00f4le along with her elder brother Georges in the immensely popular book of poetry that Hugo had published in 1877, L\u2019Art d\u2019\u00eatre grand-p\u00e8re, and the fact that Hugo was the children\u2019s guardian meant that for those who were admirers of \u2018the sublime Victor\u2019 they had the status from a very young age almost of royalty, basking in their grandfather\u2019s golden glow. As Jeanne grew she seemed to glide serenely through the fame. Always accompanied by her mother, her social life was enthusiastically documented in the newspapers.\n\nVictor Hugo died in 1885. The Hugo family had a close circle of friends, and Jeanne followed the family tradition by falling in love with one of them, L\u00e9on Daudet, the son of the very popular novelist Alphonse Daudet. Handsome, of the same age as the Hugo children, he was Georges Hugo\u2019s best friend. At the time, L\u00e9on Daudet seemed the perfect match, as many contemporary newspapers remarked. A marriage of love, both wealthy (although Daudet much less so than Jeanne), both from literary families, both brought up in the company of the greatest literary minds in contemporary France! Jeanne had to wait until she reached her majority to marry, as Victor Hugo, no doubt mindful of his late daughter L\u00e9opoldine, whom he had perhaps seen reborn in Jeanne, had inserted a proviso into his will that meant she would not receive the main part of her sizeable inheritance if she married earlier. Jeanne decided the marriage at Passy should be a civil one, out of respect for her grandfather; it attracted large crowds of onlookers and was attended by the glitterati, who heard long eulogies to Victor Hugo and comparatively little about the happy couple.\n\nAt the time L\u00e9on Daudet was a great admirer of Victor Hugo, and appears to have remained obsessed with him for years. From 1885 he attended medical school with Jean-Baptiste Charcot, the son of a world-famous neurologist and friend of his father\u2019s, Dr J-M Charcot. For a while they and Georges (who did not attend university) were great pals, having fun running amok in Paris, fighting, drinking, politically active republicans, getting into the newspapers for their outrageous behaviour; but then Daudet failed his exams. He mortally offended Charcot by claiming that he only passed his medical examinations because his father was their professor. Charcot never forgave him.\n\nAfter his marriage in early 1891 he published his first novel. His mother had hoped that marriage to Jeanne would quieten him down, but his political views changed and hardened. He became a monarchist; following the publication by his father in 1886 of Edouard Drumont\u2019s La France juive he had become virulently anti-Semitic. He was, however, able to remain close to Georges Hugo for some years despite Georges\u2019 many Jewish friends. Like his father Alphonse Daudet, L\u00e9on was passionate about politics, irascible and easily offended. He was prone to fighting duels.\n\nL\u00e9on and Georges were united in their dislike of Georges\u2019 stepfather, Edouard Lockroy, and in later life Daudet reserved nearly as much venom for Lockroy as he did for Emile Zola, one of his main b\u00eates noires (although he had known him too from childhood). Jeanne had a son by Daudet, Charles, but the marriage was soon in trouble. Daudet tells us that in 1885, he decided, while at Hauteville House sorting out Hugo\u2019s belongings with Georges, that he would one day write a novel:\n\nWe were submerged in relics. At that time I got the ambitious idea of writing a monograph about a genius, in his particular field, including a study of his entourage. But I didn\u2019t get around to writing The black star for eight years, until 1893, in that same house where I discovered, in 1885, the remains, the crumbs, the debris of Hugo\u2019s fat head. Although I tried to disguise reality as much as I could, something of the truth remained, and when Lockroy read the proofs (anyway he hated Hugo and Hugo hated him) it caused quite some drama. Hauteville House is fated to host scenes, and would have been a perfect place to be included in the remarkable book by Edouard Estauni\u00e9: Objects talk.\n\n[Nous \u00e9tions submerg\u00e9s de reliques. Des cette \u00e9poque, me venait par l\u2019ambiance l\u2019id\u00e9e ambitieuse d\u2019une monographie d\u2019un homme de g\u00e9nie, dans son cadre et dans son milieu, avec r\u00e9actions sur l\u2019entourage. N\u00e9anmoins je ne devais \u00e9crire L\u2019Astre noir que huit ans plus tard, en 1893, dan cette m\u00eame maison ou m\u2019\u00e9taient apparus, en 1885 les restes, les miettes et d\u00e9bris de la grosse t\u00eate de Hugo. Bien que je me fusse appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9former la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 autant que possible, il en \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 quelque chose, et la lecture des \u00e9preuves de L\u2019Astre noir par Lockroy \u2013 lequel d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9testait Hugo et \u00e9tait d\u00e9test\u00e9 de lui \u2013 fut l\u2019occasion d\u2019un joli drame. Hauteville-House est pr\u00e9destin\u00e9e aux sc\u00e8nes, et c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 un fameux d\u00e9cor pour le remarquable livre d\u2019Edouard Estauni\u00e9 : les Choses parlent.]\n\nHe wrote this novel, The black star, while sitting in Hauteville House with his wife, Victor Hugo\u2019s beloved granddaughter, only two years in to their marriage. Jeanne divorced him in 1895 and was awarded custody of the children, whom Daudet (who had issued a counter-divorce suit) was prevented from seeing for thirteen years by Edouard Lockroy. Jeanne then had a couple of failed engagements in quick succession, before marrying Dr Jean-Baptiste Charcot, all-round boys\u2019 own hero, in 1896. Daudet and Charcot fought a duel, inevitably. Charcot was livid that Georges, who refused to attribute blame for the divorce to either party, did not drop Daudet, as Jeanne had requested. In fact Georges took Daudet\u2019s side (perhaps because of his antipathy to Lockroy). He upset his mother by turning his back on her in the street. In 1898, when the family was attending the first performance of Victor Hugo\u2019s play \u2018La Grand\u2019m\u00e8re,\u2019 Charcot saw Georges with Daudet, stormed over to him, accused him of disrespecting his sister and slapped him so hard he knocked him down. Georges accepted the challenge, and he and Daudet both sent seconds, but Charcot changed his mind. The next day they were in court. Apparently Jeanne Hugo had been very upset that Georges continued to take L\u00e9on Daudet to visit Hauteville House, a place so special to her. Charcot said that he and Georges had been friends, but that Georges had refused to speak to him after the divorce. He, Charcot, had only wanted to help an unfortunate young lady rebuild her life. A horrible scandal, written up with relish by the newspapers who compared the two sides to the Montagues and Capulets. In the end the court decided it was six of one and half-a-dozen of the other, and fined Charcot 50 francs.\n\nSadly, Jeanne did not take into account her knight in shining armour\u2019s ambitions to be an explorer. She divorced Charcot for desertion, serving the notice when he set out for the South Pole, and in 1906 settled down with a Greek naval captain, Michel Negroponte, who died at the early age of 42 in 1914. Jeanne sent Canon Bourde de la Rogerie some money for the poor children of Guernsey in remembrance of him. She came to Guernsey in 1927 when after Georges\u2019 death she and his children handed over Hauteville House to the City of Paris.\n\nDaudet last spoke to Georges Hugo in 1903. He married his cousin and had another son, Philippe. He wrote a biography of Victor Hugo called The tragic life of Victor Hugo, which he claimed was based on material he had learnt from the family. Although Hugo\u2019s life was in many ways tragic, the same could be said of L\u00e9on Daudet, whose son Philippe fell in with the anarchists (the polar opposite to his father) and who committed suicide at the age of fourteen by shooting himself in the head with a gun he had been given in order to commit a political assassination. L\u00e9on Daudet would not accept this and was determined that his son had been murdered. He went to prison for libel, escaped, went on the run, was pardoned. He renounced his antisemitism in 1929, disliked the Nazis but was quite keen on Mussolini. He died in 1942, supporting the Vichy administration, having written 9000 articles and 128 books. The devil does indeed have some of the best tunes, because L\u00e9on Daudet was a brilliant writer. Jeanne, who was extremely proud of her heritage and spent a great deal of time safeguarding her grandfather\u2019s memory and estate, died in Paris in 1941.\n\nJeanne\u2019s autograph, along with those of other members of the Hugo entourage, is to be found in the Priaulx Library\u2019s The Album of Maggie Lelean. Maggie was the daughter of a sea-captain, and she and her sisters were near neighbours of Hugo and his grandchildren in 1878; they played with Georges and Jeanne at Hauteville House."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Hugo", "page_content": "Victor Hugo is remembered as a beloved writer of the people, who knew how to write with simplicity and power of common joys and sorrows. He is also remembered for the verbal inventiveness and technical virtuosity with which he created poems ranging from intimate lyrics to visionary and prophetic epics.\n\nVictor Hugo was an influential proponent of Romanticism . In a preface to his verse play Cromwell (1827), he called for a drama of action\u2014which he saw as appropriate to modern man, the battleground of matter and spirit\u2014that could transcend Classical categories and mix the sublime and the grotesque.\n\nPoet , novelist, and dramatist Victor Hugo is considered the most important of the French Romantic writers. Though regarded in France as one of that country\u2019s greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831; The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862).\n\nVictor Hugo , in full Victor-Marie Hugo , (born February 26, 1802, Besan\u00e7on , France\u2014died May 22, 1885, Paris), poet, novelist, and dramatist who was the most important of the French Romantic writers. Though regarded in France as one of that country\u2019s greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831) and Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862).\n\nHugo emerged as a true Romantic, however, with the publication in 1827 of his verse drama Cromwell . The subject of this play, with its near-contemporary overtones, is that of a national leader risen from the people who seeks to be crowned king. But the play\u2019s reputation rested largely on the long, elaborate preface, in which Hugo proposed a doctrine of Romanticism that for all its intellectual moderation was extremely provocative. He demanded a verse drama in which the contradictions of human existence\u2014good and evil, beauty and ugliness, tears and laughter\u2014would be resolved by the inclusion of both tragic and comic elements in a single play. Such a type of drama would abandon the formal rules of classical tragedy for the freedom and truth to be found in the plays of William Shakespeare . Cromwell itself, though immensely long and almost impossible to stage, was written in verse of great force and originality. In fact, the preface to Cromwell, as an important statement of the tenets of Romanticism, has proved far more important than the play itself.\n\nIn 1823 he published his first novel, Han d\u2019Islande, which in 1825 appeared in an English translation as Hans of Iceland. The journalist Charles Nodier was enthusiastic about it and drew Hugo into the group of friends, all devotees of Romanticism , who met regularly at the Biblioth\u00e8que de L\u2019Arsenal. While frequenting this literary circle, which was called the C\u00e9nacle , Hugo shared in launching a new review of moderate tendencies, the Muse Fran\u00e7aise (1823\u201324). In 1824 he published a new verse collection, Nouvelles Odes, and followed it two years later with an exotic romance, Bug-Jargal (Eng. trans. The Slave King). In 1826 he also published Odes et ballades, an enlarged edition of his previously printed verse, the latest of these poems being brilliant variations on the fashionable Romantic modes of mirth and terror. The youthful vigour of these poems was also characteristic of another collection, Les Orientales (1829), which appealed to the Romantic taste for Oriental local colour. In these poems Hugo, while skillfully employing a great variety of metres in his verse and using ardent and brilliant imagery, was also gradually shedding the legitimist royalism of his youth. It may be noted, too, that \u201cLe Feu du ciel,\u201d a visionary poem, forecast those he was to write 25 years later. The fusion of the contemporary with the apocalyptic was always a particular mark of Hugo\u2019s genius.\n\nFrom 1816, at least, Hugo had conceived ambitions other than the law. He was already filling notebooks with verses, translations\u2014particularly from Virgil \u2014two tragedies, a play, and elegies. Encouraged by his mother, Hugo founded a review, the Conservateur Litt\u00e9raire (1819\u201321), in which his own articles on the poets Alphonse de Lamartine and Andr\u00e9 de Ch\u00e9nier stand out. His mother died in 1821, and a year later Victor married a childhood friend, Ad\u00e8le Foucher, with whom he had five children. In that same year he published his first book of poems, Odes et po\u00e9sies diverses, whose royalist sentiments earned him a pension from Louis XVIII . Behind Hugo\u2019s concern for classical form and his political inspiration, it is possible to recognize in these poems a personal voice and his own particular vein of fantasy.\n\nVictor was the third son of Joseph-L\u00e9opold-Sigisbert Hugo, a major and, later, general in Napoleon \u2019s army. His childhood was coloured by his father\u2019s constant traveling with the imperial army and by the disagreements that soon alienated his parents from one another. His mother\u2019s royalism and his father\u2019s loyalty to successive governments\u2014the Convention, the Empire, the Restoration\u2014reflected their deeper incompatibility. It was a chaotic time for Victor, continually uprooted from Paris to set out for Elba or Naples or Madrid , yet always returning to Paris with his mother, whose royalist opinions he initially adopted. The fall of the empire gave him, from 1815 to 1818, a time of uninterrupted study at the Pension Cordier and the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, after which he graduated from the law faculty at Paris, where his studies seem to have been purposeless and irregular. Memories of his life as a poor student later inspired the figure of Marius in his novel Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nSuccess (1830\u201351)\n\nThe defense of freedom and the cult of an idealized Napoleon in such poems as the ode \u201c\u00c0 la Colonne\u201d and \u201cLui\u201d brought Hugo into touch with the liberal group of writers on the newspaper Le Globe, and his move toward liberalism was strengthened by the French king Charles X\u2019s restrictions on the liberty of the press as well as by the censor\u2019s prohibiting the stage performance of his play Marion de Lorme (1829), which portrays the character of Louis XIII unfavourably. Hugo immediately retorted with Hernani, the first performance of which, on February 25, 1830, gained victory for the young Romantics over the Classicists in what came to be known as the battle of Hernani. In this play Hugo extolled the Romantic hero in the form of a noble outlaw at war with society, dedicated to a passionate love and driven on by inexorable fate. The actual impact of the play owed less to the plot than to the sound and beat of the verse, which was softened only in the elegiac passages spoken by Hernani and Do\u00f1a Sol.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The Hunchback of Notre-Dame), an evocation of life in medieval Paris during the reign of Louis XI. The novel condemns a society that, in the persons of Frollo the archdeacon and Phoebus the soldier, heaps misery on the hunchback Quasimodo and the gypsy girl Esmeralda. The theme touched the public consciousness more deeply than had that of his previous novel, Le Dernier Jour d\u2019un condamn\u00e9 (1829; The Last Days of a Condemned), the story of a condemned man\u2019s last day, in which Hugo launched a humanitarian protest against the death penalty. While Notre-Dame was being written, Louis-Philippe, a constitutional king, had been brought to power by the July Revolution. Hugo composed a poem in honour of this event, Dict\u00e9 apr\u00e9s juillet 1830. It was a forerunner of much of his political verse.\n\nFour books of poems came from Hugo in the period of the July Monarchy: Les Feuilles d\u2019automne (1831; \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d), intimate and personal in inspiration; Les Chants du cr\u00e9puscule (1835; Songs of Twilight), overtly political; Les Voix int\u00e9rieures (1837; \u201cInner Voices\u201d), both personal and philosophical; and Les Rayons et les ombres (1840; \u201cSunlight and Shadows\u201d), in which the poet, renewing these different themes, indulges his gift for colour and picturesque detail. But Hugo was not content merely to express personal emotions; he wanted to be what he called the \u201csonorous echo\u201d of his time. In his verse political and philosophical problems were integrated with the religious and social disquiet of the period; one poem evoked the misery of the workers, another praised the efficacy of prayer. He addressed many poems to the glory of Napoleon, though he shared with his contemporaries the reversion to republican ideals. Hugo restated the problems of his century and the great and eternal human questions, and he spoke with a warmhearted eloquence and reasonableness that moved people\u2019s souls.\n\nSo intense was Hugo\u2019s creative activity during these years that he also continued to pour out plays. There were two motives for this: first, he needed a platform for his political and social ideas, and, second, he wished to write parts for a young and beautiful actress, Juliette Drouet, with whom he had begun a liaison in 1833. Juliette had little talent and soon renounced the stage in order to devote herself exclusively to him, becoming the discreet and faithful companion she was to remain until her death in 1883. The first of these plays was another verse drama, Le Roi s\u2019amuse (1832; Eng. trans. The King\u2019s Fool), set in Renaissance France and depicting the frivolous love affairs of Francis I while revealing the noble character of his court jester. This play was at first banned but was later used by Giuseppe Verdi as the libretto of his opera Rigoletto. Three prose plays followed: Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia and Marie Tudor in 1833 and Angelo, tyran de Padoue (\u201cAngelo, Tyrant of Padua\u201d) in 1835. Ruy Blas, a play in verse, appeared in 1838 and was followed by Les Burgraves in 1843.\n\nHugo\u2019s literary achievement was recognized in 1841 by his election, after three unsuccessful attempts, to the French Academy and by his nomination in 1845 to the Chamber of Peers. From this time he almost ceased to publish, partly because of the demands of society and political life but also as a result of personal loss: his daughter L\u00e9opoldine, recently married, was accidentally drowned with her husband in September 1843. Hugo\u2019s intense grief found some mitigation in poems that later appeared in Les Contemplations, a volume that he divided into \u201cAutrefois\u201d and \u201cAujourd\u2019hui,\u201d the moment of his daughter\u2019s death being the mark between yesterday and today. He found relief above all in working on a new novel, which became Les Mis\u00e9rables, published in 1862 after work on it had been set aside for a time and then resumed.\n\nWith the Revolution of 1848, Hugo was elected a deputy for Paris in the Constituent Assembly and later in the Legislative Assembly. He supported the successful candidacy of Prince Louis-Napol\u00e9on for the presidency that year. The more the president evolved toward an authoritarianism of the right, however, the more Hugo moved toward the assembly\u2019s left. When in December 1851 a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat took place, which eventually resulted in the Second Empire under Napoleon III, Hugo made one attempt at resistance and then fled to Brussels."}, {"url": "https://casdinteret.com/2020/10/the-lonely-and-devoted-life-of-juliette-drouet/", "page_content": "Victor Hugo and Juliette Drouet\n\nTwo weeks ago, I wrote about a love letter that Victor Hugo wrote to his mistress, Juliette Drouet, shortly after fleeing France to live in exile. In that post, I remarked that over the course of their impressive 50-year relationship, Juliette penned roughly 20,000 letters to the storied author. It\u2019s a mind-boggling number. Perhaps even more surprising is that the letters still exist. The University of Rouen, in partnership with the Sorbonne, is in the midst of a Herculean effort to transcribe them and put the text online. So far, they\u2019ve posted close to 12,000 of Juliette\u2019s missives. I say \u201ctranscribe\u201d because photocopies of the original letters are quite difficult to read. Below, is an example.\n\nLetter from Juliette Drouet to Victor Hugo. \u201cGuernsey 1er Janvier 1861 mardi matin 8h1/2 Bonjour, bon an, bonne sant\u00e9, bon amour, bonheur \u00e0 toi, mon bien-aim\u00e9\u2026\u201d\n\nBut I digress. In recent weeks, I\u2019ve read Juliette Drouet\u2019s Love-Letters to Victor Hugo, by Luis Guimbaud, written in 1915. It\u2019s a reasonable biography of Juliette\u2019s life, which includes a few hundred of her letters spanning the years 1833, when she first met Hugo, until her death in 1883. There are probably better biographies but this one is available for free through the Gutenberg project. Understanding this woman has been a perplexing and sometimes frustrating task. At times, she seems resourceful and strong-willed. At others, she is prattling and insecure. Across the decades, her relationship with Hugo, oscillated like a high-frequency sine-wave between blissful and abusive.\n\nWhat follows is some of what I\u2019ve concluded about a complicated woman who lived and loved more than 150 years ago.\n\nA Tumultuous Relationship\n\nI don\u2019t know how many of Juliette\u2019s letters I\u2019ve read at this point but the number is in the hundreds. Despite considerable effort, it was a challenge to find samples of her writing that portray the woman in a flattering light. A handful of themes repeat themselves ad nauseam and I categorize them as follows.\n\nElated by a recent visit by Hugo, Juliette exudes joy and gratitude to have been graced by his presence.\n\nJuliette expresses her admiration of Hugo and/or his latest work, heralding his genius.\n\nSuspicious of Hugo\u2019s absence or rumors of an affair, Juliette decries Hugo\u2019s infidelity and the pain he continually inflicts upon her.\n\nJuliette belittles her self worth while honoring Hugo\u2019s brilliance. She can only repay him with her unyielding devotion.\n\nAfter a heated quarrel, Juliette threatens to put an end to the relationship since both parties have hurled unthinkable insults at each other and will be better off without the other.\n\nJuliette begs Hugo to allow her to stop writing daily letters to him as the exercise has become repetitive and hollow.\n\nJuliette Drouet, circa 1850 by Charles Voillemot, Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, France.\n\nNote that last bullet point. That\u2019s right. The reason why there are 20,000 letters from Juliette to Hugo is that he insisted that she write to him every day! (She often wrote multiple letters in one day). Before I discovered this, I wondered why Hugo, a man of the people, known for extraordinary eloquence, would stick with a woman who, at least in my eyes, hounded him with myriad insipid reports. Extremely rare are the times when Juliette speaks of a current event or any incident outside of their couplehood.\n\nUnfortunately, my perspective arises from a one-sided study. In addition, I\u2019ve only seen a small fraction of what Juliette wrote. Hugo\u2019s letters may also be online. However, I\u2019ve not taken the time to search out his replies of apology or reciprocated adoration. Gradually, however, I\u2019ve come to believe that Hugo, despite his stature, was burdened with his own insecurities. He stayed with Juliette, at least in part, because time and time again, her gushing praise lifted his spirits. Here is an example:\n\nVendredi soir, 8 h Si j\u2019\u00e9tais tant seulement une femme d\u2019esprit, je vous dirais, mon bel oiseau, comme quoi vous avez \u00e0 vous tout seul la forme, le plumage et le chant ! Je vous dirais que vous \u00eates la merveille de toutes les merveilles, depuis celle qui sont jusqu\u2019\u00e0 celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9, et je ne dirais l\u00e0 que la simple v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Mais pour vous dire cela, MON SUPERBE, il me faudrait une voix harmonieuse qui n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dont je fais partie : l\u2019effraie, celle dont vous vous \u00eates si bien moqu\u00e9 tant\u00f4t.

Je leur laisse le soin de vous regarder, de vous \u00e9couter, de vous admirer. Moi, je ne me r\u00e9serve que le droit de vous aimer. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre moins harmonieux \u00e0 l\u2019oreille, mais c\u2019est plus doux au c\u0153ur. Je vous aime. Je t\u2019aime mon Victor. Je ne peux pas trop te le dire, je ne peux jamais te le dire assez comme je sens. Dans tout ce que je vois de beau, je te reconnais. Les belles formes, les belles couleurs, les suaves odeurs, les sons harmonieux, tout \u00e7a, c\u2019est toi, et toi, tu es bien plus que tout ce que je vois et que j\u2019admire : tu es toi ! Tu n\u2019es que le spectre solaire aux sept couleurs lumineuses, tu es le soleil lui-m\u00eame qui \u00e9claire, qui r\u00e9chauffe, qui vivifie. Voil\u00e0 ce que tu es. Moi, je suis une pauvre femme qui t\u2019adore. Juliette Friday, 8 p.m. (1835) If I were only a clever woman, I would tell you, my beautiful bird, how you unite in yourself the beauties of form, plumage, and song! I would tell you that you are the marvel of all marvels that have come and gone, and I would only be speaking the simple truth. But to tell you this, MY SUPERB ONE, I would require a voice more harmonious than that which is bestowed upon my species\u2014the barn owl that you recently so well mocked. It is therefore not me who will tell you to what degree you are dazzling and resplendent. I leave that to the chirping birds, speaking and whistling : and they, as you know, are none the less beautiful nor less appreciative. I leave to them the task of watching you, listening to you, and admiring you. For myself, I reserve only the right to love you. This may be less harmonious to the ear, but it is far sweeter to the heart. I love you, my Victor. I cannot say it to you too often, I can never say it as much as I feel it. In all the beauty that surrounds me, I recognize you. Beautiful forms, beautiful colors, smooth perfumes, harmonious sounds, all of these mean you to me, and you, you are superior to all that I see and admire : you are you! You are not only the solar spectrum with the seven luminous colors, you are the sun himself, who illuminates, warms, and invigorates. That is what you are. For myself, I am the lowly woman who adores you. Juliette\n\nOn Stage, in the Audience, and Excluded from the Theater\n\nJuliette Drouet the actress, by Champmartin, 1827\n\nJuliette met Victor Hugo in 1833, at the age of 27. A striking beauty yet lackluster actress, she had landed a part in Hugo\u2019s play Lucrece Borgia. The young playwright was smitten and soon set his sights on Juliette, sweeping her off her feet. Shortly thereafter, Hugo installed her in an apartment where the two could meet in secret. Worried that her beauty would attract more attentive suitors, he insisted that she not go out unless he was with her. Sequestered in her Parisian flat, Juliette fretted her days away. Her acting career, which had never been stellar, slowly disintegrated into stardust.\n\nNot surprisingly, Juliette was extremely jealous of Hugo\u2019s leading ladies, some of which he was known to have slept with. Hugo promised to write parts for her and indeed he occasionally did so. Unfortunately, he was neither director nor casting agent and Juliette was always replaced with another actress. Her letters demonstrate the depth of her heartbreak and disillusionment when an eagerly anticipated role fell to one of her rivals. In 1839, the couple celebrated a secret marriage, marked by Juliette\u2019s final renunciation of her acting career and Hugo\u2019s vow to never leave her.\n\nOne of Juliette\u2019s most loathed rivals, Mlle George in Hugo\u2019s play Marie Tudor\n\nHugo constantly controlled her movements. At times, she was allowed to go to the theater to see his latest production. However, Juliette was expected to report upon the actors\u2019 performances, the staging, and the audience reaction. She enthusiastically carried out her duties yet was too-often crushed and infuriated when suddenly Hugo would rescind a prior promise to send her a ticket and she\u2019d once again be left to spend an evening alone.\n\nJuliette consoled herself with the realization that she was often the first person to read or hear Hugo\u2019s plays, poetry, and prose. She became his copyist, often performing minor edits and even researching some of his characters. Her letters express overwhelming gratitude for this privilege and abundant appreciation of his manuscripts. She especially loved it when Hugo would take the time to recite his writing to her. In her defense, I somewhat agree that she did hold a place of extreme privilege. Hugo wrote some of the 19th century\u2019s greatest masterpieces\u2014stories that thrive to this day. Below is an excerpt from a letter in which Juliette wrote to Hugo regarding her eagerness to learn the fate of certain characters from Les Miserables.\n\nJe suis tr\u00e8s press\u00e9e de continuer mon TRAVAIL. Cette activit\u00e9 a plus d\u2019une raison dont la premi\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s sinc\u00e8rement l\u2019ardente curiosit\u00e9 que j\u2019ai de savoir ce que deviennent tous ces pauvres martyrs de votre imagination. Je m\u2019y int\u00e9resse comme des personnages de vrai et qui me toucheraient de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s. Leurs malheurs me rendent tr\u00e8s malheureuse et je voudrais griffer ce monstre de Javert et tuer ces hideux Th\u00e9nardier. [\u2026] Toutes ces sublimes choses me font d\u00e9sirer de tout savoir tout de suite et je voudrais ne m\u2019arr\u00eater qu\u2019au mot : fin pour conna\u00eetre le sort que tu r\u00e9serves \u00e0 tous ces pauvres gens. D\u2019abord si tu ne rends pas les Th\u00e9nardier les plus malheureux et les plus immondes des gredins tu ne seras pas juste. Je veux pour ma part que tu leur fasses tout le mal possible ou je ne serai pas contente. Je ne suis pas g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse comme tu sais. D\u2019ailleurs il n\u2019y a pas de g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 qui puisse faire pardonner \u00e0 de pareils monstres I\u2019m very pressed to continue my WORK. This eagerness has more than one motivation, the first of which is my sincere and ardent curiosity to know what\u2019s to become of these poor martyrs of your imagination. I take interest in them as if they were real people that deeply affect me. Their misfortunes render me miserable and I would scratch this monster of a man Javert and kill those hideous Th\u00e9nardiers. [\u2026] All those sublime things make me want to know everything immediately and I don\u2019t want to stop until I reach the word : end in order to know the fate that you have reserved for all these poor people. First, if you don\u2019t render the Th\u00e9nardiers the most unhappy and the most filthy of scoundrels you will not be fair. For my part, I want you to inflict as much pain as possible upon them or I will not be happy. I\u2019m not generous as you know. Anyway there is no generosity that can excuse the acts of such monsters.\n\nJuliette\u2019s Life in Exile\n\nJuliette Drouet in Jersey during Victor Hugo\u2019s exile\n\nIn my previous post, introducing Juliette Drouet and Victor Hugo\u2019s love affair, I described Juliette\u2019s efforts to organize Hugo\u2019s perilous escape to Brussels in 1851. After heavily criticizing Napoleon III and attempting to join a coup to overthrow the new emperor, Hugo found his life was in danger and he needed to flee into exile. Juliette arranged for false identity papers, a disguise, and a series of safe houses where Hugo could hideout as he made his way to Belgium. As I mentioned, she also looked after his precious manuscripts and personally delivered them to him after he had settled in Brussels.\n\nA few months before their flight, Juliette learned of another of Hugo\u2019s torrid affairs. Hugo had been seeing the actress L\u00e9onie Biard who upon learning of his commitment to Juliette, had begged Hugo to dump her. When he refused, Biard gathered up all of the love letters that she\u2019d received from Hugo and delivered them to Juliette. Not for the first time, Juliette was enraged by Hugo\u2019s infidelity. This time, however, rather than threatening to leave she redoubled her determination to remain at his side. The necessity to leave France served two important purposes. First, it saved her lover from prison, and second, it kept him far from Biard\u2019s seductive and meddling grasp.\n\nEver vigilant, Juliette continued to look after Hugo\u2019s manuscripts. She worried that Hugo\u2019s works might fall into larcenous hands before they were published or before he\u2019d received credit for having written them. Still in Brussels, in 1852 she wrote:\n\nJ\u2019ai serr\u00e9 votre manuscrit sous clef ce matin. Maintenant je ne veux pas qu\u2019il tra\u00eene sur ma table. Tu devrais de ton c\u00f4t\u00e9, mon Victor, n\u2019en pas laisser une seule ligne dehors, cela devient de plus en plus prudent. Quant \u00e0 moi je te promets de faire bonne garde. [\u2026] Personne mieux que toi ne peut pr\u00e9voir toutes les emb\u00fbches et toutes les trahisons. Aussi je te supplie de ne rien \u00e9pargner pour les d\u00e9jouer toutes. Pour cela il suffit d\u2019un peu de soin et d\u2019attention de ta part. I secured your manuscript under lock and key this morning. These days, I don\u2019t want it strewn across my table. You should on your end, my Victor, not leave a single line unguarded, doing so is becoming more and more sensible. As for me, I promise to be vigilant. [\u2026] No one better than you can foresee all traps and all betrayals. Yet I beg you to spare nothing in thwarting all of them. To do so, a little care and attention on your part will suffice.\n\nVictor Hugo\u2019s wife, Ad\u00e8le Foucher, by Louis Boulanger, 1839\n\nIndeed, the couple\u2019s life in exile began to settle into something somewhat resembling normalcy. They continued to maintain two residences, first in Brussels, then on the island of Jersey, and finally on Guernsey. Juliette seems to have been much happier during this period. She eventually lived in her own little house that Hugo bought for her. They had more time to spend together as Hugo was no longer distracted by the need to oversee the production of his plays, or by demands to attend business meetings or late-night soir\u00e9es. Hugo also profited from the isolation, as he could now write with far fewer interruptions. Juliette\u2019s persistent proximity was unlike that of Hugo\u2019s wife and children, who would come and go from his side. His immediate family members would reside with him for months at a time and then return to France for long periods.\n\nIncreasingly, Hugo gave Juliette further work as a copyist to keep her busy but she also enjoyed preparing meals for him and the two went for regular walks together. Now permitted to leave her home by herself, she made a few friends and even became close to some of Hugo\u2019s children. Oddly enough, Hugo\u2019s wife Ad\u00e8le actually came to accept Juliette and the two occasionally sent gifts to one another. One Christmas, Ad\u00e8le invited Juliette to a party that the Hugo family was throwing for local children. Juliette declined the overture but expressed her appreciation. In her will, Mme Hugo asked her sons to look after Juliette in case of their father\u2019s death.\n\nA Return to Paris\n\nPhotograph of Juliette dated 1877, project Gutenberg\n\nIn 1870, Victor Hugo ended his days of exile and returned to France. His wife Ad\u00e8le had died in 1868 and in 1873, forty years after they\u2019d met, he and Juliette settled into the same apartment in Paris. Juliette continued to work as feverishly as ever, still copying manuscripts and now taking full responsibility for managing Hugo\u2019s home. Hugo was then 71 and you might think that is libido had settled somewhat. In September of that same year, however, Juliette discovered a love letter to him, written by one of their domestic employees. To make matters worse, the young woman, Blanche Lanvin, was the daughter of close friends.\n\nPerhaps habituated to his betrayals, Juliette resigned herself to Hugo\u2019s unrestrainable flings and carried on with life as the affair proceeded for the next five years behind her back. In October 1873 she penned this rather eloquent screed:\n\nParis, 16 octobre 73, jeudi soir, 4 h. Il y a des choses qui ne se prouvent pas, mon cher bien-aim\u00e9, et qui se sentent mieux qu\u2019avec tous les t\u00e9moins et par toutes les enqu\u00eates possibles, c\u2019est l\u2019amour vrai, sans bornes et incorruptible ; c\u2019est la trahison impitoyable, permanente et l\u00e2che de la femme pour l\u2019homme, de l\u2019homme envers la femme et vice versa. Lequel de nous deux a le droit de prendre Dieu \u00e0 t\u00e9moin de son amour, lequel de nous deux doit s\u2019avouer coupable dans son for int\u00e9rieur ? Dieu seul le sait et c\u2019est \u00e0 lui que je m\u2019adresse dans cet infernal d\u00e9bat de ton amour et du mien toujours remis en question. J\u2019ai l\u2019\u00e2me affol\u00e9e \u00e0 ce point de ne plus rien distinguer entre toi et moi. Tout ce que je sais c\u2019est que je ne r\u00e9sisterai pas longtemps \u00e0 ce conflit sans cesse renaissant de mon pauvre vieil amour aux prises avec les jeunes tentations qui te sont offertes quand peut-\u00eatre tu ne les recherches pas, ce qui n\u2019est rien moins que prouv\u00e9. H\u00e9las, tout ce que je sais, et Dieu sait que je ne mensa pas, c\u2019est que, dans cette nouvelle et douloureuse \u00e9preuve, il y a des choses que toi et moi seuls connaissons et qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas pu deviner. Maintenant je te pardonne parce que je veux que Dieu te pardonne aussi, lui, qui a seul le droit de punir et le pouvoir de me d\u00e9livrer au plus vite de cet enfer terrestre o\u00f9 mon pauvre c\u0153ur est mis \u00e0 la torture depuis la premi\u00e8re minute o\u00f9 je me suis donn\u00e9e \u00e0 toi. Je lui demande de t\u2019\u00e9pargner toutes les souffrances que j\u2019endure et de te rendre les serments imprudents et sacril\u00e8ges faits sur la vie de ton fils malade. Paris, October 16, Thursday, 4:00. There are things that can\u2019t be proven, my dear beloved, and that are better sensed than examined with all possible witnesses and investigations, such is true love, without limits and incorruptible ; such is ruthless betrayal, permanent and cowardly of woman for man, of man against woman and vice versa. Which of us has the right to take God as witness to their love, which of us must admit guilt within their heart of hearts? Only God knows and it is to him that I speak inside this infernal struggle between your love and mine continually called into question. At this point, my panic-stricken soul can no longer distinguish between you and me. All that I know is that I won\u2019t long withstand this incessant conflict rising from my poor aging love fighting against the young temptations that are offered to you when perhaps you are not seeking them, that which is nothing less than proven. Alas, all that I know, and God knows that I\u2019m not lying, is that, within this new and painful ordeal, there are things that you and I alone know and that no one else can guess. Right now I forgive you because I want God to also forgive you, he, who alone has the right to punish and the power to deliver me as soon as possible from this hell on earth where my pitiful heart has been placed on the rack since the first minute that I gave myself to you. I ask him to spare you from the suffering that I endure and to free you from the rash vows and sacrileges made on the life of your sick child.\n\nIn the final years of her life, Juliette took great pleasure in welcoming Hugo\u2019s grandchildren into her home. I\u2019ve sadly not found time to tell you about Juliette\u2019s daughter, Claire Pradier, born before Juliette began seeing Hugo and cared for largely by her father. It\u2019s hard to imagine that all of Juliette\u2019s sacrifices were worth it, but opportunities were scarce for women of the 19th-century. Juliette died on May 11, 1883, after years of suffering from stomach cancer. Hugo\u2019s entourage dissuaded him from attending her funeral which took place the following day. Hugo\u2019s friend, Auguste Vacquerie, a noted journalist and man of letters delivered the eulogy.\n\nAn Influential Mistress\n\nJuliette Drouet by Jules Bastien-Lepage, Paris Mus\u00e9es\n\nIt\u2019s evident that Juliette meant far more to Victor Hugo than his other vassals of amusement. While not alone in the role, she was a lifelong partner that he heavily relied upon. Historians, psychologists, students of literature, and doctoral candidates of many stripes will undoubtedly be combing through both lovers\u2019 archives for decades. There they are bound to uncover many more examples of Juliette\u2019s contributions to Hugo\u2019s life\u2019s work.\n\nOne astute researcher recently revealed a link between Hugo\u2019s poem Paroles dans l\u2019ombre and words from a letter that Juliette had composed to him. In Juliette\u2019s version, she complains to Hugo about his inattentiveness during a visit on the previous evening:\n\nSonge que je t\u2019ai tr\u00e8s peu vu apr\u00e8s tout puisque tu as travaill\u00e9 tout le temps sans lever une seule fois les yeux sur moi et sans m\u2019adresser une parole. Je sais bien que je pouvais te regarder, et je ne m\u2019en suis pas priv\u00e9e, mais je ne te vois pas aussi bien quand tu ne me regardes pas un peu toi-m\u00eame de temps en temps. Consider that I barely saw you after all since you worked all of the time without once lifting your eyes to me and without addressing a single word to me. I well know that I could look at you, and did not deny myself that, but I don\u2019t see you as well when you don\u2019t look at me a little yourself from time to time.\n\nHugo\u2019s poem which bears a striking resemblance to the letter:\n\nParoles dans l\u2019ombre Sans doute, je vous ai ; sans doute, je vous voi.\n\nLa pens\u00e9e est un vin dont les r\u00eaveurs sont ivres,\n\nJe le sais ; mais, pourtant, je veux qu\u2019on songe \u00e0 moi.\n\nQuand vous \u00eates ainsi tout un soir dans vos livres,\n\nSans relever la t\u00eate et sans me dire un mot,\n\nUne ombre reste au fond de mon c\u0153uer qui vous aime;\n\nEt, pour que je vous voie enti\u00e8rement, il faut\n\nMe regarder un peu, de temps en temps, vous-m\u00eame. Words in the Shadow Doubtless, I have you ; doubtless, I see you.\n\nThought is a wine which makes its dreamers drunk,\n\nI know it ; nevertheless, I wish you\u2019d dream of me.\n\nWhen you are thus all through an evening in your books,\n\nWithout lifting your head and without saying a word to me,\n\nA shadow rests at the bottom of my heart that loves you;\n\nAnd, for me to see you entirely, you must look at me a little, from time to time, yourself.\n\nSo concludes my brief look into the life of Juliette Drouet. I leave it to others to sort through her prolific output and match it to the mountains of correspondence and classical masterpieces that her dominating lover produced. My hope is that as such discoveries are made, they\u2019ll give us better insights into Juliette\u2019s existence and that she\u2019ll emerge as a smart and industrious beauty who despite her limited options helped to create a literary genius that the world salutes to this day.\n\nEnd note: I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed reading at least half as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed writing this post. The translations were particularly fun for me but may well be subject to other interpretations. Please let me know in the comments if you see Juliette\u2019s words in a different light. The same holds true for my descriptions of historical events and timelines.\n\nOther Resources\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://casdinteret.com/2020/10/love-letter-from-exile-victor-hugo-juliette-drouet/", "page_content": "I recently came upon a list of the ten most beautiful love letters. In general, I find such lists rather pointless. In this case, however, most of the letters had been written by great French authors so it piqued my interest. Near the top was one that Victor Hugo wrote at the end of 1851 to his mistress, Juliette Drouet. Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte had just staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat which ultimately ended in the dissolution of the French National Assembly and re-established the French Empire. Hugo, a beloved man of the people and staunch critic of Napol\u00e9on III, joined others to launch a rebellion but quickly realized his life was in danger and that he needed to flee the country.\n\nJuliette Drouet, at that point Hugo\u2019s lover of nearly twenty years, risked her life to organize his perilous escape. As violent clashes broke out in the streets of Paris and in other towns and cities across France, Juliette arranged for false identity papers and set up a series of safe-houses where Hugo could remain hidden as he waited to cross into Belgium. Using a fake passport, Hugo arrived in Brussels on December 12. Juliette joined him two days later. With her she had brought a trunk, carrying all of Hugo\u2019s past works and some yet to come. Among the latter was two-thirds of the still uncompleted Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nHugo wrote the exemplary love letter not long after the couple had established themselves in Brussels. Juliette maintained a separate apartment and while she cooked for Hugo, cleaned and mended his clothes, and performed countless secretarial duties, she never visited his residence. It was Juliette\u2019s maid who ran the necessary errands each day between the two addresses. Hugo, on the other hand, often visited and sometimes worked from Juliette\u2019s apartment. On December 31, 1851, he penned the impassioned words while Juliette was out and he anxiously awaited her return.\n\nVictor\u2019s Letter to Juliette with My English Translation\n\nVictor Hugo by Achille Dev\u00e9ria, National Gallery of Art\n\nJuliette Drouet by Alphonse-L\u00e9on No\u00ebl, Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet\n\n\u00c0 Juliette, le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1851\n\n\n\nMon doux ange bien aim\u00e9, voici l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui finit, ann\u00e9e de douleurs, ann\u00e9e de luttes, ann\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9preuves, l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui commence sera l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019esp\u00e9rance de joie et d\u2019amour. N\u2019en doute pas, car c\u2019est tout mon c\u0153ur qui me le dit. Je suis proscrit, banni, exil\u00e9, s\u00e9par\u00e9 des miens, pauvre, errant, frapp\u00e9 au c\u0153ur et pourtant, quand je me tourne vers toi, il me semble que je vois le bon Dieu qui me sourit. To Juliette, December 31, 1851\n\n\n\nMy dearly loved angel, here we are at year\u2019s end, year of pain, year of conflict, year of hardship, the year that begins will be a year of hope of joy and of love. Do not doubt it, for all my heart tells me it is so. I am outcast, banished, exiled, separated from my loved ones, poor, wandering, heart-stricken and yet, when I turn toward you, it seems like I see the good Lord smiling upon me.\n\nTu as \u00e9t\u00e9 admirable ma Juliette dans ces sombres et rudes journ\u00e9es. Si j\u2019avais eu besoin de courage, tu m\u2019en aurais donn\u00e9, mais j\u2019avais besoin d\u2019amour, et sois b\u00e9ni, tu m\u2019en apportais ! Quand, dans mes retraites toujours p\u00e9rilleuses, apr\u00e8s une nuit d\u2019attente, j\u2019entendais le matin la clef de ma porte tressaillir sous ta main, j\u2019oubliais tout, je n\u2019avais plus de p\u00e9rils ni de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres autour de moi, c\u2019\u00e9tait la lumi\u00e8re qui entrait! You have been admirable my Juliette during these dark and difficult days. If I had been in need of courage, you would have given it to me, but I needed love, and bless you, you brought it to me! When, in my always perilous hideouts, after a night of waiting, I would hear in the morning the key to my door trembling in your hand, I would forget everything, I no longer felt in danger nor the shadows encircling me, it was light that entered!\n\nHo n\u2019oublions jamais ces heures terribles et pourtant si douces o\u00f9 tu \u00e9tais pr\u00e8s de moi dans les intervalles de la lutte ! Rappelons-nous toute notre vie cette petite chambre obscure, ces vielles tapisseries, ces deux fauteuils c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te, ces repas au coin de la table avec le poulet froid que tu apportais, ces causeries si tendres, tes caresses, tes anxi\u00e9t\u00e9s, ton d\u00e9vouement ! Tu t\u2019\u00e9tonnais de mon calme et de ma s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9. Sais-tu d\u2019o\u00f9 me venaient cette s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 et ce calme ; c\u2019\u00e9tait toi. Vois tu, Dieu ne frappe jamais tout \u00e0 fait, il nous a jet\u00e9 ici, mais ensemble. Qu\u2019il soit b\u00e9ni. Oh let us never forget those terrible hours and yet so sweet where you were next to me during periods of struggle! Let us remember for the rest of our lives that little dark room, those old tapestries, those two armchairs side by side, those meals at the fireside table with cold chicken that you would bring, those chats so tender, your caresses, your worries, your devotion! You would be surprised by my calm and my serenity. Do you know where this serenity and this calm came from; it was from you. You see, God never strikes completely, he threw us here, but together. May he be blessed.\n\nDans ces ann\u00e9es si vite \u00e9coul\u00e9es, h\u00e9las, ton \u00e2me a d\u00e9pens\u00e9 des tr\u00e9sors de tendresse, de d\u00e9vouement, de fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, de vertu, et pourtant cette belle \u00e2me est plus riche que jamais.

J\u2019ai eu tout et tu as tout. Il n\u2019y a que les astres du ciel qui puissent ainsi donner sans cesse leurs rayons sans diminuer leur lumi\u00e8re. In those years so rapidly gone by, alas, your soul dispensed a wealth of tenderness, of devotion, of loyalty, of virtue, and yet that beautiful soul is richer than ever. Your eyes gave me many smiles, your mouth many kisses, and yet your sweet face is younger than ever. You have given everything and you have kept everything. I had everything and you have everything. Only the stars in the sky can thusly cast their beams ceaselessly without diminishing their light.\n\nL\u2019ann\u00e9e qui vient de finir a \u00e9t\u00e9 triste.

Victor Hugo The year that has finished was sad. Half of my heart is dead. Oh! How sweet you were for me during those hours of dread! How God rewards you and blesses you! Your love, oh my angel, resembles virtue. I can hardly wait to see you this evening. One would say that the beating of my heart hastens the rhythm of the pendulum so as to get there more quickly. When I am nothing more than a frozen cinder, when my tired eyes no longer see the day, tell yourself, if in your heart my memory is etched:\n\n\n\nThe world has his thoughts\n\nMe, I had his Love. Victor Hugo\n\nA Long and Prolific Love Affair\n\nAfter reading this letter, I became curious about Juliette. It\u2019s in researching her life that I learned much of what I\u2019ve reported above. As fortune would have it, Juliette was Hugo\u2019s mistress for 50 years. During that time, Hugo was married and had a family. He was an insatiable womanizer who had countless short and long-term flings with other women\u2014well into old age. Some historians have described Juliette as his prisoner. Certainly, their relationship was fraught with jealous quarrels, threats of rupture, and joyous reconciliations.\n\nIn addition to being Hugo\u2019s lover, the devoted Juliette spent her days copying and proofreading Hugo\u2019s plays and poetry, clipping news articles and gathering research for his work, boosting the flamboyant author\u2019s moral, and advising him on his relationships with publishers, agents, actors, even his wife and children. Throughout the decades, Juliette composed copious notes and letters of her own. In fact, Juliette wrote to Hugo nearly every day. When she died, she left behind more than 20,000 of her own documents, hand-written in quill and ink. Is it any wonder that Hugo gained tremendous strength from their relationship? She\u2019s a fascinating figure who, like Kiki of Montparnasse, is rendered invisible in the shadow cast by her celebrated lover. I hope to learn and share more about her soon.\n\nUpdate: In a subsequent post, I dig deeper into Juliette\u2019s life and provide several examples of the letters she wrote to Hugo.\n\nVictor Hugo by Aim\u00e9 Morot, Paris Mus\u00e9es\n\nJuliette Drouet by Jules Bastien-Lepage, Paris Mus\u00e9es\n\nOther Resources\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/articles/article/victor-hugo-and-guernsey-georges-victor-hugo", "page_content": "By Dinah Bott.\n\nGeorges Victor-Hugo (1868-1925) was the son of Victor Hugo\u2019s eldest son, Charles, and the young Alice Lehaene, an orphan who had been under the guardianship of family friend and political activist Jules Simon. Hugo doted on Georges and his sister Jeanne and after the tragic and unexpected death of their father at the age of only 44 Hugo became their guardian and played a large part in their upbringing. They are the subject of his immensely popular poetry collection, L\u2019Art d\u2019\u00eatre grand-p\u00e8re (1877). Georges was a genial man and a talented artist, who was fond of Guernsey and spent summer holidays here, bringing his friends from the Parisian intellectual and artistic milieu with him.\n\nAfter the death of his grandfather, Georges was left independently wealthy. The novelist and family friend Alphonse Daudet asked him why, as he was a talented writer, did he not try his hand at writing novels? Georges replied that he would think about it when the money ran out. In December 1893 the Star announced his engagement to his childhood friend, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian (1870-1941). The wedding took place in March 1894 once Georges had completed his military service in the French navy. Her family had probably already bought La Marcherie at Icart in readiness for cosy family summers in Guernsey with the two families installed at Hauteville House and Icart.\n\nGeorges did in fact write a novel in 1896, Souvenirs d\u2019un matelot (A sailor\u2019s life). He and Pauline were divorced in 1900, having had two children, Jean (b. 1894) and Marguerite (b. 1896). At this point he fell out with his family for while as he took the side of L\u00e9on Daudet in his acrimonious split from Georges\u2019 sister, Jeanne. There were public spats and court cases, but peace was eventually restored. In 1901 he married again, to another member of the Dorian family, Dora Dorian, like Pauline close to him in age, and they remained together for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1902 he published a charming memoir of Victor Hugo, My grandfather (Mon grand-p\u00e8re, Paris: Calmann-L\u00e9vy), which was republished in 1931 with a selection of his paintings as illustrations. At the outbreak of WWI he signed up immediately and after a controversial stint in the Censor\u2019s Office asked to be transferred to the front, where his teenaged son Jean was also serving. In 1915 Georges won the Croix de Guerre for his brave conduct. At this time he arranged for his surname to be changed from Hugo to Victor-Hugo, in homage to his grandfather; some newspapers claimed it was because it sounded too German \u2013 the Hugo family was always a target. In 1916 his war drawings were published in L\u2019Illustration, where they were made much of. He died aged 57 in 1925. His war drawings were forgotten until the present century when interest in his work in general has grown. His self-portrait, in the collection of the Candie Museum in Guernsey, is on display in the Library. After his death his children and their aunt Jeanne handed Hauteville House over to the City of Paris in 1927, to be preserved as a museum."}]}
