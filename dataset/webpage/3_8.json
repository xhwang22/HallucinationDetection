R. Presbyterian Church cemetery in Newberry County, SC.\n\nNo one is sure just when James Blair came to SC but he was living in the colony prior to the Revolutionary War.\n\nThere is the possibility James could have come to SC with his father who, per family lore, was a William Blair. A number of James Blairs came into the SC colony in the early 1770s before the Revolutionary War. One settled in Chester County and there has been confusion over which James is which. Members of the Blair Genealogical Society have accounted for all but one. A James Blair arrived in Charleston on the ship Pennsylvania Farmer in 1772 and petitioned for 350 acres of land under the SC land Bounty Act. Based on how the land act awarded acreage, this would mean James was accompanied by five family members - 100 acres for him and 50 acres for each of the other family members. There is no record of a James Blair being awarded 350 acres - 250 is most received by a James Blair and this in Chester County. It is possible this James' petition was never granted. The problem the James' in this bio is his children were born after 1772, which would rule him out as being the James on the Pennsylvania Farmer - unless he was eventually awarded land with less acreage.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Farmer was one of five ships which brought a number of persons over from Great Britain as part of the contingent called by Rev. William Marten. Rev. Marten established a Presbyterian church \"on Rocky Mountain Road, 15 miles SE of Chester.\" One of the other ships was the James and Mary which had 183 persons on board. No passenger list for this ship has been found and it is possible James was aboard this ship.\n\nA James Blair fought in the Revolutionary War. His tombstone, erected by sons James and George Blair, has the term \"Revolutionary Patriot\" inscribed. A James Blair is listed as serving in the militia during 1780, 1781 and 1782. In June 1780, he was a horseman under Col. Hill and in April and July 1781 he was under Capt. Garrison and Col. Bratton. In October 1780, he was under Capt. Robert Faris and Col. Hill. During 1782, he was under a Capt. Hind (Hinds) and Col. Bratton. At some time, he was under a Capt. Walker. There are three records for a James Blair receiving payment for Revolutionary War service. On 4 April 1785, he received Seventeen Pounds, One Shilling Sterling for hire of \"waggon,\" team and driver 62 days in militia use in 1778 and 1779. On 12 April 1785, he received one hundred and ten pounds and 6 pence sterling for continental and militia use. On 21 May 1785, he received over 16 pounds sterling for 193 days militia duty in 1780, 1781, and 1782.\n\nAbout three individuals have claimed the above service records for their James Blair. It is hard to determine from the records which service is tied to which James.\n\nJames married Jane Streight based on an entry in the Newberry County S.C. Probate Estate Abstracts, Vol 1, for the estate of a George Streight and stating he had \"a daughter named \"Jennet w/o James Blair.\" It is assumed Jennet and Jane are the same person. In addition, James Blair is listed as an executor of the estate. George Streight's Last Will and Testament is dated 27 May 1788.\n\nJames' was selected at least three times to serve on Pettit Juries for Newberry County, SC - September 1786, February 1793, and July 1793.\n\nIn December 1783 James is listed as buying 200 acres of lane on Foster's Creek in Newberry County from Abraham Lindsey. The price for the land was 250 pounds \"SC money.\"\n\nIn January 1794 James purchased 100 acres of land on Foster's Creek, a branch of the Enoree River, from Levi Johnson for 50 pounds. It is stated in the action that James was a \"planter.\"\n\nIn February 1798, James was assigned as one the four men to appraise the estate of John Kelly.\n\nJames and Jane had four other children in addition to sons George, John and James. These four, as follows, had no known children and they are all buried in Kings Creek cemetery,\n\nWilliam Blair's tombstone only has his name. Based on the census records he was born about 1785 and died prior to 1800.\n\nMartha Blair's tombstone only has her name. She does not show up in any census and probably died shortly after birth.\n\nMargaret Blair's tombstone has a date of death of August 8, 1824. Since it states she died at age 33, then her birth year was 1791.\n\nMary Blair's tombstone has a date of death of May 2, 1844. Since it states she died at age 56, then her birth year was 1788.\n\nFamily sources state Margaret was the first wife of Hayne McCrackin and Mary was his second wife. Hayne is also buried at Kings Creek but his headstone has only his name. No other data has been found to verify Margaret and Mary did marry Hayne.\n\nSources\n\n1. Find A Grave for James Blair\n\n2.

Called the \"Tournament East\u2013West football game\" at the time, the Michigan Wolverines (East) played the Stanford Indians (West) - the Wolverines won 49 - 0. (The Stanford captain requested an end to the game with 8 minutes remaining.) The Tournament of Roses Parade began in 1890 and the football game began as a way to boost tourism in the area.\n\nIn 1912, he was merely 10 years old when the RMS Titanic sank in April. The RMS Titanic was a British built and run passenger liner that was billed as \"unsinkable.\" On its maiden voyage from Southampton England to New York City, carrying about 2,224 passengers and crew - from the wealthiest people in the world to poor emigrants from Europe, the Titanic hit an iceberg. Five of her watertight compartments failed but she was designed to survive only 4 being flooded. She began to sink. There were only enough lifeboats for about half of the passengers so over 1,000 remained behind while \"women and children first\" were loaded. Over 1500 died, making it the largest maritime disaster in modern history.\n\nIn 1937, by the time he was 35 years old, on May 6th, the German zeppelin the Hindenburg caught fire and blew up. The Hindenburg was a passenger ship traveling to Frankfurt Germany. It tried to dock in New Jersey, one of the stops, and something went wrong - it blew up. Thirty-six people were killed out of the 97 on board - 13 passengers, 22 crewmen, and one ground worker. The reasons for the explosion are still disputed.\n\nIn 1946, he was 44 years old when on July 4th, the Philippines gained independence from the United States. In 1964, Independence Day in the Philippines was moved from July 4th to June 12th at the insistence of nationalists and historians.\n\nIn 1977, in the year of James Blair's passing, on May 25th, Star Wars premiered in theaters. Eventually, it became the highest-grossing film of all time - until E.T. surpassed it a few years later. It was an immediate hit with theatergoers."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83150847/james-blair", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.
