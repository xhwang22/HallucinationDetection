Today, the \u201cTorre Alessi\u201d street remains the only testimony of this singular structure that stood precisely on that portion of territory\n\nThe main Italian cities can still boast of possessing the highest and most imposing towers of the Peninsula. Just think of the famous and leaning Tower of Pisa, immortalized in the photographs of many tourists who imagine having fun to support it, or the two main towers of Bologna, the Torre degli Asinelli and the Garisenda, also pending but less elevated than its adjoining companion. Each of them is an expression of the splendor of an era in which art, in all its forms, was one of the many ways to manifest power. However, few people know that even from this point of view Catania had nothing to envy to other cities. The past, unfortunately, does not tell us a good story: from the mid-60s of the last century, the only tower that was present in the city has no longer existed. We are talking about the \u201cTorre Alessi\u201d, which inspired Vitaliano Brancati\u2019s Lost Years.\n\nTHE ARCHITECT FROM MILAN. The current toponymy of Catania includes Via Torre Alessi among its sometimes bizarre names. It connects Via Salvatore Paola with Via Federico Ciccaglione, near the Botanical Garden. The name of this street is the last testimony of the singular structure that stood precisely on that portion of territory. The area to which we are referring was once used as a citrus orchard and belonged to the Alessi family. Even at that time, it was certainly not infrequent that water was scarce to irrigate the fields, so the owners of this land decided to entrust the construction of a large collection tank to the architect Carlo Sada. For a better functioning of this hydraulic system, Sada, who was well known in the city for his works, decided to insert the tank in a tower that would allow to regulate the inflow of water. And that is how a structure about 35 meters high came to light, not counting the metal top part, which was composed of four floors: the first was a dovecote, the second served as a pool, the third did not have a precise destination and the fourth was used as a panoramic terrace.\n\nTHE LOST YEARS. The eclectic taste of the architect led him to conceive an architectural element that was avant-garde from a technological point of view, considering the function to which the tower was used, but which was also aesthetically worthy of note. The result was precisely a structure with exotic features, which fully responded to the canons of the Liberty of Catania, enriched by a whole series of elements, such as an external spiral staircase and an iron dome that the writer Brancati described very well in his Lost Years: \u00abThe green spire in Moorish style was supported by nine columns. Beneath the terrace, the architrave was painted in gold, and the frieze, embroidered with oblong spheres, glistened with the green sea\u00bb. Ultimately, the Torre Alessi could be considered as one of the wonders of the city, if only for the splendid panorama that could be enjoyed from its terrace and which became a source of income for the owners. It seems, in fact, that at the end of the 800s citizens and tourists could access there by buying a ticket.\n\nTHE ECONOMIC BOOM. Over time the Torre Alessi was protagonist of sad events too. According to the sources, it is clear that during the Second World War were registered cases of people who let themselves fall on deaf ears, right from the highest part of the structure. Passing from owner to owner, at the end of the conflict it passed through period of decline, until fate manifested itself in all its cruelty. At the beginning of the 60s, the Tower, now abandoned, was involved in the demolition process that would have paved the way to the imposing residential buildings which still dot the neighborhood where the structure was located. Not only this particular example of the Catanese art was demolished, but it was also, and above all, its memory. Nobody, or almost talk about the exotic taste tower that was the pride of a people in constant turmoil anymore.\n\nTranslated into English by Eva Luna Mascolino"}], "Vitaliano Brancati was a screenwriter.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vitaliano_Brancati", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Vitaliano Brancati?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Vitaliano_Brancati/", "page_content": "Vitaliano Brancati\n\nVitaliano Brancati (Italian pronunciation: [vita\u02c8lja\u02d0no bra\u014b\u02c8ka\u02d0ti]; 24 July 1907 \u2013 25 September 1954) was an Italian novelist, dramatist, poet and screenwriter .

Insisting that 20th-century literature should express the characteristic dynamism of industry, he advocated a type of writing that would emulate the speed and tension of machines. He also became a leading proponent of Italian intervention in World War I (1914-1918) and was later an advocate of fascism.\n\nThe most important thinker in early 20th-century Italy was the philosopher, statesman, literary critic, and historian Benedetto Croce, whose influence became worldwide. His bimonthly periodical La Critica (1903-1944) and his literary and philosophical works developed the ideas of the 18th-century philosopher Giambattista Vico and stressed the importance of intuition in art and of freedom in the development of civilization. His position of idealism was in strong opposition to the positivistic thinking then current in Italy. Croce believed that the intellectual should participate in public life and was himself openly opposed to fascism. His major philosophical work, Filosofia come scienza dello spirito (1902-1917; Philosophy of the Spirit, 1909-1921), consists of four volumes, one each devoted to aesthetics, logic, practical thinking, and history. His autobiography, published in 1918, is the record of a rich and varied life.\n\nBesides La Critica, two other periodicals acted as the forum of different groups of Italian writers. Voce (1908-16), directed by the writer Giuseppe Prezzolini, helped to modernize Italian culture and introduce into Italy significant French, British, and American ideas. Outstanding among Prezzolini\u2019s collaborators were the painter and writer Ardengo Soffici and the philosopher and writer Giovanni Papini. The other important periodical, Ronda (1919-1923), was reactionary in tendency and classical in inspiration. From its circle came the writers Antonio Baldini and Riccardo Bacchelli.\n\nA unique figure throughout the first three decades of the century was the novelist, short-story writer, and playwright Luigi Pirandello, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1934. He introduced into his plays original dramatic devices that tended to bring actors and the audience into closer relation. Many of his plays are dramatizations of earlier stories, and most of them treat philosophical problems, such as relativism and multiple personality, with subtle psychological insight illuminated by graceful wit. The most famous of Pirandello\u2019s plays include the following: Sei personaggi in cerca d\u2019autore (1921; Six Characters in Search of an Author, 1922), Enrico IV (1922; Henry IV, 1922), and Come tu mi vuoi (1930; As You Desire Me, 1931). His novels include Il fu Mattia Pascal (1904; The Late Mattia Pascal, 1923) and I vecchi e i giovani (1913; The Old and the Young, 1928).\n\nThe emergence of fascism in Italy under Benito Mussolini endangered the vitality of Italian literature. Fascism failed to create a type of literature congenial to the government in power. The outstanding authors of the time reacted variously to the stifling intellectual conditions and to the contempt for human freedom contained in the Fascist political philosophy. Many were outspoken in their opposition, among them the writer and scholar Giuseppe Antonio Borgese. He realistically appraised the political situation in Goliath, The March of Fascism (1937), which was written in English, but which was not translated into Italian until ten years later. The novelist Ignazio Silone, who went into exile, became more famous abroad than in Italy for his searching political novels, notably Fontamara (1933; trans. 1934) and Pane e vino (1937; first published in English as Bread and Wine, 1936). Croce was forced into retirement under fascism; the journalist and diplomat Curzio Suckert, who wrote under the pseudonym Malaparte, served the government in an official capacity but ended by repudiating Mussolini. His most powerful work, Kaputt (1944; trans. 1946), depicts the moral and cultural degeneration of Europe under fascism.\n\nAfter World War II a number of Italian writers came into international prominence.\n\nGiuseppe Ungaretti, who ranks with Eugenio Montale among the foremost European poets of the 20th century, published his first book of verse, Il porto sepolto (The Buried Harbor), in 1916, marking the beginning of a period of great revival in Italian poetry. His works, the most important of which are Allegria di naufragi (Gaiety of the Outcasts, 1919), Sentimento del tempo (Feeling of Time, 1933), Il dolore (The Pain, 1947), and La terra promessa (The Promised Land, 1954), have been collected under the title Vita di un uomo (Life of a Man, 1958). His poetry is characterized by a sparing use of words and by his power to create illuminating images of unusual lyric intensity.\n\nMontale\u2019s major poems are found in three books: Ossi di seppia (1925; The Bones of Cuttlefish, 1983), Le occasioni (1939; The Occasions, 1987), and La bufera e altro (1956; The Storm and Other Poems, 1978); these were published in a collected edition, Poesie (1958; Poems, 1964). His lyric verse, often highly compressed and hermetic, contains a harsh and intellectual criticism of life and is at times deeply pessimistic in tone. In 1975 Montale was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nPoems by Salvatore Quasimodo reveal a passionate lyrical awareness of tragedy in modern life. Collections of these poems include Ed \u00e8 subito sera (And Suddenly It Is Evening, 1942), Giorno dopo giorno (Day After Day, 1947), La vita non \u00e8 sogno (Life Is Not a Dream, 1949), and Il falso e vero verde (The False and True Green, 1953). Quasimodo was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1959. The Selected Writings of Salvatore Quasimodo (1960) and To Give and to Have and Other Poems (1969) are English editions. His Complete Poems were published in English translation in 1983.\n\nA few years after the war a new type of realism appeared in the Italian cinema, which enjoyed a period of unique creativity, and simultaneously critics began to speak of an Italian literary neorealism. Among the outstanding figures were Carlo Levi, who exposed the plight of farmers of southern Italy in his best-seller Cristo si \u00e8 fermato a Eboli (1946; Christ Stopped at Eboli, 1947); Elio Vittorini, the author of Conversazione in Sicilia (1941; In Sicily, 1949); and Vasco Pratolini, who wrote Cronache di poveri amanti (1947; A Tale of Poor Lovers, 1949). Other major figures are Mario Soldati, noted for his Lettere da Capri (1954; Affair in Capri: The Capri Letters, 1957); Cesare Pavese, whose works include Tra donne sole (1949; Among Women Only, 1959), Il diavolo sulle colline (1949; The Devil in the Hills, 1959), and La luna e i fal\u00f2 (1950; The Moon and the Bonfires, 1950); and Vitaliano Brancati, a keen critic of contemporary Sicilian society as shown in Il bell\u2019 Antonio (1949; Antonio the Great Lover, 1952). A novel that earned acclaim internationally, Il gattopardo (1958; The Leopard, 1960), by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, is set against the background of Sicilian life; it was made into an acclaimed film.\n\nBesides Pirandello, the best-known Italian writer of the postwar period, especially in the United States, was Alberto Moravia, a prolific author notable for his novels and short stories of contemporary human situations. He wrote in a spare, realistic prose style about the moral dilemmas of men and women trapped in social and emotional circumstances. His most popular work is La ciociara (1957; Two Women, 1959), a novel about a mother and her daughter in war-torn Italy. The story was made into a successful motion picture. Another acclaimed motion picture was based on a haunting novel by Giorgio Bassani, Il Giardino dei Finzi-Contini (1962; The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, 1965). The story of the plight of an Italian Jewish family under fascism, it is set in the author\u2019s native Ferrara."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/97664.Vitaliano_Brancati", "page_content": "Showing 30 distinct works.\n\nsort by popularity original publication year title average rating number of pages\n\n* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.

The Mediterranean\u2019s largest island, with a population of around five million people, it has produced over the last two centuries a disproportionate number of great writers: De Roberto, Verga, Pirandello, Vittorini, Sciascia, and, far and away the best-selling Italian writer for the last ten years, Andrea Camilleri. Born in 1907 in the small town of Pachino on the southeast corner of Sicily\u2013a bit farther south than Tunis\u2013 Vitaliano Brancati has been called the \u201cmost Southern of Italian writers,\u201d and is recognized as an eminent contributor to the Sicilian literary canon. When he died prematurely in 1954 at the age of 47, his literary legacy included six novels, eight plays, three collections of short stories, several volumes of essays and literary criticism, hundreds of articles and other journalistic writings, and screenplays for a number of films by leading Italian directors such as Mario Monicelli and Roberto Rossellini.\n\nThe story reprinted here, \u201cIl Nonno,\u201d was written in 1934, the year following his grandfather\u2019s death, when Brancati was just twenty-seven. The heart of the story is the intimate relationship between a young boy and the \u201celderly gentleman\u201d who was his best friend for the first ten years of his life, a relationship seldom treated with such insight and sensitivity, between two males on either side of the \u201cmaturity\u201d of middle age, the dark corridor of maturity that the narrator realizes he has entered on the evening of his grandfather\u2019s funeral. The narrator\u2019s look back at this special relationship, is the occasion to revisit the landscapes and the sensory perceptions of his boyhood and to try to account for the external and internal changes that have occurred in the fifteen years or so since the illness that struck his grandfather and marked a turning point in their lives.\n\nDuring the European War, my grandfather came down with an attack of appendicitis that brought him almost to death\u2019s door. He had frequent bouts of delirium in those days, and he said something that he had never said to anyone: that his father hadn\u2019t died of natural causes, but had poisoned himself over the pain of losing his wife. On several occasions, he called out to his daughter and asked her to stand between him and the doorway because looking toward that corner of the room scared him.\n\nHe had always been a brave man, forthright, full of spirit, and he had loved me more even than his own eyes. From his meager salary as a town employee\u2013which he had to hand over, penny by penny, to my grandmother\u2013he managed to make disappear, with the ingenuous tricks of a student, a few silver lira coins that he kept squirreled away in a little purse. The purse would sit there for months at a time until my family made the trip back to our home town; would wait for me to step down off the stagecoach that brought me from Spaccaforno to Pachino and, after a three hour nap, go out with its owner into the main piazza of the town, surrounded by stores lit by oil lamps, with no signs, no shop-windows, each with maybe twenty items to sell and just barely distinguishable from the houses of the local farmers. I emptied out my grandfather\u2019s purse in those stores and filled my arms with old, simple toys, threadbare stuffed animals, dented toy guns, and puppets made of sugar with their noses and ears already broken off.\n\nI was three years old and rather domineering in my own lethargic way. From inside a bundle of white clothes and coveralls, I would stick my right hand out to point to some little piece of the world that I would have preferred belonged to me or that should be treated in some particular way. One afternoon with my grandfather, I pointed to a drowsy, fat horse in a team of six, whose owner, an important personage in the town, had often been the object of caricature in the dialect rhymes that my grandfather used to invent at banquets. I wanted my grandfather furtively to separate the horse from its companions and mount it together with me. Naturally, he said no, that wasn\u2019t possible. But I\u2019ll never forget the pained look in his eye, the disheartened gaze he cast on a world so poorly arranged as not to permit, without fear and shame, untying a horse from a team of six and making a present of it to a little boy. I didn\u2019t say a word to my grandfather for the rest of the evening, but during the night I was overcome with remorse and soaked my pillow with tears. All in all, that was the bitterest episode of my friendship with my grandfather, and it brought to an end, once and for all, my first five years of life. A year later, I was already less domineering and more serious. Something like the shade of a world-weary man had entered my body. I loved leaning on little walking sticks, smoking chocolate cigarettes, and listening to people while holding a hand up to my ear. My grandfather was the only man in the world who respected these new habits of mine with which I was preparing to make my way slowly to my first venerable age: ten.\n\nHe would take me on long walks that ended at the gates to the city, on a cracked and flaking terrace called \u201cthe round,\u201d where we could see the water off Marzamemi and the miniscule, clouded skyline of Noto.\n\nPachino sits on a hilltop, pelted by the wind of two seas: the Ionian and the Mediterranean. This wind sweeps the town continuously and makes the cobblestones shine like diamonds. The streets are wide and white and all come together in the large central piazza that, being the highest point in the town, is visible from everywhere and has that smooth aspect and red hue of places that are constantly battered by the wind.\n\nThat wind is tied, in a very intimate way, to my childhood. I can still see my grandfather\u2019s goatee brought to life and yanked to the right or left by that wonderful wind that so often took my breath away.\n\nIn the piazza was the mother church, and on the mother church the clock and the only lightning rod in town. The church, with its high, blank wall like the side of a ship, flanked a wide avenue that was considered the main street. This was the site of the local market and home to an exorbitant number of aunts and uncles, cousins, great uncles, great cousins, witnesses at my father\u2019s wedding, doctors who had treated my grandmother, midwives who had helped bring into the world my father, my brother, and me; all people who knew a heap of things about me that I didn\u2019t know, and who irritated me with their all-knowing air and that gaze that slid down over my head and rushed off into the past, as if I was nothing more to them than a pretext for resting their chins in their hands and remembering. My grandfather, no less than I, was offended by the demeanor of our relatives. I was more important to him than all of that past; though doubtless that past had some small value for him in so far as in the end it had deigned to produce the ten kilos of living being that were me. So, in total agreement with each other, we avoided the main street and made our way to the round on side streets full of children, of wagon wheels leaning against walls, and groups of people, each of whom was holding onto a horse so it could be shoed.\n\nBut in the evening, when the street was deserted, and the houses and the shops were all closed up, except for the pharmacy run by my grandfather\u2019s brother, Uncle Carlo, who stood next to the counter and, holding a guitar in his left hand, added a few hendecasyllable verses to one of his tragedies with his right; when the last lamps went out in the marketplace and it was no longer possible to tell whether what was moving around in the shadows was a watchman, a dog, or a calf; when the wind finally calmed down for a while, my grandfather and I, after having done twenty laps around the piazza, would head down the main street. Near the church, there was always someone sleeping. Up above, the stars amazed me with the way they look, on cloudless nights, over a smooth, blank wall. My grandfather used to smoke cigars and every now and again the breeze would snatch a spark and carry it off into the distance. The smell of that cigar is something I\u2019ll never be able to forget, and it\u2019s one of the three or four elemental sensations that I always draw upon when, after some unusual incident that has upset me, I start to get hold of myself. On winter nights, he would hold my little hand inside the pocket of his overcoat. On summer nights, he would give me, so I could use it to fan myself, his gray panama hat. The stories that I asked him to tell on those occasions were always of a musical nature. He would tell me, slightly out of order so I could always ask for some further explanation, about the performances of a certain Lucia and a certain Norma given in the theaters of Catania.\n\nThese stories were mixed with others of army life, but these too were sprinkled with songs. My grandfather would sing for me the tunes of his regiment, especially the one where the soldiers berated the \u201ccorporal of the week\u201d for having woken them too early.\n\nL\u2019\u00e8 suonata la sveglia L\u2019\u00e8 ancora schiur, Caporal di settimana. . .\n\nThe alarm has sounded And it\u2019s still dark Corporal of the week . . .\n\nThen there were stories of more intimate episodes, from which I learned two things: that once my father, incredibly, had been really small, even smaller than me, and that, beyond the clouds in the northern sky, there existed a city called Napoli, where my grandfather had bested an overly vain tenor in a singing contest.\n\nThen the talk turned again to my father, and it was said that, if he had been there with us at that moment, we would have been two sons, one grandfather, two fathers and a grandson, and that my grandfather would have had to be in the middle because he was the most important of the three.\n\nBut actually, my grandfather and I felt the same affection for my father and the same respect; his gaze instilled in both of us the same apprehension, and his presence disturbed, in equal measure for my grandfather and myself, our lively spontaneity. By this time, my grandfather and I had developed a taste for life that no one, not even my father, could share. We were ready to judge anything in a way all our own and in which we were never in disagreement. Exactly how this single taste had come about, I don\u2019t remember, but I think little by little, with our holding hands, with the trust that his gray goatee inspired in me, with the ten things that he chose among the many in his long life, figuring that they were the only really important ones, worthy of being told to me. I sensed immediately that he was happy with that choice, and I was flattered and enamored of the way he recounted those ten things to me. It was truly noble, worthy of a grand gentleman, of a man of true heart, as if all the rest, everything about his life that he didn\u2019t tell me, he thought not only was unsuitable to be heard by my little ears, but that it was stupid for him too, and useless, and had been lived for no reason at all.\n\nThis perfect accord, that I had the great good fortune to reach with an elderly gentleman whose yellowed photographs of when he was a child strangely resembled me, had a great power over me. I matured quickly, without the perils and pitiful frailties of a precocious child. I matured, because I was happy and because I knew how to appreciate my happiness. With the blessed confusion of someone who has had a good long sleep and now the sun is beating down on his face, I could feel the stirring, in my brain and in my eyes, of the man of tomorrow. During the periods I lived with my grandfather I was serene, never afraid at night, and I gave to the prospect of things bigger than me the order that a budding snake charmer is able to give to a group of lizards. When one is living in a world like that one does not need, in order to fill up his life, either poetry or riches, or even\u2013I hesitate a little to say it\u2013religion.\n\n* * *\n\nBut, during the war, my grandfather came down with appendicitis. At the time, I was in Pozzallo, in a house with huge balconies whose windows were filled with water and boats. I spent hours and hours reproducing in my little diary the freighters that struggled in vain to move out of sight, rather like an ant on which one has let fall a drop of ink. I heard that my grandfather was delirious, and this worried me. I was afraid that he would let slip his army stories, the songs, the episode of the tenor, and that our intimacy would be lost. For fifteen days, I let the freighters go by without reproducing them in my diary; and for me that renunciation was filled with the melancholy of a hunter of flies who keeps his hand open while two of those insects are playing on his palm. In the end, I heard that my grandfather was feeling better, that he was no longer delirious and had started a diet. Less than two months went by and around our dinner table the rigor with which grandma imposed the new diet on granddad was already famous. There were tales of how meticulous and precise he had become, and how he had developed certain habits from which he never deviated for any reason at all.\n\nWhen I saw him again, in \u201916, he was a lot thinner and his eyes shone with a brightness that was almost gleeful. I couldn\u2019t understand if he was changed or not. His ways were those of before and the words with which he greeted me were the same. His gaze, however, didn\u2019t quite convince me. Yes, it was still affectionate, it kept coming back to rest on my shirt, on my shoes, on my belt and on my cheeks, but it lacked that special stare with which it distinguished me from others.\n\nThe first day of our meeting went as it was supposed to. He told me the story of the tenor, described the war just as I wanted, and as no one else had ever described it: a group of regiments that, upon awaking in the trenches at dawn, would break out singing, L\u2019\u00e8 suonata la sveglia, l\u2019\u00e8 ancora schiur\u2026. But that night he didn\u2019t smoke his cigar anymore, because it had been forbidden him, and the next day he had to endure in silence a harangue from my grandmother, reprimanding him because, for the first time after months of dieting, he had changed his dinner time by an hour. I was secretly very pleased. As I had predicted, the famous diet, which it appeared my grandfather had sworn to uphold, went up in smoke as soon as I appeared on the scene. But that night, I came in for a bitter disappointment. As we were out walking together, he singing and I listening, my grandfather looked at the clock in the piazza with an expression that I had never seen on his face. It seemed to me that the clock, red against the deep sky, provoked in him the dread and delight that a feared island might provoke in a tired old sea dog. (I learned, several years later, that my grandfather\u2019s father had also been reduced, in his last years of life, to following a diet, and he too had regulated his meal times according to the spheres of that big clock). Three times, my grandfather shifted his gaze from the red clock face to my hair. Then he smiled weakly, accompanied me to my father and, without saying a word, left me there, for the first time in my life in such a brusque way, and went to drink his milk. I remember his stooped shoulders, the rapid gesture he made when, upon reaching the church, he looked up at the clock again, and the vast piazza where he walked off into the distance, making himself as small and insignificant as a stranger. From the storefronts came the light of oil lamps, spreading over the ground and leaving the air completely dark. The only parts of their bodies that were illuminated were the men\u2019s shoes, while the rest of them remained blurry and indistinct, like animals in the woods. The sky was strangely high and full of stars that I couldn\u2019t separate from a subtle smell of meadow and a sweet bewilderment that was a prelude to sleep. There was a great confusion in my heart as there must be in a house that has never held a party and the order suddenly arrives to give a reception on the spot. I didn\u2019t know where to begin, and what thoughts to select and what others to reject in order to suffer the profound pain that my grandfather had given me. In my confusion, that pain hung there in front of me without my being able to take full possession of it. Finally, tiredness got the better of me and I fell asleep on a chair. I think it was my father who carried me home. Between sleeping in the chair and sleeping on the bed there wasn\u2019t but a moment in which I saw the Milky Way and heard two words: \u201cIt\u2019s late!\u201d\n\nThe next day, things were already different. I felt myself disposed to observing granddad attentively, to staying slightly behind him on our walks in order to see his shoulders, to acting distracted when we walked past the front of the church, observing out of the corner of my eye whether he really did make a fleeting sign of the cross. That day I saw in my grandfather a man I had never seen before, a man with slightly stooped shoulders, big shoes, and a moist forehead. He was a sort of stranger who had been following me around since I was born, or rather who had been following us around, my grandfather and me, and whom I had only now become aware of. But I had no sense of hostility toward him. I thought he was nice, honest, and worthy of being loved. Only there was something about him that was weak and too entertaining. And perhaps I must attribute to these two qualities, which became more marked with time, the extraordinary fact that my grandfather should have slipped imperceptibly out of my life and, fifteen years later, when I was twenty-four, he barely existed for me. Or better, in Pachino there was an old man who had my name and to whom I sent hugs at the end of letters I wrote to my aunt. There was a little man whom I sought out with my eyes every time I went back to the house where my father was born. But he was reduced to saying three or four phrases; to sitting alone in a room as big as a drawing room, leafing through for the thousandth time some illustrated magazines; to mistaking me for my brother; to being afraid of having his picture taken; to displaying visible annoyance when I sat down on one of the two chairs that, in a little while, he would use to hang his jacket and pants on, and that always had to be the same ones. When they came to rest on me, his eyes would shine weakly and immediately refuse to make the effort to look at me in any special way. There were times when it even seemed he hardly recognized me as someone he knew. I wasn\u2019t hurt by all this because we had come to this point gradually, from year to year, and I would have almost been amazed if each new visit of mine to Pachino had not found my grandfather still more distant from me. My life, full of work, strange friendships, and foolish plans, had gotten pleasantly used to this poison of detachment, taken in ever stronger doses. By now, nothing in him reminded me of the old gentleman who had filled the early years of my life with his friendship. His handsome gray goatee had vanished. His eyes seemed distant and indifferent like the eyes in portraits, and his whole person increasingly fled from the memories and the love of others. At times, a question would come out of his mouth that alarmed us, as though he were about to recover the affection he once had for us. But it turned out to be a question enunciated by chance, like certain resemblances to persons we hold dear, that we see for a moment in a stranger and that make our hearts beat faster. A minute later, he would go back to his little furtive gestures and to expressing his desire for food and sleep with the violence of a child, immediately betrayed by the fact that he didn\u2019t digest well and suffered from insomnia.\n\nBy now, nothing of him came to me from Pachino: no greetings, no good wishes, not even an answer to my picture postcards. It was extraordinarily easy to forget him completely, and for months on end his image didn\u2019t come back to my memory even for a second. In April of \u201933, when I was in Catania for a short visit with my family, he died suddenly.\n\nIt happened on Wednesday of Holy Week. The news was communicated to us by telephone during the night. The next day at dawn, my father and I left for Pachino. I recall that, as I was getting in the car, I saw a man down at the end of the street, dressed in gray and acting very strangely, as though he were trying to hit, with the cane that he passed rapidly back and forth from his right hand to his left, a short figure that appeared first behind him and then to the side and then immediately disappeared. I couldn\u2019t understand if the man was a drunk or a cripple or a just a swinger of canes. In any event, I was thoroughly disgusted by him. What he was, finally, was the opening episode of the time when my grandfather would no longer be alive. My grandfather had died of old age, which is to say, he died to make room for the things that were supposed to come after him. And these things were inane and useless to the point of absurdity. They were that man swinging his cane around in the air, staggering around like an old blind dog\u2026.\n\nWhen the car started moving, my father pressed himself up against his side window and kept his eyes fixed straight in front of him, off in the distance. His hand, resting on the seat between us, looked a lot like my grandfather\u2019s hand. At dawn, meanwhile, the sky lit up with the aurora; the front steps outside the closed front doors gleamed softly; the old door of a church opened little by little; a wagon pulled by a donkey creaked its way toward a fountain; and I felt, as though for the first time, all the happiness one feels on a morning in a closed bedroom when you\u2019re next to the bed of a loved one and you see them open their eyes again and smile\u2026. My grandfather, on the other hand, for the first time in seventy years, would not be opening his eyes that morning.\n\nNot until we were on the train did I realize that granddad, whom I saw dead, was not the insignificant little old man that had been eluding my affection for ten years. Instead he was the gentleman with the gray goatee, the friend of my early years, my companion on long walks, the one who bounced me on his knee, telling me about the most beautiful and important things that had happened before I was born. He was the old gentleman who adored me and whom I loved infinitely\u2026.\n\nOn clear days, the mountains in the province of Siracusa shine all the way to the sea near Catania. But even close up those mountains have a mysterious splendor, as though the sun had ceded them to a blue star and its strange satellites. At sunrise and sunset especially, those majestic peaks appear to be the flimsiest and most delicate part of the earth. In summer, when the wild simun blows up from Africa, the mountains of Siracusa, seen from afar in the brilliant light and vibrant air, look as though they won\u2019t be able to hold up against the wind and that they\u2019ll be ripped to shreds like a veil. Those mountains were upon us in an instant, as I was remembering and snoozing. Suddenly they surrounded the train; a rich, mild light settled onto the velvet seats and the pictures in the compartment. My mind went into a fog and my heart felt a painful, profound sweetness, as if all of a sudden, after so many years, I had re-entered the enchanted grotto of childhood.\n\nAn old, dust-covered automobile was waiting for us and immediately set off toward Noto. It was still morning, and we felt ourselves heading into the sea as we sped along this last, ever-narrowing strip of Sicily. All around us by now, waves were shimmering and the saline wind was blowing. This was where I had launched my little boy\u2019s cry; this was the dust that had filled my shoes. The sensations and thoughts of my boyhood had remained so alive in me that I was ready to have them again, and not as memories, but as proper thoughts and sensations. I was right on the edge of letting go. That sky that stretched out on all sides and was sliding along the small, rounded hump of the maritime plain, like a giant trying to climb up onto a miniscule piece of floating ice; that sky looked again as it had long ago. What it had said to me then, it was saying to me again with great simplicity. So that, for the trees whitened with sand, the dogs that for a long stretch came running behind the car, the children sleeping together with the chickens in large baskets strapped to the backs of donkeys, I easily felt again the mysterious pity I had felt back then, and the fear that I\u2019d once had of those who suffered and of things that appeared to be suffering, because I saw in them something of the chastised and therefore of the wicked. Sitting in the car, I also felt a strange satisfaction; and this too was tied to the idea I had of the road in my early years, when I was afraid of horses because they reared up at passing cars, and I admired the cars because they made the horses rear up and then kept right on going, fast as the wind. Actually, my life was still under the dominion of my boyhood. The splendor of that age was following me as, at the start of a dark hallway, the light of the drawing room one has just come out of. I would always have to turn back to it, to my boyhood, if I wanted to be spontaneous and true. But had I always been spontaneous and true? And hadn\u2019t I instead shown my bones, like a scrawny horse pulling its wagon from a ditch, in the sad endeavor to be different from what I am?\n\nAt the foot of the hill where Noto rises up, I rediscovered intact an old impression of mine which had always made me realize when I had arrived in the vicinity of Pachino. It was a blend of the smell of bunches of grapes fallen to the ground and burnt by the sun and a profound respect for everything that had been living for a long time and that I had never seen. Along the road, the return of these old impressions kept getting more vivid and numerous. What I noticed in them was a great seriousness.\n\nBack then, I had notions of death and life that were very simple and clear, but above all serious. Then I wouldn\u2019t have said, not even in my stupidest and strangest dreams, a phrase like the one which, later on, I had even written: \u201cI believe in life!\u201d That phrase sounded fake, like something from a circus or a fair, compared to the clear and simple feeling that I nourished for life in my early years. Nor would I have said: \u201cWe must be happy and strong!\u201d What meaning could they have had, at that time, words such as those? What meaning could they have had in a way of living so full and natural as mine was during my boyhood? None! But what had happened inside me in the last fifteen years? Was it my grandfather who had vanished from my life, or I that had become so clouded that I was no longer able to see the friend of my first years, the man who had been so clear when my life was clear?\n\n* * *\n\nIn the room, big as a drawing room, where he used to spend his afternoons, going back to leaf through for the thousandth time some illustrated magazines from fifty years ago, I found a small stranger, stretched out on a sort of altar. This one didn\u2019t even look like the insignificant old man into which my boyhood grandfather had slowly transformed himself. He was a short little man, dressed in black, who had closed his eyes the night before and retained no other signs of humanity on his face except for one, infantile, that could have been the pain caused by lack of food. No sign of the seventy years of life that, according to the testimony of the living, were to be attributed to that little man. That little man contained to the point of absurdity the stranger that had broken off, some fifteen years ago, from my grandfather, and brought him to his grave. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to cry for him. But suddenly, when I realized that my boyhood granddad, the beautiful man with the gray goatee, would never come back to me, could never exist again, for the fact that the little unknown man had closed his eyes after having said he felt fine in order to induce my aunt to give him some raisins, the whole thing seemed so brutal, violent, and unfair that my heart squeezed shut as though it would never beat again.\n\nI accepted the chair that someone offered me and sat down in the darkest corner of the room. I cried like a baby, but without desperation. My grandfather wasn\u2019t dead, but just mysteriously forced not to show himself to be more than that miniscule old man lying on the catafalque. It was as though he had gone away or gone into hiding forever. Death could never touch the beautiful and vital gentleman with the gray goatee who had given me, with his smile and his love such a calm, natural, and full sense of living. No, he had vanished, like a magician, like the most beautiful of my dreams. All that was fabulous about him remained intact forever. I may sometimes doubt that he ever really existed, but I\u2019ll always have the hope that, from behind the curtain near which I\u2019ll be sitting in a moment of ennui, he\u2019ll stretch out his strong, warm hand and touch my head, smiling.\n\nThe room was dark, and the door across from me that led into a room that opened onto the street, was lit up like the mouth of a tunnel. The doorway framed a continuous passing of women wrapped in shawls, their hands thrusting out to send kisses and make the sign of the cross. One of them, very old, cried more than the others and collapsed against the doorframe. \u201cBeautiful! Beautiful!\u201d were the words that were heard cried out most often. Even women younger than he called him: \u201cLittle one!\u201d My aunt, sitting next to him, leaned her cheek down against his forehead and said, carefully pronouncing each syllable in a tone somewhere between crying and screaming, \u201cWhy did you decide to leave me? Why have you gone away? Everyone here loved you! Everyone!\u2026. You\u2019re beautiful, beautiful as yesterday when you were sleeping. Only you\u2019re cold, my son, cold as marble!\u201d\n\nFrom time to time, Uncle Carlo, sitting a little way off, sent through the room a gaze that was pale, thin, and bright, like the light of an old lantern. The day was growing longer. The room started to fill with people I didn\u2019t know. The women whispered words into ears. Little by little, what they said in each other\u2019s ears became very important, and by comparison the dead man himself, lying in the middle of the room, became as small as a little boy found on the street, looking around as the crowd, forgetting about him, discusses some general proposals for ways of helping homeless children. Finally, someone walked over to my aunt and begged her to get up. My aunt immediately threw herself on her father\u2019s cadaver, sticking her fingernails into his black suit. She screamed and refused to let go of her grip. I got up and left the room and took refuge in a parlor, where, during my boyhood, I used to sleep at night, breathing in smells of cloth roses, velvet headboards, and portraits. It was Holy Thursday, the day when a group of people roams through the streets of Pachino carrying a trumpet and a drum, representing the drama of the Madonna crying out her Son\u2019s name through the streets of Jerusalem. When the group arrives outside the door, a rapid drum roll can be heard, followed by a sad and deep sound from the trumpet. For an hour at least I had been hearing that double call, from neighborhood to neighborhood, making its way towards us. Then I stopped hearing it. And then, suddenly, as I was sitting in the parlor, that precipitous drum roll that sends the knick-knacks on the table trembling and the old, faded portraits vibrating. And the clear voice of the trumpet. My chest tightened and it felt like my ankles had been hit by a blow from an ax. When they called me from the street, I could barely stand up. Somehow or other, I made it outside. Pachino was whiter than ever, and on its dusty, sun-bathed streets the dark dresses of the procession stood out like hawks. With one hand on the coffin, carried on our arms, I arrived inside the church. The organ was already playing, and the little girls kneeling in the pews were singing with their silver voices. Soon the voice of the priest was added to the chants. It was then that I heard my own name, pronounced in Latin in a loud voice, and always followed by the words, \u201cthrough the endless ages.\u201d This served to make it clear to me, as clear as one plus one, that my grandfather and my boyhood had gone forever.\n\nOn the way back from the cemetery, in the midst of a little group that was already taking about other things, we came into the piazza and as I glanced up at the fa\u00e7ade of the church I saw it as a blackboard where, when I had turned my back to go down to the cemetery, someone had erased, with the sweep of a sponge, the words that my grandfather and my own boyhood had written there. I felt that same painful impression, of words erased and an empty blackboard, in front of the little round windows that I used to look out on, for hours on end, from my grandfather\u2019s doorway, standing erect on the little step where the shutter swung open and closed with a creaking sound and that on moonlit nights was half silver and half black.\n\nI left, on my own, the next afternoon. As usual, the sun was bright and the wind carried the constant sounds, piercing and cold, of the blacksmith\u2019s hammer. The large coach that takes travelers on the hour\u2019s journey from the piazza in Pachino to the train station in Noto, was already covered with dust before it left. I boarded behind an old woman and sat down between two baskets, one of which had a rabbit\u2019s foot sticking out of it and the other an apple. I turned to look out the window and saw, framed tightly at the end of a narrow street, the sea off Marzamemi; the sea that I had seen shimmering endlessly in the afternoons of my childhood and that now was as dim as a switched-off lamp at the end of a party.\n\nA few minutes later, a hunter got on and sat next to me. The coach started off, the town vanished on both sides and the mountains of Noto loomed in the distance.\n\nAn old man, who was sitting in front of me, turned slowly and, pointing at the sky, asked the hunter,\n\n\u201cGood hunting?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d the other replied. \u201cDidn\u2019t see so much as a wing this year\u2026.\u201d\n\nYes, my boyhood was really over. My boyhood was dead. One night, a little boy, standing erect in front of the mirror, I had played the most useless and desperate of games, trying to see the expression that my face took on when I closed my eyes. Now, my boyhood was finished, the handsome gentleman with the gray goatee had vanished from the earth. I knew very well that a man doesn\u2019t die all at once, but age by age. And I knew that the ages of a man are two: boyhood and maturity. That year, not even a wing had been seen in the sky, and my first age had died. But I still had another age left. I still had time to be honest, to be truthful, and above all to be simple. But a part of my life had ended; one of my eyes had closed forever."}, {"url": "https://sicilyinsideandout.com/2014/01/16/literary-islands-vitaliano-brancati/", "page_content": "I stumbled upon Vitaliano Brancati quite by accident in a bookstore at Messina. I was attracted by the title of one his books, I discovered after he was quite a prolific novelist and later his most famous novel Il Bel Antonio was developed into a movie starring Marcello Mastroianni, which became a classic of Italian cinema.\n\nBeing an opera fan I liked the idea of a pseudo-Don Giovanni being set in Sicily. Taking the novella home I discovered a rich caricature of the Sicilian male taken to strange extremes yet which has a core honesty that goes beyond any form of realism.\n\nThe main character, Giovanni Percolla is a master of the aristocratic Sicilian art of doing nothing, he sleeps a lot, chases after women with a voracious sexual appetite and lives at home with his two spinster sisters who spoil him terribly.\n\nBrancati has created a rich grotesque baroque caricature, Giovanni\u2019s world is dysfunctional and his sisters are as absurd as our Sicilian Don Giovanni is. The sisters claim to be war widows as statically so many young men died during the war that one of them was bound to have been their husband if they had married.\n\nEverything changes when Giovanni falls in love gets married to Ninetta and he tries to get ahead in life by moving up North to Milan where he works more, sleeps less and adopts a bizarre routine of taking cold showers to develop strength and immunity.\n\nThe couple returns to Sicily after failing to adapt to life in Northern Italy. Socially they have been rejected and ostracized by the northerners and they are demoralized by the literal and metaphorical coldness of the North.\n\nGiovanni suffers a physical and mental collapse due to the lack of sleep and returns to the opened arms of Sicily a pale, sickly and haggard shadow of himself.\n\nTheir return to the bosom of Sicily at first seems a defeat, yet after reviving himself with beautiful Sicilian slumber and sunshine he returns to a blessed routine of comfort.\n\nA part cautionary tale, satire and caricature Don Giovanni in Sicily is masterfully written and is one of the most succinct, beautifully written Sicilian novellas I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nBrowsing Amazon there is a translation of Don Giovanni in Sicily but it only has one review so I\u2019m not sure of the quality of the translation. I suggest browsing around the likes of AbeBooks to see if there is another translation which looks better.\n\n(Images: Thanks to Google)"}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Vitaliano_Brancati", "page_content": "This category has only the following subcategory.\n\nMedia in category \"Vitaliano Brancati\"\n\nThe following 3 files are in this category, out of 3 total."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/vitaliano-brancati", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nVitaliano Brancati was born on 24 July, 1907 in Pachino, Sicily, Italy, is a Writer.
