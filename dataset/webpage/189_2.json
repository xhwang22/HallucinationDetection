{"Lee Naylor made over 200 appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers.": [{"url": "https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/features/20220619-career-paths-lee-naylor/", "page_content": "Wolves (1997-2006)\n\nBorn in Walsall, Naylor joined Wolves Academy after leaving school before making his professional debut on 12th October 1997 in a narrow 1-0 defeat to Birmingham City. Naylor helped Wolves earn promotion to the Premier League in 2003 under Dave Jones with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Sheffield United in the play-off final. The left-back made the most appearances in the top-flight within that squad, with 37 starts before making a further 38 outings back in the Championship the following season. Wolves missed out on the play-offs by eight points in 2006 and Naylor said his goodbyes to the club in August that year when Scottish champions Celtic paid \u00a3600,000 for his services.\n\nEngland under-21s (2000-2001)\n\nWhile he was at Wolves, Naylor was called up to the England Under-21 squad by former Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United boss Howard Wilkinson. After being an unused substitute in June 2000 against Germany, Naylor started a 3-1 defeat to Greece in a UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying outing. Within that England squad was John Terry, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Jermaine Defore. Naylor played the full 90 minutes in Greece, with Terry and Luke Young receiving straight red cards in injury time.\n\nCeltic (2006-2010)\n\nJoining striker Kenny Miller in joining the Celts from Wolves, Naylor became the club\u2019s first-choice left-back and grabbed an assist for Maciej Zurawski in the 2-1 victory over Hibernian. In his first experience in Europe, Naylor played every minute of Celtic\u2019s journey to the last 16 after they beat Manchester United, Benfica and FC Copenhagen in the group stage before losing 1-0 on aggregate to Italian giants AC Milan. Naylor was nominated for the SPFA Player of the Year award in 2007 before scoring his first goal in March 2008 against Hibs. One of his most memorable moments in green and white came in 2010 when he scored the opening goal with a brilliant free-kick against Old Firm rivals Rangers before assisting Marc-Antoine Fortune for the winner.\n\nCardiff City (2010-2012)\n\nFollowing his release from Celtic, Naylor returned to England with Championship side Cardiff City, who were managed by Naylor\u2019s former manager Dave Jones. However, despite only missing one of the opening 29 league games, alongside the loan arrival of Jlloyd Samuel from Bolton Wanderers, Naylor fell down the pecking order and only played a further 56 minutes before the Bluebirds were knocked out of the play-offs by Reading. Malky Mackay arrived at the club in the summer of 2011, but Naylor continued to be back-up behind Andrew Taylor and only made two league appearances before was released upon the end of his contract.\n\nAccrington Stanley (2013-2014)\n\nAfter his release from Cardiff, Naylor failed to find a club throughout the 2012/13 season, but eventually signed for James Beattie\u2019s Accrington Stanley in September 2013 on a short team deal. He started eight of his first nine games for Stanley that season, grabbing three assists as the side struggled in League Two. However, only three months after arriving at the club, Naylor\u2019s contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nDerby County (2014-2015)\n\nAnother short-term deal followed for the full-back as he jumped up two divisions to join Championship promotion chasers Derby County during the subsequent campaign to provide competition to Craig Forsyth. He made his debut on 25th March 2014 against Ipswich Town but eventually saw the Rams suffer play-off heartbreak at Wembley as Bobby Zamora\u2019s goal promoted Queens Park Rangers. In his final season as a player, Naylor\u2019s only appearance came in a FA Cup third-round tie with Southport, with the Rams winning courtesy of a Chris Martin penalty."}, {"url": "https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2022/12/08/wolves-bloxwich-boy-lee-naylor-who-went-on-to-face-the-very-best/", "page_content": "Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Celtic's Lee Naylor battle for the ball..\n\nAnd the answer has nothing to do with the World Cup, where that first two mentioned have matched into the quarter finals with Argentina and Portugal respectively.\n\nFor our purposes, the only acceptable response is that Lee Naylor played against all of them.\n\nOr should that be flipped.\n\nThey all played against Lee Naylor.\n\nNot bad for a boy from Bloxwich!\n\nHe lined up against Ronaldo whilst at Wolves, but the remaining roll of honour came whilst representing Celtic in the Champions League.\n\nIncluding one epic night at Parkhead back in 2008 when the Hoops were on the wrong end of a five-goal thriller against a Barcelona team boasting Messi, Henry and Ronaldinho as their front three. With Eto-o and Eidur Gudjohnsen coming off the bench!\n\nAnd yet, at the time, it wasn\u2019t something the flying left back thought too deeply about.\n\nMore so now, when he looks back at such a stellar cast of opposition, it is more worthy of reflecting on, especially if making a \u2018pitch\u2019 to potential players in his role as an agent.\n\nBut it is certainly something he should be proud of.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story to tell when you look back now isn\u2019t it?\u201d Naylor reflects, completely matter-of-fact.\n\nCeltic's Lee Naylor (l) and goalkeeper Artur Boruc look on as Barcelona's Lionel Messi (c) scores the equalising goal.\n\n\u201cEspecially now I\u2019m an agent \u2013 there aren\u2019t many others who can say they went directly up against Ronaldo and Messi!\n\n\u201cI feel fortunate to have done so and played against the very best, but at the time, it probably didn\u2019t massively register with me if I\u2019m honest.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of confidence in myself at that stage, and those days were more about trying to win than who I was up against or getting anyone\u2019s shirt after the game.\n\n\u201cThere were some amazing experiences, playing in the Nou Camp, at the San Siro, and that can never be taken away from me.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s where I felt I should be at that time, it was just me playing football, enjoying it, not thinking I\u2019m a superstar or anything like that.\n\n\u201cYes, there were some very good opponents, and I loved those sort of challenges, because if you don\u2019t enjoy playing against the very best then you shouldn\u2019t be a footballer.\n\n\u201cAnd I might bring it out if I\u2019m speaking to a player in my role as an agent, because it\u2019s good experience and something I can pass on.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, that only gets a player interested, and it\u2019s about how I work as an agent, and how I can support them on and off the pitch, that determines how well I do.\n\n\u201cMaybe it can help them on their journey a little bit, but at the end of the day it\u2019s always about the player and what they do, not about me.\n\n\u201cIt is a nice story though, but one I have only really thought about more since I stopped playing.\u201d\n\nNaylor\u2019s calm and even blas\u00e9 assessment will come as no surprise to those who know him as someone who just always loved his football and enjoyed tearing up and down that left flank whatever the challenge and whoever the opposition.\n\nThat carefree almost \u2018jumpers for goalposts\u2019 approach was exactly the same in his formative years, albeit those were spent playing up front, on home turf, for Forest Star in Bloxwich.\n\nHis coach Colin Eaton was then a Wolves scout, and recommended Naylor to the youth ranks at about 10, and despite initially not enjoying it and taking something of a sabbatical, he returned a year or so later. And stayed for a further 16.\n\nConverted from a striker to a left winger, and then, by Robert Kelly, to a left back, Naylor also endured some \u2018tough love\u2019 at the time which, with the benefit of hindsight, he realises was crucial.\n\n\u201cI remember going into my first full year of the YTS at 16, Chris Turner, the manager at the time \u2013 he was really \u2018on me\u2019,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cIt was the same the second year, all over everything I did, everything I said, all the time in training, and I\u2019ll be honest, at the time I was thinking \u2018get off my back\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut now, looking back, I realise he was doing it because he saw something in me - he wanted to make sure I got the best out of myself.\u201d\n\nIt certainly worked.\n\nWolves then Club Secretary Richard Skirrow still recalls sitting next to boss Mark McGhee at a reserve match at Molineux when the 17-year-old Naylor was up against a Middlesbrough team including Paul Merson and Paul Gascoigne. The two were impressed, and McGhee acted quickly in securing Naylor\u2019s long-term future.\n\nIt proved the start of a week \u2013 25 years ago in October - which then included signing his first professional contract, passing his driving test and making his first team debut. In that order.\n\n\u201cSomething in my second year really clicked,\u201d says Naylor.\n\n\u201cI was scoring goals for the youth team and playing well for the reserves, having first played for them when I was 15.\n\n\u201cThere was a reserve game against Middlesbrough at Molineux, and I had one of those nights when it all fell together.\n\n\u201cI was hitting diagonals with my right peg \u2013 which is normally just for standing on \u2013 and had one of those amazing games that you have every now and again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember all that much from my career - but I remember that!\n\n\u201cComing off the pitch Paul Merson came up and said, \u2018what\u2019s your name kid?\u2019 and told me it was one of the best performances he had ever seen from a left back.\n\n\u201cThat left me on cloud nine and a bit starstruck to be honest.\n\n\u201cI came in next morning for a warmdown and was offered a pro contract \u2013 Middlesbrough must have had a nibble! \u2013 then I went on to pass my driving test and then got my first team debut away at Birmingham, live on Sky.\n\n\u201cWas I nervous? Oh my word, yes. It was my dream, the one thing I\u2019d been working for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had tunnel vision, nothing was ever going to stop me being a professional footballer, that was the mindset I had.\n\n\u201cAnd for the first ten minutes at St Andrew\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\n\u201cKeith Curle was shouting at me and I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game 1-0 and I was gutted with the result but from an individual point of view, it was such a positive end to an amazing week when everything just seemed to fall into place.\u201d\n\nFrom there, even of such tender years, Naylor \u2018nailed\u2019 down the left back slot for large parts of the years which followed, through the many ups and downs that spending any length of time as a Wolves player necessitates.\n\nExamples such as an impressive performance in the sensational FA Cup quarter final giant-killing at Leeds, being followed by being left on the bench for the semi-final against Arsenal typified the often-dramatic Molineux rollercoaster ride.\n\nOr more pertinently following up the collective disaster of the 2001/02 season when Wolves were overhauled in the promotion race by West Bromwich Albion, with the sensational response a year later and one of the best days in the clubs\u2019 history courtesy of play-off glory against Sheffield United at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nAll these though are experiences which Naylor can now utilise as part of his role as an agent, passing on that knowledge and expertise to those players under his guidance.\n\n\u201cWhen deciding to become an agent I had that benefit of already knowing what football is like from a player point of view but I needed to learn all about the off-field work that goes with it,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cI got to grips with that and now, with having that experience of playing at a decent level, I think it really helps.\n\n\u201cEspecially now, with over 5,000 registered agents all battling for players and to do deals, it\u2019s a big challenge.\n\nLee Naylor at Wolves in 2004\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one I really enjoy, that mix of being able to pass on advice which I learned about what to do and what not do, but also the other side of it which I have developed since working as an agent.\u201d\n\nOne of the highlights which Naylor can certainly pass on, alongside taking on some of football\u2019s true heavyweights whilst at Celtic, was that play-off final, which marks its 20th anniversary next May.\n\nFollowing the travails of the previous season, Wolves didn\u2019t find consistent form until the memorable FA Cup win against Newcastle in early January, from where Wolves only lost two of their next 23 league fixtures, including the trio in the play-offs.\n\nNaylor also chipped in with a couple of vital goals, putting Wolves in front enroute to a 4-2 win at Ipswich with a sublime volley, and then a late free kick securing a narrow 2-1 advantage in the first leg of the play off semi-final against Reading.\n\n\u201cI only ever seemed to score decent goals, when I did manage to score,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cThat Ipswich one was funny because we\u2019d been awful and, in the dressing room at half time, Dave Jones was digging us out, people were fighting, it was all going off!\n\n\u201cDave had a proper go at me as well, which I thought was harsh, but I went out with an attitude to try and prove him wrong and scored an absolute \u2018worldie\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen in the play-offs Reading had caused us problems and we knew it was going to be a tough game.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we had that free kick, I knew in my head what I wanted to do and it came off my foot so sweetly that I knew it was going in.\n\n\u201cThat gave us a crucial advantage for the second leg from where we managed to come through and reach the final.\n\n\u201cAnd the final \u2013 wow, what a day. Although I have to say it passed me by a little.\n\nGiving his expert opinion on commentary with Andy Thompson at Molineux\n\n\u201cIf you speak to psychologists, they will sometimes say that when you are so massively focused on something, like a big football match, it can end up passing you by.\n\n\u201cThat is what happened to me, and I don\u2019t seem to remember much, and it\u2019s only five or six years ago that I actually watched the whole game back for the first time.\n\n\u201cThat was when bits started coming back to me, the big man (Matt Murray) saving the penalty and being incredible that day, all those crucial moments.\n\n\u201cWe had such an unbelievable dressing room at that time, a really good mix of talent and experience and the likes of myself, Matty and Joleon (Lescott) who were still quite young.\n\n\u201cBuilding up to the game, and even coming into the stadium on the coach, I just had a feeling that nothing was going to stop us that day \u2013 I was convinced we were going to win.\n\n\u201cEven with the disappointments the fans had experienced previously in the play-offs, I think they felt that optimism too, and that was in my head right from the start.\n\n\u201cWhen we first went out to walk on the pitch ages before kick-off, our fans were already in there, making so much noise, and there were hardly any from Sheffield United.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the few things that I have always remembered from that day, just thinking, \u2018this is us, no one is beating us today\u2019, and that was how it played out.\n\n\u201cThe way we started the game, they just couldn\u2019t live with us, and going in 3-0 up at half time, there aren\u2019t many teams who can come back from that.\u201d\n\nSheffield United certainly couldn\u2019t, leaving Naylor at the heart of the intense celebrations that heralded the end of a frustratingly painful 19-year absence from the top division and a first ever taste of life in the Premier League.\n\nThat was perhaps more of a sobering experience, although, even in relegation, there were more experiences to cling onto with Naylor a league ever-present in his early twenties.\n\nIt was an unforgiving arena he always planned and hoped to return to, along with trying to build on England Under-21 honours earned in a team including the likes of John Terry, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe, to the progression of a senior Three Lions call-up.\n\nMoving to Celtic at a time when Wolves were undergoing their early transformation under Mick McCarthy was a step up in itself, and a fantastic challenge, but one from which at some stage Naylor had aimed to return back to the English topflight.\n\n\u201cIn my early twenties I had felt like something clicked again and I moved up another level,\u201d Naylor remembers.\n\n\u201cI was going through games just not wanting them to finish and couldn\u2019t wait for the next one to come around.\n\n\u201cI remember winning the Player of the Year award (in 2000/01) and was flying, just loving playing football.\n\n\u201cIt got to the stage at Wolves that things were changing and I wasn\u2019t too sure where the club was going to go.\n\n\u201cI had been there for 17 years or so and still had the dream of going back to the Premier League and of playing for England.\n\n\u201cWas that going to happen for me playing at Wolves? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cCeltic are an absolutely huge football club and going there was an exciting challenge in itself but I also thought it might eventually lead on to coming back to the Premier League, and possibly playing for England.\n\n\u201cI had an amazing first season which ended up in being recognised as one of the Players of the Year in Scotland, the award eventually going to (Shunsuke) Nakamura, who thoroughly deserved it.\n\n\u201cI think the England scouts came to watch me once at Inverness \u2013 we never did well at Inverness \u2013 and we lost the game and I\u2019m not sure they ever came back.\n\n\u201cI did o-k in the second season as well and ended up staying there for four years and it got to a stage where I turned 30 and knew that the Premier League dream was not going to return.\u201d\n\nThere was perhaps one final chance to reach the top tier after being reunited with manager Jones at Cardiff, but the Bluebirds couldn\u2019t press on from a blistering launch to the 2010/11 season and finished up \u2013 as so often in that era - losing in the play-offs.\n\nAt one point, there was actually a chance of a second stint with Wolves, Naylor returning to train at the club during Dean Saunders\u2019 tenure, but he didn\u2019t quite have the immediate level of fitness to hit the ground running in a way that was required at the time.\n\nHe would later make 13 appearances for Accrington Stanley, unpaid, as a favour for their boss and his friend James Beattie, before rounding things off with several outings for Derby County.\n\nIn total he made 529 career appearances \u2013 333 of them at Wolves \u2013 and scored 14 goals, of which nine came whilst at Molineux.\n\nAfter hanging up the boots he admitted there were a couple of years of relative inactivity whilst deciding on his next step.\n\n\u201cI played a lot of golf,\u201d he laughs.\n\nNaylor, now 42, had several property interests, which he has maintained, and did complete his UEFA \u2018B\u2019 license but ultimately leant towards becoming an agent rather than a coach for an increased sense of job security.\n\nHe is also a regular pundit alongside Mikey Burrows and fellow former full back Andy Thompson on Wolves TV \u2013 \u201cpassing on my expert advice\u201d \u2013 and, as befitting his new industry, is always a keen watcher of football whether it is in heading to Molineux or watching the World Cup on television.\n\nAnd that is where, when watching defenders trying to cope with a perhaps slightly ageing Messi and Ronaldo, Naylor can reflect on the fact that he came up against both when they were properly in their prime.\n\nAlthough it was always a very different challenge facing those two in comparison to mere mortal opponents!\n\n\u201cMessi and Ronaldo are very different because it\u2019s not like they are out-and-out wingers who you end up marking all game,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThey come over to your side to do a bit, and then they\u2019re off somewhere else, and that\u2019s another reason why they are so tough to play against.\n\n\u201cThe way they play, their skill, the goals they score, their footballing brains in how they link up with others, they are obviously the elite.\n\n\u201cAnd at the same time, they are unbelievable athletes as well, which is why they are still going strong and still making an impact after so many years.\u201d\n\nSo, the age-old question which continues to permeate football and divide opinion across the globe: \u2018Who is the best?\u2019\n\nNaylor laughs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one which is always goes off in my WhatsApp chats \u2013 who is the best out of Messi and Ronaldo.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many fights and laughs around that question, but it\u2019s all good fun.\n\n\u201cWhat do I think? I don\u2019t think I can actually say. They are quite different players who have both had incredible careers so I wouldn\u2019t want to separate the two.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/academy/20190417-lee-naylor-academy-graduate/", "page_content": "The former England under-21 international spent his teenage years knocking in the goals for Wolves as a striker before he was converted into a pacey left-back. Here Lee reflects on his time as a young player at Molineux.\n\nThanks for your time Lee. Firstly, how did you become part of the Wolves Academy?\n\nI came as a schoolboy at the age of 10. I stayed until I was about 12 or 13 but I didn\u2019t enjoy it, so I left. I felt the system back then was too regimented, it wasn\u2019t what I was used to, I just enjoyed going out onto a field and playing football. When I started, we were hardly playing football, it was all about the coaching and I found it boring. I just wanted to play football and score goals, because I was a striker back in the day. I went back to my Sunday League team, before coming back to Wolves a year later, and from there I got selected for a YTS (Youth Training Scheme) and eventually started playing left-back at the age of 15.\n\nWhy did you make the change from striker to left-back?\n\nI used to bang the goals in when I was a striker, I was scoring goals every week, but it was the coaches at Wolves who tried me at different positions on the left because I had a left foot. I had never seen myself as a left-back, but Rob Kelly decided to put me back there and saw something in me that I didn\u2019t see. It was weird to me at first, but I gave it my best and ended up being given the YTS, which at the time was such a massive thing to me. I knew I was a good footballer and I had a decent left foot, but I didn\u2019t expect it at all. I came in to the office on day with my mum and when they told me I was being given a YTS and I was just overjoyed, I was overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nWhat are some of your favourite memories from your time as a young player at Wolves?\n\nI remember Chris Turner, who was my coach at the time, used to get on at me over everything and I hated it. But obviously, now I\u2019m older I can see that everything he said to me was for a reason, to make me a better player because he could see the potential in me. I remember doing well throughout my first season as a YTS, I played in some good reserve games, but come my second year, something just clicked in me. I was going through games and found them so easy, getting five or six goals by October as a wing-back. I played a reserve game out at Molineux against Middlesbrough and it was the best game I\u2019ve ever had. It was frightening. I was ducking inside, spraying passes with my right leg \u2013 I never used my right before in my life, and I played a 70-yard pass, putting the other winger through on goal. I was taking on senior pros in that game and Paul Merson was playing. When we came off the pitch he asked me what my name was and told me it was one of the best performances he\u2019d ever seen. The next day I was offered a professional contract.\n\nYou made your professional debut in a derby game against Birmingham City, how were you feeling before that match?\n\nI was more excited than nervous. I just got told I was travelling with the team after being in and around the reserves for quite a while. I had a mad week before that game. I had played youth team football, passed my driving test, had my best game ever for the reserves mid-week and then got chucked into the Wolves-Blues derby \u2013 live on Sky \u2013 at the weekend. All that happened in the one week and I was just on cloud nine. But I had no idea I was going to be playing in that match as I wasn\u2019t even training with the first-team. When we were having the team talk half an hour before kick-off, Mark McGhee calls out my name and tells me I\u2019m playing. My name wasn\u2019t even in the programme. It was a brilliant day, I couldn\u2019t even hear myself think for the first 15 minutes of the game because it was so loud. Playing in front of that sort of crowd at 17 was amazing.\n\nFinally, how did you find being part of an Academy group which consisted of some of the best players the club has produced?\n\nIf not the best in a player like Robbie [Keane]. Rob and I started with our YTS at the same time and we used to be brought in to training together by my mum because he lived out close to us in Wednesfield. We had a good crop. I think it was the first time the club had gone over to Ireland and scouted there because we had a lot of Irish boys in Seamus Crowe, Keith Andrews, Rob, Alan Dixon and it was a brilliant time. You were in and around the first team, carrying out your duties such as cleaning boots, and it prepared you well to go on and become a professional.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Wolves versus West Ham United matchday programme, which is available around Molineux on matchdays for just \u00a33.50, and also featured content with Adama Traore, Will Norris and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake.

With Eto-o and Eidur Gudjohnsen coming off the bench!\n\nAnd yet, at the time, it wasn\u2019t something the flying left back thought too deeply about.\n\nMore so now, when he looks back at such a stellar cast of opposition, it is more worthy of reflecting on, especially if making a \u2018pitch\u2019 to potential players in his role as an agent.\n\nBut it is certainly something he should be proud of.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story to tell when you look back now isn\u2019t it?\u201d Naylor reflects, completely matter-of-fact.\n\nCeltic's Lee Naylor (l) and goalkeeper Artur Boruc look on as Barcelona's Lionel Messi (c) scores the equalising goal.\n\n\u201cEspecially now I\u2019m an agent \u2013 there aren\u2019t many others who can say they went directly up against Ronaldo and Messi!\n\n\u201cI feel fortunate to have done so and played against the very best, but at the time, it probably didn\u2019t massively register with me if I\u2019m honest.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of confidence in myself at that stage, and those days were more about trying to win than who I was up against or getting anyone\u2019s shirt after the game.\n\n\u201cThere were some amazing experiences, playing in the Nou Camp, at the San Siro, and that can never be taken away from me.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s where I felt I should be at that time, it was just me playing football, enjoying it, not thinking I\u2019m a superstar or anything like that.\n\n\u201cYes, there were some very good opponents, and I loved those sort of challenges, because if you don\u2019t enjoy playing against the very best then you shouldn\u2019t be a footballer.\n\n\u201cAnd I might bring it out if I\u2019m speaking to a player in my role as an agent, because it\u2019s good experience and something I can pass on.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, that only gets a player interested, and it\u2019s about how I work as an agent, and how I can support them on and off the pitch, that determines how well I do.\n\n\u201cMaybe it can help them on their journey a little bit, but at the end of the day it\u2019s always about the player and what they do, not about me.\n\n\u201cIt is a nice story though, but one I have only really thought about more since I stopped playing.\u201d\n\nNaylor\u2019s calm and even blas\u00e9 assessment will come as no surprise to those who know him as someone who just always loved his football and enjoyed tearing up and down that left flank whatever the challenge and whoever the opposition.\n\nThat carefree almost \u2018jumpers for goalposts\u2019 approach was exactly the same in his formative years, albeit those were spent playing up front, on home turf, for Forest Star in Bloxwich.\n\nHis coach Colin Eaton was then a Wolves scout, and recommended Naylor to the youth ranks at about 10, and despite initially not enjoying it and taking something of a sabbatical, he returned a year or so later. And stayed for a further 16.\n\nConverted from a striker to a left winger, and then, by Robert Kelly, to a left back, Naylor also endured some \u2018tough love\u2019 at the time which, with the benefit of hindsight, he realises was crucial.\n\n\u201cI remember going into my first full year of the YTS at 16, Chris Turner, the manager at the time \u2013 he was really \u2018on me\u2019,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cIt was the same the second year, all over everything I did, everything I said, all the time in training, and I\u2019ll be honest, at the time I was thinking \u2018get off my back\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut now, looking back, I realise he was doing it because he saw something in me - he wanted to make sure I got the best out of myself.\u201d\n\nIt certainly worked.\n\nWolves then Club Secretary Richard Skirrow still recalls sitting next to boss Mark McGhee at a reserve match at Molineux when the 17-year-old Naylor was up against a Middlesbrough team including Paul Merson and Paul Gascoigne. The two were impressed, and McGhee acted quickly in securing Naylor\u2019s long-term future.\n\nIt proved the start of a week \u2013 25 years ago in October - which then included signing his first professional contract, passing his driving test and making his first team debut. In that order.\n\n\u201cSomething in my second year really clicked,\u201d says Naylor.\n\n\u201cI was scoring goals for the youth team and playing well for the reserves, having first played for them when I was 15.\n\n\u201cThere was a reserve game against Middlesbrough at Molineux, and I had one of those nights when it all fell together.\n\n\u201cI was hitting diagonals with my right peg \u2013 which is normally just for standing on \u2013 and had one of those amazing games that you have every now and again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember all that much from my career - but I remember that!\n\n\u201cComing off the pitch Paul Merson came up and said, \u2018what\u2019s your name kid?\u2019 and told me it was one of the best performances he had ever seen from a left back.\n\n\u201cThat left me on cloud nine and a bit starstruck to be honest.\n\n\u201cI came in next morning for a warmdown and was offered a pro contract \u2013 Middlesbrough must have had a nibble! \u2013 then I went on to pass my driving test and then got my first team debut away at Birmingham, live on Sky.\n\n\u201cWas I nervous? Oh my word, yes. It was my dream, the one thing I\u2019d been working for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had tunnel vision, nothing was ever going to stop me being a professional footballer, that was the mindset I had.\n\n\u201cAnd for the first ten minutes at St Andrew\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\n\u201cKeith Curle was shouting at me and I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game 1-0 and I was gutted with the result but from an individual point of view, it was such a positive end to an amazing week when everything just seemed to fall into place.\u201d\n\nFrom there, even of such tender years, Naylor \u2018nailed\u2019 down the left back slot for large parts of the years which followed, through the many ups and downs that spending any length of time as a Wolves player necessitates.\n\nExamples such as an impressive performance in the sensational FA Cup quarter final giant-killing at Leeds, being followed by being left on the bench for the semi-final against Arsenal typified the often-dramatic Molineux rollercoaster ride.\n\nOr more pertinently following up the collective disaster of the 2001/02 season when Wolves were overhauled in the promotion race by West Bromwich Albion, with the sensational response a year later and one of the best days in the clubs\u2019 history courtesy of play-off glory against Sheffield United at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nAll these though are experiences which Naylor can now utilise as part of his role as an agent, passing on that knowledge and expertise to those players under his guidance.\n\n\u201cWhen deciding to become an agent I had that benefit of already knowing what football is like from a player point of view but I needed to learn all about the off-field work that goes with it,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cI got to grips with that and now, with having that experience of playing at a decent level, I think it really helps.\n\n\u201cEspecially now, with over 5,000 registered agents all battling for players and to do deals, it\u2019s a big challenge.\n\nLee Naylor at Wolves in 2004\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one I really enjoy, that mix of being able to pass on advice which I learned about what to do and what not do, but also the other side of it which I have developed since working as an agent.\u201d\n\nOne of the highlights which Naylor can certainly pass on, alongside taking on some of football\u2019s true heavyweights whilst at Celtic, was that play-off final, which marks its 20th anniversary next May.\n\nFollowing the travails of the previous season, Wolves didn\u2019t find consistent form until the memorable FA Cup win against Newcastle in early January, from where Wolves only lost two of their next 23 league fixtures, including the trio in the play-offs.\n\nNaylor also chipped in with a couple of vital goals, putting Wolves in front enroute to a 4-2 win at Ipswich with a sublime volley, and then a late free kick securing a narrow 2-1 advantage in the first leg of the play off semi-final against Reading.\n\n\u201cI only ever seemed to score decent goals, when I did manage to score,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cThat Ipswich one was funny because we\u2019d been awful and, in the dressing room at half time, Dave Jones was digging us out, people were fighting, it was all going off!\n\n\u201cDave had a proper go at me as well, which I thought was harsh, but I went out with an attitude to try and prove him wrong and scored an absolute \u2018worldie\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen in the play-offs Reading had caused us problems and we knew it was going to be a tough game.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we had that free kick, I knew in my head what I wanted to do and it came off my foot so sweetly that I knew it was going in.\n\n\u201cThat gave us a crucial advantage for the second leg from where we managed to come through and reach the final.\n\n\u201cAnd the final \u2013 wow, what a day. Although I have to say it passed me by a little.\n\nGiving his expert opinion on commentary with Andy Thompson at Molineux\n\n\u201cIf you speak to psychologists, they will sometimes say that when you are so massively focused on something, like a big football match, it can end up passing you by.\n\n\u201cThat is what happened to me, and I don\u2019t seem to remember much, and it\u2019s only five or six years ago that I actually watched the whole game back for the first time.\n\n\u201cThat was when bits started coming back to me, the big man (Matt Murray) saving the penalty and being incredible that day, all those crucial moments.\n\n\u201cWe had such an unbelievable dressing room at that time, a really good mix of talent and experience and the likes of myself, Matty and Joleon (Lescott) who were still quite young.\n\n\u201cBuilding up to the game, and even coming into the stadium on the coach, I just had a feeling that nothing was going to stop us that day \u2013 I was convinced we were going to win.\n\n\u201cEven with the disappointments the fans had experienced previously in the play-offs, I think they felt that optimism too, and that was in my head right from the start.\n\n\u201cWhen we first went out to walk on the pitch ages before kick-off, our fans were already in there, making so much noise, and there were hardly any from Sheffield United.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the few things that I have always remembered from that day, just thinking, \u2018this is us, no one is beating us today\u2019, and that was how it played out.\n\n\u201cThe way we started the game, they just couldn\u2019t live with us, and going in 3-0 up at half time, there aren\u2019t many teams who can come back from that.\u201d\n\nSheffield United certainly couldn\u2019t, leaving Naylor at the heart of the intense celebrations that heralded the end of a frustratingly painful 19-year absence from the top division and a first ever taste of life in the Premier League.\n\nThat was perhaps more of a sobering experience, although, even in relegation, there were more experiences to cling onto with Naylor a league ever-present in his early twenties.\n\nIt was an unforgiving arena he always planned and hoped to return to, along with trying to build on England Under-21 honours earned in a team including the likes of John Terry, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe, to the progression of a senior Three Lions call-up.\n\nMoving to Celtic at a time when Wolves were undergoing their early transformation under Mick McCarthy was a step up in itself, and a fantastic challenge, but one from which at some stage Naylor had aimed to return back to the English topflight.\n\n\u201cIn my early twenties I had felt like something clicked again and I moved up another level,\u201d Naylor remembers.\n\n\u201cI was going through games just not wanting them to finish and couldn\u2019t wait for the next one to come around.\n\n\u201cI remember winning the Player of the Year award (in 2000/01) and was flying, just loving playing football.\n\n\u201cIt got to the stage at Wolves that things were changing and I wasn\u2019t too sure where the club was going to go.\n\n\u201cI had been there for 17 years or so and still had the dream of going back to the Premier League and of playing for England.\n\n\u201cWas that going to happen for me playing at Wolves? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cCeltic are an absolutely huge football club and going there was an exciting challenge in itself but I also thought it might eventually lead on to coming back to the Premier League, and possibly playing for England.\n\n\u201cI had an amazing first season which ended up in being recognised as one of the Players of the Year in Scotland, the award eventually going to (Shunsuke) Nakamura, who thoroughly deserved it.\n\n\u201cI think the England scouts came to watch me once at Inverness \u2013 we never did well at Inverness \u2013 and we lost the game and I\u2019m not sure they ever came back.\n\n\u201cI did o-k in the second season as well and ended up staying there for four years and it got to a stage where I turned 30 and knew that the Premier League dream was not going to return.\u201d\n\nThere was perhaps one final chance to reach the top tier after being reunited with manager Jones at Cardiff, but the Bluebirds couldn\u2019t press on from a blistering launch to the 2010/11 season and finished up \u2013 as so often in that era - losing in the play-offs.\n\nAt one point, there was actually a chance of a second stint with Wolves, Naylor returning to train at the club during Dean Saunders\u2019 tenure, but he didn\u2019t quite have the immediate level of fitness to hit the ground running in a way that was required at the time.\n\nHe would later make 13 appearances for Accrington Stanley, unpaid, as a favour for their boss and his friend James Beattie, before rounding things off with several outings for Derby County.\n\nIn total he made 529 career appearances \u2013 333 of them at Wolves \u2013 and scored 14 goals, of which nine came whilst at Molineux.\n\nAfter hanging up the boots he admitted there were a couple of years of relative inactivity whilst deciding on his next step.\n\n\u201cI played a lot of golf,\u201d he laughs.\n\nNaylor, now 42, had several property interests, which he has maintained, and did complete his UEFA \u2018B\u2019 license but ultimately leant towards becoming an agent rather than a coach for an increased sense of job security.\n\nHe is also a regular pundit alongside Mikey Burrows and fellow former full back Andy Thompson on Wolves TV \u2013 \u201cpassing on my expert advice\u201d \u2013 and, as befitting his new industry, is always a keen watcher of football whether it is in heading to Molineux or watching the World Cup on television.\n\nAnd that is where, when watching defenders trying to cope with a perhaps slightly ageing Messi and Ronaldo, Naylor can reflect on the fact that he came up against both when they were properly in their prime.\n\nAlthough it was always a very different challenge facing those two in comparison to mere mortal opponents!\n\n\u201cMessi and Ronaldo are very different because it\u2019s not like they are out-and-out wingers who you end up marking all game,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThey come over to your side to do a bit, and then they\u2019re off somewhere else, and that\u2019s another reason why they are so tough to play against.\n\n\u201cThe way they play, their skill, the goals they score, their footballing brains in how they link up with others, they are obviously the elite.\n\n\u201cAnd at the same time, they are unbelievable athletes as well, which is why they are still going strong and still making an impact after so many years.\u201d\n\nSo, the age-old question which continues to permeate football and divide opinion across the globe: \u2018Who is the best?\u2019\n\nNaylor laughs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one which is always goes off in my WhatsApp chats \u2013 who is the best out of Messi and Ronaldo.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many fights and laughs around that question, but it\u2019s all good fun.\n\n\u201cWhat do I think? I don\u2019t think I can actually say. They are quite different players who have both had incredible careers so I wouldn\u2019t want to separate the two.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/naylor-lee/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Lee Naylor\n\naka: The Weasel (social media fan\u2019s nickname for him)\n\nHeight: 5.10\n\nWeight: 12st\n\nBorn: 19 March 1980\n\nBirthplace: Walsall\n\nSigned: 25 Aug 2006\n\nLeft: 1 June 2010 (Free)\n\nPosition: Defender, Left-back\n\nSquad no.: 3\n\nDebut: Celtic 2-1 Hibernian, League, 26 Aug 2006\n\nInternationals: England (no caps)\n\nBiog\n\nWalsall-born full-back Lee Naylor was signed by Celtic for \u00a3600,000 from Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24th August 2006.\n\nThe deal which brought the 27-year-old to Glasgow also saw fellow left-back Charlie Mulgrew, 20, move from Glasgow to Molineux. It was however a transfer which was not originally met with universal approval from the Bhoys support.\n\nNaylor had spent all his career at Wolves and following soon after the dismal failure of Mo Camera, a free transfer from Burnley, the Celtic support were not pleased at the club looking once more towards the English Championship in their bid to solve the problematic left-back position.\n\nFor his part, Naylor was delighted to have secured a move to Parkhead, and his enthusiasm and obvious joy at joining Celtic was evident in his early interviews as well as his performances on the pitch. Indeed within weeks of arriving, Naylor had won over most of the Celtic support with his energetic and tenacious play.\n\nAn over-lapping full back, Naylor was an asset in both attack and defence. Eager to get forward and get a cross into the box, Naylor also ensured he didn\u2019t neglect his primary role and worked hard in curtailing opposition attacks. Although his performances dipped by the end of that season he had done enough to be nominated as a candidate for the SPFA Player of the Year Award 2006/07.\n\nCracks had however began to appear in his play and as the new season began, Naylor appeared to be a different player from the one that impressed during his first six months at the club. His distribution was dire, good opportunities were squandered by over-hit crosses and misplaced passes. Defensively he was often caught out of position and looked uncomfortable when players ran at him with the ball\n\nLess than a year after giving hope that Celtic\u2019s search for a quality left-back could be over, it appeared that Naylor, like many before him, was not the answer. He did however retain a regular starting spot \u2013 scoring his first goal in a vital win over Hibs (s cracker of a goal he scored v Hibs was to everyone\u2019s surprise but more than deserving of all the plaudits that came his way after it) \u2013 as Celtic dramatically battled back to claim the 2007/08 championship and their third title in a row.\n\nSeason 2008/09 saw Celtic surrender their grip on the league title and once more Naylor\u2019s performances were frequently criticised by the support. A seemingly likeable character off the pitch, Naylor, despite his obvious failings on the park, he never gave anything less than his all in the Hoops but the fact remained that the left-back slot remained a significant weakness within the Celtic team.\n\nThe arrival in July 2009 of the highly rated Danny Fox from Coventry \u2013 ironically another Championship team \u2013 appeared to spell the end of Naylor\u2019s days as the first choice left-back at Parkhead. Naylor made a number of cameo appearances filling in for Fox when the ex-Sky Blues man was injured.\n\nWhen Danny Fox surprisingly exited Parkhead prematurely in the January transfer window, Bhoys boss Tony Mowbrary underlined his reluctance to use Naylor by bringing in Dutch internationalist Edson Braafheid on loan from Bayern Munich. The Dutchman disappointed, and following the departure of Mowbray the interim Celtic manager Neil Lennon recalled Naylor to the starting line-up. Patience from Naylor had paid off.\n\nTo Lee Naylor\u2019s credit he came good, and to the surprise of most he played a strong part and put the Dutch internationalist in the shade (where notably Braafheid later played in the World Cup final at the end of the season). Admittedly no stunning performances, but he still managed to hit the jackpot and grab a goal against Rangers in the final league derby match in May 2010. Something that he will prize. It may have been a deflection from his free-kick but it was still one more goal than Danny Fox scored this season from free-kicks (and Danny Fox was meant to be a free-kick specialist). Naylor had caught the eye of sections of the support and all were happy for him.\n\nHowever, with a new manager to come, the squad had to be refreshed and Lee Naylor had been in and out for the last couple of seasons.

It was however a transfer which was not originally met with universal approval from the Bhoys support.\n\nNaylor had spent all his career at Wolves and following soon after the dismal failure of Mo Camera, a free transfer from Burnley, the Celtic support were not pleased at the club looking once more towards the English Championship in their bid to solve the problematic left-back position.\n\nFor his part, Naylor was delighted to have secured a move to Parkhead, and his enthusiasm and obvious joy at joining Celtic was evident in his early interviews as well as his performances on the pitch. Indeed within weeks of arriving, Naylor had won over most of the Celtic support with his energetic and tenacious play.\n\nAn over-lapping full back, Naylor was an asset in both attack and defence. Eager to get forward and get a cross into the box, Naylor also ensured he didn\u2019t neglect his primary role and worked hard in curtailing opposition attacks. Although his performances dipped by the end of that season he had done enough to be nominated as a candidate for the SPFA Player of the Year Award 2006/07.\n\nCracks had however began to appear in his play and as the new season began, Naylor appeared to be a different player from the one that impressed during his first six months at the club. His distribution was dire, good opportunities were squandered by over-hit crosses and misplaced passes. Defensively he was often caught out of position and looked uncomfortable when players ran at him with the ball\n\nLess than a year after giving hope that Celtic\u2019s search for a quality left-back could be over, it appeared that Naylor, like many before him, was not the answer. He did however retain a regular starting spot \u2013 scoring his first goal in a vital win over Hibs (s cracker of a goal he scored v Hibs was to everyone\u2019s surprise but more than deserving of all the plaudits that came his way after it) \u2013 as Celtic dramatically battled back to claim the 2007/08 championship and their third title in a row.\n\nSeason 2008/09 saw Celtic surrender their grip on the league title and once more Naylor\u2019s performances were frequently criticised by the support. A seemingly likeable character off the pitch, Naylor, despite his obvious failings on the park, he never gave anything less than his all in the Hoops but the fact remained that the left-back slot remained a significant weakness within the Celtic team.\n\nThe arrival in July 2009 of the highly rated Danny Fox from Coventry \u2013 ironically another Championship team \u2013 appeared to spell the end of Naylor\u2019s days as the first choice left-back at Parkhead. Naylor made a number of cameo appearances filling in for Fox when the ex-Sky Blues man was injured.\n\nWhen Danny Fox surprisingly exited Parkhead prematurely in the January transfer window, Bhoys boss Tony Mowbrary underlined his reluctance to use Naylor by bringing in Dutch internationalist Edson Braafheid on loan from Bayern Munich. The Dutchman disappointed, and following the departure of Mowbray the interim Celtic manager Neil Lennon recalled Naylor to the starting line-up. Patience from Naylor had paid off.\n\nTo Lee Naylor\u2019s credit he came good, and to the surprise of most he played a strong part and put the Dutch internationalist in the shade (where notably Braafheid later played in the World Cup final at the end of the season). Admittedly no stunning performances, but he still managed to hit the jackpot and grab a goal against Rangers in the final league derby match in May 2010. Something that he will prize. It may have been a deflection from his free-kick but it was still one more goal than Danny Fox scored this season from free-kicks (and Danny Fox was meant to be a free-kick specialist). Naylor had caught the eye of sections of the support and all were happy for him.\n\nHowever, with a new manager to come, the squad had to be refreshed and Lee Naylor had been in and out for the last couple of seasons. He was released on a free in June 2010, and despite the criticisms from sections of the support, he will be fondly remembered by the majority for his time and effort. He got himself a goal v Rangers and for that invaluable moment the support will remember him very fondly.

Either bow to player pressure and let some of their top stars depart, leaving them open to outrage from supporters had they then failed to win the league, or keep them at Celtic against their will, and put the house on men who were anything but all in for the cause.\n\nIn the end, they went with the latter course of action, knowing they would have been crucified had they allowed the likes of Odsonne Edouard or Kristoffer Ajer to jump ship if their hopes of making history were sunk. In the end, a resurgent Rangers torpedoed their hopes in any case, with Celtic\u2019s ragtag bunch unsurprisingly lacking the stomach for the fight.\n\nFor Lee Naylor, the former Celtic full-back who has now become an agent, alarm bells were already ringing in the early part of last summer. Not only was he hearing of the unrest in the dressing room, he was concerned over the recruitment process, having pitched potential signings and been rebuffed not by former teammate Neil Lennon, but by head of football operations Nicky Hammond.\n\nFor Naylor, the 10 in-a-row dream didn\u2019t die during Celtic\u2019s winter of discontent, but right there and then.\n\n\u201cThe only positive is now knowing who to get rid of,\u201d Naylor told the Celtic Huddle Podcast. \u201cOn the pitch there\u2019s nothing much they can take but at least now they can rebuild. They\u2019ll know who wants to be at Celtic and they can clear out those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe signs were there at the start of the season. When you have that many people who are wanting to leave, subconsciously you can\u2019t do it on the pitch.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s interest in that many players, the time was right to make change then. We tried to keep hold of too many players to get 10 in a row and it ended up hurting us.\n\n\u201cAs a club you should be preparing for the future. Celtic have always had two or three coming though from the youth ranks and putting their foot in the deep water with the first time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d then have three or four signings in the summer coming on to strengthen the side.\n\n\u201cYou can cope with one or to wanting to leave and you can get through the season.\n\n\u201cBut when you have five or six who want out the door, there\u2019s no way you can recover.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, players coming in have been well below par, so you are always heading for a downfall.\u201d\n\nNaylor could scarcely believe what he was seeing both the park from Celtic this term, with the team showing none of the characteristics he associates with the successful Celtic sides of the past.\n\n\u201cYou need players that can step in at any time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had that but it\u2019s not seemed that way this season and they\u2019ve paid the price.\n\n\u201cWhen we played we had an urgency about us. I remember [Gordon] Strachan showing us a video of when we lost the ball while attacking. He paused it half way through and asked us, what\u2019s going on here?\n\n\u201cHe had every player on the pitch sprinting back \u2013 that was the fear of Celtic losing.\u201d\n\nOff the park, it has been a similar story, with Naylor disappointed to see supporters protesting outside Celtic Park and calling for former teammate Neil Lennon\u2019s sacking back in December of last year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the Celtic I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see fans gathering outside the club in so much disappointment.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice to see. I obviously don\u2019t condone bad behaviour or violence, but that was the real low point for me.\u201d\n\nNaylor is hoping though that a fresh start can revive Celtic\u2019s fortunes next term, and if Eddie Howe is indeed the man to come in, he has tipped him to re-establish that identity which has been lost along the way during the last nine tumultuous months.\n\nBut he has warned that just as Celtic will need to adapt to suit the demands of their new manager, so must he to suit the demands of the club.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good young manager,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be used to what it takes to be a manager in Glasgow because you need to win every single game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll bring identity to the club again on the pitch in the way we play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been needing that for a while. It\u2019s a tough one because it takes time but you are under scrutiny regardless.\n\n\u201cIf you are a Celtic or Rangers manager you need to win regardless.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.talkceltic.net/forums/threads/lee-naylor.118946/", "page_content": "Now that he has been away from the club for a while, I was wondering what people's thoughts and memories of Lee Naylor as a Celtic player were?\n\n\n\nI quite liked him to be honest. I felt he got a rougher ride from a section of the Celtic support than he deserved. Ok he wasn't the greatest left back in the club's history but he certainly wasn't a bad player. He was outstanding for us in his first season here and was actually nominated for the Players Player of the Year award that season.\n\n\n\nI thought he was quite a good player coming forward, he got himself into good attacking positions and linked up quite well with Aiden McGeady down the left flank. Defensively he could be a bit suspect but that could be said of a lot of the full-backs that Celtic have had down the years.\n\n\n\nI think the thing I liked most about him was that he never hid. Even if he was having a ropey game and the fans were giving him stick he would still always look for the ball and try to get involved in the game. Some players would have hid in that situation but Naylor never did.\n\n\n\nOverall I think he did a good job for Celtic. He was certainly well worth the money we paid for him.\n\nClick to expand..."}, {"url": "https://www.67hailhail.com/news/ex-celtic-man-lee-naylor-was-left-stunned-by-november-protests/", "page_content": "Ex-Celtic man Lee Naylor was left stunned by November protests\n\nBy Euan Davidson May 18, 2021\n\nThere was a point this season where Celtic managed just one win in 11 games. In all competitions, the Bhoys were floundering. Protest filled the winter air, as fans congregated [Herald] outside Paradise on two occasions.\n\nIt was an unusual sight. Admittedly, small protests against the board, via tifos and literature had become commonplace. However, an actual revolt was a sight to behold. In a decade of dominance, there were still rumblings of discontent, but this was mutiny.\n\nAnd it was quite reasonable. This season was utterly dismal, and we\u2019ll be counting the cost of the board\u2019s inaction for a while yet. Even if normal service resumes in 21-22, the scars of this campaign will take a while to heal. If, that is, they heal at all.\n\nReflecting on this season, Lee Naylor joined Mark Wilson and Simon Donnelly for a chat on the Celtic Huddle Podcast. What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t hold back when talking about the failures of 20-21.\n\nSpeaking about the awful form and the protests outside Paradise, Naylor said [Celtic Huddle Podcast]:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not Celtic. That\u2019s not the Celtic I know, anyways. I never thought in my time that I\u2019d see Celtic fans gathering outside the club, in that much disappointment.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice to see, obviously I don\u2019t condone bad behaviour and violence, but that was the lowest point for me, to see that.\n\nAsked about whether there were any positives to this season, Naylor curtly replied:\n\n\u201cKnowing who to get rid of.\n\n\u201cAt least now you can rebuild, and rebuild to know who wants to be at Celtic. Clear out who wants to be there and who doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nLee Naylor doesn\u2019t hold back, but nor should he: Celtic let supporters down this season\n\nEssentially, just so he isn\u2019t misconstrued, what Naylor is saying is that he didn\u2019t expect fans to be so disappointed by the club, that they\u2019d (rightly) protest. Just so we\u2019re on the same page.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Naylor took a lot from being at Celtic. Across the whole podcast, the former Wolves man drops \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d throughout. Signed by Gordon Strachan in 2006, Naylor was shortlisted for the Player of the Year honours in 2007 [BBC].\n\nOver 4 years and 100 appearances, Naylor established himself as Strachan\u2019s first-choice left-back, before his contract expired in 2010.\n\nAnd, on this evidence, he\u2019s clearly hurt by what the supporters have been through this season. Clearly, he counts himself in that number."}, {"url": "https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/sport/football/lee-naylor-reveals-two-celtic-20624006", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Celtic F.C updates, transfer news and analysis from Football Scotland delivered straight to your inbox every day for free\n\nFormer Celtic left-back Lee Naylor claims Neil Lennon had his hands tied over transfers before being shown the door at Parkhead.\n\nNaylor enjoyed a four-year stint for the Hoops between 2006 and 2010, winning two Premiership titles and one Scottish Cup during his time in Glasgow, and has since became an agent since hanging up his boots.\n\nNaylor even played under Lennon during his time with the Hoops and has revealed he submitted several players for the club's hierarchy to consider during the Northern Irishman's most recent tenure.\n\nBut it seems the manager might not have had the final say on potential incomings, as Naylor told the Celtic Huddle podcast : \u201cI put a few in at the start of the season but there was no takers.\n\n\u201cThere was a centre midfielder and striker.

Naylor helped Wolves earn promotion to the Premier League in 2003 under Dave Jones with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Sheffield United in the play-off final. The left-back made the most appearances in the top-flight within that squad, with 37 starts before making a further 38 outings back in the Championship the following season. Wolves missed out on the play-offs by eight points in 2006 and Naylor said his goodbyes to the club in August that year when Scottish champions Celtic paid \u00a3600,000 for his services.\n\nEngland under-21s (2000-2001)\n\nWhile he was at Wolves, Naylor was called up to the England Under-21 squad by former Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United boss Howard Wilkinson. After being an unused substitute in June 2000 against Germany, Naylor started a 3-1 defeat to Greece in a UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying outing. Within that England squad was John Terry, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Jermaine Defore. Naylor played the full 90 minutes in Greece, with Terry and Luke Young receiving straight red cards in injury time.\n\nCeltic (2006-2010)\n\nJoining striker Kenny Miller in joining the Celts from Wolves, Naylor became the club\u2019s first-choice left-back and grabbed an assist for Maciej Zurawski in the 2-1 victory over Hibernian. In his first experience in Europe, Naylor played every minute of Celtic\u2019s journey to the last 16 after they beat Manchester United, Benfica and FC Copenhagen in the group stage before losing 1-0 on aggregate to Italian giants AC Milan. Naylor was nominated for the SPFA Player of the Year award in 2007 before scoring his first goal in March 2008 against Hibs. One of his most memorable moments in green and white came in 2010 when he scored the opening goal with a brilliant free-kick against Old Firm rivals Rangers before assisting Marc-Antoine Fortune for the winner.\n\nCardiff City (2010-2012)\n\nFollowing his release from Celtic, Naylor returned to England with Championship side Cardiff City, who were managed by Naylor\u2019s former manager Dave Jones. However, despite only missing one of the opening 29 league games, alongside the loan arrival of Jlloyd Samuel from Bolton Wanderers, Naylor fell down the pecking order and only played a further 56 minutes before the Bluebirds were knocked out of the play-offs by Reading. Malky Mackay arrived at the club in the summer of 2011, but Naylor continued to be back-up behind Andrew Taylor and only made two league appearances before was released upon the end of his contract.\n\nAccrington Stanley (2013-2014)\n\nAfter his release from Cardiff, Naylor failed to find a club throughout the 2012/13 season, but eventually signed for James Beattie\u2019s Accrington Stanley in September 2013 on a short team deal. He started eight of his first nine games for Stanley that season, grabbing three assists as the side struggled in League Two. However, only three months after arriving at the club, Naylor\u2019s contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nDerby County (2014-2015)\n\nAnother short-term deal followed for the full-back as he jumped up two divisions to join Championship promotion chasers Derby County during the subsequent campaign to provide competition to Craig Forsyth. He made his debut on 25th March 2014 against Ipswich Town but eventually saw the Rams suffer play-off heartbreak at Wembley as Bobby Zamora\u2019s goal promoted Queens Park Rangers. In his final season as a player, Naylor\u2019s only appearance came in a FA Cup third-round tie with Southport, with the Rams winning courtesy of a Chris Martin penalty."}]}
