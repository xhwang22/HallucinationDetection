It was the year that would change tennis forever, and in every sense, from how the game was played (and how the players were paid) to how it was seen around the world.\n\n1968 was a truly historic year, arguably the most important since 1945 and the end of World War Two. Artistically and specifically musically (the greatest art form of the 1960s), it was the year that \u201cpop\u201d changed to \u201crock\u201d, as everyone from The Beatles to The Velvets followed the trail blazed by Jimi Hendrix the year before and started playing louder, faster and darker. Politically, too, it was a momentous 12 months, as all the optimism of the mid-sixties (which lasted roughly from the first American success of The Beatles to the release of \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d in 1967\u2019s Summer of Love) gave way to the acrimony and violence of the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d and the riots at the Democratic Party Conference in Chicago. However, it was in sport and specifically in tennis that some of the most seismic and lasting changes occurred, as 1968 was the year that changed tennis forever.\n\nThroughout 2018, the 50th anniversary of the start of the \u201cOpen\u201d era, LastWordOnTennis will be commemorating and celebrating the most important year in tennis history, looking back at all the ways in which it changed tennis irrevocably, including:\n\nTHE FIRST OPEN MAJOR \u2013 In 1968, the Australian Open took place in December, so the first Open-era Major was the 1968 French Open, in May. Thus, a sporting revolution took place against the backdrop of a genuine political revolution \u2013 the fabled Paris \u201968 student uprisings \u2013 and history was made both on and off court.\n\nTHE FIRST OPEN WIMBLEDON \u2013 How did Wimbledon, the very embodiment of tennis tradition, cope with the generational change of 1968? At the first Open-era Wimbledon, the fault-lines between the old Amateur game and the new Professional era were fully laid bare.\n\nTHE FIRST US OPEN \u2013 We will look back at how The US Championships became The US Open, the biggest, brashest and most \u2018open\u2019 Open of them all.\n\nTHE GENDER REVOLUTION \u2013 We will examine how the sporting revolution within the game led to its very own sexual revolution, with a growing demand from female players for gender equality and equal pay, and in the process we will tell the story of how the women\u2019s game found its greatest ever champion (in terms of being a champion for the game itself) in Billie Jean King.\n\nTHE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION \u2013 Amid all the other momentous changes of the period, the late 1960s saw the arrival of the first non-wooden rackets, which in time would transform the game completely.\n\nAND FINALLY, THE FANS\u2019 VIEW \u2013 At the end of 2018, LastWordOnTennis will invite those tennis fans who saw the remarkable transformations of 1968 at first-hand to record their own unique memories of 1968 and how it changed the game, which would ultimately transform a rather genteel, relatively upper-class entertainment into unarguably the greatest individual sport in the world.\n\nIn short, we aim to provide revolutionary (or at least rather remarkable) coverage of the greatest revolution in tennis, and we hope you can join us for the ride.\n\nOthers in this series\n\nBrief History of Pre-1968 Tennis\n\n1968 French Open\n\n1968 Wimbledon\n\n1968 US Open\n\nMain Photo:"}, {"url": "https://www.tcdb.com/Person.cfm/pid/108974/Twila-%E2%80%9CTwi%E2%80%9D-Shively", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nTwila Shively\n\nBorn: March 20, 1922 in Decatur, Illinois, USA\n\nDied: November 25, 1999 (77 years old)\n\nTotal Cards: 2\n\n*"}, {"url": "https://www.biographies.net/biography/twila-shively/m/0hhtbrr", "page_content": "Who was Twila Shively?\n\nTwila Shively [\u2033Twi\u2033] was an American competitive baseball player. An outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5 ft 6 in, 128 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\n\nTwila Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field. A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer.\n\nBorn in Decatur, Illinois, Twila Shively was the daughter of Glenn and Eva Shively. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with this headline: \u201cShe\u2019s Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/sports/tennis/Professional-and-open-tennis", "page_content": "In 1967 a British proposal for a limited schedule of open tournaments was voted down by the international federation, but the British LTA refused to accept the verdict. In December 1967, despite the threat of expulsion from the ILTF, the LTA voted to abolish the distinction between amateurs and pros in their tournaments. This revolutionary step forced an emergency meeting of the ILTF in March 1968 in which 12 open tournaments were approved. The era of open professionalism in tennis dawned in 1968.\n\nStarting in the 1930s, many of the amateur champions became barnstorming professionals. After World War II , Jack Kramer became the pro champion and in the early 1950s took over promotion of the pro tour. He kept raiding the amateur ranks, signing such stars as Frank Sedgman, Tony Trabert, Lew Hoad , and Ken Rosewall . They made money with the one-night stands, but their matches were virtually unreported. Although the traditional tournament circuit was avowedly amateur, leading players were paid substantial guarantees \u201cunder the table\u201d in addition to expenses. For more than four decades there was discussion of having \u201copen\u201d competition between amateurs and pros to end the hypocrisy of \u201cshamateurism,\u201d but proposals were always defeated by conservative elements within the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF\u2014later the ITF). In 1967, however, two new professional groups were formed: the National Tennis League, organized by former U.S. Davis Cup captain George MacCall, and World Championship Tennis (WCT), founded by New Orleans promoter Dave Dixon and funded by Dallas oil and football tycoon Lamar Hunt. Between them they signed a significant number of the world\u2019s top players, professional and amateur.\n\nAs tennis began to establish its popularity, there was a need for professionals to coach and to organize, but, unlike real tennis , there were no competitions in which professionals could play. This changed in 1926 when Charles C. (\u201cCash and Carry\u201d) Pyle, a successful sports promoter in the United States , offered Suzanne Lenglen $50,000 to go on a professional tour of America playing Mary K. Browne, who had been U.S. singles champion from 1912 to 1914. He also signed four male players. The tour, played in major arenas, drew large crowds and was a financial success. For the next 40 years, pro tennis consisted primarily of barnstorming tours that featured the reigning champion playing a recently signed amateur champion.\n\nThe open era\n\nThe first open tournament was the British Hard Courts at Bournemouth in April 1968, where the champions were Ken Rosewall and Virginia Wade. The first open Wimbledon was a joyous occasion, as many past champions who had been stripped of membership in the All England Club when they turned professional were welcomed back. The total prize money was \u00a326,150 ($62,760), of which \u00a32,000 went to men\u2019s singles champion Rod Laver and \u00a3750 went to women\u2019s singles winner Billie Jean King. The singles titles at the first U.S. Open, with a total purse of $100,000, were won by Arthur Ashe, the sport\u2019s first black male champion, and Wade. Within two decades the major championships had multimillion-dollar purses, and top players could expect to earn in excess of $1,000,000 a year on the court alone. Laver became the first player to sweep the major titles a second time and the first to do so as a professional.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Moments Nicknames Quiz\n\nThe transition years from quasi-amateurism to full-fledged professional tennis were rife with political disputes and lawsuits for control of what had become a big-money sport. Both male and female players formed guilds\u2014the men\u2019s Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA), which in 1986 became the Women\u2019s International Tennis Association (WITA). Previous player unions had been ineffective, but the ATP showed itself a potent political force when the majority of its members boycotted Wimbledon in 1973 in a dispute over the eligibility of the Yugoslav pro Nikki Pilic. The women\u2019s union proved similarly unified. The women have had a separate pro tour, except at the major championships, since 1971.\n\nThe first few seasons of open tennis were ruled by players who were products of the old system and reflected its behavioral standards and norms. These included the compact, classical Rosewall, the Australian John Newcombe, and the Americans Arthur Ashe and Stan Smith.\n\nAs television, in America and later worldwide, became an increasingly significant force in tennis, a new breed of flamboyant and often flippant, cocky, and quick-tempered player developed. Among them was Ilie Nastase\u2014a dark, handsome, mercurial Romanian noted for his rapid mood swings. While winning the 1972 U.S. Open, the 1973 French Open, and four Masters titles, he created chaos and controversy on the court with colourful, and occasionally off-colour, tantrums and tirades. He was perhaps an influence on Jimmy Connors, a brash American whose aggressive, blood-and-guts, all-court style and feisty temperament captivated audiences whether they loved or loathed him. In 1974 Connors won Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the U.S. Open. In an intensely competitive era that produced short careers, Connors enjoyed extraordinary longevity at the top. He won Wimbledon again in 1982, the U.S. Open four more times, and the WCT Championship in 1977 and 1980.\n\nFollowing the fiery Connors as the dominant player was the relatively cool Bj\u00f6rn Borg, who led Sweden to its first triumph in the Davis Cup in 1975. Practically unbeatable on slow clay, he won the French Open six times between 1974 and 1981 and remarkably adapted his game to fast grass, adding a sledgehammer serve and underspin approach shot, to win Wimbledon five years running, 1976\u201380. No player had done that since the champion had to play through the draw, starting in 1922. The American John McEnroe ended Borg\u2019s Wimbledon reign in 1981 and beat him in the 1980\u201381 U.S. Open finals. Between 1979 and 1984 McEnroe, a torrid-tempered left-hander of exquisite athleticism and racket control, won Wimbledon three times, the U.S. Open four times, the Masters three times, and the WCT Championship four times.\n\nThe balance of power in men\u2019s tennis shifted back to Europe in the 1980s. Borg inspired a new wave of players in Sweden. A sophisticated junior-development system created a group of Swedish players\u2014led by 1982, 1985, and 1988 French Open champion Mats Wilander. Another European country with a long tennis tradition that reached new heights in the 1980s was Czechoslovakia. One of the foremost players and coaches in Europe in the 1920s and \u201930s was the Czech Karel Kozeluh. Czechoslovakia produced men\u2019s Wimbledon champions Jaroslav Drobny in 1954 and Jan Kode\u0161 in 1973. Among the players to come out of Czechoslovakia\u2019s player-development system and become dominant in the 1970s and \u201980s were Martina Navratilova, who became a U.S. citizen; Hana Mandlikova, who became an Australian citizen in 1987; and Ivan Lendl, who took up residence in the United States. The European tennis boom of the 1980s also swept through West Germany, which produced Boris Becker, who won the Wimbledon singles in 1985 at age 17 (the youngest man and first unseeded player to do so), and Steffi Graf, who in 1987 ended Navratilova\u2019s five-year reign as the top-ranked woman in tennis and in 1988 won the Grand Slam, becoming the first woman to do so since Margaret Court in 1970.\n\nGraf\u2019s emergence also ended an extraordinary streak by the American Chris Evert, who had won at least one of the Grand Slam singles titles for 13 consecutive years, 1974\u201386, an unprecedented feat. A paragon of backcourt consistency and controlled temperament, Evert was the perfect contrast in both style and personality to several net-rushing rivals: the Australian Evonne Goolagong, who won her first Wimbledon in 1971 at age 19, Billie Jean King, and Navratilova, whom Evert played in 13 Grand Slam finals in one of the game\u2019s greatest rivalries. Evert, probably more than anyone, popularized the two-handed backhand, and she made a steady baseline game the prevalent style of a whole generation of women players.\n\nDuring the 1990s Steffi Graf collected 14 of her 21 career Grand Slam singles titles. Tall and athletic, Graf used powerful ground strokes and excellent court coverage to dispatch opponents. Her primary rival during this period was Yugoslavia\u2019s Monica Seles, who collected seven Grand Slam titles between 1990 and 1992. Though Graf retired in 1999, the women\u2019s tour still boasted exceptional competition and talented players, such as Martina Hingis of Switzerland (winner of five major titles before the age of 20) and American Lindsay Davenport, who won titles at the U.S. Open (1998), Wimbledon (1999), and the Australian Open (2000). At the turn of the century, sisters Venus and Serena Williams of the United States emerged as a new force on the women\u2019s tour. Serena won the U.S. Open in 1999, 2002, 2008, and 2012\u201314; the French Open in 2002, 2013, and 2015; Wimbledon in 2002\u201303, 2009\u201310, 2012, and 2015\u201316; and the Australian Open in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009\u201310, 2015, and 2017. Venus won Wimbledon five times (2000\u201301, 2005, and 2007\u201308), the U.S. Open twice (2000\u201301), and an Olympic gold medal in tennis (2000). The sisters were credited with popularizing the sport among African Americans.\n\nThe men\u2019s game increasingly emphasized athleticism and power in the 1990s. Pete Sampras of the United States best epitomized this style of play, using devastating serves and ground strokes, along with exceptional agility, to claim a record-setting 14 Grand Slam titles; the record was later surpassed by Roger Federer of Switzerland. Players such as Patrick Rafter of Australia, Sweden\u2019s Stefan Edberg, and Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov also claimed their share of major titles during the decade, but Andre Agassi surfaced as Sampras\u2019s primary rival. Agassi won singles titles at the Australian Open (1995, 2000\u201301, 2003), the French Open (1999), Wimbledon (1992), and the U.S. Open (1994, 1999) and finished the 1999 season as the top-ranked player on the tour. In the early 21st century, Federer emerged as one of the game\u2019s dominant players. He won an unprecedented 19 men\u2019s singles Grand Slam championships\u2014eight Wimbledon titles (2003\u201307, 2009, 2012, and 2017), five U.S. Opens (2004\u201308), five Australian Opens (2004, 2006\u201307, 2010, and 2017), and one French Open (2009). One of Federer\u2019s main rivals was Rafael Nadal of Spain. Although initially thought of as a clay-court specialist\u2014he captured a record 10 French Open titles (2005\u201308, 2010\u201314, and 2017)\u2014Nadal also won at Wimbledon (2008 and 2010), the Australian Open (2009), and the U.S. Open (2010, 2013, and 2017)."}, {"url": "https://aagpbl.org/profiles/twila-shively-twi/542", "page_content": "\u201cTwi\u201d played softball in the Chicago softball leagues as early as 1942 when a headline in the Chicago Daily News said that she \u201cLooks Like a Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb, and Has Baseball \u2018Savvy\u2019 Plus a Pretty Face.\u201d Twi was a member of Chicago\u2019s National Girls Baseball League\u2019s (NGBL) Rockola Music Maids team in 1944. The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/twila-shively/", "page_content": "Twila Shively [\u2033Twi\u2033] (March 20, 1920 \u2013 November 25, 1999) was an American competitive baseball player.

The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars.\n\nShively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field. Shively collected a .196 batting average and a .276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a .968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies' Penny O'Brian (236). During the regular season she achieved a career highlight, when she belted a two-out, walk-off grand slam to give her team the victory.\n\nHer most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (.247), runs scored (78) hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45) and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches) and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit's players averaged under .200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the .300 mark (.316).\n\nFollowing her baseball career, Shively graduated at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and worked as a physical education teacher at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana.

Listed at 5 ft 6 in (168 m), 128 pounds, she batted and threw right-handed. Twila Shively spent five of her six years in the AAGPBL playing in the left field A solid defensive player, she showed speed, good hands, an accurate throwing arm, and lived in a constant state of readiness. Routinely, she ranked among the top defensive outfielders in several categories, until a severe ankle injury limited her ability to perform, and had to switch to first base. Offensively, she made consistent contact, knew when to take the extra base, and excelled as a basestealer. She began playing softball at age eight and moved up in the softball ranks in Chicago as early as 1942. By then, she was featured in an article signed by Carl Guldager and published in the Chicago Daily News with this headline: \u201cShe\u2019s Hedy Lamarr of Softball, Twila Shively Looks Like Model, Runs Bases Like Ty Cobb. Has Baseball Savvy Plus Pretty Face\u201d. The NGBL was organized in Chicago to keep the best local players from migrating to the AAGPBL, which had been stabilized in 1943. After that, both circuits competed against each other to see who could associate itself with the biggest stars. Shively entered the AAGPBL in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, playing for them three years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948) and Peoria Redwings (1948\u20131950). In her rookie year she formed part of a Chicks outfield that included Thelma Eisen in the center field and Elizabeth Wicken at right field Shively collected a.196 batting average and a.276 on-base percentage in 106 games, driving in 23 runs and scoring 42 times, while her 46 stolen bases ranked her fifth in the league. She also led all outfielders with a.968 fielding percentage and finished second for the most putouts (234) behind Fort Wayne Daisies\" Penny O\"Brian (236). Her most productive season came in 1946, when she posted career numbers in average (247), runs scored (78) hits (101), runs batted in (45), steals (45) and games played (111). Considering the year was great for many pitchers her numbers were quite respectable. Four no-hitters were recorded by Anna Mae Hutchison (Belles), Betty Luna (Blue Sox), Carolyn Morris (Peaches) and Amy Irene Applegren (Lassies), while Connie Wisniewski (Chicks) and Dorothy Wiltse (Daisies) topped the league in earned run average with 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. As a result, more than half of the circuit\"s players averaged under.200. Dorothy Kamenshek (Peaches) was the only hitter to reach the.300 mark (316). She also coached the school\"s softball and volleyball teams to city championships, inspiring children for almost 30 years. Twila Shively died in Douglas, Michigan on Thanksgiving Day, 1999 at the age of 79, after suffering four years of Alzheimer\"s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer. She is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, unveiled in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personality."}, {"url": "https://buzzlearn.com/twila-shively/", "page_content": "Learn about Twila Shively Net Worth, Biography, Age, Birthday, Height, Early Life, Family, Dating, Partner, Wiki, and Facts.\n\nWho is Twila Shively:\n\nTwila Shively is a famous Baseball player.

You never saw the results in the newspaper from one-night stands played by pros like Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and Fred Stolle.\n\n\n\nBut in mid-1967 New Orleans businessman Dave Dix-on, seeking events to put in the new Louisiana Superdome, thought pro tennis would be a perfect enterprise if marketed and packaged right. He received the backing of Dallas businessmen Lamar Hunt and AIG. Hunt Jr.\n\n\n\nWorld Championship Tennis was formed and Dixon set out to sign eight of the leading amateurs in the world \u2013 John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Dennis Ralston, Pierre Barthes, Nikki Pilic, Roger Taylor, Butch Buchholz and Cliff Drysdale. They were called \u201cThe Handsome Eight\u201d but the key signings were that of Newcombe and Ralston. Newcombe was the defending Wimbledon and Forest Hills champ and Ralston the leading American player.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt amongst those players that the WCT signings helped cause \u201copen\u201d tennis in 1968. The result of \u201copen\u201d tennis was the great tennis boom of the 1970s, the effects of which are still evident today.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout those signings Wimbledon would not have opened its gates to pros in 1968, the event that signaled the beginning of tennis\u2019 open era,\u201d said Drysdale.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that WCT came in and a person of Lamar\u2019s reputation, what he did in football and what he meant to sports, I think gave the players and potential sponsors the confidence to keep investing in tennis. Open tennis came and Lamar was instrumental in that,\u201d said Buchholz.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt (WCT) was the start of open tennis,\u201d said Ralston. \u201cThe involvement of WCT has been very important for the game of tennis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think because all of us turned pro at once, it forced them to make the decision to make tennis open,\u201d Newcombe said. \u201cBut when I signed with WCT I had no idea open tennis would be coming.\u201d\n\n\n\nWCT held a taped-for-TV event on the final day of 1967 in the parking lot of a Sydney, Australia suburb. However, the first true WCT tournament was in late January, 1968 at Kansas City. A piece of Astroturf was stretched over the ice of a hockey rink.\n\n\n\nThe Astroturf left 20 feet of uncovered ice and several players, particularly, Ralston, hit the ice and went sliding. For the first time, tennis players wore colored clothes and used yellow balls. Frustrated after losing his first pro match, Roche flushed his blue shirt down the toilet, flooding the restrooms and lockers.\n\n\n\nThe going was rough for WCT organizers as well. The only time WCT made any money was in Shreveport where a moving company had to pay $500 for failing to celiver the court on time.\n\n\n\nAs WCT went through its growing pains and the George McCall tour (Laver, Rosewall, etc.) was struggling, the amateur administrators recognized they could no longer keep the pros out.\n\n\n\nThe first \u2019open\u201d tournament was held in Bournemouth in April 1968 and Wimbledon became the first major event to let pros play a few months later.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people made a lot of sacrifices,\u201d said Buchholz. \u201cNone of us can be tod thankful for what WCT has done,\u201d said Laver. Added his Aussie mate Ken Rosewall, \u201cI give WCT a great deal of credit. They established what a pro circuit could be. . . nearly everything about pro tennis had its start in the WCT series.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few of WCT\u2019s contributions to tennis are: the creation of the first doubles only championship tournament to showcase a seldom appreciated aspect of the sport; the introduction of tennis worldwide in cities which had never hosted a tennis event; the development of a slower indoor surface for better tennis; and even a major increase in prize money.\n\n\n\nMike Davies, former WCT Executive Director, sums up WCT\u2019s contributions like this:\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore WCT, the sport was doing nothing. Without it, the sport would never have gotten off the ground. The federations? What did they do with tennis for 70 years? If Lamar hadn\u2019t come in, the ILTF and national associations would still be running things. What would it be like? I wonder. . .\u201d\n\n\n\nGet our weekly recap Brings new meaning to the phrase Sunday Funday. No spam, ever."}]}
