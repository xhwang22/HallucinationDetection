Tolkien as well as working on both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series. Most recently he has worked as a concept artist for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power television series. [1]\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, Canada.[2] He graduated from the \u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e8coratifs of Strasbourg[2] in 1981, having obtained a Diploma in Illustration.[3] He now lives in Neuchatel with his wife Fataneh and his son Dana.[2]\n\nHowe first read The Lord of the Rings in high school, borrowing them from his school library. He started with The Two Towers, because \"everyone who started the first volume never got any further\" and The Fellowship of the Ring was rarely available to borrow.[4] He was inspired by artwork from The Brothers Hildebrandt to start creating illustration of Tolkien's works.[4]\n\nHowe's version of Boromir is based on his own face.[5]\n\nInvolvement in Peter Jackson's Middle-earth film series [ edit | edit source ]\n\nJohn Howe and Alan Lee worked as the chief conceptual designers on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.[6] Howe is also credited as a carpenter in the first two films.[6] [7] He has a cameo as one of the nine Kings of Men in the Prologue of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Howe and Lee returned to work as conceptual designers for The Hobbit film series. They both make an uncredited appearance as a men-musicians of Laketown in The Desolation of Smaug.[8]\n\nArtwork theft [ edit | edit source ]\n\nIn the night of 18 May 1997, 11 of Howe's originals were stolen from the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que of Sedan in Belgium. The thief's father contacted the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que a couple weeks later promising to try to retrieve the stolen works from his son. 8 originals were finally returned, one (Minas Tirith) was damaged beyond repair. \u00c9owyn and the Nazg\u00fbl, Gandalf the Grey, and The Uruk-hai were never recovered.[9]\n\nPublished Artwork [ edit | edit source ]\n\nHowe is one of HarperCollins' most used artists, and his cover art is frequently featured on translations as well.\n\nMultiple editions [ edit | edit source ]\n\nCalendars and books [ edit | edit source ]\n\n\"Illustrating Tolkien means treading warily, dipping one's brush in shadow and rinsing them in light. Battle and balance, down the impossible path between the clear and the obscure.\" \u2015 John Howe on painting Middle-earth, Tolkien's World.\n\n\"It was this place in North Island, and we wandered round these fields saying, well, Bag End can go here, that can be our party tree; it was very exciting. It's almost even more fun to have a location imposed upon you, because you really have to get down to brass tacks and figure it out, imagine it on paper. It's a real illustrator's job.\" \u2015 John Howe on working for Weta, Interview.\n\nSee also [ edit | edit source ]"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/34748.John_Howe", "page_content": "John Howe\n\nBorn\n\nAugust 21, 1957\n\nWebsite\n\nGenre\n\nJohn Howe is a Canadian book illustrator, living in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland.

It\u2019s a corker.\n\nHowe is, of course, a long-time Tolkien illustrator and is currently working with Alan Lee as Conceptual Designer for The Hobbit movie trilogy.\n\nMeet the man who remade Middle\u2011earth\n\nby Ethan Gilsdorf\n\nYou may not know John Howe, but you have probably visited his worlds.\n\nHowe is among the best-known illustrators of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s works. Since the 1990s, Howe has helped visualize Middle-earth by creating art for various bound editions of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and other works. He also provided artwork for more obscure Tolkienania, such as calendars, posters, postcards, jacket art for the covers of audio editions and games and trading cards. Not only that, he\u2019s the man behind the pen for a variety of other fantasy art projects: Beowulf board games, Anne McCaffery book jackets, Magic: The Gathering cards, children\u2019s books, and folk tales such as Rip Van Winkle and Jack and the Beanstalk. Howe has also illustrated books on dragons, knights and \u201chow to\u201d instructional manuals for how to draw your own fantasy art.\n\nBut Howe\u2019s stature as a fantasy artist catapulted to new heights when Peter Jackson tapped him and Alan Lee, another prominent Tolkien illustrator, to serve as conceptual designers for his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jackson has said that even before he hired Howe, the illustrations that Howe drew of Gandalf (see banner image above), Bag End, the Balrog and the Nazg\u00fbl\u2019s flying beasts helped guide his vision for Middle-earth.\n\nToday, given the millions who have seen Jackson\u2019s films, Howe can be credited with irrevocably shaping how we see Tolkien\u2019s world on the screen, and in our imaginations. Someone had to design every dwarf axe, evil tower, hobbit mug, and orc prosthetic, and Howe had his hand in nearly every decision about Middle-earth\u2019s \u201clook and feel.\u201d\n\nPlus, thanks to the seemingly infinite production documentaries found in the Rings trilogy\u2019s Extended Edition DVDs, Howe has become somewhat of a celebrity\u2014at least among the ranks of those who care about the behind-the-scene scribblers, sword-forgers and model makers who work for the special effects house Weta Workshop and Jackson\u2019s fantasy empire down in Wellington, New Zealand. (Howe actually works for 3 Foot 7 Ltd., the New Zealand production company created by Warner Bros.) With his colleagues, Howe has brought new levels of fastidiousness to movie production design.\n\n\u201cJohn is highly productive,\u201d said Alan Lee about his office mate and artistic collaborator, \u201cproducing brilliant drawings in the brief periods when his turbo-charged metabolism allows him to sit still.\u201d\n\nThe tag-team of Howe and Lee moved back to Wellington when Jackson decided to adapt The Hobbit trilogy. The first installment, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, came out Christmas of 2012; film two, The Desolation of Smaug, hit theaters a year after that. When the \u201cExtended Edition\u201d of An Unexpected Journey was released last year, fans got an extra taste of Howe\u2019s magic touch. Expect the same sneak peeks into Howe\u2019s process when the extra dance mix version of film two comes likely comes out in October or November. Of course, there\u2019s also the final installment of the trilogy, now with the new title The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which arrives just over half a year from now, in December.\n\n[Read More]"}, {"url": "https://www.john-howe.com/links/gallery/details.php?image_id=1593", "page_content": "\n\nLord of the Brush\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lord of the Brush will take you on a journey to discover John Howe, an artist famous for his illustrations of JRR Tolkien\u2019s Middle Earth.

She leads a team of video journalists, picture editors, a graphic designer, data journalist and community developer, and specialises in social media.

It\u2019s one of just a few, carefully selected objects on display in his home that show the connection between the illustrator and his most famous work, drawing the concept art and designs for the film adaptations of Tolkien\u2019s books.\n\nTo call Howe down to earth despite his integral involvement in the multi-award winning, global blockbusters would be an understatement. However, as he settles down on his sofa, dressed in jeans, a plain grey jumper and socks, there\u2019s no hint of a Hollywood-sized ego here.\n\nNow that the final film version of The Hobbit film has come out in cinemas, Canadian-born Howe has come to the end of a long journey that took him from Switzerland to New Zealand and back, over the course of many years.\n\nJohn Howe Jo Fahy\n\n\u201cI always knew that I wanted to draw\u2026I didn\u2019t know it was actually a profession until I finished high school,\u201d Howe told swissinfo.ch. He\u2019s talking about a time that, in his words, is \u201cpractically pre-history in terms of the media we know today\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny kid in high school who can draw can put it up on the internet now,\u201d he muses. For him however, starting out was about getting feedback from family and friends, putting a portfolio together and trying to get in to art school.\n\nHe studied near Strasbourg in France before he and his wife were offered jobs in the 1980s on an animated feature film in Lausanne.\n\nFirst images\n\nWhen the Lord of the Rings movie was in its very early stages, the filmmakers came across work by Howe as they begun to shape the look and feel of the film.\n\n\u201cThey basically covered the walls of their office with artwork they\u2019d found,\u201d said Howe. \u201cA majority must have been by Alan Lee and myself, so I think we got them by default in a sense.\u201d\n\nHe had illustrated a number of Tolkien calendars in the 1980s and 90s.\n\n\u201cI had no idea who Peter Jackson [the films\u2019 director] was, I\u2019d never seen any of his films,\u201d Howe confessed. He describes setting off to work on the film in New Zealand - in his understated style - as \u201ca bit of an adventure\u201d.\n\nOn set\n\nHowe and Lee used Tolkien\u2019s novels and the script to create the concept art for designers and others in the production team to construct costumes, sets and props.\n\n\u201cInstinctively I knew what I thought things should look like, but there was also a lot of revision,\u201d said Howe. He and Lee would draw the images and then redraw after consulting with Jackson.\n\n2012 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Inc.\n\n\u201cSometimes one drawing can be enough to inform an entire team,\u201d said Howe. He blends the mythical names and vocabulary from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit stories into his speech as he talks, so familiar are the concepts to him, they no longer warrant clarification.\n\nIn The Hobbit, Beorn, a warrior who can change into a bear, gives a king, Thorin Oakenshield, and his company of dwarves, shelter in his home.\n\n\u201cFor a set like Beorn\u2019s, there would be the initial drawings which would outline the style and the culture behind it. From then on in I think I did possibly a good hundred drawings of each of the carvings, because they\u2019re all different,\u201d recalls Howe.\n\nHowe had to redesign the outside of Beorn's house even though everything had been built and shot, when Jackson decided it wasn\u2019t \u201cquite grand enough\u201d after seeing the finished construction.\n\nDespite events like this, Howe describes the director as \u201cquite amazing\u201d but \u201ceasy going\u201d. Overall, Howe and Lee created 6,000-7,000 pieces of artwork for The Lord of the Rings and more for The Hobbit films.\n\nInspiration\n\nEnchanting audiences from the hardcore Tolkien fans to the casual cinema-goer was a task that required extensive research on Howe\u2019s behalf.\n\nIt was an undertaking that seemed to click with Howe, as he showed me his study. Rather than a room filled with paintbrushes and sketches, his workspace consists of a computer on a neat desk, surrounded by walls lined floor to ceiling with books, many of them on mythology, ancient iconography and fantasy creatures.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not simply illustrating the text as it is, you\u2019re also trying to bring back in some of the author\u2019s sources \u2026 and the fascinations the author had,\u201d said Howe, looking around at the books.\n\nHe sees Tolkien\u2019s tales as \u201can open door\u201d into the world of myth and saga, such as the \u2018Nibelunglied\u2019 or the Song of the Nibelungs, an epic poem written in Middle High German or medieval narratives of the legend of King Arthur.\n\nTo have done anything less than thoroughly delve into Tolkien\u2019s way of thinking, would have been \u201cultimately quite disappointing\u201d he said thoughtfully.\n\n\n\nThe Swiss connection\n\nIn 1911, when J.R.R.Tolkien was 19 years old he came on a walking tour to Switzerland. Numerous Tolkien experts believe various scenes and locations in the books were based on sights he saw during his time in the country, as does Howe.\n\n\u201cI believe the lonely mountain was inspired by his view over the Matterhorn, and that\u2019s very officially noted in the annotated version of The Hobbit,\u201d said Howe.\n\nHe also lists the alpine resort of Grindelwald as \u201csurely\u201d being his inspiration for Rivendell, and Lake-town as being based on the now disproved concept of Swiss Lake dwellers.\n\nWhen asked if he is someone who goes to visit these places to look for the similarities himself, he admits, referring to himself and his wife \u201cwe\u2019ve never been to Grindelwald actually, which is really shameful isn\u2019t it! So we must go\u201d.\n\nHe pauses in his characteristic style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about taking the time and trouble to place yourself in a certain perspective. There is great value in making a little personal pilgrimage to these places,\u201d said Howe.\n\n\u201cJust imagine this 19-year-old, doing his walking tour of Switzerland before the war \u2026 which he might not have survived, because most of his companions didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter five years away working on the film projects, Howe is now looking forward to getting back to his pencils and paint, and perhaps even visiting some of the Swiss locations he\u2019s become more familiar with than he may realise, through his illustrations.\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative"}, {"url": "https://blog.flametreepublishing.com/fantasy-gothic/john-howe", "page_content": "Dragons don't exist.\n\nThat's a shame, of course. Instead we have to rely on the brilliant work of artists to render these fantastic worlds for us. One hugely important figure in the fantasy art world is the artist John Howe. With a much-loved body of work and perhaps best known for his concept art work on The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series, Howe's career is marked with an array of interesting experiences that have resulted in some truly astonishing fantasy art pieces.\n\nImage source\n\n\"Illustration is a proposition, a spontaneous exploration not only of the theme to hand, but also the deeper currents that make imagery necessary.\"\n\nHowe was born isbut educated in France, and after completing his degree in Strasbourg he then went on to study at the\n\nWhilst grateful for the opportunity to study at excellent schools, Howe concedes that his understanding was at odds with his limited language ability. Regardless, he was always drawing. After learning to sketch with his mother's help, a young Howe quickly grew frustrated by what he considered to be his limited ability. He had always endeavoured to be better and had seemingly harnessed this impulse to constantly improve his illustrations. After being muscled out of over-booked art classes in school, Howe instead found ways to apply his artistic talents in other places. In biology class he would draw images of microscopic creatures \u2013 renderings that his classmates struggled with \u2013 and would give these drawings to them, for a small fee that is. However, now because of his success, fifty cents for an original John Howe is a steal!\n\nThat said, Howe says that anything that was not passed on to others is not likely to have survived up to today. Constantly looking to improve his sketches, he says that he would go over them so many times that eventually there would be nothing left at all, forcing him to start something new. Howe paints a picture of a boy who feels pressure and concern that he is not good enough to succeed. One form of solace Howe did find, however, was in books. Most notably was his reading of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series, a work that would have a profound influence on the rest of his life and career.\n\nHowe has a confession regarding these titles though. Due to The Fellowship of the Ring being constantly checked out of the library, he instead opted to skip it and start with the perennially available The Two Towers instead. He naturally followed that with The Return of the King, before finally circling back and reading the first instalment last.\n\nHe admits this may not have been the best choice but makes it clear that he has since re-read the series, this time in the correct sequence. This was probably essential, especially since his appointment (alongside Alan Lee) as a concept artist for Peter Jackson's film trilogy.\n\nThis is Howe's most high-profile appointment to date, allowing him to work on a fictional world he had been enamoured with since boyhood. When the production for The Hobbit film trilogy began, Howe was once again brought on board to detail Tolkien's Middle Earth.\n\nHe has also worked on other big series, such as the movie adaptation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; a limited edition cover for George R. R. Martin's A Clash of Kings; as well as illustrations for the hugely popular card game Magic: The Gathering.\n\nBut like any artist, Howe should not be reduced simply to his work on pre-established franchises. Drawing from a wide range of influences across world mythology, Howe has steadily built up an impressive portfolio of images. His work has involved interpreting tales from classics such as Beowulf, as well as creating jaw-dropping worlds built purely from his powerful imagination. Click here to browse all 2478 images in his online portfolio.\n\nA recurring point of interest for Howe has always been dragons. Appearing across a wide selection of canons and subject to a vast array of interpretation, dragon art is something that Howe has long expressed a love for.\n\n\"They span the spectrum from devilry to divinity, from blackest evil to boundless good. They come in all configurations, they speak or they make our minds reel with the power of their thoughts, they squat athwart hoards of treasure untold. They are story. They are dragons.\"\n\n\n\nWe were over the moon when Howe agreed to write the foreword for our book Dragon Art. Covering the appearance of dragons through the course of time and how their representation differs across cultures, there is no better expert to speak on the subject than Howe. Building upon his stellar introduction we were able to craft a book packed with curated images of the highest quality, depicting all sorts of incredible dragon images. Available in print or as an iBook, we're proud to have made a book that Howe himself approves of.

Tolkien's Middle-earthFor other people with the same name, see John Howe.\n\nJohn Howe (born August 21, 1957) is a Canadian book illustrator and conceptual designer, best-known for his artwork of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. One year after graduating from high school, he studied in a college in Strasbourg, France, then at the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs in the same town.\n\nHowe and Tolkien artist Alan Lee served as chief conceptual designers for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. Howe illustrated the Lord of the Rings board game created by Reiner Knizia, and re-illustrated the maps of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion in 1996\u20132003. His work includes images of mythological material such as the Old English epic poem Beowulf (including Knizia's board game Beowulf: The Legend). Howe illustrated many books in the fantasy genre, such as those by Robin Hobb. He also contributed to the film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia. In 2005 a limited edition of George R. R. Martin's novel A Clash of Kings was released by Meisha Merlin, with numerous illustrations by Howe.\n\nHowe has illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game.\n\nFor The Hobbit films, original director Guillermo del Toro and replacement director Peter Jackson consulted with both Howe and fellow conceptual artist Alan Lee to ensure continuity of design.\n\nHowe is a member of the living history group the Company of Saynt George, and has expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments.\n\nHowe also served as a conceptual designer for Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which premiered on Prime Video on September 2, 2022.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art cl*es full, and left him in cl*es like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology cl* though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for cl*mates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got \"a real spark\" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.\n\nWith Alexis Metzinger during filming John Howe in Strasbourg\n\nA year after his high school graduation, Howe moved to Strasbourg, France to attend college. The following year, he enrolled into the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:\n\nThe first year was spent not understanding much, the second at odds with what I did manage to understand, and the third eager to get out, although in retrospect I certainly owe whatever clarity of thought I possess to the patience of the professor of Illustration.\n\nThroughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was \"simultaneously ancient and novel.\" He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his \"The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-d\u00fbr\", a piece inspired by Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of \"his\" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.\n\nProjects in which Howe worked include The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, Beowulf, Robin Hobb's books, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Cards for Magic: The Gathering, The Hobbit, Pan's Labyrinth. Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.\n\nSelected works\n\nThe Fisherman & His Wife , transl. from Brothers Grimm (Mankato, Minnesota: Creative Education, 1983).
