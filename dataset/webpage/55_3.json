{"Steve Ridzik was a software engineer at Microsoft in the early 1990s.": [{"url": "https://news.microsoft.com/features/the-engineers-engineer-computer-industry-luminaries-salute-dave-cutlers-five-decade-long-quest-for-quality/", "page_content": "The technology industry is still young, but its history is already rich with myths and legends.\n\nThe biggest myth is about how invention actually occurs \u2013 the notion of that \u201caha\u201d\u2019 singular, magical moment leading to inevitable success. The reality, as Malcolm Gladwell made clear in his New Yorker Creation Myth article several years ago, is that invention is more ponderous, with one idea building on another.\n\nWithin the technology industry, this cycle of invention is captured in eras, from mainframe and mini, to PC, Internet, mobile and the cloud. Most within the industry move from wave to wave, hoping to catch each successive one at just the right time.\n\nThen there are the wave makers. The giants on whose shoulders the industry stands. Dave Cutler is a wave maker, with a broad set of shoulders.\n\nCutler, a Microsoft Senior Technical Fellow whose impressive body of work spans five decades and two coasts, will be honored Saturday evening as a Computer History Museum Fellow, along with Lee Felsenstein, the designer of the Osborne 1, the first mass-produced portable computer; and Philip Moorby, one of the inventors of the Verilog hardware description language. They join other wave makers such as Alan Kay, Vinton Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee in the museum\u2019s Hall of Fellows.\n\n\u201cThe Fellow awards recognize people who\u2019ve had a tremendous impact on our lives, on our culture, on the way we work, exchange information and live. And yet, having had such a profound impact, they\u2019re mostly unknown,\u201d said John Hollar, the museum\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cPeople like Dave Cutler, who probably influences the computing experiences of more than 2 billion people, yet isn\u2019t known in a way he deserves to be, in proportion to the impact he\u2019s had on the world.\u201d\n\nCutler, 74, who still comes to his office each day on Microsoft\u2019s sprawling Redmond, Washington, campus, has shaped entire eras: from his work developing the VMS operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation in the late \u201870s, his central role in the development of Windows NT \u2013 the basis for all major versions of Windows since 1993 \u2013 to his more recent experiences in developing the Microsoft Azure cloud operating system and the hypervisor for Xbox One that allows the console to be more than just for gaming.\n\nSteve Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s former CEO, is a fellow Michigan native, friend and golfing buddy. In his view, there isn\u2019t another engineer who\u2019s had a greater impact on the history of computing than Cutler. \u201cThere have been incredible visionaries who also made an impact, but not from the engineer\u2019s seat,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cI\u2019ve never met another engineering leader with the same versatility, leadership and technical talents.\u201d\n\nRay Ozzie, Microsoft\u2019s former chief software architect, first met Cutler in the late \u201870s when he was a software engineer at Data General, a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) competitor. He considers Cutler one of the industry\u2019s most preeminent and prolific engineers.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which Dave has advanced the computing industry and advanced business can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Ozzie said. \u201cDave\u2019s groundbreaking work on VMS enabled DEC\u2019s VAX to become the category killer in the era of the 32-bit supermini. When the PC itself then transitioned to 32 bits from 16, Dave\u2019s work on NT was directly responsible for enabling Windows to yet again be the category killer. And as the computing world shifted from servers to services, Dave\u2019s work on Azure was key to enabling Microsoft\u2019s transformation to one of the world\u2019s top providers of cloud computing infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNathan Myhrvold, former chief strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft, considers Cutler one of the greatest systems programmers of all time. \u201cWriting hard-core systems software down in the bowels is a very specialized thing. For every systems programmer there are a thousand applications programmers who program on top of it. Dave\u2019s just one of the greats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one technical person who\u2019s indispensable in the history of modern Windows, it\u2019s Dave,\u201d said Terry Myerson, executive vice president, Windows and Devices Group.\n\nCutler is a doer, not a talker. One of his favorite idioms is: \u201cWhen all is said and done, much more is said than done.\u201d So perhaps it\u2019s best to have others put into perspective the impact he\u2019s had on the computing experiences of billions of individuals and hundreds of thousands of businesses worldwide.\n\nThe Massachusetts miracle\n\nIn 1976, DEC was the darling of the technology industry. It and other competitors, like Data General and Prime Computer along the Massachusetts Route 128 corridor, ruled the computing landscape.\n\nBut Gordon Bell, the company\u2019s top engineering executive, was concerned. Sales of the company\u2019s flagship product, its 16-bit PDP-11, were stagnating and rival IBM was on the verge of releasing its first minicomputer.\n\nBell\u2019s response: Change the playing field by introducing a new, 32-bit super-minicomputer line of systems called the VAX with a new operating system that would be backward compatible with the company\u2019s PDP-11 programs.\n\nBell asked a 33-year-old engineer, who had joined the company four years earlier and made a name for himself by developing real-time operating systems for the PDP-11, to lead development of the VMS operating system. Forty-one years ago this month, Cutler and four other senior engineers launched the VMS project; Cutler was the senior programmer.\n\nBell, a founding trustee of the Computer History Museum who himself was named a Computer History Museum Fellow in 2003, said he chose Cutler to lead the development of VMS because \u201cwe both had the same goals and competitive urges \u2026 Dave is the ultimate competitor. He really wants to win.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the first VAX superminis emerged from DEC\u2019s manufacturing plants and the VAX quickly gained a leadership position in the market. Bell would come to call Cutler \u201cthe best writer of operating systems in the world.\u201d\n\nBurton Smith is perhaps the best-known parallel computing designer and a Microsoft Technical Fellow. In the late \u201870s, he was working for a high-performance computing company and had the opportunity to meet Richard MacNeal, a founder of MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation, now MCS Software, the company that developed NASTRAN, a finite element analysis program.\n\n\u201cDick took me over to this computer and said, \u2018Look at this.\u2019 It was a VAX 11/780 running NASTRAN,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNormally running NASTRAN on a new computer exposes bazillions of bugs and takes years to perfect. I said \u2018How hard was this thing to bring up?\u2019 He said, \u2018Oh, it was a piece of cake. We just put it on there, compiled it and it started running.\u2019 The impact of the VAX on the world had a lot to do with the fact that it was bulletproof. It was robust. It really worked as advertised. That was Dave\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nWhile Cutler\u2019s operating systems work on the PDP 11 and VAX are legendary, Bell is quick to add that the dynamic range of Cutler\u2019s work at DEC is often overlooked. He cites three examples:\n\nThe PL/1 compiler that included a backend runtime that ultimately hosted several other DEC languages (Cutler and others wrote a book on the work, \u201cEngineering a Compiler\u201d)\n\nThe MicroVAX I architecture that Cutler helped design\n\nThe DecCommand Language \u201cthat was really loved by all VAX users\u201d\n\nIn 1982, Cutler met with Bell and announced he intended to leave DEC to form a company with a scientist from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. After meeting with Cutler and his cofounder, Bell made a counter offer, knowing how frustrated Cutler had become with the growing bureaucracy at the company\u2019s headquarters at a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts.\n\nBell told him, \u201cGo anywhere you want to go, take anyone with you that you want, and do anything you want to do.\u201d DECWest was born.\n\nCutler decided to locate his new operations more than 3,000 miles from DEC\u2019s headquarters: in Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle and not far from Microsoft. Len Kawell was one of the young engineers who followed Cutler to set up operations there. \u201cOne day, Dave called me into his office and said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m opening a new office in Seattle. You want to come with us?\u2019 So I came out to Seattle in early \u201980. We were originally just going to do a new real-time operating system for the VAX, but we ended up creating the MicroVAX and an operating system called VAXeln, which was a real-time operating system. Dave got into hardware at that point, actually designing the silicon, so Roger [Heinen] and I took over the software.\u201d\n\nOne of the things that separates Cutler from other engineers, Kawell said, is his understanding of hardware. \u201cDave understands hardware like no one else I\u2019ve ever worked with. A lot of people think in high-level language. Dave thinks in actually the registers and instructions of the machine. When we did the MicroVAX I, Dave wrote the microcode [a layer of hardware-level instructions] for the machine.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Cutler left DEC when his team\u2019s Prism project, with its new Mica operating system, was killed.\n\nBell had first introduced Cutler to Bill Gates in 1983. Now, five years later, Cutler would join Microsoft to develop a new portable operating system, and create a new wave.\n\nRaising Windows\n\nRob Short had worked for DECWest since 1982. After DEC cancelled the Prism project, Cutler, two more business-oriented colleagues and he thought they might start a new company.\n\n\u201cBut then Dave got a call from Bill Gates,\u201d Short said. \u201cThat kind of freaked us out because we didn\u2019t really have a high opinion of Microsoft at that point.\u201d That meeting led to a follow-up meeting with Gates, Ballmer and Myhrvold.\n\n\u201cWe had a fascinating conversation about where the industry was going,\u201d Short added. \u201cAt one stage, I remember saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually going to happen in the hardware world.\u2019 And Bill said, \u2018It\u2019s not what we think is going to happen, it\u2019s how we\u2019re going to shape the industry.\u2019 I had never met anyone who thought that way before.\u201d\n\nThe courtship continued when Ballmer visited Cutler\u2019s home one evening. \u201cSteve came over to Dave\u2019s house and when he left we looked at each other and said, \u2018This is a different animal entirely. This is an interesting crowd of people.\u2019\u201d\n\nLater that month, on Oct. 31, 1988, Cutler started at Microsoft. Short and other members of the DEC West team (five with software expertise, six with hardware) would soon follow. They provided their notices to DEC on a Friday and started the following Monday, recalled Darryl Havens, who would write the input-output system for NT.\n\nThe small, high-powered team of former DEC engineers and one existing Microsoft employee (Steve Wood) began by spending six months creating a specification for the operating system \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 the specification that now resides in the Smithsonian Institute.\n\n\u201cIf you spend that amount of time designing something and you have a spec that gives you every single API [application programming interface], what its inputs are, what its outputs are, you pretty much know how the thing is going to work,\u201d Havens said. \u201cSo I actually typed in the code for the entire I/O system in three weeks. That\u2019s how well-designed it was. By the time I sat down to write the code, I already pretty much knew how it was going to work.\u201d\n\nThe team started coding in earnest in April 1989, working double-digit hours six or seven days a week. The main goal: produce a portable operating system that could run on architectures other than Intel\u2019s x86 chips and take advantage of the increased address space offered by nascent 32-bit microprocessors. RISC architectures were popular at the time and promised better performance than the x86. IBM and Microsoft had been cooperating on an operating system called OS/2, but it was a 16-bit operating system that ran only on Intel hardware and wasn\u2019t portable.\n\nThe goals for the NT operating system were challenging and ambitious. The team had to make it:\n\nPortable and available on multiple targets (MIPS, Alpha, PowerPc, x64)\n\nPossible to run on multiple operating systems (POSIX (Unix), OS/2 and Windows 32\n\nSecure and C2 certified (a trusted computer certification)\n\nRun on systems with multiple processors (unique to the PC industry at the time) and capable of running multiple programs at one time, again unique to the PC segment\n\nOne of the toughest challenges was testing the system. Early on, the team decided it didn\u2019t have the resources necessary to write a comprehensive test suite. Instead, they opted for a dynamic stress system, which put a severe load on the overall system. Every night the team ran stress tests on hundreds of machines. The next morning the team would arrive at the office, triage the failures and identify the bugs for the daily 9 a.m. bug-review meeting.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of very clever science and brute force and not being afraid of large numbers,\u201d Short said. \u201cThere might be a thousand failures. So what are we going to do? Well, we started with one of them, looked at it and \u2026 Dave isn\u2019t afraid of slogging through.\u201d\n\nThe playing field kept shifting as well.\n\nAt first, the team was going to target the expanded OS/2 32-bit API as the main \u201cpersonality\u201d of the system, but later they changed to Windows 32 when Windows 3.1 proved to be so popular (16 million copies sold in six months). As a result, the team had to expand the Windows 16 API to a Windows 32 API and redesign the entire graphics subsystem. The team also had to hit the reset button on hardware when it changed its initial hardware target from the Intel i860 XR RISC processor to the MIPS R3000.\n\nAnother particularly vexing problem was getting DOS and Windows 16 applications to run in the new 32-bit environment.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to write a modern operating system from scratch,\u201d Myhrvold said. \u201cWe also wanted to have some level of backward compatibility with previous systems and that\u2019s where everything was difficult. But we came up with a variety of methods to do it, some in my group, some in Dave\u2019s \u2026 It\u2019s always hard to have backward compatibility when you\u2019re doing something brand new and you\u2019d love to throw the whole past out. But for customers it\u2019s really important to have that bridge to the past. Figuring out how we could do that so that existing Windows applications could get moved over and run on NT was pretty important.\u201d\n\nMyhrvold recalls that the teams had a strategy for handling DOS apps, but Windows apps presented a greater challenge. \u201cBut we made it work,\u201d Myhrvold said. \u201cWithout that, I don\u2019t think there would have been much of a future for Microsoft.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Dave and team accomplished was an almost impossible design challenge,\u201d said Ed Lazowska, the Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington.\n\nBell believes Cutler is the only engineer with the confidence to pull off NT as he did. \u201cAlmost anyone who would have been good enough to do NT would have insisted on a blank sheet for the spec,\u201d Bell said. \u201cDave appreciates legacy and compatibility. The world is better off because Dave Cutler went to Microsoft and built NT for a much larger market.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, when the project first began, the team comprised about 20 engineers. By the time the first version of Windows NT shipped five years later, the team had expanded to about 150 engineers as it battled constraints and tradeoffs.\n\nWindows NT 3.1 shipped on July 27, 1993. The team was exhausted, but exhilarated.\n\n\u201cPeople work for Dave because they know the project is going to succeed,\u201d Short said. \u201cDave is intense. He can be crude and demanding at times, but that\u2019s actually a small piece of him. He\u2019s actually very good at motivating people . . . . If you\u2019re an engineer, you want to work on a project that you think is useful. You want to think that the project will succeed and that your individual effort will make a difference. When you worked for Dave, you were in a project like that.\u201d\n\nPart of Cutler\u2019s secret sauce is that he inspires a loyal crew around him, Myhrvold said. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a character\u2026Did you see the movie \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d? There is a whole genre of old World War II military movies about this great commander who has this loyal set of guys and Quentin Tarantino updated it. When I saw the movie I said, \u2018Hey, this is Dave,\u2019 Myhrvold said, laughing. \u201cThere are probably worse things than comparing a man to Brad Pitt.\u201d\n\nCutler stopped managing the entire NT project in 1996, but continued to lead the kernel development until 2006. In March 2005, he completed one of his \u201cmost gratifying pieces of work\u201d at Microsoft when, partnering with AMD, he helped develop the AMD64 architecture (64-bit extensions to the 32-bit x86 architecture) and led the effort to ship the first two x64 64-bit Windows systems (workstation and server). At the time, some questioned why Microsoft developed a 64-bit system; today most computers are 64-bit systems and even our phones will soon have a 64-bit operating system.\n\nIn 2008, Cutler was honored at a White House ceremony as one of the nation\u2019s National Medal of Technology and Innovation Laureates. In support of Cutler\u2019s nomination for the award, Bill Gates provided evidence of just how hard the task had been:\n\n\u201c\u2026 NT is unique because it lives within the constraints of ill-defined hardware, while providing a runtime environment for the myriad of legacy applications that ran on the loosely defined PC Windows operating systems of the early 1990s. Unlike other systems, he built a compatible, yet many-way scalable system that hosted multiple environments. Dave was the principal designer of the layering structure that ensured only a few components needed to be changed to run on either a different instruction-set architecture or on machines with radically different hardware and input/output subsystems. In 1989, NT was originally designed to be OS/2 and POSIX compatible. The Windows subsystem was added without core design changes. NT runs on a range of systems from gas pumps to 64-CPU 64-bit systems with more than a terabyte of memory, including clusters. With the introduction of Windows XP in 2001, it became the basis for all Microsoft PC-based operating systems.\u201d\n\nBallmer\u2019s viewpoint is more succinct: \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be a Microsoft today without Dave.\u201d\n\nMoving to the cloud\n\nIn 2006, Amitabh Srivastava was a corporate vice president in Microsoft\u2019s Windows division, working on redefining the organization\u2019s engineering processes. Ozzie had recently been named the company\u2019s chief software architect and the two had their first meeting one late afternoon in Building 34 on Microsoft\u2019s campus.\n\nSrivastava has always had a rule: If he\u2019s in town, he never misses dinner at home with his family \u2013 or if he needs to, he tells his family he\u2019ll be late. That evening, Srivastava lost track of time. He missed dinner and never called home to say he\u2019d be late. The one-hour meeting began at 4 p.m. and went until 8 p.m.\n\n\u201cBy the end of that meeting, I was convinced software wouldn\u2019t be shipped as it had been. My personal realization was, \u2018I\u2019m working on the wrong thing,\u2019\u201d Srivastava recalled.\n\nAt the time, Srivastava\u2019s office was across from Cutler\u2019s, and the two often got to the office early. Soon after the meeting with Ozzie, Srivastava recalls telling Cutler, \u201cI don\u2019t know what needs to be done, but I know there\u2019s something changing dramatically and we\u2019ve got to rethink our approach.\u201d\n\nAfter a few more weeks of discussions, Srivastava knew Microsoft needed to build an operating system for the cloud, and he identified his first task: Recruit Cutler.\n\n\u201cSo I go to Dave and he says \u2018I think I\u2019m ready to retire,\u2019\u201d Srivastava said. \u201cI said, \u2018Dave, not quite. This is different. This could change the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nCutler didn\u2019t say yes to Srivastava, but he also didn\u2019t say no. \u201cI had worked with Dave long enough to know that when he didn\u2019t say no right away, that was a good sign.\u201d\n\nSrivastava developed a plan for Cutler and him to visit every team at Microsoft running a cloud service, from MSN and Hotmail to Xbox Live and the company\u2019s cloud data centers. \u201cThis is the same guy who won\u2019t go to meetings. Dave went to every meeting.\u201d\n\nThe due diligence process took a few months as Cutler and Srivastava listened to the pain points and band-aid approaches teams had taken to keep their cloud services running. After the tour, Cutler and Srivastava never had a formal discussion about him joining the team. Cutler was on board.\n\n\u201cWe never had a problem recruiting,\u201d Srivastava said. \u201cOnce Dave was there, the Red Dog (the project\u2019s code name) team was the one everyone wanted to work on.\u201d\n\nCutler\u2019s role was to develop the hypervisor for the cloud operating system. \u201cDave wrote the hypervisor; it\u2019s probably the most efficient you could think of. It was completely optimized. We knew that any part Dave wrote would be the best,\u201d Srivastava said. \u201cDave\u2019s just a phenomenal guy. He\u2019s brilliant. His work ethic is amazing. And he has a very high bar for quality; Dave doesn\u2019t cut corners.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, on Oct. 27, 2008, Ozzie stood on stage at the company\u2019s Professional Developer\u2019s Conference in Los Angeles and announced a technology preview of Windows Azure (now Microsoft Azure).\n\n\u201c\u2026 Amitabh, Dave and their team have been working for a few years now on our own platform for computing in the cloud,\u201d Ozzie said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to be the foundation, the bedrock underneath all of Microsoft\u2019s service offerings for consumers and business alike, and it\u2019s designed to be ultimately the foundation for yours as well. And so I\u2019d like to announce a new service in the cloud, Windows Azure.\u201d\n\nSrivastava followed Ozzie on stage, wearing his Red Dog sneakers, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to finally discuss Windows Azure, our Project Red Dog that Dave Cutler and I have been leading quietly for some time. Dave is a kernel guy and what you have there is the kernel of the Microsoft Cloud Platform. Kernels don\u2019t demo well. They don\u2019t have the glitz, or the glitter, but a good one allows others to create killer apps, and that\u2019s exactly what we have done. We have built a platform to allow you to build your killer apps.\u201d\n\nEight years later, Microsoft Azure plays a significant role in Microsoft\u2019s cloud business. At the company\u2019s most recent developer conference in San Francisco, Scott Guthrie, the company\u2019s executive vice president of its Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group, told developers Microsoft\u2019s cloud now manages more than 1 million servers within 30 unique Azure regions around the world. \u201cTo put that in perspective,\u201d Guthrie said, \u201cthat\u2019s more locations than Google and AWS combined.\u201d\n\nAfter the conference, financial analysts for Sanford Bernstein wrote an investor report with the headline: \u201cQuick Take \u2013 The Microsoft Build Developer Conference \u2013 All Roads Lead to Azure?\u201d Within the report the analysts said, \u201cAzure is increasingly the center of all of Microsoft\u2019s development and product strategies. After numerous conversations at the Build 2016 Conference, we\u2019re feeling even more confident in the Azure opportunity and the potential that Azure could grow very fast for an extended period of time.\u201d\n\nSeparating the best from the rest\n\nIn 2011, Boyd Multerer, the then-director of development for Xbox One, had a problem. Multerer, who helped create Xbox Live, the gaming and entertainment service, and the father of the popular XNA video game programming language, had decided with his team that Xbox One needed a virtual machine if both games and apps were going to run on the console.\n\nThe initial thinking was that it might be too hard to work.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure we could do it,\u201d Multerer recalls. \u201cWe knew we would need someone really special to pull it off. So we asked ourselves, \u2018Well, do we know anyone who could do this type of specialized work\u2019 and Dave\u2019s name was about the only one that came up. He\u2019s got that depth of knowledge at the bottom of the operating system \u2013 how it interfaces with the hardware, how you build virtual machines. All that experience was there, but he\u2019s legendary and intimidating, so we figured there\u2019s no way we\u2019d ever get him to join our team.\u201d\n\nHoi Vo, a distinguished engineer on Multerer\u2019s development team, knew Cutler, having worked with him on Microsoft Azure. He helped broker a meeting for Multerer, Cutler and himself in a \u201cneutral\u201d building on Microsoft\u2019s campus, away from both the Xbox and Azure teams.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the scariest meeting of my life,\u201d Multerer said, \u201cjust the anticipation of it.\u201d\n\nMulterer and Vo walked Cutler through their plans for Xbox One. Cutler sat silently through the entire meeting, never asking a question. When the meeting was over Multerer recalls thinking, \u201cOK, I have no idea how that just went.\u201d\n\nA couple days later, Cutler communicated to Multerer and Vo that he wanted to learn more. Soon they set up a second meeting with the team\u2019s distinguished and senior engineers. The team was \u201cscared to death,\u201d Multerer recalls. In the meeting, each engineer explained what she or he was doing, talking about the importance of performance, predictability and robustness.\n\nSoon after, and a few months before his 70th birthday, Cutler joined the team. He soon \u201cset the bar for how hard people should work and how high they should hold the quality bar,\u201d Multerer said. Two years later, on Nov. 22, 2013, Xbox One shipped in North America.\n\n\u201cDave designed and wrote the hypervisor for Xbox One,\u201d Multerer said, with an obvious sense of awe. \u201cHe wrote the entire bottom of the stack. Because the hypervisor is there, Xbox games can run on Windows. That\u2019s why apps run on Xbox One. The impact of that work is phenomenal. And the amount of work he did was phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHaving the opportunity to see Cutler work as an individual contributor, collaborating closely with a small number of other engineers on his team, Multerer got an opportunity to see what separates the best from the rest.\n\n\u201cDave fits a pattern that I\u2019ve seen from the very best software engineers,\u201d Multerer said. \u201cThey have similar traits, one of them is you hold quality extremely high. The best engineers like Dave are fanatical about quality. That means they write a lot of test code. They ensure that the code they write works. That\u2019s what they hang their pride and reputation on. Most software engineers measure their success in terms of volume of code. The greats like Dave measure themselves in terms of quality of code \u2013 small amounts of quality, tuned, performant, robust code that doesn\u2019t crash \u2026 It\u2019s that fanatical embodiment of code quality that separates Dave from the rest. He just won\u2019t accept anything less, from himself or others.\u201d\n\nMulterer laughs, recalling a story to make his point. Jon Lange, who wrote the memory manager for Xbox One and worked closely with Cutler, was bouncing around the office one day, obviously extremely pleased. \u201cI think it was one of the happiest days of his life,\u201d Multerer said. \u201cHe found a bug in Dave\u2019s code and Dave said \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re right. We need to fix that.\u2019 That made Jon\u2019s day.\u201d\n\nCode warrior\n\nValerie Chen is an 18-year-old high school senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. On a recent Saturday in March, she and three other high school seniors were in Seattle, being honored at the Living Computer Museum.\n\nClick here to load media\n\nChen, Matthew Edwards from Blacksburg High School in Blacksburg, Virginia, Karthik Rao from Briarcliff High School in Briarcliff Manor, New York, and Cherry Zou from Poolesville High School in Poolesville, Maryland, became the first recipients of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) Cutler-Bell Prize in high school computing, funded by a $1 million endowment established by Cutler and Bell. Each winner received a $10,000 prize.\n\nThe four students presented their projects to Bell, Cutler and Jeannette Wing, a Microsoft corporate vice president of research, among others from ACM and CSTA.\n\nChen, who will be attending Yale in the fall as a computer science major, loved the fact that Cutler, Bell and Wing toured the museum with them, showing the students artifacts of systems they had actually built. \u201cThat was really amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really great that when we presented our projects to them they understood and appreciated the work. It felt really good to have someone recognize our work.\u201d\n\nIn return, the students provided Cutler and Bell some advice on how they could better use social media to publicize the prize among high school students.\n\nThere certainly are more computing waves to come; Bell and Cutler want to ensure that the next generation of engineers is prepared to make and ride the waves.\n\n\u201cGordon and I wanted to start something at the high school level that would focus on getting more students interested in computer science early,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cThis year\u2019s recipients were outstanding. Our hope is that other institutions and companies will see the merit of this approach and donate funds to further the scope of the awards. The initial recipients of the award reinforced our conviction that this is a very effective way to foster the advancement of computer science.\u201d\n\nThe Cutler-Bell award might encourage future generations of engineers to pursue opportunities in augmented reality or quantum computing, but Cutler already has impacted generations of engineers, Ozzie insists.\n\n\u201cOne of Dave\u2019s unspoken contributions is that he has created generations of incredibly strong engineers, simply as a side-effect of being who he is and doing what he does,\u201d Ozzie said. \u201cSpeaking from personal experience from back in the \u201870s and \u201880s, those who worked for him \u2013 such as Tim Halvorsen and Len Kawell, my cofounders in the startup that created Lotus Notes \u2013 were taught a very specific engineering rigor. They learned about coding and commenting conventions, source code and project organization conventions, and so much more. There was only one way to do things \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018optimally,\u2019 and it was intensely rigorous. He taught them. They taught me. I taught others. Generations have learned rigorous methodology, and have become far better engineers, even without having directly worked with him.\n\n\u201cThe companies and products he benefited will come and go,\u201d Ozzie added, \u201cbut the culture of engineering excellence that he created, above all, is his lasting legacy.\u201d\n\nBell won\u2019t be able to join his friend of more than 40 years at Saturday evening\u2019s event at the computer museum. He\u2019s traveling. Asked what his toast to Dave would be if he could be there, Bell responds: \u201cHey Dave, just keep on keeping on.\u201d\n\nCutler intends to do just that. On Monday morning, he\u2019ll be back at his Studio A office at Microsoft, because he\u2019s a thinker doer, not a talker.\n\nHis advice for Valerie, Cherry, Matthew, Karthik and forthcoming generations of software engineers?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a great believer in Fred Brooks\u2019s taxonomy of people,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cHe said in his book, \u201cThe Mythical Man Month,\u201d that there are thinkers, doers and thinker doers. Thinkers are a dime a dozen. Anyone can think and profess great ideas. Doers are more valuable because they do things and get things done. The most valuable, however, are the thinker doers. They think and they do!\n\n\u201cMuch of my success belongs to the people I have worked with,\u201d Cutler added. \u201cEvery project I have worked on has been filled with industry-leading software and hardware engineers. My part in relation to theirs has been quite small.\n\n\u201cBut I have always strived to be a thinker doer,\u201d Cutler continued. \u201cI have a couple of sayings that are pertinent. The first is: \u2018Successful people do what unsuccessful people won\u2019t.\u2019 The second is: \u2018If you don\u2019t put them [bugs] in, you don\u2019t have to take them out.\u2019 I am a person that wants to do the work. I don\u2019t want to just think about it and let someone else do it. When presented with a programming problem, I formulate an appropriate solution and then proceed to write the code. While writing the code, I continually mentally execute the code in my head in an attempt to flush out any bugs. I am a great believer in incremental implementation, where a piece of the solution is done, verified to work properly, and then move on to the next piece. In my case, this leads to faster implementation with fewer bugs. Quality is my No. 1 constraint \u2013 always. I don\u2019t want to produce any code that has bugs \u2013 none.\n\n\u201cSo my advice is be a thinker doer,\u201d Cutler concluded. \u201cFocus on the problem to solve and give it your undivided attention and effort. Produce high-quality work that is secure.\u201d\n\nWords to live by from a man who, when all is said and done, has done more than he\u2019s said.\n\nRelated:\n\nClick here to load media\n\nWatch a short summary of Dave Cutler\u2019s contributions to computing.

But what about the rest, many of whom became millionaires in their own right?\n\nIn the wake of Paul Allen's untimely death at age 65 in October 2018, we thought it would be a good time to take another look back.\n\nThis is an update of a post originally written by Jay Yarow in 2011."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates", "page_content": "spouse Melinda Gates ...(Show more)\n\nBill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), American computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world\u2019s largest personal-computer software company.\n\nGates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school\u2019s payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments. In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers. They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers. With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. Gates\u2019s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation\u2014then the world\u2019s biggest computer supplier and industry pacesetter\u2014for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer). After the machine\u2019s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out competing operating systems. While Microsoft\u2019s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software. Makers of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software. By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry\u2019s ultimate kingmaker.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Technology Quiz\n\nLargely on the strength of Microsoft\u2019s success, Gates amassed a huge paper fortune as the company\u2019s largest individual shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a decade his net worth had reached into the tens of billions of dollars\u2014making him by some estimates the world\u2019s richest private individual. With few interests beyond software and the potential of information technology, Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye, handling civic and philanthropic affairs indirectly through one of his foundations. Nevertheless, as Microsoft\u2019s power and reputation grew, and especially as it attracted the attention of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Gates, with some reluctance, became a more public figure. Rivals (particularly in competing companies in Silicon Valley) portrayed him as driven, duplicitous, and determined to profit from virtually every electronic transaction in the world. His supporters, on the other hand, celebrated his uncanny business acumen, his flexibility, and his boundless appetite for finding new ways to make computers and electronics more useful through software.\n\nAll of these qualities were evident in Gates\u2019s nimble response to the sudden public interest in the Internet. Beginning in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the development of consumer and enterprise software solutions for the Internet, developed the Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer devices such as home televisions and personal digital assistants, created the Microsoft Network to compete with America Online and other Internet providers, and, through Gates\u2019s company Corbis, acquired the huge Bettmann photo archives and other collections for use in electronic distribution.\n\nIn addition to his work at Microsoft, Gates was also known for his charitable work. With his then wife, Melinda, he launched the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) in 1994 to fund global health programs as well as projects in the Pacific Northwest. During the latter part of the 1990s, the couple also funded North American libraries through the Gates Library Foundation (renamed Gates Learning Foundation in 1999) and raised money for minority study grants through the Gates Millennium Scholars program. In June 2006 Warren Buffett announced an ongoing gift to the foundation, which would allow its assets to total roughly $60 billion in the next 20 years. At the beginning of the 21st century, the foundation continued to focus on global health and global development, as well as community and education causes in the United States. After a short transition period, Gates relinquished day-to-day oversight of Microsoft in June 2008\u2014although he remained chairman of the board\u2014in order to devote more time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In February 2014 he stepped down as chairman but continued to serve as a board member until 2020. During this time he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016). The documentary series Inside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates appeared in 2019. Two years later Gates and his wife divorced.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Gates\u2019s extraordinary success will guarantee him a lasting place in the pantheon of great Americans. At the very least, historians seem likely to view him as a business figure as important to computers as John D. Rockefeller was to oil. Gates himself displayed an acute awareness of the perils of prosperity in his 1995 best seller, The Road Ahead, where he observed, \u201cSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can\u2019t lose.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://en.unionpedia.org/i/Steve_Ridzik", "page_content": "Steve Ridzik Stephen George Ridzik (April 29, 1929 \u2013 January 8, 2008) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1950 to 1966, primarily the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators.

In 1953, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1955, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 draft.\n\nRidzik pitched for the Giants from 1957 to 1958 appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a major league game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League.\n\nRidzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1963 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1966, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career.\n\nAfter life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington, D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players.

He won 39 games and had a lifetime 3.79 earned run average over 12 major league seasons that included stops with the Washington Senators, the New York Giants and the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nAfter baseball, Ridzik worked for a military food distributor in the Washington, D.C., area before moving to Florida in the late 1980s. He helped organize charity events featuring former major league players in Florida and helped former Senators teammate Chuck Hinton establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association.\n\nIn addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, a brother and sister, and four grandchildren.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2008 by The Associated Press\n\nThis story is from ESPN.com's automated news wire.
