{"Thomas Clayton Wolfe's books were written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Wolfe", "page_content": "Thomas Wolfe, in full Thomas Clayton Wolfe, (born Oct. 3, 1900, Asheville, N.C., U.S.\u2014died Sept. 15, 1938, Baltimore, Md.), American writer best known for his first book, Look Homeward, Angel (1929), and his other autobiographical novels.\n\nHis father, William Oliver Wolfe, the Oliver Gant of his novels, was a stonecutter, while his mother, Julia Elizabeth Westall Wolfe, the Eliza of the early novels, owned a successful boardinghouse in Asheville, N.C., where Wolfe grew up. He was educated privately and in 1916 entered the University of North Carolina, where he wrote and acted in several one-act plays. In 1920 he enrolled in George Pierce Baker\u2019s 47 Workshop at Harvard University, intending to become a playwright. Several of his plays were produced at Harvard, including Welcome to Our City (1923), in which the town of Altamont (Asheville) first appeared.\n\nIn 1923 Wolfe left Harvard for New York City, where he resided for the rest of his life. Still intending to be a playwright, he taught at Washington Square College of New York University. In 1926, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became Look Homeward, Angel, in which he recounted the growth of an autobiographical protagonist, Eugene Gant, in the mountain town of Altamont. The book was a success, though its publication caused a great furor in Asheville.\n\nDuring the late 1920s Wolfe entered into a relationship with the theatrical designer Aline Bernstein, who appeared as Esther Jack in his last two novels and who wrote of their friendship in the novel The Journey Down (1938). After the publication of Look Homeward, Angel, Wolfe quit teaching to write full-time. His second novel, Of Time and the River (1935), takes up the story of Eugene Gant from his leaving home to attend Harvard until his meeting with Esther Jack. Wolfe\u2019s memoir of his life in the 1930s, The Story of a Novel (1936), describes his close working relationship with the editor Maxwell Perkins (q.v.), who helped him reduce the enormous manuscripts of his first two works down to manageable novelistic proportions.\n\nWolfe did not publish another novel during his lifetime, though at his death he left a prodigious quantity of manuscript, from which the editor Edward Aswell extracted two more novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again (1940). These books depict the struggles of a young writer to become established in New York City and his first experiences with literary fame. A collection of Wolfe\u2019s shorter pieces and chapters of an uncompleted novel, The Hills Beyond (1941), and his Letters to His Mother (1943) were also published, as well as his Selected Letters (1956).\n\nWolfe was gifted with the faculty of almost total recall, and his fiction is characterized by an intense consciousness of scene and place, together with what is often an extraordinary lyric power. In Look Homeward, Angel and Of Time and the River, Wolfe was able to imbue his life story and the figures of his parents with a lofty romantic quality that has epic and mythopoeic overtones. Powerful emotional evocation and literal reporting are combined in his fiction, and he often alternates between dramatically effective episodes of recollection and highly charged passages of rhetoric. Though The Web and the Rock and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again contain episodes of great vividness, they are too often uncontrolled in their form and fail to sustain the epic tone of Look Homeward, Angel, which has become an American classic."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/thomas-clayton-wolfe", "page_content": "Thomas Clayton Wolfe\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (1900-1938) was an American novelist of prodigious talent and equally formidable failings. His highly autobiographical novels are notable for fervent energy, uninhibited emotion, and grandly rhetorical language.\n\nThomas Wolfe achieved critical acclaim for his unabashed romanticism and visionary faith in the inherent greatness of America and the heroism of its people. He possessed an extraordinary ability for portraiture and a gift for visual detail and sensory impressions, but his brilliance is often diminished in a diffuse sea of inflated irrelevancies and ranting incantations and exhortations. Modern critics have grown less infatuated with his prose and become more aware of the lack of thematic focus, structural cohesion, and controlling artistic intelligence in even his most disciplined work.\n\nThe most striking irony in Wolfe's work is that despite his spontaneous emotionalism there is an absence of compassion for any character other than his self-identifying protagonist, and despite his mystic exaltation of sex there is little credible sexuality and even less love.\n\nLonely Childhood\n\nWolfe was born on Oct. 3, 1900, in Asheville, N.C. His mother had been a schoolteacher before marrying William O. Wolfe, a stonecutter and a man of towering assertiveness and drive. After the parents split up, Wolfe's lonely childhood was spent shuttling between the two. The death of his older brother Ben, whom he idolized, left an emotional scar from which he never recovered.\n\nAfter an outstanding scholastic record, at the age of 15 Wolfe was admitted to the University of North Carolina, where he became active in various publications and theater groups. Two plays were produced: The Return of Buck Gavin (published 1924) and The Third Night (1938). Upon graduation the embryonic author continued at Harvard University, eventually earning a master of arts degree. His involvement with the famous Playwright Workshop led to Welcome to Our City (produced at Harvard, 1923) and to work on Mannerhouse (published 1948), concerning the disintegration of a southern family. His professors' enthusiasm encouraged Wolfe to move to New York in 1923 to seek success in the theater. Failure forced him to accept a position as English instructor at New York University. In 1924 in Europe he met Aline Bernstein, a married mother of two, 16 years his senior, with whom he had a brief but intense love affair.\n\nLook Homeward, Angel\n\nIn 1926 Wolfe began work on an enormous novel which would explore and explain \"the strange and bitter magic of life.\" After some 20 months of furious writing, Wolfe left the huge, sprawling manuscript with Maxwell Perkins, editor of Scribner's. Though impressed with the author's genius, Perkins would not publish the novel until it was considerably revised and drastically cut. After a great deal of reworking and editing, Look Homeward, Angel appeared in 1929. Opening with a 90-page account of the early lives of his father and mother, the novel is a thinly disguised autobiographical record of the author's early years in the person of Eugene Gant.\n\nIn contrast to the critics' instant praise, Wolfe earned the hostility of many relatives and friends who easily recognized themselves in the novel. Though recent critical judgment of the work has been tempered by the recognition of its romantic and at times adolescent pretentiousness, Look Homeward, Angel contains vigorous prose and sequences of unquestionable power, such as the chilling conversation between Eugene and the ghost of his brother Ben, and the graphic description of his father's struggle against cancer. It is Wolfe's major contribution to American literature.\n\nWolfe resigned from New York University in 1930 and returned to Europe for a year on a fellowship. He had in mind a vast novel of several volumes which would range in time from the Civil War to the present and would replace Eugene Gant with a less autobiographical protagonist. After nearly five years of grappling with this conception\u2014while living in extreme loneliness and near poverty in Brooklyn Heights, New York City\u2014Wolfe recognized his inability to achieve a structural unity for the work.\n\nOf Time and the River\n\nPerkins insisted that Wolfe return to his previous autobiographical mode. Despite Wolfe's bitter protestations, a mammoth, haphazardly organized novel, Of Time and the River, appeared in 1935. Here the story of Eugene Gant continues, from his journey to Harvard University, through his period of personal turmoil in Europe, including an unhappy love affair, concluding with his return to the United States. The work's two outstanding sections are a vivid description of Eugene's ride to Boston and the horrifyingly effective account of the death of Gant's father.\n\nAlternating between hysterical affirmation and maudlin self-pity, the novel's young protagonist is a rather unpleasant individual whose heroic conception of himself is never sustained by objective facts. Most of the other characters are sketchily drawn, with the exception of the friend Starwick, who, like Eugene, is endowed with a tragic dimension, whose basis is never made clear. Eugene's relationship with Starwick and his horror at discovering his friend's homosexuality are psychologically ambiguous and absurdly melodramatic. The study maintains a strange effectiveness, however, because of its frequent insights into the abyss of human loneliness and the sterility of self-love.\n\nSeveral months after publication of Of Time and the River, Perkins collected several short stories and sketches extracted from Wolfe's earlier uncompleted novel. Under the title From Death to Morning, the uneven work was severely attacked by critics, although it included two of Wolfe's finest pieces of controlled narration\u2014\"Only the Dead Know Brooklyn\" and \"Death the Proud Brother.\" In 1936 Wolfe terminated his association with Perkins, largely to quell the rumor that the editor had acted as a near collaborator in the creation of his fiction, and signed with Edward C. Aswell, editor of Harper and Brothers.\n\nPosthumous Publications\n\nForgiven by his family and friends in North Carolina, for the first time in many years Wolfe returned home, where he spent several months writing and discovering that \"you can't go home again.\" He presented a voluminous manuscript to Aswell, the working outlines for a new series of novels. On vacation in the West, Wolfe suddenly contracted pneumonia, which activated a tubercular condition. He died on Sept. 15, 1938, in Baltimore.\n\nFrom the eight-foot pile of manuscript left him, Aswell compiled two novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940), and a volume of short stories, The Hills Beyond (1941). The novels are no less autobiographical than Wolfe's earlier ones, and despite some impressive prose in The Web and the Rock, there is no indication that Wolfe had begun to achieve mastery of his medium or to discover fresh thematic material. Wolfe's other posthumous writings include Letters to His Mother (1943), Western Journal (1951), and Letters (1956).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe only biography of Wolfe is Andrew Turnbull, Thomas Wolfe (1968).

Hugh Holman, 1996\n\n3 Oct. 1900\u201315 Sept. 1938\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe, novelist and short story writer, was born in Asheville, the eighth child of William Oliver, a stonecutter from Pennsylvania, and Julia Elizabeth Westall Wolfe, a native North Carolinian. In 1904 he went with his mother and some of the other children to St. Louis, where his mother kept a boardinghouse during the World's Fair and where his brother Grover died, an event that he was to use with distinction in his fiction. In 1905 he began attending public school in Asheville and in 1912 moved to a private school operated by Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Roberts. Margaret Roberts was a major influence on his life and work.\n\nIn 1916 Wolfe entered The University of North Carolina as a freshman. In the summer of 1918 he was a civilian war worker in Norfolk; that fall he enrolled in Professor Frederick H. Koch's playwriting course at The University of North Carolina. On 14 and 15 Mar. 1919 his one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed with Wolfe in the title role on the first bill of the Carolina Playmakers. Wolfe edited The Tar Heel, The University of North Carolina student newspaper, and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay, \"The Crisis in Industry.\" Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919.\n\nIn June 1920 he was graduated from the university with a B.A. degree and in September entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University to earn an M.A. degree in English and to study playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of his play The Mountains were performed by the 47 Workshop at Harvard in 1921. In 1922 he completed the requirements for the M.A. degree, and in June of that year his father died in Asheville, another event of great importance in his fiction. Wolfe continued to study with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which in May 1923 produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City. In November 1923 he went to New York City, where he solicited funds for The University of North Carolina. In February 1924 he began teaching English as an instructor at the Washington Square College of New York University, a task that he continued to perform intermittently until January 1930. According to student reports, he was a conscientious and successful teacher.\n\nIn October 1924 he sailed for England on the first of what proved to be seven European trips. He traveled in France, Italy, and Switzerland, and on his return voyage in 1925, he met Mrs. Aline Bernstein, who was eighteen years his senior, a scene designer for the Theater Guild and the wife of a successful stockbroker. In October 1925 she became his mistress. Their affair was stormy, but Aline Bernstein was one of the powerful influences on his life. In the summer of 1926 he returned to Europe and there began work on the first version of his novel Look Homeward, Angel. In the summer of 1927 he made his third European journey, traveling in France, Austria, and Germany.\n\nOn 31 Mar. 1928 he completed the manuscript for the novel Look Homeward, Angel. That summer he made his fourth European trip, was injured in a fight at the Oktoberfest in Munich, and received news of Scribner's interest in Look Homeward, Angel, which was accepted for publication in January, beginning his long, close, and sometimes painful association with the editor Maxwell Perkins. The amount of editing done on the manuscript by Perkins has been greatly exaggerated. The novel, when published on 8 Oct. 1929, was of all Wolfe's long works the one closest to his original plan. It sold only moderately well, but it was a great critical success, and Wolfe was hailed as the most promising young American novelist.\n\nIn 1930 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and made his fifth European tour. On his return in the late spring of 1931, he began living in Brooklyn. The following year his tempestuous affair with Mrs. Bernstein ended. Perkins, after first putting it into production, withdrew his second novel, K-19, which remained unpublished. His short novel, A Portrait of Bascom Hawke, appeared in Scribner's Magazine, and it was co-winner of the $5,000 Scribner's Short Novel Prize. In July he published a second short novel, Web of Earth, one of his best works.\n\nDuring the period between 1932 and 1935 Wolfe prepared three books for publication, K-19, No Door, a short novel, and a collection of three short novels. Perkins, however, insisted that Wolfe must come forward with a long work continuing his saga of Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Look Homeward, Angel. Wolfe was having difficulty with the large book although he was publishing excellent short stories and short novels. In 1933 Perkins began to work with him daily on the \"big book\" and finally, in July 1934, over Wolfe's protests, sent the manuscript of Of Time and the River to the publishers. On its publication Wolfe was bitter about the shape of the book, declaring that had he been allowed to, he would have made it much better. The critics, although generally approving, did find the work to be sprawling and ill organized.\n\nIn 1935 he participated in the Writer's Conference at Boulder, Colo., and his speech made there was published as a serial in the Saturday Review of Literature and as a book, The Story of a Novel. This work recounts his struggle to produce Of Time and the River. In November 1935 From Death to Morning, a collection of short novels and short stories, was published.\n\nIn 1935 and 1936 Wolfe made his sixth and seventh European trips, spending much time in Germany, where translations of his works had made him a very popular figure. In 1936, leaving Berlin on a train, an incident with a Jew trying to escape Germany forced him to recognize the cruel nature of the Nazi state, and on returning home he wrote one of his most powerful short novels, \"I Have a Thing To Tell You,\" a strong indictment of Germany, which was serialized in the New Republic. Like many of his short novels, it was later incorporated in expanded form in one of his novels, in this case You Can't Go Home Again.\n\nIn 1936 his quarrel with his publisher, Charles Scribner's Sons, began; it grew out of his sense that Perkins was preventing him from writing what he truly wished to write, and it was exacerbated by what he felt was Scribner's unwillingness to defend him in a libel suit and by his unhappiness about the reputation that Of Time and the River and The Story of a Novel gave him of being a prodigious but formless writer whose works were shaped by his editor. This struggle with Scribner's continued throughout 1937, until in December he signed a contract with Edward C. Aswell, of Harper and Brothers, for the publication of his later work. However turbulent this period was emotionally, it was one of the most fruitful for Wolfe in terms of short publications in such journals as the New Republic, the New Yorker, Scribner's, American Mercury, Harpers Bazaar, the Yale Review, and the Saturday Evening Post.\n\nIn 1938 he left New York for a western tour, depositing the large body of manuscript materials that he had with his new editor, Edward C. Aswell. On the way west, he stopped by Purdue University and gave a lecture, \"Writing and Living\" (published in 1964). In July 1938 he became ill in Seattle, and on 6 September he was sent to the Johns Hopkins University Hospital, where he died of tuberculosis of the brain, eighteen days before his thirty-eighth birthday.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, Edward Aswell assembled from the manuscripts the novels The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, which were published in 1939 and 1940. A collection of short stories and sketches and fragments of a novel were published as The Hills Beyond in 1941. In assembling these works, Aswell worked from Wolfe's outline and organized the material in the huge but incomplete collection of manuscripts that Wolfe had left. The Web and the Rock, which deals with a new protagonist George Webber, is pretty much the novel that Wolfe would have produced, although the latter two-thirds would certainly have been greatly revised. You Can't Go Home Again, also about Webber, is largely a collection of materials, with narrative links written by Aswell to bridge the gaps. Thus only in his short stories, short novels, and Look Homeward, Angel does Wolfe's work survive in a form in which he himself was the principal agent of organization. Of Time and the River carries too much of Maxwell Perkins's intention rather than Wolfe's, even to being in the third person when Wolfe had written most of it in the first person. The last two novels had to be given their present shape by Aswell with only Wolfe's outline to assist him.\n\nIn 1991 The University of North Carolina Press and Paul Gitlin, administrator of the estate of Thomas Wolfe, brought out The Good Child's River, an unfinished novel \"based loosely on the early life of\" Aline Bernstein, edited and with an introduction by Suzanne Stutman. According to the jacket, \"Some sections of this work were heavily edited and published after Wolfe's death. Here for the first time is The Good Child's River, as Wolfe wrote it, along with some fragments, contained in two appendixes, that Wolfe may have intended to include in the finished work.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe was a writer of enormous energy and imaginative force, marked by a richly rhetorical style and powerful command of language. The subject of the bulk of his writing was his own experience as an American. He was in the tradition of Walt Whitman, attempting through the record of himself to explain and to define what it meant to be an American. His work is marred by excesses and exuberance, and of his novels, only Look Homeward, Angel has the firm shape that he himself gave it. Out of these facts has grown the legend that Wolfe was an uncontrolled and excessive writer, blessed with the gift of language but unable to control the structure of his works. But his thirty-two short stories and his seven short novels indicate quite clearly that this was not true. In the short length of the story and the intermediate length of the short novel, he was able to write tightly organized, powerful, and convincing stories, and it was only when he began to assemble these works into large structures, such as those that Perkins imposed on him in the early 1930s, that his lack of artistic control became apparent.\n\nWolfe's subject was always himself and his experiences, transmuted by the imagination and elevated by the power of his rhetoric. His effort to put a person, himself, fully \"on record\" through the guise of fiction was a major and masterful accomplishment in the American novel, and at the time of his death he was ranked among the top three or four twentieth-century American novelists. His critical stock has fallen severely since his death in 1938, yet his command of language, the strength of his characterizations, and the power with which he could describe the experiences and feelings of youth were all such that his place as a permanent figure in American writing seems assured."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Thomas-Clayton-Wolfe/6000000005582272742", "page_content": "About Thomas Clayton Wolfe\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wolfe-2120\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1120\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/104277501/family?cfpid=21...\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/89349251/family?cfpid=485...\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was a major American novelist of the early 20th century.\n\nWolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886); Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950); Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956); Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958); Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904); Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918); and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.[6] Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in The New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, Writing and Living, then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\n\"I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\nAfterward\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, due to the amount of the material he left at his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two further Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper and Row. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels (some 700 pages apiece) ever written.\" In these novels, Wolfe switched his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed in an act of arson during the Bele Chere street festival, the perpetrators still unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. Return of an Angel, by Sandra Mason, is a play that explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of his novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was produced for several years in October, next door to the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in celebration of Wolfe's birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son.\" The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and Saint Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks and Essays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe#Works\n\nExerpt from Wikitree Wolfe-2120:\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe , Effie Nelson Wolfe , Frank Cecil Wolfe , Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe, Grover Cleveland Wolfe , Benjamin Harrison Wolfe , and Frederick William Wolfe . The family lived at 92 Woodfin Street in Asheville, North Carolina where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver who ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and bought and sold real estate. In 1906 Julia bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with Thomas while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Thomas lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. Wolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when he was 15 years old. He was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Thomas was interested in becoming a playwright and in 1919 he enrolled in a playwriting course. Some plays he wrote in his life were \"The Return of Buck Gavin\" ,\"The Third Night\" and \"The Mountains\". He also edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled \"The Crisis in Industry\". In June of 1920 Wolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. He entered Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in September of the same year, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play \"Welcome to Our City\". In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University , a position he occupied periodically for over six years. During his short life Thomas Clayton Wolfe wrote several lengthy novels, \"Look Homeward, Angel\", \"Of Time and the River\", \"The October Fair\", \"The Web and the Rock\" and \"You Can't Go Home Again\" plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing.

Though it was situated close to the family home on 92 Woodfin Street, where Thomas often went to meet his siblings, he mostly spent a lonely childhood. His older brother, Ben, died in 1918. This left a deep emotional impact on Wolfe, as he was quite close to Ben.\n\nWolfe was youngest of the eight siblings in the family. The first-born child of his parents, Leslie, died in infancy. His other siblings were Eddie Nelson, Frank Cecil, Mabel Elizabeth, twins Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison, and Frederick William. In 1904, during the \u2018World Fair,\u2019 he accompanied his family to St. Louis, where his mother ran a boarding house. One of his brothers, Grover, died of typhoid in St. Louis.\n\nWolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina, to William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall-Wolfe. His father was a stone carver, while his mother owned a boarding house and dealt in real estate.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nIn November 1923, Wolfe went to New York City to raise funds for the \u2018University of North Carolina\u2019 and with an aim to see his plays on \u2018Broadway.\u2019 However, even after 3 years, he did not succeed, as the plays were lengthy and unsuitable for stage. In 1924, he joined the \u2018Washington Square College\u2019 of \u2018New York University\u2019 as an instructor for English. He continued to teach from time to time, until January 1930.\n\nWolfe went to Europe for the first time in October 1924. There, he visited France, Italy, and Switzerland. While returning in 1925, he met Mrs. Aline Bernstein, wife of a stockbroker and a mother of two. She was a scene designer for \u2018Theater Guild.\u2019 In October 1925, he got romantically involved with Aline, who was 18 years his senior. The two had an intense, stormy affair for the next 5 years. She proved to be a powerful influence and muse of his life.\n\nOn his second European trip in 1926, Wolfe commenced work on his first novel, initially titled, \u2018O Lost.\u2019 After 20 months of writing, he completed it in March 1928 and submitted the manuscript to \u2018Scribner\u2019s,\u2019 who showed immense interest in it. The lengthy manuscript was edited by well-known editor Maxwell Perkins. The two had a long and close association.\n\nPerkins edited the long autobiographical fiction to a manageable proportion. It was named \u2018Look Homeward, Angel.\u2019 The novel was about the protagonist \u2018Eugene Gant,\u2019 Wolfe\u2019s alter ego, who lived in the town of \u2018Altamont,\u2019 which stood for Asheville. It was published on October 8, 1929, and was well-received. Wolfe was considered one of the most promising American novelists of the time. However, his family and the residents of Asheville, who could easily recognize their references in the novel, did not take it well. Wolfe stayed away from the town for nearly 8 years. Soon after, he ended his relationship with Bernstein.\n\nin 1930, Wolfe went to Europe for a year on a \u2018Guggenheim Fellowship.\u2019 Later, he stayed in Brooklyn and continued to write. He withdrew his second novel, \u2018K-19,\u2019 after submitting it for publication. He published the short novels \u2018A Portrait of Bascom Hawk\u2019 and \u2018Web of Earth.\u2019 The former co-won the \u2018Scribner\u2019s Short Novel Prize.\u2019\n\nBy 1935, Wolfe had completed a short novel named \u2018No Door\u2019 and a collection of three more novellas. On Perkins\u2019s suggestion, in 1933, he began his second lengthy autobiographical novel, \u2018Of Time and the River.\u2019 Wolfe had reservations about the final edited product, though it sold better than his first novel.\n\nNot too happy with Perkins\u2019s severe editing, Wolfe signed with \u2018Harper & Brothers.\u2019 He made a speech at the 1935 \u2018Writer\u2019s Conference,\u2019 Colorado, (later published as \u2018The Story of a Novel\u2019), stating his struggle with his second novel. A collection of short stories and novels, \u2018From Death to Morning,\u2019 was published in November 1935.\n\nWolfe\u2019s writing was popular in Europe, especially in Germany.

He first attended the University of North Carolina and then Harvard University before moving to New York City in 1923. It was there that he wrote his most popular work, Look Homeward, Angel (1929), an autobiographical piece centering on his alter ego, Eugene Gant. Wolfe followed with four novels over the following eight years and had more than 10 works published after his untimely death in 1938.\n\nEarly Years\n\nThomas Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina, to a stonecutter father and a mother who owned a boardinghouse. After attending a private prep school, Wolfe enrolled in the University of North Carolina in 1916. There he began his writing career, penning and acting in several one-act plays. Wolfe also edited The Tar Heel, UNC's student newspaper, and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for his essay \"The Crisis in Industry.\" Wolfe graduated in 1920, and in the fall he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he set his sights on becoming a professional playwright as a part of Harvard's 47 Workshop.\n\nIn 1923, Wolfe left Boston for New York, the city he called home for the rest of his life. He taught at Washington Square College of New York University and continued to write. Three years later, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became the novel Look Homeward, Angel.\n\n'Look Homeward, Angel'\n\nIn early 1928, Wolfe completed the manuscript for Look Homeward, Angel, and by summer he learned that Scribner was interested in the work. The book was officially accepted for publication in January 1929, and Wolfe began his long, close and tumultuous relationship with editor Maxwell Perkins (who was also famously the editor of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald). Perkins edited the manuscript down into a more manageable form (a process that would eventually mark the beginning of the end of the pair's working relationship), and it was published in October 1929 to great critical reception, placing Wolfe on the literary map as one of America's most promising young novelists.\n\nAnother consequence of publication was the furor caused in Wolfe's hometown of Asheville, as the cast of characters in the autobiographical book hit close to home for many of Asheville's residents.\n\nThe Road to Success\n\nThe following year, Wolfe received a Guggenheim Fellowship and published a second short novel, Web of Earth, and soon began preparations for several other works: K-19, No Door (a short novel) and a collection of three short novels. Wolfe's publication plan conflicted with that of Perkins, who wanted Wolfe to write a follow-up to the story of Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Look Homeward, Angel. Perkins began working with Wolfe daily in 1933 on this proposed book, and in the summer of 1934, ignoring Wolfe's objections, Perkins sent the manuscript of Of Time and the River to Scribner. The book was generally well-received upon publication, but Wolfe was bitterly displeased with it, blaming Perkins for the unsatisfactory form of the final product.\n\nAn Early Death\n\nIn 1936, Wolfe's dissatisfaction with Perkins led to a larger conflict with Scribner, and Wolfe left Scribner for Harper & Brothers. Two years after leaving Scribner, Wolfe left New York to travel to the American West. In July 1938, he became sick in Seattle, and two months later he was sent to the Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Wolfe could not recover his health, and he died at Johns Hopkins of tuberculosis of the brain shortly before his 38th birthday.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, Edward Aswell, Wolfe's Harper editor, assembled from the manuscripts left behind the novels The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940). Several other collections and uncompleted works also appeared posthumously, and Wolfe's legacy is that of one of America's strongest writers whose potential was cut tragically short.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Thomas Wolfe\n\nBirth Year: 1900\n\nBirth date: October 3, 1900\n\nBirth State: North Carolina\n\nBirth City: Asheville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Thomas Wolfe was a major American novelist of the early 20th century, notable for his first book, 1929's 'Look Homeward, Angel.'\n\nIndustries\n\nEducation and Academia\n\n\n\nTheater and Dance\n\n\n\nFiction and Poetry\n\nAstrological Sign: Libra\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of North Carolina\n\n\n\nHarvard University\n\nDeath Year: 1938\n\nDeath date: September 15, 1938\n\nDeath State: Maryland\n\nDeath City: Baltimore\n\nDeath Country: United States\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Thomas Wolfe Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/thomas-wolfe\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: September 6, 2019\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://www.dailyasianage.com/news/142927/thomas-wolfe", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe was an American novelist of the early twentieth century.

His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the mores of that period, filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, contemporary author William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have been the greatest talent of their generation for aiming higher than any other writer. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of beat generation writer Jack Kerouac, and of authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains an important writer in modern American literature, as one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction, and is considered North Carolina's most famous writer. Ernest Hemingway, whose succinct writing style and manly voice were in many ways the opposite of Wolfe's lumbering and ruminating style, dismissed Wolfe derisively as \"the over bloated Li'l Abner of American letters.\"\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886), Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950), Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956), Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958), Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904), Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918), and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906 Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old. A member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, he predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today. Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nWolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of his play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC, while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nWolfe was unable to sell any of his plays after three years because of their great length. The Theatre Guild came close to producing Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, and Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland.\n\nOn his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. Eighteen years his senior, she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children. In October 1925, she and Wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing.\n\nWolfe returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of an autobiographical novel titled O Lost. The narrative, which evolved into Look Homeward, Angel, fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, and chronicled family, friends, and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family's surname became Gant, and Wolfe called himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza. The original manuscript of O Lost was over 1100 pages (333,000 words) long, and considerably more experimental in style than the final version of Look Homeward, Angel. It was submitted to Scribner's, where the editing was done by Maxwell Perkins, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe. Wolfe initially expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing, but he had misgivings later. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, and that Perkins, who had five daughters, found in Wolfe a sort of foster son.\n\nThe novel, which had been dedicated to Bernstein, was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929. Soon afterward, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Mrs. Bernstein. The novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume. Titled Of Time and the River, it was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In an ironic twist, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time because they hadn't been included. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe was persuaded by Edward Aswell to leave Scribner's and sign with Harper & Brothers. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work is what prompted him to leave. Others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936 he witnessed incidents of discrimination against Jews, which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. He returned to America and published a story based on his observations (\"I Have a Thing to Tell You\") in The New Republic. Following its publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government, and he was prohibited from traveling there.\n\nIn 1937, Chickamauga, his short story set during the US Civil War battle of the same name, was published. Wolfe returned to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after submitting over one million words of manuscript to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, \"Writing and Living,\" and then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boarding house in Washington, D.C. and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found among his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\nI shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\n\nThomas Wolfe is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\"\n\nPosthumous works\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, there being much unpublished material remaining after his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper & Brothers. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels ever written\" (nearly 700 pages each). In these novels, Wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important American writers, comparable to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, or William Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing\". He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W. J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner later decided that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-coochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Li'l Abner of literature.\"\n\nLegacy\n\nSoutherner and Harvard historian David Herbert Donald's biography of Wolfe, Look Homeward, won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1988.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was influenced by Wolfe, and included him as a character in his books. Earl Hamner, Jr., who went on to create the popular television series The Waltons, idolized Wolfe in his youth.\n\nHunter S. Thompson credits Wolfe for his famous phrase \"Fear and Loathing\" (on page 62 of The Web and the Rock).\n\nIn the film Genius\u2014a biographical drama about Max Perkins released in the summer of 2016\u2014Wolfe is portrayed by Academy Award\u2013nominated actor Jude Law.\n\nArchives\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nTributes\n\nReturn of an Angel, a play by Sandra Mason, explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of Look Homeward, Angel. The play was staged several times near the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in the month of October, to commemorate his birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son\". The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nHistoric landmarks\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. Wolfe called it \"Dixieland\" in Look homeward, Angel. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed by a fire set by an arsonist during the Bele Chere street festival. The perpetrator remains unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003.\n\nA cabin built by Wolfe's friend Max Whitson in 1924 near Azalea Road was designated as a historic landmark by the Asheville City Council in 1982. Thomas Wolfe Cabin, as it is called, was where Wolfe spent the summer of 1937 in his last visit to the city. In a letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Wolfe said, \"I am going into the woods. I am going to try to do the best, the most important piece of work I have ever done,\" referring to October Fair, which became The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again. He also wrote \"The Party at Jack's\" while at the cabin in the Oteen community. The city bought the property, including a larger house, from John Moyer in 2001. As of 2017, renovation is being considered and work has been done on the cabin.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote the appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe that were visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and St. Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks\n\nLook Homeward, Angel (1929)\n\nNo Door (novella, 1933; was published in two installments in Scribner's Magazine in 1933 and 1934, and later become part of his full-length Of Time and the River)\n\nOf Time and the River (1935)\n\nFrom Death to Morning (1935)\n\nThe Story of a Novel (1936)\n\nChickamauga (Short Story) (1937)\n\nThe Child By Tiger (Short Story)(1937 in the Saturday Evening Post of 9/11)\n\nThe Web and the Rock (1939) [published posthumously]\n\nYou Can't Go Home Again (1940) [published posthumously]\n\nThe Hills Beyond (1941) [published posthumously]\n\nMannerhouse: A Play in a Prologue and Four Acts (1948) [published posthumously]\n\nA Western Journal: A Daily Log of the Great Parks Trip, June 20-July 2, 1938 (1951) [published posthumously]\n\nThe Letters of Thomas Wolfe (1956) [published posthumously]\n\nShort Novels of Thomas Wolfe (1961) [published posthumously]\n\nThe Mountains: A Play in One Act; The Mountains: A Drama in Three Acts and a Prologue (1970) [published posthumously]\n\nWelcome to our City: A Play in Ten Scenes (1983) [published posthumously]\n\nBeyond Love and Loyalty: The Letters of Thomas Wolfe and Elizabeth Nowell (1983) [published posthumously]\n\nMy Other Loneliness: Letters of Thomas Wolfe and Aline Bernstein (1983) [Richard Kennedy, ed.]\n\nThe Hound of Darkness (1986) [published posthumously]\n\nThe Collected Stories of Thomas Wolfe (1987) [Francis E.
