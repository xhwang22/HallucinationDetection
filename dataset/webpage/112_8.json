Among the countless raves for the play, Ben Brantley of The New York Times hailed \"Morning's At Seven surprises Manhattan theatergoers every time it comes around. It's rare that a Broadway comedy seduces by stealth. The discreet miracle of Mr. Osborn's writing is in the shadows he weaves into the sunniest exchanges.\" In his Variety review, Charles Isherwood wrote \"the play's pleasures are durable ones, and it affords a cast of veterans a chance to display their gifts. Osborn's writing is infused with clear-sighted but sympathetic wisdom.\" Terry Teachout of The Wall Street Journal calls Morning's At Seven \"a great American play that ought to be far better known.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION:\n\nMorning's At Seven will play 12-week engagement through January 9 at Theatre at St. Clements, 423 W. 46th Street, NYC).

Enter Email Sign Up\n\nCrouse: I\u2019ve spent a long time reporting on women\u2019s sports and trying to cover them in unusual ways, whether it\u2019s exposing the punishments women athletes face for having children or just helping bring excellent women athletes\u2019 profiles before a mainstream audience. There was never really a job on those themes for me to apply to, so I came up with how I wanted to do it myself, doing stories that I hoped would resonate with readers like me (especially because I\u2019m an athlete myself). Lucy Harris\u2019s story fit right into that.\n\nWe produced her story as part of a documentary series I came up with as an experiment with Breakwater Studios about people who were incredibly talented and on the cusp of making history, but were forgotten for any number of reasons \u2013 obviously that premise applies to so much of women\u2019s sports. It\u2019s hard to get historical stories, especially in a documentary, to echo in ways that make people think about the world around them right now, but in this case, the resonance with barriers that contemporary female athletes face was clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: I feel like every college athlete should be required to study Lusia Harris\u2019s career. Luckily, the award comes at a perfect time because we\u2019re gearing up for what looks to be a really competitive women\u2019s Final Four. What\u2019s something you learned about during the making of the documentary that everyone should know?\n\nCrouse: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever heard directly from a woman who was at the center of the revolutionary changes to women\u2019s sports in America that were unfolding 50 years ago, at the dawn of Title IX (which granted women and girls equal opportunities in school sports to those enjoyed by boys and men). It was interesting to learn that Lucy made her women\u2019s team so good that the women\u2019s basketball team at her small Mississippi school flew in planes to their games, while the less competitive men\u2019s team took buses.\n\nYou rarely hear of women\u2019s teams leading the way, or getting resources that reflect their superiority. It contradicts the tired argument that \u201cnobody wants to watch women play.\u201d Of course they do \u2013 we just have to tell the stories with the same level of quality we tell stories about men.\n\nQ: Shaq and Steph Curry were executive producers of the documentary. How much were they involved in the day-to-day of the project and what was it like to work with them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrouse: They were incredible promoters of Lucy Harris\u2019s story. I hope what they did for \u201cThe Queen of Basketball\u201d can wind up being a model for how male athletes with outstanding platforms \u2014 or any powerful men whose power has grown in systems that were optimized for them to succeed \u2014 can use their audiences to bring attention to extraordinary, but lesser known, women. Sharing the love lifts everyone up.\n\nQ: You grew up in South Kingstown, went to Harvard, and now have won an Oscar at The New York Times. What\u2019s the Rhode Island-related documentary you\u2019d just love to work on?\n\nCrouse: The Pulitzer prize-winning novelist Jhumpa Lahiri graduated from my high school several years ahead of me; her mother was my teacher\u2019s aide when I was an elementary student at South Road School in Wakefield. I\u2019ve never met Lahiri, but have always admired her, and was surprised there wasn\u2019t more of a shrine to her in my high school \u2013 I just remember a small plaque with her name on it in a corner of our library, which I would look at and think, we should be shouting her name from the rooftops! with everything she\u2019s achieved.\n\nHer writing gave me a new lens for thinking about my hometown, for good and bad, as has following some of her family\u2019s experiences in the town when they\u2019ve been in the news. In keeping with the themes of her books, I think that story would make a powerful foundation for a look at the modern American town (and about how they are changing \u2013 as well as how they aren\u2019t). I\u2019d love to know more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story first appeared in Rhode Map, our free newsletter about Rhode Island that also contains information about local events, data about the coronavirus in the state, and more.

Madison also spent the year as a TA for the Sophomore Acting Class, a job she\u2019ll miss dearly. Her favorite on-stage role (at URI and of all time) was playing the Provost in Measure for Measure. She adores making the most out of the littlest characters. But a close second favorite was performing in The Wolves. Madison is over the moon to be jumping in at Gloucester Stage and can\u2019t wait to learn something different from everyone. She hasn\u2019t had spare time in several years, but if she did, she might go hiking.\n\nLAUREN CORCUER (Props Design) is excitedly returning to Gloucester Stage after her work this season on Barefoot in the Park, Ben Butler and last season on the Agitators.

She has concentrations in both acting and stage management and has a love for the work that happens on and back stage. Her time at URI was filled with participating in many productions, trying everything from carpentry, stage combat, sound board operating, and acting in vastly different roles. To end her senior year, she was the stage manager for an eight show one act festival and found the process challenging but rewarding. She believes having a passion for both the artistic side and logistic side of theatre keeps her well rounded and helps her see things from different perspectives.

As she spoke, there was the muffled pounding of Mr. Mamet's typewriter, a sound that is part of the texture of her life.\n\nMany of the people Miss Crouse has loved have been involved with writing, the theater, or both. She could have rejected it all, overwhelmed by the surfeit of talent in her household. Instead, she became an actress and married a playwright. Right now she is starring as Viola in the Circle Repertory's lighthearted version of Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night,'' directed by Mr. Mamet. The critics have hailed her performance as ''outstanding,'' and said she exudes ''charm along with intelligence.''\n\nMiss Crouse's father was Russel Crouse, who wrote, among many plays, ''Life with Father'' and ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' in collaboration with Howard Lindsay, the man after whom she was named. Her mother, Anna, wrote children's books with her father. Her older brother, Timothy, wrote ''The Boys on the Bus,'' a funny, much-admired description of the press corps covering the 1972 Presidential campaign. Her maternal grandfather was John Erskine, the noted English professor who wrote ''The Private Life of Helen of Troy,'' and who headed the Juilliard School of Music for many years. Her father's father was a newspaperman. Family of Busy Typewriters ''In our family, the work ethic was held up as some kind of byword,'' Miss Crouse remembered. ''At any hour, somebody's typewriter was going. If my father had been an actor instead of a playwright, I might have had problems.''\n\nMiss Crouse remembers her growing-up years as golden and romantic, ''part of the way Broadway used to be.'' Celebrities streamed to the family's town house in the East 60's, a home with Victorian antiques and tasseled red draperies. Among the frequent guests were Sherwood Anderson, Eugene O'Neill, Edna Ferber, John Steinbeck, Frederic March (''I remember him well - his noble bearing''), John Mason Brown, Howard Lindsay, Dorothy Stickney, Ethel Merman, Mary Martin and Irving Berlin. They ate and drank and sang and played charades ''in a spirit of fun and affection,'' Miss Crouse said. ''I thought everybody had a life like that.
