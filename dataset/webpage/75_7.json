Much anticipated when it was published in 1919, Reed\u2019s narrative remains as riveting today as when the events he describes were still reverberating throughout the world.\n\n\n\nReed was hardly a disinterested observer, and his involvement in the Communist labor movement lends urgency and passion to his classic account. He vividly describes events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace and seized the reins of power.\n\n\n\nDespite Reed\u2019s personal leanings, which he made no attempt to hide, the book garnered praise from luminaries across the political spectrum. George F. Kennan, the American diplomat, and father of the policy of Soviet containment, said that \u201cReed\u2019s account of the events of that time rises above every other contemporary record for its literary power, its penetration, its command of detail. It will be remembered when all others are forgotten.\"\n\n\n\nReed was committed to telling the story of the Russian revolution as truthfully as possible. That the book was banned by Russian premier Josef Stalin is a testament to the author\u2019s success in carrying out his mission. One hundred years after Russia and the world trembled, Ten Days that Shook the World brings alive the momentous events of 1917.

I have had a copy hanging around for I don't know how long and finally got around to reading it.\n\n\n\nBefore you read it yourself, and I recommend you do if you are a keen student of history, take my advice and read Reed's notes and explanations section beforehand. Bless my sacred icons, there are enough political parties to occupy a hundred gulags, and that's just amongst the socialists! (Later, of course, they did occupy a hundred gulags.)\n\n\n\nAfter the weak Tsar Nicholas II hopped it in March the Provisional Government was led by Kerensky, a moderate socialist. He instigated an ill-judged military intervention by General Kornilov, who tried and failed to gain power for himself. The revolution survived, but the Bolsheviki were far from likely to rise to the top.\n\n\n\nReed had free access to many of the debates in the Russian houses of parliament and a favoured access to the Bolshevik headquarters at Smolny. He didn't get to talk to Lenin or Trotsky personally but he saw them up close and heard their speeches firsthand.\n\n\n\nHis description of Lenin is worth quoting at length:\n\n\n\n'A short, stocky figure, with a big head set down in his shoulders, bald and bulging. Little eyes, a snubbish nose, wide, generous mouth, and heavy chin; clean-shaven now, but already beginning to bristle with the well-known beard of his past and future. Dressed in shabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, to be the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been. A strange popular leader\u2014a leader purely by virtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising and detached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies\u2014but with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concrete situation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectual audacity.'\n\n\n\nTrotsky cuts a much more impressive figure, with Reed describing him addressing the hall on the eve of the insurrection, where his 'thin, pointed face was positively Mephistophelian in its expression of malicious irony.'\n\n\n\nThe Bolsheviks were the extreme party, pretty much all the other parties, from their old allies the Mensheviks to the Cadets who represented the intelligentsia, were of a mind to work with capitalists and go slowly. The Bolsheviks acted, capturing the Winter Palace by merely occupying it with minimal resistance.\n\n\n\nAnd it still takes the breath away to read the proclamations they made upon assuming their shaky, largely undesired power in Petrograd. Try this for size, the first line of the first point of the Land Decree:\n\n\n\n1. The Right of private ownership of land abolished for ever\n\n\n\nJust like that!\n\n\n\nI've often asked myself, having lived my life in the first few decades of the 19th century, whether or not I would have been a socialist, concluding that the answer is probably yes. However, I like to think that I wouldn't have been convinced by Lenin and that mob.\n\n\n\nIt's not just the obvious lessons of hindsight that convinces me of that, though the paranoid brutally of Stalin (barely mentioned here so marginal a figure was he at the time) certainly besmirched the good name of communism for ever.\n\n\n\nNo, the signs of where this 'experiment' was going were there from the start in Lenin's immediate U-turn on the freedom of the press. Originally he promised that this was only a short-term measure for the duration of the civil war, then as soon as the Bolsheviks gained power we get this resolution:\n\n\n\n'The re\u00ebstablishment of the so-called \u201cfreedom of the press,\u201d the simple return of printing presses and paper to the capitalists,\u2014poisoners of the mind of the people\u2014this would be an inadmissible surrender to the will of capital, a giving up of one of the most important conquests of the Revolution; in other words, it would be a measure of unquestionably counter-revolutionary character.'\n\n\n\nThe other socialists in the house could see where this was going and disagreed strongly, which Reed faithfully reported, despite being a clear supporter of the Bolshevik cause. Not long after, Russia became a one-party state.\n\n\n\nBut the revolution never spread across the rest of Europe, which was the Bolshevik's ultimate aim. Sure, Russia's sphere of influence soon grew into the Soviet Union, but this was only achieved by coercion and conquest.\n\n\n\nAs quoted here by Reed, Trotsky famously said of the revolution: 'There are only two alternatives; either the Russian Revolution will create a revolutionary moment in Europe, or the European powers will destroy the Russian Revolution.'\n\n\n\nAnd yet neither of those two things happened.\n\n\n\nThis is a fascinating account of an extraordinary event, brought to life by Reed's closeness to it all, his hearing the speeches and talking to some of the principle players and to ordinary people in the street.\n\n\n\nI would stop short of calling it an exciting account, however. The ten days of the October Revolution certainly shook the world, but the low-key ease in which the Bolsheviks took control barely shook the streets of Petrograd at the time; the shops and theaters stayed open, most people would have been unaware that anything was going on.\n\n\n\nReed wrote well, and with an even hand despite his own allegiances. Only once did I detect an attempt to lower his guard and wax lyrical, when he attended a mass funeral (called a Brotherhood Grave) on his one flying visit to see what was happening in Moscow:\n\n\n\n'I suddenly realised that the devout Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which it was a glory to die\u2026.'\n\n\n\nI can understand him thinking that at the time, but oh how wrong he proved to be."}, {"url": "https://oceanofpdf.com/authors/john-reed/pdf-epub-ten-days-that-shook-the-world-download/", "page_content": "[PDF] [EPUB] Ten Days that Shook the World Download by John Reed.

It is a mark of the respect in which Reed was held by the Bolsheviks that Ten Days That Shook The World was published with a short but very appreciative introduction by no less than Lenin, in which the Russian socialist leader says that he would like to see Reed\u2019s book ``published in millions of copies and translated into all languages\u2019\u2019.\n\nReed was a founder member of the Communist Party of the USA and when he died in Soviet Russia shortly after the publication of the book in 1919 he was buried in the Heroes\u2019 Grave in Red Square in Moscow.\n\nThe book certainly captures the spirit of the days leading up to and following the revolution of November 7: it is based largely on notes that Reed personally took at the time, on hundreds of Russian newspapers that he collected, and is interspersed with quotes from proclamations, decrees and announcements recovered from the walls of Petrograd.\n\nSometimes the story has a dreamlike quality, with figures such as Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev fleeting past Reed in the middle of the night in the corridors of the Smolny Institute, the chaotic headquarters of the revolution. Reed\u2019s accounts of the many meetings and debates featuring the various political groupings prominent at the time have an immediacy and vividness that is hard to describe. Despite the fact that Reed was firmly on the side of the Bolsheviks, though, this is no hagiography or fake history such as those later put out by Stalin and his followers: Reed never stifles the voices of the opponents of the Bolsheviks, and there are plenty of quotes from publications and speeches from the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries. Although Reed doesn\u2019t hide his sympathies, readers are left to make up their own minds about the rights and wrongs of the case.\n\nA number of things are notable in Reed\u2019s account of the early days of the revolution. First, Stalin\u2019s name appears only twice in the course of the book, once in a list of People\u2019s Commissars and once on a proclamation, and the man himself never appears in person.\n\n* * * * Finding this article thought-provoking and useful?

A passage from Reed\u2019s notes on November 8gives a flavour: ``Smolny was tenser than ever, if that were possible. The same running men in the dark corridors, squads of workers with rifles, leaders with bulging portfolios arguing, explaining, giving orders as they hurried anxiously along, surrounded by friends and lieutenants. Men literally out of themselves, living prodigies of sleeplessness and work\u2014men unshaven, filthy, with burning eyes, who drove upon their fixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation. So much they had to do, so much! Take over the Government, organise the City, keep the garrison loyal, fight the Duma and the Committee for Salvation, keep out the Germans, prepare to do battle with Kerensky, inform the provinces what had happened, propagandise from Archangel to Vladivostok \u2026 Government and Municipal employees refusing to obey their Commissars, post and telegraph refusing them communication, railroads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains, Kerensky coming, the garrison not altogether to be trusted, the Cossacks waiting to come out \u2026 Against them not only the organised bourgeoisie, but all the other Socialist parties except the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, a few Mensheviki Internationalists and the Social Democrat Internationalists, and even they undecided whether to stand by or not. With them, it is true, the workers and the soldier-masses\u2014the peasants an unknown quantity \u2026\u201d\n\nThird, that Lenin and Trotsky \u2013 both the undisputed leaders of the revolution in Reed\u2019s narrative \u2013 had no dreams of constructing a totalitarian state or ``socialism in one country\u2019\u2019, but were fully aware of the fact that the revolution was a gamble whose success depended on the proletariat of Germany, France and Britain. As Trotsky puts it in a speech captured by Reed: ``There are only two alternatives; either the Russian Revolution will create a revolutionary movement in Europe, or the European powers will destroy the Russian Revolution!\u201d. This no doubt accounts for the fact that the book was banned in the Soviet Union following the death of Lenin, the expulsion of Trotsky and the gradual destruction of the generation of Bolsheviks involved in the revolution.\n\nDespite recognising the immeasurable odds against the success of the Revolution, Reed\u2019s book ends on an optimistic note on November 29, 1917, with the union of the Congress of Peasants and the Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies. As socialists worldwide prepare to mark the 91st anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution and as revolution stirs in South America in the early years of the 21st Century, Reed\u2019s book is worth reading and re-reading by all those who share his optimism and vision.\n\n[Reed\u2019s book is available free and in full at: www.marxists.org]"}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/tendaysthatshook0000reed_r0m9", "page_content": "This book contains historical photographs from the Russian Revolution. John Reed was on an assignment for The Masses, a magazine of socialist politics, when he was reporting the Russian Revolution. Although Reed states that he had \"tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth\" during the time of the event, he stated in the preface that \"in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral\" (since the book leans towards the Bolsheviks and their viewpoints). Ten Days That Shook the World has received mixed responses since its publication in 1919, resulting in a wide range of critical reviews from negative to positive. However, the book was overall positively received by critics at the time of its first publication, despite some critics' vocal opposition to Reed's political beliefs. George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and historian who had no love for Bolshevism and is best known as \"the father of containment,\" praised the book: \"Reed's account of the events of that time rises above every other contemporary record for its literary power, its penetration, its command of detail\" and would be \"remembered when all others are forgotten.\" Kennan saw it as \"a reflection of blazing honesty and a purity of idealism that did unintended credit to the American society that produced him, the merits of which he himself understood so poorly.\" On March 1, 1999, The New York Times reported New York University's \"Top 100 Works of Journalism\" list, which placed Ten Days that Shook the World at in seventh position\n\nAccess-restricted-item true Addeddate 2022-02-15 19:16:35 Bookplateleaf 0002 Boxid IA40365311 Camera USB PTP Class Camera Collection_set printdisabled External-identifier urn:oclc:record:1302548078\n\nurn:lcp:tendaysthatshook0000reed_r0m9:lcpdf:f0a77920-9e8a-4334-8843-af68cf65438d\n\nurn:lcp:tendaysthatshook0000reed_r0m9:epub:c23d160b-187e-4823-bcfa-135b9407d0ff Foldoutcount 0 Identifier tendaysthatshook0000reed_r0m9 Identifier-ark ark:/13960/s27rwjzbfzw Invoice 1652 Isbn 1940849330\n\n9781940849331 Ocr tesseract 5.0.0-1-g862e Ocr_detected_lang en Ocr_detected_lang_conf 1.0000 Ocr_detected_script Latin Ocr_detected_script_conf 0.9552 Ocr_module_version 0.0.15 Ocr_parameters -l eng Old_pallet IA-NS-1300247 Openlibrary_edition OL28372414M Openlibrary_work OL827976W Page_number_confidence 93.79 Pages 340 Partner Innodata Pdf_module_version 0.0.18 Ppi 360 Rcs_key 24143 Republisher_date 20220215185325 Republisher_operator associate-lyn-pestano@archive.org Republisher_time 412 Scandate 20220211005808 Scanner station32.cebu.archive.org Scanningcenter cebu Scribe3_search_catalog isbn Scribe3_search_id 9781940849331 Tts_version 4.5-initial-80-gce32ee1e Show More Show Less\n\nFull catalog record MARCXML"}, {"url": "https://www.marxists.org/archive/reed/1919/10days/10days/lenin.htm", "page_content": "John Reed\n\nTen Days that Shook the World\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith the greatest interest and with never slackening attention I read John Reed\u2019s book, Ten Days that Shook the World.

Russia, for so long an enigma, became the focus of every kind of fantastic speculation that, in the long term, would morph into many shelves of biography and history, novels of espionage, and finally, George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm.\n\nAt first, however, the Russian Revolution was simply a sensational item of world news. What could be more thrilling than the fall of the tsar, or more arresting than the triumph of the proletariat (a word now fallen into disuse)? The revolution was all the more intoxicating, because its leaders, especially Lenin and Trotsky, were brilliant newspaper copy \u2013 passionate intellectuals and articulate middle-class revolutionaries who seemed to be men of action committed to translating communist theory into their vision of a new society.\n\nBritish and American journalists flocked to Petrograd (now St Petersburg), the epicentre of the earthquake that was toppling the old autocracy, among them a young socialist from Portland, Oregon, named John (\u201cJack\u201d) Reed, who had recently graduated from Harvard with a passion for socialism.\n\nReed later wrote that Harvard had made him, and many others, \u201crealise that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities\u201d, whereupon he and his fellows turned their attention to the writings of innovative minds such as HG Wells.\n\nFrom Harvard, Reed had moved to New York to try his luck as a journalist. In 1913, he joined the staff of the Masses, edited by Max Eastman, becoming part of a journalistic milieu that included Lincoln Steffens, Ida Tarbell, John Dos Passos, Emma Goldman, and the radical playwright Eugene O\u2019Neill, as well as the feminist and journalist Louise Bryant, whom he married in 1916.\n\nOn the Masses, Reed\u2019s modus operandi, as a reporter, was to get arrested, which he regularly did, while looking for trouble. Soon, weary of provoking the US authorities, he broadened his horizons to take in the ferment in the old world as well as the new. In 1917, appalled by Woodrow Wilson\u2019s declaration of war against Germany, the newlyweds set off for Europe, and wound up in St Petersburg at the beginning of the revolution. Reed saw at once that this was his great opportunity. Where previously he had written and published poetry and flirted with the Mexican revolution, now his prose caught fire at the prospect of a worldwide socialist catharsis. Reed was exhilarated by what he was witnessing:\n\nThe last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from two pounds a day to one pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, in the final week, no bread at all. Hold-ups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down.\n\nAfter this first, thrilling encounter with revolution (Reed also met both Lenin and Trotsky), Reed and Bryant returned to the US, and became trapped in a succession of bruising lawsuits inspired by the American authorities\u2019 fear of Bolshevism. Reed\u2019s life at this time was every bit as dramatic as the world from which he had just returned. All his papers from his Russian trip were confiscated, and would not be returned for seven months. At this juncture, Reed seized his moment, not least because his wife (Louise Bryant) was about to publish her own version, Six Red Months in Russia. His editor, Max Eastman, recalls a meeting with his correspondent during the period of time when Reed shut himself away to write his account of the revolution in, he claimed, 10 days:\n\n\u201cHe was gaunt, unshaven, greasy skinned, a stark, sleepless, half-crazy look on his slightly potato-like face. He had come down after a night\u2019s work for a cup of coffee.\n\n\u201c\u2018Max, don\u2019t tell anybody where I am. I\u2019m writing the Russian revolution in a book. I\u2019ve got all the placards and papers up there in a little room and a Russian dictionary, and I\u2019m working all day and all night. I haven\u2019t shut my eyes for 36 hours. I\u2019ll finish the whole thing in two weeks. And I\u2019ve got a name for it too \u2013 Ten Days That Shook the World. Good-bye, I\u2019ve got to go get some coffee. Don\u2019t, for God\u2019s sake, tell anybody where I am!\u2019\n\n\u201cDo you wonder why I emphasise his brains? Not so many feats can be found in American literature to surpass what he did there in those two or three weeks in that little room with those piled-up papers in a half-known tongue, piled clear up to the ceiling, and a small dog-eared dictionary, and a memory, and a determination to get it right, and a gorgeous imagination to paint it when he got it. But what I want to comment on now was the unqualified, concentrated joy in his mad eyes that morning. He was doing what he was made to do, writing a great book. And he had a name for it too\u2014Ten Days That Shook the World.\u201d\n\nEastman was right. From its opening page, Ten Days has a tempo and a voice that sets it apart, in an era when reportage as a genre was still in its infancy.\n\nReed\u2019s account of what he saw continues to shape many subsequent versions of the Russian revolution\n\nSince March 1917, when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers beating upon the Tauride Palace compelled the reluctant imperial duma to assume the supreme power in Russia, it was the masses of the people, workers, soldiers and peasants that forced every change in the course of the revolution. They hurled the Miliukov ministry down; it was their soviet that proclaimed to the world the Russian peace terms\u2013\u201cNo annexations, no indemnities, and the right of self-determination of peoples\u201d; and again, in July, it was the spontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat who once more stormed the Tauride Palace, to demand that the soviets take over the government of Russia.\n\nReed never made much effort to conceal his sympathies. While he was reporting from Russia, his articles in the Masses, and especially the headline \u201cKnit a strait-jacket for your soldier boy\u201d, had inspired an indictment for sedition against the magazine. His account of the Bolshevik leadership is frankly partisan:\n\n\u201cThe Bolsheviks, then a small political sect, put themselves at the head of the movement. As a result of the disastrous failure of the rising, public opinion turned against them, and their leaderless hordes slunk back into the Viborg Quarter, which is Petrograd\u2019s St Antoine. Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviks; hundreds were imprisoned, among them Trotsky, Madame Kollontai and Kamenev; Lenin and Zinoviev went into hiding, fugitives from justice; the Bolshevik papers were suppressed.\n\n\u201cProvocateurs and reactionaries raised the cry that the Bolsheviki were German agents, until people all over the world believed it. But the provisional government found itself unable to substantiate its accusations; the documents proving pro-German conspiracy were discovered to be forgeries; and one by one, the Bolsheviki were released from prison without trial, on nominal or no bail, until only six remained. The impotence and indecision of the ever-changing provisional government was an argument nobody could refute. The Bolsheviks raised again the slogan so dear to the masses, \u2018All power to the soviets!\u2019\u2013 and they were not merely self-seeking, for at that time the majority of the soviets was \u2018moderate\u2019 socialist, their bitter enemy.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s account of what he saw continues to shape many subsequent versions of the Russian Revolution. The great film director Sergei Eisenstein based his film October (Ten Days That Shook the World) on the American reporter\u2019s work. Reed\u2019s account was romantic, partisan and intensely personal:\n\n\u201cMore potent still, [the Bolsheviks] took the crude, simple desires of the workers, soldiers and peasants, and from them built their immediate programme. And so, while the Mensheviks and socialist revolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with the bourgeoisie, the Bolsheviks rapidly captured the Russian masses. In July they were hunted and despised; by September the metropolitan workmen, the sailors of the Baltic fleet, and the soldiers, had been won almost entirely to their cause. The September municipal elections in the large cities were significant; only 18% of the returns were Menshevik and socialist revolutionary, against more than 70% in June\u2026\u201d\n\nThe power of Reed\u2019s account comes from its character as an \u201ceye-witness account\u201d. Reed was present at almost every scene he describes. He was in the room; he heard the debates; and he saw the chaos of revolution.\n\nBy night, armed patrols went through the silent streets, and on the corners soldiers and Red Guards squatted around little fires laughing and singing; in the daytime great crowds gathered on the sidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students and soldiers, businessmen and workmen.\n\nReed\u2019s work is edged with tragedy, too. On his first return to America after the October revolution, he got bogged down in a debilitating series of trials for sedition as a communist. His penchant for trouble-seeking told on his mental and physical health, and he began to suffer from insomnia and depression. By the time he set off back to Russia to participate in the second congress of the Comintern, he was visibly deteriorating from scurvy and malnutrition.\n\nAlready the revolution was disintegrating into faction fighting. Reed, always prey to the appeal of a good story, allowed himself to be seconded, on behalf of the Comintern, to another congress in Baku. The journey wrecked his health and, by the time he returned to Moscow, he was suffering from typhus. He died on 17 October 1920, was given a hero\u2019s funeral, and buried in the Kremlin Wall, a unique honour.\n\nIt is part of the myth of Ten Days that Reed should die so soon after publication, as a martyr to a great cause. In 1922, his book was republished with an encomium from Lenin himself.\n\n\u201cWith the greatest interest and with never slackening attention I read John Reed\u2019s book, Ten Days That Shook the World. Unreservedly do I recommend it to the workers of the world. Here is a book which I should like to see published in millions of copies and translated into all languages. It gives a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution.\u201d \u2013 VI Lenin\n\nTen Days That Shook the World is neither history nor polemic, but a bit of both \u2013 a rhetorical act of witness that is both authentic and unputdownable. It remains one of the great texts of American journalism: ironically, it gains an extra and paradoxical credibility from being un-fact-checked and unmediated. With all its many flaws, both ideological and literary, it remains a masterpiece of reportage.\n\nA signature sentence\n\n\u201cFrom the farthest corners of great Russia, whereupon desperate street-fighting burst like a wave, news of Kerensky\u2019s defeat came echoing back the immense roar of proletarian victory; Kazan, Saratov, Novgorod, Vinnitza \u2013 where the streets had run with blood; Moscow, where the Bolsheviks had turned their artillery against the last stronghold of the bourgeoisie \u2013 the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nThree to compare\n\nLouise Bryant: Six Red Months in Russia (1918)\n\nArthur Ransome: Six Weeks in Russia (1919)\n\nGeorge Orwell: Animal Farm (1945)"}], "After his release, John Reed Jr. continued to write and speak about Communism and the Soviet Union.": [{"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldman-john-reed-1887-1920/", "page_content": "John Reed, 1910. Library of Congress\n\n\"Even as an undergraduate he betrayed what many people believe to be the central passion of his life, an inordinate desire to be arrested.\" \u2014 Walter Lippman, 1914\n\nJohn Reed \u2014 writer, reporter, activist and playboy \u2014 was a legend even to his contemporaries. Born to a well-to-do Oregon family, a graduate of Harvard, and a steadfast socialist, Reed lived what many would call a terrifying life of his own making and desire.\n\nAdventurer\n\nIn the innocent, hopeful years before World War I, and scarcely out of Harvard, Reed embarked on a rebellious course that led him to befriend the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World), to write for Max Eastman's The Masses, to ride with the guerrilla forces of Pancho Villa, and to rush into the maw of the Russian Revolution just as the Bolsheviks brought an end to Czarist rule.\n\nBohemian Figure\n\nHe was a knight of American Bohemia, and a habitu\u00e9 of its capital, New York City's Greenwich Village. There he communed with an eclectic array of intellectuals, writers, and artists -- including Emma Goldman. His acquaintances advocated free speech and free love, and were committed to the cause of anarchism. One of them, the journalist Louise Bryant, became his wife and followed him to Russia twice -- once to write about the revolution as it continued to unfold, and once more to join her husband after his arrest and imprisonment. Reed and Bryant were determined \"to smash through the hull of custom and tradition,\" the editor Max Eastman observed, \"and touch at all times and over the earth the raw current of life.\"\n\nWar Protester\n\nWhen World War I broke out in Europe, it cast a pall over the generally pacifist \"lyrical Left.\" Reed wrote an article for The Masses entitled \"The Trader's War,\" criticizing the hypocritical mincing-machine of a war whose aim was profits through the sale of armaments. Three years later, at Emma Goldman's trial in June 1917 for obstructing the draft, Reed said the war was an \"overture to the blackest month for free men our generation has known. With hideous apathy the country has acquiesced in a regime of judicial tyranny, bureaucratic suppression and industrial barbarism. In America, law is merely the instrument for good or evil of the most powerful interest, and there are no Constitutional safeguards worth the powder to blow them to hell.\"\n\nWitness to Revolution\n\nReed's reporting of the Russian Revolution in 1917 brought him lasting fame. He arrived in Petrograd in time to witness the Bolshevik seizure of power in October. His now famous book, Ten Days That Shook the World was the first major account of the revolution to appear in America. \"From his typewriter,\" the historian Robert Rosenstone wrote, \"would flow hundreds of thousands of words about the origins and workings of Soviets, Kerensky and the Provisional Government, workers' control of factories, the state of the army, the character of the Russian people, Bolshevism, the personalities of Lenin, Trotsky, Lunacharsky and other leaders, the tangled web of foreign affairs, the meaning of counterrevolution, the implications of the revolution for the rest of the world.\" Reed's politics had always been passionately left-wing. They were now socialist in spirit, and communist in practice, meaning that his socialism responded to the Kremlin's dictates. From 1917 on, Reed's positions -- and those of other American left-wingers -- were always formed in dialogue, either for or against, with Moscow's Comintern (Communist International).\n\nTheory and Practice\n\nIn the fall of 1919, Reed made his last trip to Russia. After several months of observing how unstable Russia had become -- the government was now suppressing its citizens with summary executions -- Reed made plans to leave. The first leg of Reed's long journey home took him to the Astoria Hotel in Petrograd. Learning that Emma Goldman had just arrived in Russia after her deportation from the U.S., wrote Rosenstone, \"Jack burst into her room 'like a sudden ray of light.' Over a steaming cup of coffee, they celebrated a reunion.\" Almost immediately, Goldman brought up the uncomfortable topic of state power and demanded to know about the Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police). \"Reminded of all the old Russian revolutionists who had broken with the Bolsheviks, Jack blurted, 'You are a little confused by the Revolution in action because you have dealt with it only in theory.'\"\n\nUp Against the Revolution\n\nReed's causes often put him at mortal risk. Such was the case in Russia in 1919, as he passed through regions torn by civil war as he traveled home. He was arrested and imprisoned in Finland, just before the ship on which he stowed away was to sail to America. After his release, Reed returned to Petrograd to recover. In July 1919, he attended Comintern's Second Congress in Moscow. His militancy on the question of trade unionism alienated him from Russian leaders who had in mind consolidating their power over a populace that had to learn \"compromise\" and subjugation of individualist concerns.\n\nHero in Russia\n\nIn September 1919, at Reed's request, Louise Bryant traveled to Moscow to join her husband. She found him \"older and sadder.\" Their reunion was short-lived. Weak from prison and suffering from a long battle with kidney disease, Reed succumbed to typhus. He died on October 17, 1920, in a Moscow hospital with his Bryant by his side. He was thirty-three years old. John Reed was buried at the base of the Kremlin Wall, a Hero of the Revolution.\n\nImmortalized On Film\n\nIn 1981 actor and director Warren Beatty made a three-and-a-half-hour film based on Ten Days That Shook the World, using documentary interviews with Reed's surviving contemporaries as interludes in the film. Beatty himself played the character of John Reed, and Diane Keaton played Louise Bryant. Maureen Stapleton played Emma Goldman, winning an Oscar for her performance."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Reed", "page_content": "John Reed, (born Oct. 22, 1887, Portland, Ore., U.S.\u2014died Oct. 19, 1920, Moscow), U.S. poet-adventurer whose short life as a revolutionary writer and activist made him the hero of a generation of radical intellectuals.\n\nReed, a member of a wealthy Portland family, was graduated from Harvard in 1910 and began writing for a Socialist newspaper, The Masses, in 1913. In 1914 he covered the revolutionary fighting in Mexico and recorded his impressions in Insurgent Mexico (1914). Frequently arrested for organizing and defending strikes, he rapidly became established as a radical leader and helped form the Communist Party in the United States.\n\nHe covered World War I for Metropolitan magazine; out of this experience came The War in Eastern Europe (1916).

The author of Ten Days That Shook the World, a magnificent firsthand account of the Russian Revolution, Reed died in Moscow of typhus on October 17, 1920, five days shy of his 33rd birthday.\n\nAbout Ten Days That Shook the World, V.I. Lenin, the co-leader of the 1917 October Revolution, commented in an introduction written in 1919, \u201cUnreservedly do I recommend it [Reed\u2019s book] to the workers of the world. Here is a book which I should like to see published in millions of copies and translated into all languages.\u201d The book has had a special place in the hearts and minds of class-conscious workers ever since its appearance. It can still be recommended \u201cunreservedly.\u201d\n\nMany people may be familiar with the name of John \u201cJack\u201d Reed from the 1981 movie Reds, in which Warren Beatty portrayed the intrepid and principled journalist and for which Beatty won the Academy Award for best director.\n\nWhat the film cannot convey, among other things, however, is the vital, muscular and poetic quality that made Reed\u2019s writing so influential in his time and to later generations. Reds only hints at the full complexity of the man who, more than any American writer of his generation, followed the demands of his political conscience to their revolutionary conclusions.\n\nJohn Reed was born in Portland, Oregon on October 22, 1887 into an upper-middle-class family. His mother\u2019s father, Henry Dodge Green, was a wealthy Portland industrialist and his house a center of Portland\u2019s genteel social gatherings.\n\nReed came of age during the era of the full-blown development of American capitalism. In the 30 years following the Civil War, the US emerged as a modern industrial power. The decades saw the enrichment of the infamous Robber Barons, and the US launched its first imperialist war in 1898, seizing the Philippines and Cuba from Spain.\n\nThe urban population swelled in this period, also a time of large-scale immigration, and the working class emerged as a powerful force, expressing\u2014in a series of bitter strike struggles\u2014its determination to fight the omnivorous ruling class.\n\nReed\u2019s father, C.J. Reed, was a crusader against political corruption in Oregon, helping to take on the logging interests in his capacity as a U.S. marshal. Not having gone to college himself, C.J. was determined that Jack should attend Harvard, interceding for his son when he failed his entrance exam. Jack passed the second time. Working on and contributing to several Harvard publications, Reed honed his journalistic and editing skills. He also wrote and published a good deal of poetry and became a member of the newly formed Harvard Socialist Club.\n\nEstablishing himself in Greenwich Village in 1911, Reed was at the center of the neighborhood\u2019s bohemian culture. The Village was home to such figures as poet Hart Crane, \u201cscandalous\u201d novelist Henry Miller (who, not long before his death, describes Reed\u2019s milieu in Reds) and dramatist Eugene O\u2019Neill.\n\nIt was here, as a working writer and an editor at The American Magazine (founded in 1906), that Reed grappled with the challenge of earning a living under conditions where serious art does not pay the rent. For Reed, \u201cserious art\u201d still meant his poetry, which does not make much of an impression after more than a century, and also supplementing his income from The American by selling short stories, which, in some cases genially give a flavor of life at that time.\n\nAs Reed came to know Manhattan, however, its palaces and its squalor, he came to realize that something was fundamentally wrong with American society. In a later essay written in the months before his journey to Russia that would result in his witnessing the October Revolution, titled \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d he would recall the political awakening of his early twenties:\n\nOn the whole, ideas alone didn\u2019t mean much to me. I had to see. In my rambles about the city I couldn\u2019t help but observe the ugliness of poverty and all its train of evil, the cruel inequality between rich people who had too many motor cars and poor people who didn\u2019t have enough to eat. It didn\u2019t come to me from books that the workers produced all the wealth of the world, which went to those who did not earn it.\n\nHearing of a new arts and features magazine with a decidedly socialist orientation, called The Masses (founded in 1911), Reed quickly introduced himself to its editor Max Eastman, who would later translate many of Leon Trotsky\u2019s works into English, and climbed on board as both an editor and contributor.\n\nThough the new magazine could not pay him, Reed would find his work for this important publication his most fulfilling. The Masses was to publish the first stories of Sherwood Anderson in 1916, later to be collected in the groundbreaking Winesburg, Ohio. It published works by figures such as Jack London, the novelist Floyd Dell, and the poets Carl Sandburg and Amy Lowell. Painters John Sloan, George Bellows and Pablo Picasso contributed illustrations.\n\nBy 1913, Reed would prove a more than receptive audience member when\u2014in a Greenwich Village apartment\u2014he met William \u201cBig Bill\u201d Haywood, leader of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), the left-wing syndicalist movement. Reed listened as Haywood described the developing situation in nearby Paterson, New Jersey, where silk workers were on strike and being beaten and jailed by police. Reed, perhaps for the first time, reacted to a major story not only as a journalist but as a partisan, determined to publicize the strike and help the workers.\n\nSoon after arriving in Paterson, a naturally defiant Reed goaded a belligerent police officer into arresting him. In the county jail, overcrowded with immigrant strikers, he befriended the workers\u2014\u201cgentle, alert, brave men, ennobled by something greater than themselves\u201d\u2014and drew out their stories. That \u201csomething greater,\u201d the class struggle, can be seen at work in the article Reed wrote for The Masses (\u201cWar in Paterson\u201d), which opens:\n\nThere\u2019s war in Paterson, New Jersey. But it\u2019s a curious kind of war. All the violence is the work of one side\u2014the mill owners. Their servants, the police, club unresisting men and women and ride down law-abiding crowds on horseback. Their paid mercenaries, armed detectives shoot and kill innocent people. Their newspapers ... publish incendiary and crime-inciting appeals to mob violence against the strike leaders ... They control absolutely the police, the press, the courts.\n\nSo moved was Reed by the condition of the silk workers that he organized a dramatic pageant, held at Madison Square Garden, in which the actual workers demonstrated their onerous work and their treatment as strikers at the hands of the police.\n\nReed\u2019s best known work is Ten Days That Shook the World (1919), but he did produce other outstanding works of reportage, one of which is his account of his experiences riding with Pancho Villa\u2019s army in the Mexican Revolution, titled Insurgent Mexico (1914). The compelling work immerses the reader in the harsh, violent life of La Tropa, Villa\u2019s army, and its camp followers.\n\nAs was the case in Paterson, Reed not only sympathized politically with the peasant revolutionaries but came quickly to admire them and want their respect, which he was proud to earn. At one point in Insurgent Mexico, he writes of an initiation into La Tropa over a bottle of sotol:\n\n\u201cDrink it,\u201d yelled the chorus as the Tropa crowded up to see. I drank it. A howl of laughter and applause went up. Fernando leaned over and gripped my hand. \u201cGood for you, companero!\u201d he bellowed, rolling with mirth ... Captain Fernando leaned over and patted my arm. \u201cNow you are with the men (los hombres.) When we win the Revolucion it will be a government by the men,\u2014not by the rich. We are riding over the lands of the men. They used to belong to the rich, but now they belong to me and to the compa\u00f1eros.\u201d\n\nThe material Reed sent back to the US, published in The Metropolitan magazine, established him as America\u2019s foremost war correspondent. The writing was at once impressionistic and clear-eyed, imagistic and frank.\n\nCertainly, no more stark instance of brutal oppression could have presented itself to Reed or the world than the Ludlow Massacre of April, 1914, the culminating atrocity of the protracted southern Colorado coal miners\u2019 strike of the winter of 1913-14. Reading of the massacre, Reed immediately left for Las Animas County.\n\nThere he made a detailed search of the scene of the massacre, in which National Guard militiamen rented by John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Colorado Fuel and Iron Company killed an estimated 26 miners, their wives and children, some shot with machine guns and some deliberately burned to death in tents the miners had been living in during the strike.\n\nReed wrote a lengthy, scathing article for The Metropolitan, \u201cThe Colorado War,\u201d in July 1914, which detailed the murderous violence of the Rockefeller interests. \u201cI got into Trinidad [Colorado, 15 miles from Ludlow] about ten days after the massacre at Ludlow,\u201d Reed wrote. Later in the article, he explained:\n\nI went to Ludlow next day to see the Federal troops come in and the militia leave. The tent colony, or where the tent colony had been, was a great square of ghastly ruins. Stoves, pots and pans still half full of food that had been cooking that terrible morning, baby-carriages, piles of half-burned clothes, children\u2019s toys all riddled with bullets, the scorched mouths of the tent cellars, and the children\u2019s toys that we found at the bottom of the \u201cdeath hole\u201d\u2014this was all that remained of the entire worldly possessions of 1,200 poor people. At the railroad station about fifty militiamen waited for the train\u2014boys with the stupid, vicious faces of saloon-corner loafers. Only a few were in uniform, for many of them were mine-guards hastily mustered in. As the regulars left their train one militiaman said loudly, in the hearing of the militia officers: \u201cI hope these red-necks kill a regular so they will go in and wipe out the whole bunch. We certainly done a good job on that tent colony.\u201d\n\nIn August of that year, the world was struck by the greatest upheaval to that point in modern times. The First World War broke out in Europe. Reed sailed to Italy as a correspondent for The Metropolitan. He went to France, where he attempted twice to reach the front but was arrested and turned back both times. He then went to London, where he wrote a long article on England in wartime, showing that patriotism was limited to the upper classes. The Metropolitan rejected the article.\n\nIn \u201cThe Traders War,\u201d written from London and published in The Masses in September, Reed outlined the history of the imperialist commercial rivalries between Britain, France and Germany and stated that the war was nothing more than a continuation of these conflicts. (In a noteworthy scene in Reds, Reed [Beatty], asked at a meeting of the Liberal Club in Portland, Oregon what he thinks \u201cthis war is about,\u201d gets to his feet and replies with one word, \u201cProfits.\u201d)\n\nReed returned to France and in December made his way to Germany via Switzerland. In Berlin, he was able to conduct an interview with the revolutionary socialist Karl Liebknecht, who alone in the German Reichstag had refused to vote to fund the war. When Reed asked him about \u201cthe chances of World Revolution,\u201d \u201c\u2018To my mind\u2019 [Liebknecht] responded serenely, \u2018nothing else can come out of this war.\u2019\u201d\n\nReed and other American correspondents were able, after long delays, to secure permission to visit the German front in Northern France. Along the way they were feted by German officers and saw the horrors of trench warfare. He wrote articles on these experiences for The Metropolitan and returned to the US in January 1915.\n\nReed only stayed home a few months. By March, since he was unable to get permission to visit France again, The Metropolitan asked him to report on the war in Eastern Europe. With the artist Boardman Robinson, he visited Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia.\n\nAlmost half the articles he wrote, although Reed could not know this at the time, were about the final days of the tsarist empire with its drunkenness, abuse, and corruption organized into armies. In one article, \u201cAn Optimistic Pilgrimage\u201d that still moves the reader 105 years later, Reed passes through a Jewish village near Rovno in what is now Ukraine, and observes the filth and poverty of the Jews and their oppression by the Russians. One of his guides, a Russian army officer, complains that all Jews are traitors to Russia.\n\nThe scenes from Serbia are shocking. The first country to be invaded by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in response to the assassination of its Archduke Ferdinand in 1914, Serbia was in the middle of a typhus epidemic. Reed visited one hospital for those stricken with disease:\n\nWe entered a barrack, along whose walls cots lay touching each other, and with the feeble light of two lanterns we could see the patients writhing in their dirty blankets, five and six crowded into two beds. Some sat up, apathetically eating; others lay like the dead; still others gave short, grunting moans, or shouted suddenly in the grip of delirium.\n\nWhen Reed returned from Europe in late 1915, the official political atmosphere in the US had shifted to the right: a pro-war \u201cpreparedness\u201d campaign was underway and middle-class public opinion had become anti-German. He moved back to Greenwich Village with the woman he would marry, also from Oregon, journalist Louise Bryant. It was at this time he befriended Eugene O\u2019Neill. Reed, O\u2019Neill, Bryant and some of their circle wrote and performed plays in Provincetown, Massachusetts in the summer of 1916.\n\nThe Metropolitan refused to return him to Europe because of his antiwar views. But in the spring of 1917, two more world-shaking events occurred. In March, the Russian tsar, Nicholas II, was overthrown, and in April the United States entered the world war.\n\nThroughout the spring and summer of 1917, Reed wrote antiwar articles for The Masses. By August, he had decided he had to see the revolution in Russia for himself. Reed arrived in Petrograd on September 13, just after the attempted coup against the bourgeois Provisional Government by tsarist General Lavr Kornilov. The coup melted away largely because of the Bolsheviks\u2019 mobilization of workers and soldiers.\n\nThrough connections in New York, including Bolsheviks such as V. Volodarsky, Reed became acquainted with that party\u2019s leaders, who were now preparing the overthrow of the Provisional Government and its replacement by a government of Soviets.\n\nHe hastened from place to place in Petrograd, saving leaflets and proclamations and documenting the positions of each party. He interviewed leaders of the frightened capitalist parties, and he saw Lenin and Trotsky give speeches to thousands of workers. Reed himself spoke to countless other Bolshevik leaders, workers, soldiers and sailors, as they applied themselves to the historical task of establishing a government of the working class. He was a witness to the Bolshevik seizure of power and was present at the famous storming of the Winter Palace, as well as the struggle afterwards by the new Soviet government against counterrevolution.\n\nFor the remainder of the year Reed remained in the new Soviet Russia. He worked for the People\u2019s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs and was briefly appointed consul to the US. In early 1918, he had his first long discussions with Lenin and Trotsky. He left for home soon after, but was detained in Finland until April by the nationalist government.\n\nOn his return to New York, he was met on the dock by government agents who seized his papers and summoned him to court the next day. Reed was indicted under the Espionage Act for a 1917 article, published in The Masses, \u201cKnit a strait-jacket for your soldier boy,\u201d which describes what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nReed took up the task of defending the revolution to an American audience in such articles as \u201cSoviets in Action\u201d and \u201cThe Structure of the Soviet State\u201d published in T he Liberator (the successor to The Masses), in the autumn of 1918.\n\nIt was at this time that be took up a fight for the ideas of Bolshevism in the left wing of the American Socialist Party, along with Louis Fraina and other supporters of the Russian Revolution in the journal The Revolutionary Age. His papers from Russia were returned to him, and he worked feverishly on his description of the events he had lived through in October-November 1917. Eastman later reported that Reed wrote the book in a remarkably short period of time, sequestered in a room in Greenwich Village, seeing no one and coming out only for meals.\n\nIn March 1919, the product of this effort, Ten Days That Shook the World, was published. It was the peak of Reed\u2019s development as a journalist. He combined his own observations and conversations with the scrupulous publication of the documents of the revolution itself he had collected.\n\nHere is how Reed describes the Bolshevik headquarters, the Smolny Institute, a former upper-class girls school in tsarist times (only eight months previously!) on the day of the insurrection, November 7:\n\nThe massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up, and from every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dim in the gloom. Automobiles and motorcycles came and went; an enormous elephant-colored armored automobile, with two red flags flying from the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, and at the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bonfire. At the inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which the sentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down. \u2026 A crowd came pouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round black fur hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders, soldiers in rough dirt-colored coats and grey fur shapkas [hats] pinched flat.\n\nOn this occasion Reed encounters the Bolshevik leader Lev Kamenev. Kamenev reads out to him, translating from Russian into French, effectively the first proclamation, just passed in session, of the new Soviet government: \u201cThe new Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Government will propose immediately a just and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries \u2026 The Soviet is convinced that the proletariat of the countries of Western Europe will aid us in conducting the cause of Socialism to a real and lasting victory.\u201d\n\nAnd Reed\u2019s description of Lenin stands out:\n\nDressed in shabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, to be the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been. A strange popular leader\u2014a leader purely by virtue of intellect: colorless, humorless, uncompromising and detached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies\u2014with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analyzing a concrete situation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectual audacity.\n\n(An insightful description, aside from the characterization of Lenin as \u201ccolorless\u201d and \u201chumorless,\u201d which was anything but the case!)\n\nTen Days That Shook the World is one of the artistic achievements not only of the Russian Revolution, but of American and world literature. The fact that it inspired another great work, Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s October (1928), gives it a unique place in human culture.\n\nReed discovered the drama of the revolution in its own action, in the rapid and intense response of classes to one other in the pursuit of their social goals, expressed not only by force of arms, but by the most profound political thought. He was able to translate this into narrative and description.\n\nTen Days That Shook the World was the first time the revolution spoke in its full eloquence to the world. Lenin in his famous preface to the book, noted above, commented: \u201cWith the greatest interest and with never slackening attention I read John Reed\u2019s book, Ten Days That Shook the World. \u2026 It gives a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. These problems are widely discussed, but before one can accept or reject these ideas, he must understand the full significance of his decision. John Reed\u2019s book will undoubtedly help to clear this question, which is the fundamental problem of the international labor movement.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1919, Reed helped to launch the Communist Labor Party (one of the forerunners of the Communist Party, founded in May 1921), as it split from the opportunist Socialist Party. In October he left again for Soviet Russia and participated as an American delegate to the Second Congress of the Communist International, held from July 19 to August 7, 1920. Following that, Reed attended the Congress of the Peoples of the East in Baku in Soviet Azerbaijan, an assembly of 1,900 delegates from across Asia and Europe organized by the Communist International, which opened September 1.\n\nFrench leftist Alfred Rosmer, in Moscow Under Lenin, has a well-known description of Reed speaking at the Congress in Baku, a city famous for its petroleum industry. Rosmer noted that Reed, who had learned a few words of Russian, \u201cwas a great success. He shouted a question to his audience: \u2018Don\u2019t you know how Baku is pronounced in American? It\u2019s pronounced oil!\u2019 The solemn faces were suddenly shaken with laughter.\u201d\n\nReed returned to Moscow on September 15, fell sick with typhus and died on October 17. It is said that he might have survived if the American government had not had an embargo on medications to Soviet Russia.\n\nRosmer explained in his book that when he and others returned from Moscow, \u201ca sad piece of news greeted us. John Reed, who had returned in advance of us, was in hospital, ill with typhus. No effort was spared to save him, but it was all in vain and a few days later he died. His body was displayed in the great hall of the House of Trade Unions. On the day of the funeral, winter had already arrived and snow was falling. We were overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nRosmer continued, \u201cA burial place was found for him in the Kremlin wall, in the section reserved for heroes who had fallen in the revolutionary battle. The words of farewell were spoken by [Nikolai] Bukharin, for the central committee of the Communist Party, by [Alexandra] Kollontai, and by his comrades from the Executive Committee. Louise Bryant, who had arrived only to see him die, was there, completely shattered by grief. The whole scene was indescribably sad.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s reputation after his death has been closely tied to the fate of the Russian Revolution. The Stalinist regime that usurped the Soviet state in the next decade could not abide the truth about the revolution, and Trotsky\u2019s role in October 1917, as Reed had depicted it. Stalin is mentioned only in passing because he played virtually no role in the seizure of power. The work was banned, at Stalin\u2019s insistence, in the Soviet Union for decades.\n\nEqually, anticommunist commentators in Europe and America have sought to make Ten Days That Shook the World into a mere literary accomplishment. Some have alleged, falsely, that after disagreements over Communist tactics in 1920, Reed became disillusioned with Marxism.\n\nDespite the Stalinist and anticommunist treatment of Reed and his work, for millions of workers and young people Ten Days That Shook the World remains an indispensable introduction to the most momentous event in world history. In a time when the question of socialist revolution has been placed before millions and millions, a new generation must discover his work.\n\nTen Days That Shook the World is currently on sale at Mehring Books for $14.40."}, {"url": "https://www.magellantv.com/articles/john-reeds-fast-life-journalist-activist-and-eyewitness-to-the-russian-revolution", "page_content": "The foremost young journalist of his era, John Reed\u2019s career spanned only eight years, from 1912 to 1920. In that time, he reported on landmark labor disputes in the United States and revolutions in Mexico and Russia. In doing so, the Harvard-educated Reed became intimately connected to the causes he covered, advocating for the rights of oppressed workers and speaking against America\u2019s involvement in World War I. His coverage of the Russian Revolution drew him to what he believed was the hope that Communism offered working people, an ideal he finally died for.\n\n\u25ca\n\nJohn Reed burned brightly for eight years, then burned out. Once America\u2019s most famous journalist, he died in Moscow in 1920, not quite 33 years old. His eyewitness account of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, remains the definitive telling of the turbulent founding of the Soviet Union. By the end, Reed had become a true believer more than a passionate observer, committing himself to what he saw as the promise of Russian Bolshevism to overthrow worldwide capitalism.\n\nWatch In the Turmoil of the Russian Revolution now on MagellanTV.\n\nExactly a century after his death, American society is confronted by new forms of the domestic disruptions that Reed reported on: mass demonstrations, labor struggles, and repressive law enforcement.\n\nObservers may be excused for believing that these fractures are built into the national fabric. But in the century following Reed\u2019s death, public and private American institutions have grown to respond, however imperfectly, to endemic problems of poverty, racism, violence, corruption, and censorship. And though great progress has been made, there is a long way still to go. Few pushed that early advance with their tireless work against injustice and inequity more than John Reed.\n\nOut of the West and Out-of-Place at Harvard\n\nReed was the son of a prominent Portland, Oregon civil engineer, and grandson of the man who owned the city\u2019s water and gas companies. He was sent to Harvard University, where he wrote sketches for the vaunted Hasty Pudding Club, contributed to the Harvard Lampoon, sang in the Glee Club, and headed the football cheerleading squad. Nevertheless, Reed felt very much the Western outsider, ill-at-ease with the social customs of his very wealthy, Eastern establishment classmates.\n\nHeightening the strain, Reed\u2019s father was suffering professional setbacks after leading an investigation into Portland\u2019s municipal corruption. Working closely with him on the case was the era\u2019s foremost investigative reporter, Lincoln Steffens, author of the landmark book The Shame of the Cities. (Steffens was one of the \u201cmuckraking journalists\u201d whom President Theodore Roosevelt had in mind when he coined the phrase.) The two became friends, and Steffens was only too happy to meet with and advise young \u201cJack\u201d Reed after his graduation from Harvard.\n\nProgressive campaigns against graft, bid-rigging, and election fraud in cities across the United States were launched around the turn of the century, and by 1910 had brought long overdue reforms to local governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of school in 1910, Reed plunged into the life of New York City, leading a nearly round-the-clock existence in the radical and artistic circles of Greenwich Village. Between his Harvard connections and his curiosity about the lives of working people, Reed spent two years surveying the broad social landscape. He was as comfortable in exclusive artistic salons as he was in seamy waterfront dives. His experiences gradually resulted in a crusading passion for fairness and sympathy for workers condemned to poverty in the midst of the city\u2019s colossal corporate and private wealth.\n\nEarly Professional Success, Then A Crucial Readjustment\n\nReed was clearly a born writer who thought of himself as a poet. With Steffens\u2019 help, he soon found success contributing feature stories \u2013 everything from celebrity profiles to slice-of-life accounts of social inequity \u2013 to the leading magazines of the day: Collier\u2019s, the Century, the Metropolitan, and The Saturday Evening Post.\n\nReed was an early advocate for two young friends who went on to distinguished writing careers. The journalist Walter Lippmann founded the New Republic magazine and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1958. And the great dramatist Eugene O\u2019Neill won four Pulitzers and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936.\n\nBut after Reed\u2019s father died in 1912, his health and finances shattered in the wake of his stand against Portland\u2019s corrupt civic authority, young John became dissatisfied with his professional trajectory. In early 1913, he began contributing articles to The Masses, a vivid monthly magazine dedicated to socialist causes.\n\nJohn Reed at his desk, ca. 1914 (Image Credit: fronterad.com)\n\nReed was reporting on a textile workers\u2019 strike in Paterson, New Jersey, for The Masses when he was arrested while attempting to speak at a rally. Hoping to spread news of their demands (mainstream newspapers, beholden to clothing advertisers, sat on the story), Reed helped produce possibly the first entertainment event of its kind, one pitched to a specific social cause. Drawing on his experience with Harvard\u2019s theatrical Hasty Pudding Club, Reed put together a benefit pageant at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden that, using music and song, dramatically reenacted events from the strike.\n\nLater that year, he was in Mexico for the Metropolitan magazine, covering the ongoing revolution there. Reed spent four months with Pancho Villa's army as it successfully fought federal troops of the dictator Victoriano Huerta. His dispatches in sympathy with the landless peasants supporting Villa, and arguing against American intervention in favor of Huerta, were collected in his first book, Insurgent Mexico. Its 1914 publication solidified his status as America\u2019s leading journalist.\n\nIn 1914, Reed went to remote Ludlow, Colorado, where, on April 20, troops of the Colorado National Guard and agents working for John D. Rockefeller\u2019s mining company fired into a tent camp of striking miners, killing 20, including women and 12 children. In its immediate aftermath, fighting between troops and armed strikers left another 50 dead.\n\nReed interviewed witnesses, investigated conditions, and presented the strikers\u2019 demands that led to what was called the Ludlow Massacre. An eight-hour day, the right to live outside of company housing, and recognition of the miners\u2019 union seemed reasonable to an outraged public. A humiliated Rockefeller promptly agreed to needed reforms.\n\nRevolution in Russia, Infamy at Home\n\nWhen World War I erupted in August 1914, Reed departed for Italy, France, and Germany, where he reported on life in the trenches before America\u2019s entry in the war. By now, Reed\u2019s sympathies lay entirely with the soldiers on both sides of the horrible conflict, young working-class men conscripted to fight for kings, colonial empires, and industrialists. He was in the Balkans, on Russia\u2019s doorstep, when a rebellion among Russian troops led to the March 1917 abdication of Czar Nicholas II in favor of a socialist government.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Reed undertook a series of public talks strongly advocating against American involvement in the war. But the national mood had shifted. Reed was arrested for the crime of advising young men to refuse Army service, and The Masses, denied distribution by U.S. postal authorities, was forced to close. Dissent was outlawed in a shameful nadir for American civil liberties. In the space of a year Reed had gone from celebrity writer to national pariah.\n\nReed\u2019s short, intense life was the subject of Warren Beatty\u2019s sweeping historical drama, Reds, which was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, winning three, in 1981.\n\nIn late 1917, Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant \u2013 considered the first female war correspondent for her own work during the Great War \u2013 journeyed to St. Petersburg to cover the turmoil still dividing Russia in the wake of the Czar\u2019s abdication. The nation\u2019s legislative bodies, headquartered in the city, were split among constitutional royalist, republican, and socialist parties, the latter ranging from center-left Mensheviks to radical Bolsheviks.\n\nOver the course of five frantic months, Bryant and Reed, who spoke rudimentary Russian, covered the fierce legislative debates, political rallies, strikes, demonstrations, and battles that erupted as the fragile government of the Menshevik socialist Alexander Kerensky staggered under cascading social and military failures. Racing around the city and countryside at all hours, and at occasional risk to their lives, Reed and Bryant interviewed people on all sides of the crisis, from ministers and politicians to transit workers and peasant soldiers.\n\nSoldiers of Kerensky\u2019s provisional government in St. Petersberg\u2019s Palace Square, 1917. (Image Credit: wikipedia)\n\nKerensky was in the field with the Army command when the Bolsheviks, supported by rebel brigades demanding long-promised land reform and an end to Russia\u2019s disastrous involvement in the war, swept to power in St. Petersburg\u2019s raucous legislative Duma. Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky now led a government that immediately nationalized factories, abolished private land rights, and instituted a peace treaty with Germany.\n\nReed, recognized by Lenin and Trotsky as a celebrity reporter representing American socialists, was captivated by what he saw as a new hope for the working people of the world. Along with his notebooks, Reed collected a trove of documents \u2013 posters, flyers, manifestoes, and newspapers that he brought back to the United States in April 1918 \u2013 all of which was confiscated by federal agents who arrested Reed on charges of sedition after his ship docked in New York.\n\nReed Creates a Classic of Journalism\n\nFortunately for Reed, his mentor Lincoln Steffens used his Washington influence to have his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s material returned six months later. With it now in hand, Reed worked around the clock for three weeks to write Ten Days That Shook the World.\n\nThe marathon effort, combined with the stress of his federal indictment, broke Reed\u2019s already fragile health. And though a jury eventually found him not guilty of sedition by virtue of his right to freedom of speech, his career as a journalist was effectively over. Reed now worked full-time speaking and writing in support of the Communist Party of America, an organization he helped form.\n\nIn late 1919, Reed slipped out of the U.S. under an assumed name and forged passport, traveling to Moscow to gain official recognition for his political party (one of several claiming the Communist title) and to report on social conditions.\n\nBy then, there were indications that the Soviet regime was as oppressive as the autocratic system it replaced. Ten Days That Shook the World had reported the Bolsheviks\u2019 suspension of a free press, as well as Trotsky\u2019s explicit threats of violence toward political opponents. At the time, though, Reed considered them necessary measures a fledgling popular government had to take against fierce enemies.\n\nIn August 1920, party officials compelled Reed to make an exhausting trip to a Comintern conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. On his return, he confessed to Bryant, who had joined him in Moscow, his dismay with the casual corruption he witnessed on the journey. But it was too late for him to further investigate this subversion of the revolutionary ideal. A case of pneumonia led to a fatal bout of typhus. Reed died in a Moscow hospital, Bryant at his side. He was granted the Soviet honor of interment in the Kremlin wall, a memorial for Russian heroes.\n\nReed worked in a world at war, in the midst of unprecedented social unrest and violent revolutions, and brought to his reporting an equal force for change. If it seems he lost his way in an idealistic pursuit of justice, keep in mind that he died very young. There\u2019s no telling what else he might have accomplished, where he would have gone, or how his views may have evolved in the ensuing years. Certainly, many of his American socialist contemporaries reacted with horror to Soviet atrocities in the decades to come. Whatever his path, we may assume that Reed would not have lost his passionate regard for truth, or his commitment to the well-being of the working people of the world.\n\n\u03a9\n\nTitle Image: A parade of striking soldiers in St. Petersberg, 1917.

He attended Harvard University, where he began his writing career by serving on the editorial boards of Lampoon and Harvard Monthly. Reed joined the staff of the leftist periodical The Masses in New York City in 1913. The following year he participated in the uprising of Pancho Villa in Mexico. In 1917, Reed, a Leninist sympathizer, interviewed the leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The resulting work, Ten Days that Shook the World, was his most well known.\n\nAfter his return to the United States, Reed helped found the Communist US Labor Party in 1919 and served as its first chairman.

Reed was honored as a Soviet hero and buried under the Kremlin wall. Some 13 years later, the Nazis burned his account of the Bolshevik Revolution for its Communist sympathies."}, {"url": "https://jacobin.com/2017/12/john-reed-ten-days-shook-world-russian-revolution/", "page_content": "John Reed arrived in Petrograd at the dawn of history. The globetrotting journalist had traveled to Russia with his feminist wife Louise Bryant as soon as news of impending revolution broke. It was 1917, and \u201cJack,\u201d as his friends knew him, had a front-row seat to the October Revolution.\n\nFamous for his vivid firsthand accounts of labor conflict and war, Reed was the perfect writer to tell the electrifying story of Lenin and the Bolsheviks seizing power. Ten Days that Shook the World, Reed\u2019s celebratory account of the Russian Revolution, is now hailed as an American classic. George Kennan of all people praised it as \u201ca reflection of blazing honesty and a purity of idealism.\u201d In a recent New York Times retrospective, Condoleezza Rice, no Bolshevik, writes that Ten Days \u201cprovided a riveting and vivid \u2014 if not impartial \u2014 account of the most pivotal phase of the revolution, as viewed from the ground.\u201d\n\nBut Reed\u2019s \u201cslice of intensified history,\u201d as he called it, had trouble finding an audience at first. \u201cHere by wide acknowledgement,\u201d a sympathetic Reed biographer wrote, \u201cwas a great American journalist, an eyewitness to the greatest story of the time, but not an editor outside the tiny radical press would give him an inch of space.\u201d\n\nOnly Max Eastman, who published the left-wing little magazine The Masses, was willing to assign Reed to cover the Russian Revolution. But while Reed was in Russia, the US government shut down The Masses. Reed and other writers had been editorializing against American entry into World War I, which it turns out was a violation of the 1917 Espionage Act. To make matters worse, upon Reed\u2019s homecoming in 1918 customs officials seized his trunk full of notes and materials on the revolution, delaying his book by several months. Eastman founded a new magazine, The Liberator, and published Reed\u2019s essays on the revolution, but only after preempting the censors by toning down Reed\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\n\nIn the face of state suppression, the publishers and editors of the widely circulated papers that had previously published Reed\u2019s essays \u2014 American Magazine, Collier\u2019s, Saturday Evening Post, Metropolitan Magazine \u2014 stayed silent. Whereas Ten Days earned Reed burial at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, one of only two Americans to receive that honor \u2014 the famous Wobbly Big Bill Haywood is the other \u2014 Reed\u2019s adoring take on the Russian Revolution also merited him the scorn of the American publishing world. Reed\u2019s glowing evaluation of the \u201cgreat Lenin,\u201d \u201cloved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been,\u201d was held in high contempt by a liberal intellectual culture that had once embraced the daring reporter.\n\nNothing in Reed\u2019s early biography suggested he would become a renowned radical. Born into a wealthy Oregon family, he attended a posh East Coast prep school before making his way to Harvard, where he discovered his talents as a writer. After college Reed sought out bohemia among the intellectuals and artists of Greenwich Village. His early New York essays, observations of his extensive wanderings through teeming immigrant neighborhoods, exhibited a cosmopolitan sensibility. But they were also expressed in the rather apolitical idiom of romanticism. Reed\u2019s work took a more political turn when he began writing for The Masses, which mixed aesthetic experimentalism with Marxism.\n\nReed\u2019s political transformation was further ignited by his experience covering the 1913 silk strike in Patterson, New Jersey. Outraged by the weavers\u2019 meager wages, poor working conditions, long workdays, and the brutal treatment they received at the hands of the police, Reed joined their picket line and was promptly thrown in jail for four days. While behind bars he became engrossed by the life stories told by the striking silk workers, engendering a sympathy for the working class that remained steadfast the rest of his life. Reed proceeded to dramatize the strike in a pageant that he produced at Madison Square Garden, a fascinating story told in Jeremy McCarter\u2019s entertaining book, American Radicals: In the War for American Ideals (which includes profiles of Reed, Eastman, Walter Lippmann, Alice Paul, Randolph Bourne).\n\nIn establishing a reputation as a first-rate reporter fearlessly willing to go wherever a good story took him, Metropolitan Magazine sent the twenty-six-year-old Reed on assignment to cover the Mexican Revolution in 1914. He mailed home remarkable stories of his four months eating, drinking, sleeping, traveling, and fighting alongside Pancho Villa\u2019s guerrilla peasants. Even as Reed\u2019s Mexico essays were exquisite in detail, they lacked the sophisticated geopolitical awareness of his later writings about World War I and the Russian Revolution. And yet he had learned something. Upon his return, Reed advised against American intervention in the Mexican Revolution, and castigated his fellow journalists for depicting Villa as a villain. What Reed had seen in Mexico with his own eyes contradicted what reporters were writing from the safety of their Manhattan salons.\n\nReed noticed a similar gap between what the press wrote and what he witnessed while reporting on the miners\u2019 strike in Ludlow, Colorado, where two dozen mostly women and children were massacred. This rift pushed Reed to conduct research that would allow him to make broader connections between the state repression of impoverished immigrant workers and their families, and the larger political economy of mining. In the words of a biographer, his Ludlow efforts \u201cmarked his growth as a class-conscious writer not easily satisfied with recording his impressions but who must dig deeper into the play of forces behind them.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his Mexico and Colorado reporting, Reed had achieved a degree of infamy among polite society. In 1914, Walter Lippmann wrote a sneering New Republic profile of his former Harvard classmate, titled \u201cLegendary John Reed.\u201d In Lippmann\u2019s estimation, the only higher principle Reed stood for was the right to an adventure, and upsetting bourgeois norms was the grandest of all escapades. \u201cReed is one of the intractables, to whom the organized monotony and virtue of our civilization are unbearable,\u201d Lippmann wrote. \u201cYou would have to destroy him to make him fit.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s reporting on World War I failed to put his critics at ease. From the outset of the Great War, Reed was skeptical of all sides in what he called a \u201ctraders\u2019 war.\u201d Lippmann disgusted him in particular for touting the war in idealist terms. From the ghastly killing fields that Reed beheld with his own eyes, such posturing was a sick joke. His antiwar stance, which became even more pronounced when Woodrow Wilson broke his campaign promise to keep the United States out of the war, damaged his career prospects. So too did his budding communist activism. Such heresies preconditioned the press to deny him a platform to tell the story of the Russian Revolution. And yet, after seeing his remarkable essays in The Liberator, the intrepid publishing house Boni & Liveright published and aggressively marketed Ten Days that Shook the World. Moreover, being cut off from most of the rest of liberal intellectual culture freed Reed to write Ten Days his own way, which allowed for the book\u2019s timeless feel.\n\nI recently re-read Ten Days alongside China Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s sublime new book, October: The Story of the Russian Revolution. Despite the fact that Mi\u00e9ville has the benefit of 100 years of historiographical hindsight, and despite the fact that Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s book narrates the period between the February and October Revolutions \u2014 as opposed to Ten Days which focuses on the few weeks leading up to the Bolsheviks taking power \u2014 Reed\u2019s masterpiece holds up extremely well by comparison. In fact, Mi\u00e9ville uses Ten Days as one of his most telling primary sources.\n\nTen Days is not an impartial account of the Russian Revolution. Condoleezza Rice is right about that. In the preface, Reed wrote that his book is the story of how \u201cone hundred and sixty million of the world\u2019s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty.\u201d Nothing neutral there. But Reed\u2019s position on the revolution did not render his account untrue. \u201cIn the struggle my sympathies were not neutral,\u201d Reed admitted. \u201cBut in telling the story of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.\u201d\n\nTen Days is splendid precisely because of Reed\u2019s developed sense of class consciousness. Reed wrote, in the midst of describing the extremely tense situation prior to the revolution, that \u201cto Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to such a fever pitch.\u201d But it was not incredible to him, a fact that allowed Reed to hear things that others might have missed. For instance, Reed heard an industrialist, frustrated that workers, soldiers, and peasants continued to agitate against the bourgeois government that had been formed in the wake of the February Revolution, say, \u201cWinter was always Russia\u2019s best friend. Perhaps now it will rid us of Revolution.\u201d\n\nReed and his partner Bryant were everywhere in the pitched days of the revolution. With almost unlimited access granted to them by both the crumbling government of Alexander Kerensky and the rising Bolshevik movement led by Lenin and Trotsky, Reed bore witness to seemingly every momentous event. Either that, or his observations, recorded for posterity in Ten Days, have become some of the landmarks by which we remember the revolution.\n\nI give you two examples. First, Reed\u2019s riveting narrative of the Second Congress of the Soviets. This raucous meeting took place on the eve of the revolution and is infamous because the Mensheviks and other moderate left groups abandoned it. The Mensheviks wanted to keep the February coalition together and thus rejected the October revolution that had been brewing in the streets of Petrograd. The Bolsheviks wanted the Congress to support the second, radicalized revolution and, given that they had majority control that is exactly what happened, thus precipitating the Menshevik departure. In retrospect, this split is momentous because it made post-revolutionary peace more difficult to achieve \u2014 in fact the Mensheviks fought alongside the counterrevolutionaries in the civil war that followed the October Revolution.\n\nThus it has often been argued that the Bolshevik-Menshevik split set the stage for the disasters of one-party rule. Reed captured a Trotsky speech following the Menshevik walkout that has long served to indict the Bolsheviks for their antidemocratic tendencies in spite of the fact that the Mensheviks could just as easily have been blamed for not accepting the will of the Soviets (Mi\u00e9ville makes this latter argument). \u201cAll these so-called Socialist compromisers, these frightened Mensheviki,\u201d Trotsky spoke, \u201clet them go! They are just so much refuse which will be swept into the garbage-heap of history!\u201d\n\nAnother striking example: after the Bolsheviks captured the Winter Palace, thus spelling the doom of the Kerensky government, Reed and Bryant began making their way to the palace through the jubilant streets of Petrograd. Along the way they happened to arrive at a Bolshevik checkpoint simultaneously with a group of Mensheviks who were hoping to get into the palace to make one last, largely symbolic stand for the doomed provisional government. When the soldiers forbid them to pass, the Mensheviks threatened to push through and asked, \u201cwhat will you do to stop us?\u201d One of the soldiers said, \u201cWe will spank you!\u201d This interaction, recorded by Reed in Ten Days, has grown into a classic example of the contempt that the newly empowered rank-and-file held for their former leaders. It truly was a new day in Russia.\n\nI dare anyone to read Ten Days that Shook the World (or, for that matter, Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s October) and conclude that the Russian Revolution was perpetrated by a small conspiracy of committed communists, as so many Americans and others have long since believed. Millions of Russians had had enough with the war, the hunger, the endless humiliations that accompanied living in such a deeply unequal society. \u201cIt was against this background of a whole nation in ferment and disintegration that the pageant of the Rising of the Russian Masses unrolled.\u201d The rank-and-file \u2014 soldiers, workers, peasants \u2014 made the revolution. Lenin, Trotsky, and the other Bolshevik leaders merely had the temerity to step into the breach left by the failed provisional government.\n\nBut even as the revolution was people-powered \u2014 even as it was fueled by hunger and deprivation \u2014 it was about ideas! Ten Days makes this clear on multiple occasions. Everywhere Reed went he noticed that people were reading and talking politics, history, philosophy. \u201cFor months in Petrograd, and all over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune.\u201d Revolutionary Russia was alive with big ideas.\n\nSome of these ideas were old, ideas first thought up by Marx and other western philosophers. But some ideas and words were new, too. As a doorman at a building taken over by the Petrograd Soviet told Reed: \u201cI don\u2019t know what is becoming of poor Russia. All these Mensheviki and Bolsheviki \u2026 This Ukraine and this Finland and this German imperialists and this English imperialists. I am forty-five years old, and in all my life I have never heard so many words as in this place \u2026\u201d\n\nTen Days that Shook the World continues to have a lot to teach us about the Russian Revolution that took place one hundred years ago. But the best part of the book \u2014 that which will continue to stand the test of time \u2014 is the unparalleled prose. A few examples are in order. To conclude the climactic chapter \u2014 which detailed the hours when the Bolsheviks came to power \u2014 Reed wrote:\n\nSo. Lenin and the Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection, the Petrograd Soviet had overthrown the Provisional Government, and thrust the coup d\u2019etat upon the Congress of Soviets. Now there was all great Russia to win \u2014 and then the world! Would Russia follow and rise? And the world \u2014 what of it? Would the peoples answer and rise, a red world-tide? Although it was six in the morning, night was yet heavy and chill. There was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silent streets, dimming the watch-fires, the shadow of a terrible dawn grey \u2014 rising over Russia \u2026\n\nReed concluded Ten Days in equally memorable fashion:\n\nI suddenly realized that the devout Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which it was a glory to die \u2026\n\nThat closing line made Reed a prophet of sorts. Not for forecasting the course of the Soviet Union \u2014 on that he was enormously and tragically wrong. Rather, Reed seems to have anticipated that he would pay the ultimate price for his devotion to the Russian Revolution. After illegally returning to Russia in 1919 with sedition charges hanging over his head, and then after the US government prevented him from returning home to face those charges, Reed fell ill with typhus. Due to a blockade imposed by the Western nations waging war against the fledgling communist state, he was unable to receive proper medical treatment.\n\nReed died an untimely death in Moscow on October 17, 1920, five days shy of thirty-three."}, {"url": "https://www.equaltimes.org/reasserting-the-importance-of", "page_content": "John Reed \u2013 journalist, poet, adventurer, political activist and workers\u2019 rights defender \u2013 is the author of the landmark chronicle of the October Revolution of 1917.

Both of these works and Reed\u2019s career now constitute an invaluable example of engaged journalism committed to social justice while ensuring truthful reporting, respect for sources and the indispensable need for the journalist to be where the news is happening.\n\nReed was a forerunner of narrative or literary journalism, capable of taking his readers to the scene of the events and giving them a sense of the atmosphere surrounding them, many decades before Tom Wolfe made it fashionable under the generic term \u2018new journalism\u2019 or authors such as Rodolfo Walsh, Truman Capote, Gay Talese or Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez elevated it to the category of a literary genre.\n\nOne of Reed\u2019s \u2018brothers in arms\u2019 and author of one of the most insightful introductions to Ten Days that Shook the World (1919), journalist Albert Rhys Williams, wrote a highly detailed portrayal of the US journalist in action in the full throes of the Revolution: \u201cHe collected material wherever he could find it, moving from place to place. He collected complete files of the Pravda and Izvestia, all the proclamations, booklets, posters, and announcements. Posters were a special passion. Every time a new poster appeared, he did not hesitate to tear it from the wall if there was no other way of getting it.\u201d According to Williams: \u201cThose who wanted to be abreast of contemporary affairs needed only to follow John Reed, for he always hastened, a kind of storm bird, to wherever big things happened.\u201d\n\nJohn Reed, journalist, poet, adventurer, political activist and workers\u2019 rights defender, is the only US citizen whose remains are buried in the most sacrosanct place in the Russia that inherited the Soviet Union, the foot of the Kremlin Wall.\n\nThis empire of empires was to emerge a few years after the triumph of the Revolution, in October and November 1917, an event Reed recounted in a way few others could aspire to.\n\nJohn Reed was born into a wealthy family in Portland, Oregon, on 22 October 1887. The future chronicler of conflicts and revolutions graduated from Harvard in 1910 and his interests soon turned from adolescent heroic fantasies towards the social struggle and journalism. In 1913, Reed\u2019s life reached a turning point that shaped his political engagement. Having joined the staff of The Masses, a socialist publication headed by Max Eastman, Reed covered a series of serious labour disputes in the United States that reinforced his vision of journalism as a tool for denouncing social injustice. War in Paterson, his article on the silk workers\u2019 strikes in New Jersey dates back to that time. As an uncomfortable witness to such labour struggles, Reed had his first experience as a guest of the federal prison system, one that would be repeated throughout his life, including in Finland, where he was imprisoned many years later on suspicion of spying for Bolshevik Russia.\n\nBeing on the scene\n\nReed travelled to Mexico in 1913 as a correspondent for Metropolitan Magazine, to cover the Mexican Revolution for almost four months. During his time there, he was able to interview and develop a good rapport with the guerrilla and revolutionary leader Pancho Villa, who fondly nicknamed the US correspondent \u2018Chatito\u2019. The 1914 book Insurgent Mexico was the result of those months spent chronicling the war and the insurrection, a book that would earn him great prestige as a war correspondent and paved the way for his journey to Europe, where he was sent to cover the First World War.\n\nIn The Traders\u2019 War, an article written in September 1914 for The Masses, Reed explained that the war in Europe was, in fact, a \u201cclash of traders\u201d. In The Worst Thing in Europe, an article also written for The Masses, in March 1915, he gave a brief insight into Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary might\u201d, a presage of what was to come two years later, when its army fell apart, abandoned the front and joined the Revolution: \u201cThe Russian army, inexhaustible hordes of simple peasants torn from their farms, blessed by a priest, and knouted into battle for a cause they had never heard of\u2026,\u201d wrote Reed.\n\nOne of the keys to Reed\u2019s ability to describe events with such precision, and irrespective of his own political assessment of them, is that he was always on the scene of the events as they were happening.\n\nUnlike now, in the midst of the 21st century, when the internet has become the main source of information and an excuse for not sending reporters to the scene of events, a century ago, if you wanted to write with sufficient accuracy and objectivity about any event, the Russian Revolution, for example, you had to be in Petrograd, in Moscow or on board the convoy that carried the forces of Alexander Kerensky\u2019s provisional government to crush the Bolsheviks in the imperial city.\n\nAnd that is what John Reed did. That is why he headed to Petrograd, now St. Petersburg, to give a first-hand account of the by then unstoppable Revolution. John Reed and his then partner, Louise Bryant, a feminist, left-wing activist and also a journalist, set off for Europe at the end of August 1917, with Petrograd as their final destination. It was the start of their Russian adventure.\n\nThe US journalist described in great detail the events rapidly unfolding in Russia and that formed part of the history of those \u201cten days that shook the world\u201d. In a report sent to The New York Call on 22 November 1917, but which corresponds to the events of 7 November according to the Gregorian calendar (25 October 1917 according to the Julian calendar followed in Russia at the time), Reed offered this brief insight into one world that was collapsing and another that was emerging: \u201cThis morning I was at the scene of the dispersal of the Junkers [military school cadets] defending the Winter Palace by the Soviet troops. In the afternoon I was present at the opening of the All-Russian Assembly of Soviets. In the evening I witnessed the assault on the Winter Palace, entering with the first Bolsheviki troops.\u201d\n\nIn his 1975 biography of the journalist, Romantic Revolutionary, Robert A. Rosenstone writes that the Revolution was a \u201cdream incarnate\u201d for Reed, who \u201csoared into a realm of visionary transcendence\u201d. Many in the United States had an exotic and mystical notion of Russia at the turn of the century. It was the land of the \u201cSlavic soul\u201d, a mystical force expressed by figures such as Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Stravinsky or Diaghilev, the \u201cpolar opposite\u201d to America\u2019s materialism and pragmatism, according to Rosenstone.\n\nThe human tragedy of the First World War and the February 1917 revolution that toppled Tsar Nicholas II put an end to that, and what was happening in Russia started to be viewed as an almost millennium-long struggle between autocracy and democracy. Reed himself went on to apologise for not having understood what was happening from the outset. In an article for The Masses, in July 1917, prior to the tsunami of the October Revolution, Reed noted that although the focus in the analysis of Russia during those world war years was placed on its role in the struggle, the real key was the long frustrated uprising of the Russian masses, the purpose of which was to establish \u201ca new human society on earth\u201d. And even then he forecast that the drivers of this change would be the Soviets, \u201cthe real revolutionary heart of the New Russia\u201d.\n\nPascual Serrano, journalist and expert in international politics, underlines John Reed\u2019s ability to understand and interpret the events of the Russian Revolution, something which left Russian historians and scholars astonished from the outset. Serrano, author of the 2011 book Contra la Neutralidad (Against Neutrality), in which he analyses John Reed\u2019s commitment to the truth and social rights, explains that this insight may have been due to the fact that he was a \u201cforeign\u201d correspondent, capable of perceiving details that a local analyst would perhaps overlook.\n\nFor Serrano, who also refers in his book to the committed journalism of authors such as Rodolfo Walsh, Robert Capa, Edgar Snow and Ryszard Kapuscinski, another of Reed\u2019s skills was to give a voice to the leading characters of the stories, whether it be the striking textile workers in Paterson, United States, in the uprising in the dusty lands of northern Mexico, in the trenches of the Great War or in the Smolny Institute in Petrograd, where the Bolsheviks set up their headquarters. The aim was to break down false stereotypes through information and truthful reporting. Reed makes this clear in the preface to his book on the Russian Revolution:\n\n\u201cIn the struggle my sympathies were not neutral. But in telling the story of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.\u201d\n\nIn 1919, a year before he fell fatally ill with typhus, Reed was able to publish his most popular work, despite the obstacles put in his way by the conservative, anti-communist forces in the United States. Reed was not only confronted with condemnation on this front, but also with criticism from the inert socialist movement in his country at the time. Reed was a member of the Third International, but he was not forgiven, in socialist circles, for his independence, and not least his imagination. Max Eastman, editor of The Masses, summarised the situation in a speech paying tribute to Reed. He said, \u201cJohn Reed was confronted with the choice between popular and profitable hypocrisy in the capitalist journals, and lonely disreputable truth in the revolutionary press. And he chose the truth\u201d."}, {"url": "https://publicseminar.org/2017/11/john-reed-romantic-revolutionary/", "page_content": "\u201cThis class struggle sure plays hell with your poetry.\u201d\n\nThe words are those of John Reed, American poet, fiction writer, journalist, radical, socialist, and finally communist, whose biography I wrote more than four decades ago. He used that phrase in 1919 in conversation with Max Eastman, editor of the radical little magazine, The Masses, and its successor, The Liberator. Reed was then deeply involved in contentious and time-consuming leftist politics as one of the leaders of a group that broke away from the Socialist Party to form the Communist Labor Party. He had just completed writing Ten Days That Shook the World, a classic that is at once an eye-witness report and a history of the Bolshevik Revolution. Yet despite his radical activities and writings, to me Jack Reed is best understood as someone who lived and saw the world through the eyes of a poet.\n\nOctober 22, was the 130th anniversary of his birth. He only lived to the age of 33, but in those few years he accomplished the work of more than a single lifetime. For the next half century Ten Days would define how much of the world came to understand the shape and course of the Russian Revolution. It also \u2014 though I have never been able to find precise figures \u2014 must have been one of the most widely circulated books of the twentieth century. Translated into dozens of languages and promoted by every communist party in the world, it was in theory read by all party members as a roadmap for a twentieth-century revolution.\n\nReed was an early contributor to Harriet Monroe\u2019s famed little magazine, Poetry, which began publishing in 1912 and continues to this day. During its first year of publication, Reed was one of ten award-winning poets. The competition for space in the journal was fierce. In its pages that year were some of the most formidable poets of the century: William Butler Yeats, Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Radbindranath Tagore.\n\nReed led what I would call a poetic, romantic, or even an epic life. He sought out the most intense experiences, threw himself into new and often dangerous situations \u2014 labor conflict, wars, revolutions \u2014 at home and abroad, the final one being the uprising he witnessed in Petrograd in 1917. To his contemporaries, as to us, he could seem to be a figure out of a novel, someone who was a little (a lot?) larger than life, and \u2014 it must be admitted \u2014 more than a touch ambitious and egocentric in his quest for truth, justice, art, and love. He was often in the news for being arrested at a strike or protest rally, directing an Industrial Workers of the World pageant at Madison Square Garden, having himself declared persona non grata in two countries for picking up a rifle and firing a shot from a German trench towards France, or pursuing an affair with the rich and famous salon hostess, Mabel Dodge, across two continents.\n\nJack Reed was born literally and figuratively at the top, on Cedar Hill overlooking Portland in 1887 at the home of his grandfather, Henry Green, one of the great pioneer capitalists of the Northwest. His businessman father was something of a maverick: a progressive in a conservative town, he played a role in Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s prosecution of the timber barons who had been illegally seizing government forests. He was a sickly child with serious kidney problems. Confined to home for several years, he lived through books, particularly Arthurian tales of knights, dragons, and damsels in distress. Such notions of romance never fully left him. Among his papers when he died in 1920 were sketches of two novels that he had been working on while stuck for several months in a prison in Finland on his way home from the Russian Revolution. One was a romance titled The Ever Victorious, about the final battlefield struggles of an aged medieval king. The other, a kind of proletarian romantic epic of the sort that John Dos Passos would later write, was a partially autobiographical work that dealt with the rise of modern industry, and the labor and radical movements in the twentieth century.\n\nEarly in life, Jack knew he wanted to be a writer. Some of his first sketches are about camping trips he and friends took up the Willamette River. His parents sent him to a private high school, Morristown Academy, in New Jersey. He went on to Harvard as a member of the Class of 1910, which included Walter Lippmann and T.S. Eliot. Harvard in those years was a place of ferment in the arts and social thought, the early twentieth century\u2019s equivalent of Berkeley or other campuses in the sixties. There Reed became involved in a multiplicity of activities \u2014 football cheerleader, Socialist Club member, writer for and editor of various campus papers, literary reviews, and the distinctly upper-class club, Hasty Pudding, for which he penned its annual play. Yet it was at Harvard that he began to see himself as a Westerner, which to him meant someone who lived large and outside the norms of polite society, someone who was free to indulge in unusual and forbidden activities. One good example: in 1910 a tour of the continent was de rigeur for Harvard grads (all men of course), but Reed did the tour his own way. Not in luxury, but by working on a cattle boat. And though he did have a formal suit made for him in London to attend some swanky affairs at the American Embassy, he walked and hitch-hiked his way across much of the continent, even marching across parts of Spain, not one of the normal destinations on such graduation tours.\n\nAfter returning to the US, there was only one place for an aspiring writer to live: Greenwich Village. In the decade prior to the World War, it was the center of that first great flourishing of American bohemia, an unstable but heady mixture of avant-garde art, lifestyle innovation, and radical politics. Reed was soon friends with major artistic and radical political figures of the day: artists John Sloan and George Bellows; writers Floyd Dell and Lincoln Steffens; anarchist Emma Goldman; activist Margaret Sanger; and labor leader Bill Haywood, president of the Industrial Workers of the World. He quickly became one of the editors of The Masses, the main underground (i.e., small circulation) organ of the Village. Sometime during this period an uptown feature writer labeled Reed the \u201cGolden Boy of Greenwich Village.\u201d The label stuck, though no doubt some villagers used it ironically. But already in his mid-twenties, he was a counter cultural hero.\n\nIn 1912 Reed was publishing in both the underground press and commercial magazines \u2014 sketches, short stories, and poems. He made his living as a freelance writer and a journalist, sometimes writing for large circulation, slick magazines. He covered events and people both trivial and important, on occasion interviewing or doing profiles of figures like William Jennings Bryan, Evangelist Billy Sunday, Socialist Eugene V. Debs, and President Woodrow Wilson. But the specialty that made him famous or notorious (take your pick) was his reporting from the site of major industrial upheavals. The first time he was arrested for talking back to a cop was during the strike of IWW silk workers in Paterson, New Jersey in 1913, a strike that was being totally blacked out in the New York City press. A year later he was in Ludlow, Colorado, reporting on how the National Guard had shot down in cold blood more than 25 striking coal miners in their encampment. Reed wrote about strikes with such power and identification with the workers \u2014 his favorites were the Wobblies \u2014 that he ended up in jail several more times for vocally defending their rights.\n\nIn mid-1914 the popular, mass circulation Metropolitan Magazine sent him off to cover the revolution that was unfolding in Mexico. Unlike other American reporters who sat in El Paso and interviewed refugees from the conflict, Reed waded across the Rio Grande, hitched a ride in a donkey car with an itinerant Arab peddler, and made his way to Chihuahua where he met and hung out for a while at the headquarters of the legendary Pancho Villa, who gave him a nickname, Chatito (Pug Nose). Then Jack went off and spent six weeks riding with a troop of Villa\u2019s horseback soldiers, living with them and fleeing with them during a major retreat. His electric, visceral reporting, and especially his front-line stories from the crucial Battle of Torreon, turned him into the highest paid journalist in the country ($500 a week plus $500 for every article; $500 equaling $12,300 in 2017 currency). His weekly stories were advertised with a fanciful sketch of Reed, drawn by an artist, standing on a battlefield, sombrero on his head and bandoliers of cartridges across his chest.\n\nThough now a famous figure, Reed did not give up his attachment to the thriving culture of the Village. He continued to publish in and work as an editor of The Masses, backed Margaret Sanger in her campaign for birth control, and was one of the founding members of that avant-garde theater company, the Provincetown Players, which produced the first works of the great playwright Eugene O\u2019Neill. His leftism was instinctual rather than theoretical, though towards the end of his life he did get around to reading a bit of Marx. When the First World War broke out, he wrote an essay in The Masses titled, \u201cA Trader\u2019s War.\u201d This attitude was only strengthened after a 1914 tour as a reporter for the Metropolitan on both the Western and the Eastern Fronts in France and Germany. His writing suffered. He could not draw emotional creativity from the slaughter of the trenches. A year later he was in the Balkans, where he walked across endless fields of corpses, and denounced the struggle between Austria-Hungary and Serbia as dreadful and meaningless.\n\nI am here subordinating his love life, including his many affairs in the Village and abroad, and his love for Louise Bryant, who became his wife, to Reed as writer and activist. Louise has a major role in my book and in the film Reds, where their stormy days together go on way too long for my taste. But their relationship says something about Village culture in those days. When they got married because he was in danger a lot and wanted her to be his legal heir, they kept the act a secret from their friends, ashamed of having such a traditional sanction for their life together. Several times they separated, but she did accompany him to Russia and later wrote her own book, Six Months in Red Russia, about staying on in the new Soviet Union after his demise. I am also leaving out his many illnesses, including his repeated kidney troubles and eventual surgery. When he was in Russia, Reed was a man with only one kidney.\n\nAs the US edged towards and then entered the conflict in 1917, Jack, both in print and on the podium at mass rallies, denounced American involvement, and got himself arrested and jailed a couple of more times. These antiwar activities got him banned from all major US commercial publications, including the Metropolitan. By mid-1917 the highest paid reporter in the country was now out of work, his only outlets the newspaper, the Socialist Call, and The Masses. Soon even the latter was gone, banned from postal circulation by the U.S. government. In 1919 he stood trial twice with other editors under the Sedition Act, but they were not convicted. His offense: a headline he put over a medical report from the UK that talked about how many soldiers were suffering from Shell Shock, or what we would call PTSD. The headline read: \u201cKnit a straightjacket for your boy.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1917, Reed\u2019s reportorial nose sniffed a major story brewing in Russia, which had gone through a \u201cdemocratic\u201d revolution a few months earlier. He borrowed money from a friend, got an assignment from two tiny leftist publications, and went off to Petrograd, a perilous journey in seas full of German submarines sinking American ships. He arrived just a few weeks before the October Revolution and went everywhere in Petrograd: to the cafes on the Nevsky Prospekt where writers gathered; factories in the Viborg district where workers debated which parties to support; the Winter Palace, where Prime Minister Kerensky lived in the Tsar\u2019s old chambers; the Marinsky Palace, seat of the Provisional Government; Smolny Institute, where the Bolsheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries made their headquarters; the trenches on the front lines in nearby Latvia. He interviewed everyone from factory workers to Kerensky, Leon Trotsky, and the leader, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Through American government intervention, he was stopped in Finland on the way home and jailed in solitary confinement. Freed after two months, he returned to New York where officials met him on the docks and seized a trunk load of papers he had collected in Petrograd. It took influential friends almost a year to spring them free.\n\nDifficult as it is to believe, he wrote Ten Days That Shook the World in two months. Following its publication, he helped to organize the Communist Labor Party of the United States, then returned to Moscow as the tiny party\u2019s representative to the Second Congress of the Communist International, where he argued with Bolshevik leaders over the tactics of how to bring the revolution to America. Annoyed at their support for the AFL rather than the IWW, he resigned when he was outvoted, then reconsidered and withdrew his resignation before going off to the Congress of the Peoples of the East in Baku. There he contracted the typhus that would kill him in 1920 just a few days short of his thirty-third birthday. Some three million Russians died of the same disease, in part because the Allies were blockading the ports of the new Russian regime and no supplies or medications could get through.\n\nOn the first page, Reed calls Ten Days \u201ca slice of intensified history.\u201d We might want to call it The New Journalism. Decades before Hunter Thompson began including himself in his reporting, Reed was doing the same thing. He is the observer participant in the days that he immortalized. But the book can be a difficult one to read because its narrative is slowed down, stuffed as it is with so much raw data (posters torn from walls, pages from newspapers, memos written by political factions, and resolutions from various groups of soldiers, workers, or committees jam the pages along with his firsthand reports and reflections.)\n\nEven so, anyone who makes the effort will find it to be an exciting book. The most diverse people have given it ringing endorsements. Lenin, of course, writing in an introduction: \u201cUnreservedly do I recommend it to the workers of the world.\u201d George Kennan, the conservative diplomat and father of the theory of Containment, the policy which governed American actions towards the Soviet Union for many decades: \u201cReed\u2019s account of events . . . rises above every other contemporary record for its literary power, its penetration, its command of detail.\u201d In 1999 a group of judges centered at New York University created a list of the top 100 works of American journalism of the twentieth century. Ten Days was number seven.\n\nJohn Reed should be remembered as a symbolic figure, the poet as radical and revolutionary. He was a man who took his beliefs, those of the counter culture of his era, all the way. Not many of his fellow Bohemian radicals followed. The anarchist George Bellows could go from drawing anti-war to pro-war posters after 1917, but Reed stayed true to his beliefs. What struck me when I was writing his biography in the early seventies, and what is true again today, is the absolute contemporaneity of the issues he wrote about: the implicit and then explicit critique of capitalism that runs like a thread through his writings; his support for immigrants (he knew mostly Italian, Polish, and Russians), and for the birth control movement; his exposures of exploitation in factories, opposition to involvement in foreign wars and to government censorship; his fervid support of the right to have one\u2019s voice and opinions heard. Ultimately, with Reed one sees the growing realization that what was taught in high school and college about the way America functioned \u2014 the notion of a pure democracy, equality, liberty and justice for all \u2013was as much (perhaps more?) a mythic ideology than a daily reality. The more things change the more they stay the same.\n\nRobert A.

He offered his services translating decrees, and even took up arms, joining a patrol against counterrevolutionaries. He fell ill and died in Russia during the fall of 1920.

His grandmother's household had Chinese servants.[1] Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. In 2001 a memorial bench dedicated to Reed was installed in Washington Park, which overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace (the mansion no longer exists).[2]\n\nHis mother, Margaret (Green) Reed, was the daughter of Portland industrialist Henry Dodge Green,[3] who had made a fortune founding and operating three businesses: the first gas & light company, the first pig iron smelter on the West Coast, and the Portland water works (he was its second owner).[4] SW Green Avenue was named in his honor.[5]\n\nJohn's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was born in the East and came to Portland as the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland's business community.[6] The couple had married in 1886, and the family's wealth came from the Green side, not the Reed side.\n\nA sickly child, young Jack grew up surrounded by nurses and servants. His mother carefully selected his upper-class playmates. He had a brother, Harry, who was two years younger. Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school.[7] Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious.[8] In September 1904, he was sent to Morristown, a New Jersey prep school, to prepare for college. His father, who did not attend college, wanted his sons to go to Harvard.[9] At Morristown Jack continued his poor classroom performance, but made the football team and showed some literary promise.[10]\n\nThe Harvard Monthly Vol. 44 (1907) Vol. 44 (1907)\n\nReed failed his first attempt at Harvard College's admission exam but passed on his second try, and enrolled in the fall of 1906.[11] Tall, handsome, and lighthearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the Lampoon and The Harvard Monthly, and was president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held a position in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and also wrote music and lyrics for their show Diana's Debut. Reed failed to make the football and crew teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo.[12] He was also made \"Ivy orator and poet\" in his senior year.\n\nReed attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on socialism.[13] Reed later recalled:\n\nAll this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H.G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.[14]\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910. That summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring.[15] Reed worked as a common laborer on a cattle boat to pay his fare to Europe. His travels were encouraged by his favorite professor, Charles Townsend Copeland (\"Copey\"), who told him he must \"see life\" if he wanted to write about it successfully.[16]\n\nCareer\n\nJournalist\n\nReed had determined to become a journalist, and set out to make his mark in New York, a center of the industry. Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, Lincoln Steffens, who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. He appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on The American Magazine, where he read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and later helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called Landscape Architecture.[17]\n\nA native of Oregon , John Reed made New York City the base of his operations.\n\nReed made his home in Greenwich Village, a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a freelance journalist that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in The Saturday Evening Post. Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by Collier's, The Forum, and The Century Magazine. One of his poems was set to music by composer Arthur Foote. The editors at The American came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.[18]\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and Ida Tarbell. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of The Masses, edited by Max Eastman. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of strikers in the New Jersey silk mills. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the general socialist union, the Industrial Workers of the World. His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader Bill Haywood, Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in Madison Square Garden as a benefit for the strikers.[19]\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the Metropolitan Magazine to report the Mexican Revolution.[20] He shared the perils of Pancho Villa's army for four months and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was Venustiano Carranza) when it defeated Federal forces at Torre\u00f3n, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City.[21] Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's reporting on the Villistas in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention. Reed's reports were collected and published as the book Insurgent Mexico (1914).\n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in Colorado, scene of the recent Ludlow massacre, which was part of the Colorado Coalfield War between the John D. Rockefeller, Jr.-owned Colorado Fuel & Iron Company and United Mine Workers union supporters. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict.[22]\n\nReed spent summer 1914 in Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together Insurgent Mexico and interviewing President Wilson on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at White House insistence, was not a success.[23]\n\nWar correspondent\n\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after Germany declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the Metropolitan. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in Naples, and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties.\n\nIn an unsigned piece titled \"The Traders' War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of The Masses, Reed wrote:\n\nThe real War, of which this sudden outburst of death and destruction is only an incident, began long ago. It has been raging for tens of years, but its battles have been so little advertised that they have been hardly noted. It is a clash of Traders... What has democracy to do in alliance with Nicholas, the Tsar? Is it Liberalism which is marching from the Petersburg of Father Gapon, from the Odessa of the pogroms?... No. There is a falling out among commercial rivals.... We, who are Socialists, must hope\u2014we may even expect\u2014that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far-reaching social changes\u2014and a long step forward towards our goal of Peace among Men. But we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about Liberalism going forth to Holy War against Tyranny. This is not Our War.[24]\n\nIn France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman. The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed Karl Liebknecht, one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the Second International, and by its replacement with militarism and nationalism.[25]\n\n1917 c. 1917 Reedc. 1917\n\nHe returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915 he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by Boardman Robinson, a Canadian artist and frequent Masses contributor. Traveling from Thessaloniki, they saw scenes of profound devastation in Serbia (including a bombed-out Belgrade), also going through Bulgaria and Romania. They passed through the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Bessarabia. In Che\u0142m they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in Petrograd was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in Kiev. In Bucharest, the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to Constantinople in hopes of seeing action at Gallipoli. From these experiences he wrote the book, The War in Eastern Europe, published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with Louise Bryant, who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both also had affairs with others, in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916 Reed met the young playwright Eugene O'Neill. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a summer destination on Cape Cod for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.\n\nThat summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed Woodrow Wilson, believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war.[26] In November 1916 he married Bryant in Peekskill, New York. The same year, he underwent an operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital to remove a kidney. He was hospitalized until mid-December.[27] The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a conscientious objector, as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published Tamburlaine and Other Verses, in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the Metropolitan was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his Cape Cod cottage to the birth control activist and sex educator Margaret Sanger.[28]\n\nWhen Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the People's Council in Washington: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\"[29] In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for The Masses, which the United States Post Office Department refused to mail, and for Seven Arts. Due to antiwar articles by Reed and Randolph Bourne, the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication.[30] Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.\n\nWitness to the Russian Revolution\n\nWorker of the American labor movement, internationalist writer, John Reed. Stamp of USSR, 1987.\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the State Department with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in Stockholm.[31] The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of Finland, the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed military coup of monarchist General Lavr Kornilov. This was an attempt to topple the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and Ukraine, had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin, toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nFood shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:\n\nThe last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down\u2014milk and everything of that sort.[32]\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the Winter Palace, the seat of Kerensky's government.[33] Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.[34]\n\nThe cover of this 1919 British pamphlet emphasizes Reed's short-lived status as Soviet consul.\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government. He went to work for the new People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.[35]\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met Leon Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the Constituent Assembly on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American Raymond Robins of the International Red Cross. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"[36]\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of Red Guards prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack. Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.[37]\n\nIn January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed's credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed's appointment a massive blunder. Businessman Alexander Gumberg met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed's nomination. Learning of Gumberg's intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.[38]\n\nReed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant's Six Red Months in Russia appeared first, but Reed's 10 Days That Shook the World (1919) garnered more notice.\n\nBryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28.[39] On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to Finland. In Turku harbor, when Reed was boarding a ship on his way to Stockholm, Finnish police arrested him; he was held at Kakola prison in Turku until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to Kristiania, Norway via Stockholm.\n\nBecause he remained under indictment in the Masses case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, Morris Hillquit, promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day.[40] His papers were not returned to him until November.\n\nRadical political activist\n\nVoice of Labor, October 1919 Cover of Reed'sOctober 1919\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in The Masses, particularly one headlined \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy,\" had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for sedition against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason).\n\nThe first Masses trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29.[41] The second Masses trial also ended in a hung jury.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Reed stood outside a closed hall on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive. On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the Sedition Act and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in The Bronx). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well. He tried to prevent Allied intervention in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the Ukraine and Japanese designs on Siberia, but this argument had no traction with the people.[42]\n\nOn February 21\u201322, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a Senate committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the U.S., but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was \"savagely distorted\" by the press. Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted.[43] Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of The New York Communist, the weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the Communist Labor Party of America (Reed's group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the Communist Party of America. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, The Voice of Labor, and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, The Communist. Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"[44]\n\nComintern functionary\n\nIndicted for sedition and hoping to secure Comintern backing for the CLP, Reed fled America with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to Bergen, Norway as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to Kristiania, crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to Moscow by train. In the cold winter of 1919\u201320, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.[45]\n\nReed's feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist Emma Goldman had recently arrived aboard the Buford, among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the Cheka. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see Angelica Balabanoff, a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.[46]\n\n10 Days That Shook The World, published by the Comintern in Hamburg in 1922 German edition of, published by the Comintern in Hamburg in 1922\n\nThough facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America. Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to Petrograd.[47] In March, he crossed into Helsinki, where he had radical friends, including Hella Wuolijoki, the future politician and member of parliament. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter.\n\nOn March 13, Finnish customs officials found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for treason. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe US Secretary of State was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finnish authorities for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate. Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from depression and insomnia, wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a hunger strike. He was finally released in early June, and sailed for Tallinn, Estonia, on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to Petrograd, recuperating from malnutrition and scurvy caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. Still, his spirits were high.[48]\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish tramp steamer and arrived in Gothenburg on August 10. At the same time, Reed attended the second Comintern congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.[49]\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist party needed to work within the existing institutions\u2014a policy Reed felt would be disastrous. He was contemptuous of the bullying tactics displayed during the congress by Karl Radek and Grigory Zinoviev, who ordered Reed to attend the Congress of the Peoples of the East to be held at Baku on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through a countryside that was devastated by civil war and typhus. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from Murmansk. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\"[50] Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance. Years after having abandoned Communism himself, his friend Benjamin Gitlow asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the Communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took Bryant to meet Lenin, Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\nDeath\n\nReed's body lying in state in Moscow\n\nReed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. Reed's mind started to wander; eventually he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920.[51] After a hero's funeral, Reed's body was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. He remains one of only three Americans who were honored by being buried there, the other two being C. E. Ruthenberg, the founder of [[Communist Party USA, and Bill Haywood, a founding member and leader of the Industrial Workers of the World.\n\nLegacy\n\nReed's interpretation in popular culture has varied. Some, such as biographer Robert A. Rosenstone, have called him a romantic, while Upton Sinclair derided him as a \"playboy of the revolution.\"[52] For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amid solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon. By the 1930s, the height of the communist movement in the United States, literary John Reed Clubs, affiliated with the Communist Party, existed in his honor in many large cities of the United States. Others, such as his old friend and comrade Benjamin Gitlow, claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism toward the end of his life. They sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own anti-communist cause.\n\nRepresentation in other media\n\nSoviet director Sergei Eisenstein's influential 1927 silent film October: Ten Days That Shook the World was based on Reed's book.\n\nwas based on Reed's book. John Dos Passos included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work 1919, the second part of his U.S.A. trilogy.\n\nthe second part of his U.S.A. trilogy. The 1958 Soviet film In October Days (Russian: \u0412 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f ), directed by Sergei Vasilyev, featured Reed and Bryant.\n\n(Russian: ), directed by Sergei Vasilyev, featured Reed and Bryant. Actor and director Warren Beatty made the film Reds (1981), based on Reed's life. Beatty starred as Reed, Diane Keaton as Louise Bryant. and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill. The movie won three Academy Awards and was nominated for nine others.\n\nTwo films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution, one with two parts released a year apart. Mexican director Paul Leduc made Reed: Insurgent Mexico (1973).[53] A Mexican\u2013Soviet-Italian co-production released Red Bells (1982) and Red Bells II (1983), both directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, with Franco Nero as Reed.[54]\n\nPublications\n\nDiana's Debut.

The author of Ten Days That Shook the World, a magnificent firsthand account of the Russian Revolution, Reed died in Moscow of typhus on October 17, 1920, five days shy of his 33rd birthday.\n\nAbout Ten Days That Shook the World, V.I. Lenin, the co-leader of the 1917 October Revolution, commented in an introduction written in 1919, \u201cUnreservedly do I recommend it [Reed\u2019s book] to the workers of the world. Here is a book which I should like to see published in millions of copies and translated into all languages.\u201d The book has had a special place in the hearts and minds of class-conscious workers ever since its appearance. It can still be recommended \u201cunreservedly.\u201d\n\nMany people may be familiar with the name of John \u201cJack\u201d Reed from the 1981 movie Reds, in which Warren Beatty portrayed the intrepid and principled journalist and for which Beatty won the Academy Award for best director.\n\nWhat the film cannot convey, among other things, however, is the vital, muscular and poetic quality that made Reed\u2019s writing so influential in his time and to later generations. Reds only hints at the full complexity of the man who, more than any American writer of his generation, followed the demands of his political conscience to their revolutionary conclusions.\n\nJohn Reed was born in Portland, Oregon on October 22, 1887 into an upper-middle-class family. His mother\u2019s father, Henry Dodge Green, was a wealthy Portland industrialist and his house a center of Portland\u2019s genteel social gatherings.\n\nReed came of age during the era of the full-blown development of American capitalism. In the 30 years following the Civil War, the US emerged as a modern industrial power. The decades saw the enrichment of the infamous Robber Barons, and the US launched its first imperialist war in 1898, seizing the Philippines and Cuba from Spain.\n\nThe urban population swelled in this period, also a time of large-scale immigration, and the working class emerged as a powerful force, expressing\u2014in a series of bitter strike struggles\u2014its determination to fight the omnivorous ruling class.\n\nReed\u2019s father, C.J. Reed, was a crusader against political corruption in Oregon, helping to take on the logging interests in his capacity as a U.S. marshal. Not having gone to college himself, C.J. was determined that Jack should attend Harvard, interceding for his son when he failed his entrance exam. Jack passed the second time. Working on and contributing to several Harvard publications, Reed honed his journalistic and editing skills. He also wrote and published a good deal of poetry and became a member of the newly formed Harvard Socialist Club.\n\nEstablishing himself in Greenwich Village in 1911, Reed was at the center of the neighborhood\u2019s bohemian culture. The Village was home to such figures as poet Hart Crane, \u201cscandalous\u201d novelist Henry Miller (who, not long before his death, describes Reed\u2019s milieu in Reds) and dramatist Eugene O\u2019Neill.\n\nIt was here, as a working writer and an editor at The American Magazine (founded in 1906), that Reed grappled with the challenge of earning a living under conditions where serious art does not pay the rent. For Reed, \u201cserious art\u201d still meant his poetry, which does not make much of an impression after more than a century, and also supplementing his income from The American by selling short stories, which, in some cases genially give a flavor of life at that time.\n\nAs Reed came to know Manhattan, however, its palaces and its squalor, he came to realize that something was fundamentally wrong with American society. In a later essay written in the months before his journey to Russia that would result in his witnessing the October Revolution, titled \u201cAlmost Thirty,\u201d he would recall the political awakening of his early twenties:\n\nOn the whole, ideas alone didn\u2019t mean much to me. I had to see. In my rambles about the city I couldn\u2019t help but observe the ugliness of poverty and all its train of evil, the cruel inequality between rich people who had too many motor cars and poor people who didn\u2019t have enough to eat. It didn\u2019t come to me from books that the workers produced all the wealth of the world, which went to those who did not earn it.\n\nHearing of a new arts and features magazine with a decidedly socialist orientation, called The Masses (founded in 1911), Reed quickly introduced himself to its editor Max Eastman, who would later translate many of Leon Trotsky\u2019s works into English, and climbed on board as both an editor and contributor.\n\nThough the new magazine could not pay him, Reed would find his work for this important publication his most fulfilling. The Masses was to publish the first stories of Sherwood Anderson in 1916, later to be collected in the groundbreaking Winesburg, Ohio. It published works by figures such as Jack London, the novelist Floyd Dell, and the poets Carl Sandburg and Amy Lowell. Painters John Sloan, George Bellows and Pablo Picasso contributed illustrations.\n\nBy 1913, Reed would prove a more than receptive audience member when\u2014in a Greenwich Village apartment\u2014he met William \u201cBig Bill\u201d Haywood, leader of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), the left-wing syndicalist movement. Reed listened as Haywood described the developing situation in nearby Paterson, New Jersey, where silk workers were on strike and being beaten and jailed by police. Reed, perhaps for the first time, reacted to a major story not only as a journalist but as a partisan, determined to publicize the strike and help the workers.\n\nSoon after arriving in Paterson, a naturally defiant Reed goaded a belligerent police officer into arresting him. In the county jail, overcrowded with immigrant strikers, he befriended the workers\u2014\u201cgentle, alert, brave men, ennobled by something greater than themselves\u201d\u2014and drew out their stories. That \u201csomething greater,\u201d the class struggle, can be seen at work in the article Reed wrote for The Masses (\u201cWar in Paterson\u201d), which opens:\n\nThere\u2019s war in Paterson, New Jersey. But it\u2019s a curious kind of war. All the violence is the work of one side\u2014the mill owners. Their servants, the police, club unresisting men and women and ride down law-abiding crowds on horseback. Their paid mercenaries, armed detectives shoot and kill innocent people. Their newspapers ... publish incendiary and crime-inciting appeals to mob violence against the strike leaders ... They control absolutely the police, the press, the courts.\n\nSo moved was Reed by the condition of the silk workers that he organized a dramatic pageant, held at Madison Square Garden, in which the actual workers demonstrated their onerous work and their treatment as strikers at the hands of the police.\n\nReed\u2019s best known work is Ten Days That Shook the World (1919), but he did produce other outstanding works of reportage, one of which is his account of his experiences riding with Pancho Villa\u2019s army in the Mexican Revolution, titled Insurgent Mexico (1914). The compelling work immerses the reader in the harsh, violent life of La Tropa, Villa\u2019s army, and its camp followers.\n\nAs was the case in Paterson, Reed not only sympathized politically with the peasant revolutionaries but came quickly to admire them and want their respect, which he was proud to earn. At one point in Insurgent Mexico, he writes of an initiation into La Tropa over a bottle of sotol:\n\n\u201cDrink it,\u201d yelled the chorus as the Tropa crowded up to see. I drank it. A howl of laughter and applause went up. Fernando leaned over and gripped my hand. \u201cGood for you, companero!\u201d he bellowed, rolling with mirth ... Captain Fernando leaned over and patted my arm. \u201cNow you are with the men (los hombres.) When we win the Revolucion it will be a government by the men,\u2014not by the rich. We are riding over the lands of the men. They used to belong to the rich, but now they belong to me and to the compa\u00f1eros.\u201d\n\nThe material Reed sent back to the US, published in The Metropolitan magazine, established him as America\u2019s foremost war correspondent. The writing was at once impressionistic and clear-eyed, imagistic and frank.\n\nCertainly, no more stark instance of brutal oppression could have presented itself to Reed or the world than the Ludlow Massacre of April, 1914, the culminating atrocity of the protracted southern Colorado coal miners\u2019 strike of the winter of 1913-14. Reading of the massacre, Reed immediately left for Las Animas County.\n\nThere he made a detailed search of the scene of the massacre, in which National Guard militiamen rented by John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Colorado Fuel and Iron Company killed an estimated 26 miners, their wives and children, some shot with machine guns and some deliberately burned to death in tents the miners had been living in during the strike.\n\nReed wrote a lengthy, scathing article for The Metropolitan, \u201cThe Colorado War,\u201d in July 1914, which detailed the murderous violence of the Rockefeller interests. \u201cI got into Trinidad [Colorado, 15 miles from Ludlow] about ten days after the massacre at Ludlow,\u201d Reed wrote. Later in the article, he explained:\n\nI went to Ludlow next day to see the Federal troops come in and the militia leave. The tent colony, or where the tent colony had been, was a great square of ghastly ruins. Stoves, pots and pans still half full of food that had been cooking that terrible morning, baby-carriages, piles of half-burned clothes, children\u2019s toys all riddled with bullets, the scorched mouths of the tent cellars, and the children\u2019s toys that we found at the bottom of the \u201cdeath hole\u201d\u2014this was all that remained of the entire worldly possessions of 1,200 poor people. At the railroad station about fifty militiamen waited for the train\u2014boys with the stupid, vicious faces of saloon-corner loafers. Only a few were in uniform, for many of them were mine-guards hastily mustered in. As the regulars left their train one militiaman said loudly, in the hearing of the militia officers: \u201cI hope these red-necks kill a regular so they will go in and wipe out the whole bunch. We certainly done a good job on that tent colony.\u201d\n\nIn August of that year, the world was struck by the greatest upheaval to that point in modern times. The First World War broke out in Europe. Reed sailed to Italy as a correspondent for The Metropolitan. He went to France, where he attempted twice to reach the front but was arrested and turned back both times. He then went to London, where he wrote a long article on England in wartime, showing that patriotism was limited to the upper classes. The Metropolitan rejected the article.\n\nIn \u201cThe Traders War,\u201d written from London and published in The Masses in September, Reed outlined the history of the imperialist commercial rivalries between Britain, France and Germany and stated that the war was nothing more than a continuation of these conflicts. (In a noteworthy scene in Reds, Reed [Beatty], asked at a meeting of the Liberal Club in Portland, Oregon what he thinks \u201cthis war is about,\u201d gets to his feet and replies with one word, \u201cProfits.\u201d)\n\nReed returned to France and in December made his way to Germany via Switzerland. In Berlin, he was able to conduct an interview with the revolutionary socialist Karl Liebknecht, who alone in the German Reichstag had refused to vote to fund the war. When Reed asked him about \u201cthe chances of World Revolution,\u201d \u201c\u2018To my mind\u2019 [Liebknecht] responded serenely, \u2018nothing else can come out of this war.\u2019\u201d\n\nReed and other American correspondents were able, after long delays, to secure permission to visit the German front in Northern France. Along the way they were feted by German officers and saw the horrors of trench warfare. He wrote articles on these experiences for The Metropolitan and returned to the US in January 1915.\n\nReed only stayed home a few months. By March, since he was unable to get permission to visit France again, The Metropolitan asked him to report on the war in Eastern Europe. With the artist Boardman Robinson, he visited Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia.\n\nAlmost half the articles he wrote, although Reed could not know this at the time, were about the final days of the tsarist empire with its drunkenness, abuse, and corruption organized into armies. In one article, \u201cAn Optimistic Pilgrimage\u201d that still moves the reader 105 years later, Reed passes through a Jewish village near Rovno in what is now Ukraine, and observes the filth and poverty of the Jews and their oppression by the Russians. One of his guides, a Russian army officer, complains that all Jews are traitors to Russia.\n\nThe scenes from Serbia are shocking. The first country to be invaded by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in response to the assassination of its Archduke Ferdinand in 1914, Serbia was in the middle of a typhus epidemic. Reed visited one hospital for those stricken with disease:\n\nWe entered a barrack, along whose walls cots lay touching each other, and with the feeble light of two lanterns we could see the patients writhing in their dirty blankets, five and six crowded into two beds. Some sat up, apathetically eating; others lay like the dead; still others gave short, grunting moans, or shouted suddenly in the grip of delirium.\n\nWhen Reed returned from Europe in late 1915, the official political atmosphere in the US had shifted to the right: a pro-war \u201cpreparedness\u201d campaign was underway and middle-class public opinion had become anti-German. He moved back to Greenwich Village with the woman he would marry, also from Oregon, journalist Louise Bryant. It was at this time he befriended Eugene O\u2019Neill. Reed, O\u2019Neill, Bryant and some of their circle wrote and performed plays in Provincetown, Massachusetts in the summer of 1916.\n\nThe Metropolitan refused to return him to Europe because of his antiwar views. But in the spring of 1917, two more world-shaking events occurred. In March, the Russian tsar, Nicholas II, was overthrown, and in April the United States entered the world war.\n\nThroughout the spring and summer of 1917, Reed wrote antiwar articles for The Masses. By August, he had decided he had to see the revolution in Russia for himself. Reed arrived in Petrograd on September 13, just after the attempted coup against the bourgeois Provisional Government by tsarist General Lavr Kornilov. The coup melted away largely because of the Bolsheviks\u2019 mobilization of workers and soldiers.\n\nThrough connections in New York, including Bolsheviks such as V. Volodarsky, Reed became acquainted with that party\u2019s leaders, who were now preparing the overthrow of the Provisional Government and its replacement by a government of Soviets.\n\nHe hastened from place to place in Petrograd, saving leaflets and proclamations and documenting the positions of each party. He interviewed leaders of the frightened capitalist parties, and he saw Lenin and Trotsky give speeches to thousands of workers. Reed himself spoke to countless other Bolshevik leaders, workers, soldiers and sailors, as they applied themselves to the historical task of establishing a government of the working class. He was a witness to the Bolshevik seizure of power and was present at the famous storming of the Winter Palace, as well as the struggle afterwards by the new Soviet government against counterrevolution.\n\nFor the remainder of the year Reed remained in the new Soviet Russia. He worked for the People\u2019s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs and was briefly appointed consul to the US. In early 1918, he had his first long discussions with Lenin and Trotsky. He left for home soon after, but was detained in Finland until April by the nationalist government.\n\nOn his return to New York, he was met on the dock by government agents who seized his papers and summoned him to court the next day. Reed was indicted under the Espionage Act for a 1917 article, published in The Masses, \u201cKnit a strait-jacket for your soldier boy,\u201d which describes what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nReed took up the task of defending the revolution to an American audience in such articles as \u201cSoviets in Action\u201d and \u201cThe Structure of the Soviet State\u201d published in T he Liberator (the successor to The Masses), in the autumn of 1918.\n\nIt was at this time that be took up a fight for the ideas of Bolshevism in the left wing of the American Socialist Party, along with Louis Fraina and other supporters of the Russian Revolution in the journal The Revolutionary Age. His papers from Russia were returned to him, and he worked feverishly on his description of the events he had lived through in October-November 1917. Eastman later reported that Reed wrote the book in a remarkably short period of time, sequestered in a room in Greenwich Village, seeing no one and coming out only for meals.\n\nIn March 1919, the product of this effort, Ten Days That Shook the World, was published. It was the peak of Reed\u2019s development as a journalist. He combined his own observations and conversations with the scrupulous publication of the documents of the revolution itself he had collected.\n\nHere is how Reed describes the Bolshevik headquarters, the Smolny Institute, a former upper-class girls school in tsarist times (only eight months previously!) on the day of the insurrection, November 7:\n\nThe massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up, and from every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dim in the gloom. Automobiles and motorcycles came and went; an enormous elephant-colored armored automobile, with two red flags flying from the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, and at the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bonfire. At the inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which the sentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down. \u2026 A crowd came pouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round black fur hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders, soldiers in rough dirt-colored coats and grey fur shapkas [hats] pinched flat.\n\nOn this occasion Reed encounters the Bolshevik leader Lev Kamenev. Kamenev reads out to him, translating from Russian into French, effectively the first proclamation, just passed in session, of the new Soviet government: \u201cThe new Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019 Government will propose immediately a just and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries \u2026 The Soviet is convinced that the proletariat of the countries of Western Europe will aid us in conducting the cause of Socialism to a real and lasting victory.\u201d\n\nAnd Reed\u2019s description of Lenin stands out:\n\nDressed in shabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, to be the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been. A strange popular leader\u2014a leader purely by virtue of intellect: colorless, humorless, uncompromising and detached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies\u2014with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analyzing a concrete situation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectual audacity.\n\n(An insightful description, aside from the characterization of Lenin as \u201ccolorless\u201d and \u201chumorless,\u201d which was anything but the case!)\n\nTen Days That Shook the World is one of the artistic achievements not only of the Russian Revolution, but of American and world literature. The fact that it inspired another great work, Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s October (1928), gives it a unique place in human culture.\n\nReed discovered the drama of the revolution in its own action, in the rapid and intense response of classes to one other in the pursuit of their social goals, expressed not only by force of arms, but by the most profound political thought. He was able to translate this into narrative and description.\n\nTen Days That Shook the World was the first time the revolution spoke in its full eloquence to the world. Lenin in his famous preface to the book, noted above, commented: \u201cWith the greatest interest and with never slackening attention I read John Reed\u2019s book, Ten Days That Shook the World. \u2026 It gives a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. These problems are widely discussed, but before one can accept or reject these ideas, he must understand the full significance of his decision. John Reed\u2019s book will undoubtedly help to clear this question, which is the fundamental problem of the international labor movement.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1919, Reed helped to launch the Communist Labor Party (one of the forerunners of the Communist Party, founded in May 1921), as it split from the opportunist Socialist Party. In October he left again for Soviet Russia and participated as an American delegate to the Second Congress of the Communist International, held from July 19 to August 7, 1920. Following that, Reed attended the Congress of the Peoples of the East in Baku in Soviet Azerbaijan, an assembly of 1,900 delegates from across Asia and Europe organized by the Communist International, which opened September 1.\n\nFrench leftist Alfred Rosmer, in Moscow Under Lenin, has a well-known description of Reed speaking at the Congress in Baku, a city famous for its petroleum industry. Rosmer noted that Reed, who had learned a few words of Russian, \u201cwas a great success. He shouted a question to his audience: \u2018Don\u2019t you know how Baku is pronounced in American? It\u2019s pronounced oil!\u2019 The solemn faces were suddenly shaken with laughter.\u201d\n\nReed returned to Moscow on September 15, fell sick with typhus and died on October 17. It is said that he might have survived if the American government had not had an embargo on medications to Soviet Russia.\n\nRosmer explained in his book that when he and others returned from Moscow, \u201ca sad piece of news greeted us. John Reed, who had returned in advance of us, was in hospital, ill with typhus. No effort was spared to save him, but it was all in vain and a few days later he died. His body was displayed in the great hall of the House of Trade Unions. On the day of the funeral, winter had already arrived and snow was falling. We were overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nRosmer continued, \u201cA burial place was found for him in the Kremlin wall, in the section reserved for heroes who had fallen in the revolutionary battle. The words of farewell were spoken by [Nikolai] Bukharin, for the central committee of the Communist Party, by [Alexandra] Kollontai, and by his comrades from the Executive Committee. Louise Bryant, who had arrived only to see him die, was there, completely shattered by grief. The whole scene was indescribably sad.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s reputation after his death has been closely tied to the fate of the Russian Revolution. The Stalinist regime that usurped the Soviet state in the next decade could not abide the truth about the revolution, and Trotsky\u2019s role in October 1917, as Reed had depicted it. Stalin is mentioned only in passing because he played virtually no role in the seizure of power. The work was banned, at Stalin\u2019s insistence, in the Soviet Union for decades.\n\nEqually, anticommunist commentators in Europe and America have sought to make Ten Days That Shook the World into a mere literary accomplishment. Some have alleged, falsely, that after disagreements over Communist tactics in 1920, Reed became disillusioned with Marxism.\n\nDespite the Stalinist and anticommunist treatment of Reed and his work, for millions of workers and young people Ten Days That Shook the World remains an indispensable introduction to the most momentous event in world history. In a time when the question of socialist revolution has been placed before millions and millions, a new generation must discover his work.\n\nTen Days That Shook the World is currently on sale at Mehring Books for $14.40."}, {"url": "https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/eam/ci/comintern.html", "page_content": "ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY\n\nThe Communist International was the successor to the group of parties associated with the Left Wing of the Zimmerwald Conventions. First and foremost, of course, was the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks)\u2014the organization which had seized the reins of the Russian empire in November of 1917 and was in the midst of consolidating its position in a bloody civil war. To a great extent, the establishment of the Comintern was a manifestation of the Russian desire for a final solution to its civil war through world revolution. Representatives of revolutionary parties and trends from around the globe were sought for participation in the new international organization.\n\n1. Founding Congress\u2014Moscow\u2014March 2-6, 1919.\n\nThe Founding Congress was attended by 34 delegates with decisive vote and 18 with consultative vote.\n\nA stenographic report of the Founding Congress of the Comintern was published in German in 1921 and in Russian translation that same year. An English translation of the Gerrman original was published by Pathfinder Press in 1987. [Various speeches of the Founding Congress may be viewed here as html documents.]\n\nThe First Congress did not elect an Executive Committee; it was to consist of delegates from the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Balkan Federation, Switzerrland, and Scandinavia.\n\nThe Communist Labor Party of America applied for Comintern membership on September 21, 1919.\n\nThe Communist Party of America applied for Comintern membership on November 24, 1919.\n\nThe Socialist Party of America applied for Comintern membership on March 12, 1920.\n\nConference \u2014Amsterdam, Netherlands\u2014February 10-17, 1920.\n\nThe February 1920 conference was attended by 16 delegates, including representatives of the Communist Parties of Russia (by mandate), Germany, America (CPA International Secretary Louis C. Fraina the delegate); the British Socialist Party, the Workers' Socialist Federattion, and the Stop Stewards and Workers' Committees; the Swiss and Belgian Communist movements. There were also 5 delegates present with voice and no vote. The conference adopted an extensive thesis on unionism, which was prepared and introduced by Fraina, as well as theses on Social-Patriotism and Unity.\n\n2. Second Congress\u2014Moscow & Petrograd\u2014July 19 - August 7, 1920.\n\nThe Second Congress was attended by more than 220 delegates, including 167 with decisive votes.\n\nA stenographic report of the 2nd Congress of the Comintern was published in German in Hamburg in 1921 and in Russian translation that same year. A second edition in Russian was published in 1934, correcting some important errors. An English translation (in two volumes) of the German original was published by New Park Publications in 1977. [This material may be viewed here as an html document.]\n\nIn light of the hasty decision to convene the Founding Congress of the Comintern, with its list of delegates determined as much as anything by accidents of geography, in a certain sense the \u201cSecond Congress\u201d of the Communist International should be regarded as the first.\n\nThe Communist Party of America dispatched two representatives to Moscow to serve as its delegates at the 2nd Congress (Louis C. Fraina and Alexander Stoklitsky) prior to the Bridgman Unity Convention of May 1920. The majority of the members of the old CPA refused to join the United Communist Party of America at this time, resulting in the continued existence of two communist organizations in America. After the conclusion of the Unity Convention, UCP member Edward Lindgren [\"Flynn\"] was sent to Moscow to serve as a Comintern Congress delegate, joining three other members of the former Communist Labor Party of America already there: former CLP International Delegates John Reed and Alexander Bilan, as well as Eadmonn MacAlpine. Lindgren brought news of the Unity Convention and the group decided to press for Comintern ratification of the new party by unseating the CPA delegation. No information on the Unity Convention and continued split had arrived from the old CPA, however, and the Credentials Commissionm, reluctant to make a ruling on the basis of incomplete information, upheld the mandates of Fraina and Stoklitsky. This decision, ratified by a 19-9 vote on the floor of the Congress, recognized the UCP as the majority party in America and accorded its delegates 6 votes, while the old CPA was regarded as the minority party and allocated 4 votes. [See the stenographic report of the brief debate on this matter, Lindgren speaking for the UCP and Fraina for the old CPA.]\n\nThe Second Congress approved the \u201c21 Conditions\u201d for admission to the Communist International.\n\nThe Second Congress elected an Executive Committee for the first time. It consisted of delegates from Russia (5 members, 6 candidates), Germany (1 member, 1 candidate), France, Great Britainm The United States (2 delegates\u2014Reed of the UCP and Nicholas Hourwich [Gurvich; \u201cAndrew\"] of the Communist Party of America), Italy (1 member, 1 candidate) Czechoslovakia, Austria, Scandinavia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the Far East, the Near East, Finland, Poland, Holland (2 delegates), Latvia (1 candidate), Hungary, Georgia, Java, and a Youth representative. This group in turn elected a small bureau consisting of Zinoviev, Bukharin, and Kobetsky (Russia); Runniansky (Hungary); and Meyer (Germany).\n\nThe small bureau was later enlarged to include Kun (Hungary), Rosmer (France), Koenen, and Radek (Russia).\n\nFirst Congress of Peoples of the East\u2014Baku\u2014September 1-8, 1920.\n\nA stenographic report of the First Congress of Peoples of the East was published in Russian in 1920. An English translation was published in Moscow in 1922 and a German translation that same year. A new English translation was made by Brian Pearce and published in London by Hammersmith Books in 1970. [This stenographic report is available here as an html document.]\n\n4. 3rd World Congress\u2014Moscow\u2014June 22 - August 12, 1921.\n\nA stenographic report of the 3rd Congress of the Comintern was published in German in Hamburg in 1921 and in Russian translation in 1922. An abridged report of the proceedings in English was published in London by the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1921.\n\nThe Third Congress did not directly elect an Executive Committee, but decided that the 4 parties with 40 votes at the Congress should send two delegates and the 14 countries with 20 to 20 votes should send one delegate. The first American delegate dispatched to Moscow as a representative to the ECCI was Oscar Tyverovsky [\"Baldwin\"].\n\nThis body was subsequently \u201cenlarged\u201d in 1921-22; 15 new Communist Parties were allotted delegates with consultative votes and other parties were allowed a second vote. The United States was allotted two representatives by the time of the 4th Congress: Ludwig E. Katterfeld [\"Carr\"]\u2014who replaced Tyverovsky\u2014and James P. Cannon [\"Cook\"]. The ECCI elected a presidium consisting of Zinoviev, Radek, and Bukharin (Russia); Heckert (Germany); Souvarine (France); Genanri (Italy); Kun (Hungary); and Humbert-Droz (Switzerland). A three member Secretariat consisting of Kuusinen (Finland), Rakosi (Hungary), and Humbert-Droz handled day-to-day organizational details.\n\nAlthough not originally intended as such, the formal gatherings of the \u201cenlarged\u201d Executive Committee of the Comintern rapidly came to supplant the more cumbersome and logistically difficult World Congresses of that body. With communications between Moscow and the rest of the world still shaky in this period, the doubling of representation at the gathering allowed the dispatch of half the delegates home again to directly relate the decisions of the gathering to their repsective national parties.\n\nAmerican Delegates to the 3rd Congress included Max Bedacht.\n\nFirst Congress of Toilers of the Far East\u2014Moscow and Petrograd \u2014Jan. 21 - Feb. 2, 1922.\n\nThis gathering was attended by delegates from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and the peoples of Siberia.\n\nIt was not the Third Congress but rather the 1st Enlarged Plenum which actively advanced the slogan of the \u201cUnited Front\u201d\u2014the call for the gathering itself, made in January 1922, took the form of an open manifesto to the workers of the world entitled \u201c For the United Front of the Proletariat.\" 5. 1st Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014Feb. 21 - March 4, 1922. The First Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International was attended by 105 delegates from 36 sections. The Plenum considered the theses on the United Front, a proposal from the Vienna Union for a joint conference of the executives of the three Internationals, the war danger, communist work in the trade unions, and the situation in the French and British Communist Parties. The Plenum elected a new Presidium, consisting of Zinoviev, Radek, and Bukharin (Russia); Brandler (Germany); Souvarine (France); Terracini (Italy); Keribich (Czechoslovakia); and Katterfeld (USA). Candidates were Genrik Valetskii (Russia) and Otto Kuusinen (Finland). Max Bedacht also was present as a delegate of the American Communist movement. 6. 2nd Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014June 7-11, 1922. The Second Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Comintern was attended by 41 delegates from 17 countries with voting powers, and 9 additional delegates with voice but no vote. In addition, there were 4 representatives of the Red International of Trade Unions and 4 representatives of the Communist Youth International with votes. Another account states that there were a total of 60 delegates in attendance. A great deal of time was spent by the plenum discussing the affairs of the Communist Party of France. The Second Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International replaced Terracini, Keibich, and Katterfeld with Gramsci (Italy), Smeral (Czechoslovakia), and Jordanov. Candidate members were Cannon [\"Cook\"] (USA) and Kuusinen (Finland). By the time of the 4th Congress, the ECCI was run by a 5 person Secretariat consisting of Kuusinen (Finland), Kon, Eberlein (Germany), Rakosi (Hungary), and Minkin. 7. 4th World Congress\u2014Petrograd and Moscow\u2014November 5 - December 5, 1922. A stenographic report of the 4th Congress of the Comintern was published in German in Hamburg in 1923 and in Russian translation that same year. A much-abridged report of the proceedings was published in London by the Communist Party of Great Britain circa 1923. The body opened at a meeting held in Petrograd on Nov. 5 before moving to Moscow for its subsequent meetings. The 4th Congress was attended by a total of 393 delegates, including representatives of 58 Communist Parties. Some 340 of these delegates were given both voice and vote, 48 (including the Americans, members of a \u201csympathetic\u201d rather than fully-affiliate party, the WPA) were allowed voice but not vote, and 5 were admitted as guests. The Workers Party of America sent three delegates, including Max Bedacht (who reported on the gathering to the Central Executive Committee of the WPA) and Alexander Trachtenberg. Also present was Alfred S. Edwards (\"Sullivan\"), a hardline member of the party's left. The 4th Congress appointed an American Commission to study the situation and develop policy for the Communist Party of America. This commission consisted of Radek, Bukharin, Kuusinen, and Losovsky (replaced by Melnichansky) from Russia; Valetskii and Domski (Poland); Katayama (Japan); Kurela (Finland); Raavenstein (Holland); Eberlein (Germany); Lackie (England); Kobler (Czechoslovakia); Gamelon (France); Assaria (Italy); McLean (Ireland); and McDonald (Canada). This American Commission rebuked Edwards for an attack he launched on the political line of The Worker, The gathering heard a keynote report by V.I. Lenin entitled \u201cFive Years of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution.\" The 4th Congress changed the structure of the Executive Committee of the Comintern. No longer would ECCI members be selected by member parties and responsible to those parties; henceforth the 25 members of the ECCI would be elected by one congress and be responsible for carrying out the decisions of that congress. These members of ECCI would be responsible only to the next congress. The 4th Congress elected en bloc a slate for the ECCI nominated by the Congress' Presidium. 8. 3rd Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014June 12-23, 1923. A stenographic protocol of the 3rd Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1923. Israel Amter attended the sessions of the 3rd Enlarged Plenum as the delegate of the Workers Party of America. He prepared an extensive report on the results of the gathering which was published in the party press in all languages in August 1923. 9. 5th World Congress\u2014Moscow\u2014June 17 - July 8, 1924. The 5th World Congress of the Communist international was attended by 406 delegates from 41 countries, of whom 324 were delegates with full voting rights. As the historian E.H. Carr has noted: \"By far the most important event occurring within the orbit of the Cominteren between its Fourth and Fifth Congresses was the failure of the attempted German revolution of October 1923. The Fifth Congress could hardly fail to reflect the widening gap between the one party which had a victorious revolution to its credit and the parties which had failed, or had not even made the attempt. * * * The German failure of October 1923 proved the general need for a leadership in foreign communist parties more amenable to Russian example and guidance.\" [fn. E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, (London: Macmillan, 1964) v. 7, pp. 70, 95.] The failure of the German revolution was blamed on the \u201cBrandlerite\u201d leadership of the KPD and was used as cause for the removal of the current leadership and replacement with a new group hailing from the party's Left. At the same time, in Britain a Labour government came to power for the first time and accorded Soviet Russia with de jure recognition. As a result, the center of gravity of the international movement quickly shifted from Germany to England. [fn. E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, (London: Macmillan, 1964) v. 7, pg. 72.]\n\nA stenographic report of the 5th Congress was published in German in 2 volumes in 1924. A Russian translation was published in Moscow in 1925. A much-abridged report of the proceedings in English was published by the Communist Party of Great Britain circa 1925.\n\n10. 4th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014June 12 and July 12-13, 1924.\n\nThe 4th Plenum of the Enlarged ECCI met for one day prior to the 5th World Congress and for two days after it ended. The July sessions dealt with matters referred to ECCI by the 5th Congress: reports for the Italian Commission by Manuilsky, for the Swedish Commission by Thaelmann, on behalf of the Bulgarian Commission, a resolution on Poland. The plenum also established a Negro Commission, including representatives of the British, French, and Belgian parties, to organize propaganda among the black population.\n\n11. 5th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014March 21 - April 6, 1925.\n\nA stenographic protocol of the 5th Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1925.\n\nThe American delegates to the 5th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI included William Z. Foster [\"Dorsey\"], James P. Cannon, and John Williamson (YWL) for the majority; C.E. Ruthenberg [\"Sanborn\"], Jay Lovestone [\"Powers\"], and John Pepper for the minority. Cannon and Pepper were appointed to the Political Commission of the plenum, while Foster and Ruthenberg were appointed to the Commission on Trade Union Unity. Foster and Lovestone were also appointed to the Peasant Commission.\n\nThe main report was delivered by Grigorii Zinoviev, which set the line on the \u201cpartial stabilization\u201d of capitalism and advanced the slogan of \u201cBolshevization\u201d of communist parties.\n\nJames P. Cannon delivered a speech on the problems of Bolshevization of the American party and the question of a Labor Party in America on March 30, 1925.\n\nThe 5th Plenum had an American Commission, chaired by Otto Kuusinen with Jules Humbert-Droz its secretary.\n\n12. 6th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014Feb. 17 - March 15, 1926.\n\nThe 6th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI met for the first time at 8 pm in the Andreev Hall of the Kremlin, the former throne room of the Tsar. A stenographic protocol of the 6th Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1926. Extensive excerpts of the proceedings were published in English in the pages of International Press Correspondence, beginning with the March 4, 1926 issue.\n\nThe welcoming speech to the gathering was made by Chairman of the Comintern Grigorii Zinoviev, after which the credentials committee reported that 23 of the 43 members of ECCI were present (all with decisive vote), as were 14 of 27 candidate members (5 serving as substitutes with decisive vote, the other 9 with consultative vote). In addition, another 93 delegates representing 32 parties were present\u2014 49 with decisive and 44 with consultative votes. In total, then, at the start of the plenum there were 77 delegates with decisive and 53 delegates with consultative vote.\n\nThe body unanimously elected predetermined slates to membership of the various commissions. The Political Commission was headed by Zinoviev and included representatives of the parties of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Belorussia, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Estonia, Finland, France, Holland, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, Yugoslavia, and the Young Communist League. Other commissions included the Trade Union Commission (Monmousseau, Secretary); Eastern Commision (Roy, Secretary); British Commission (Braun, Secretary); French Commission (Manuilsky, Secretary); American Commission (Robson, Secretary) and including Bukharin, Katayama, Kun, Kuusinen, Manuilsky, Stalin, Zetkin, and Zinoviev, among others; and a Scandinavian Commission (Remmele, Secretary).\n\nA massive Keynote Report on the Activies of the ECCI was delivered over three sessions starting on Saturday, Feb. 20, 1926, by President of the Comintern Grigorii Zinoviev. In his speech, Zinoviev reaffirmed the idea of the \u201ctemporary stabilization of capitalism.\u201d A dual \u201cperspective\u201d was advocated, whereby the move to a new revolutionary period might be either fast (for example, in 2 years) or slow (in 10 years). Regardless, Zinoviev stated, \u201cour diagnosis is the same as before: the death of capitalism, dictatorship of the proletariat within a comparatively short time!\u201d Zinoviev more than once emphasized the importance of the 3rd Congress of the Comintern (1921) over that of the 4th (1922) and 5th (1924), strongly advocating the continuance of the slogan \u201cTo the Masses!\u201d and the unceasing utilization of \u201cUnited Front tactics.\u201d The goal, Zinoviev states, is to win the support of a majority of the working class to the leadership of the Communist Party\u2014something that was as yet unobtained.\n\nWith regards to the United States, Zinoviev called America \u201cbut one of the links of world capitalsm as a whole (although the strongest link)\u201d and calls it \u201cthe promised land of reformism.\u201d He sees a trend among the nations of Europe towards the \u201cAmericanization\u201d of the labor movement, attempts to strip the trade unions of their radical political perspective and to reduce them to negotiating devices for purely monetary objectives. Zinoviev criticized both \u201cUltra-Left\u201d (anti-United Front) and \u201cRight\u201d (Social Democratic) opposition movements within the Communist Parties, and is critical of the misapplication of United Front tactics by erstwhile well-meaning supporters of the Comintern general line. He advocated increased \u201cself-reliance and independence\u201d among the parties of the Comintern, while acknowledging situations in which the CI must \u201cdissolve some CC\u201d and \u201cappoint another in its place\u201d due to \u201csituations when this can not be helped.\"\n\n13. 7th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014Nov. 22 - Dec. 16, 1926.\n\nA stenographic protocol of the 7th Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1927.

The material was not published again in English until 1954, when it appeared under the title \u201cOnce More on the Social-Democratic Deviation in Our Party\u201d in volume 9 of Stalin's Works.\n\nWorld Congress Against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism\u2014Brussels \u2014Feb. 10 -XX, 1927.\n\nThe World Congress Against Colonia Oppression and Imperialism was attended by 152 delegates from 37 countries. A German language official protocol was published in Berlin in 1927.\n\nThis Congress was organized by the Third International as a \u201cunited front\u201d organization attempting to unite the working class of various tendencies around a common program. The body approved a resolution moved jointly by the British, Indian, and Chinese delegations on the duties of the working class of the countries of the advanced, imperialist world against the national liberation movements of the less developed, colonial nations. The Congress also issued a manifesto, \u201cTo All Oppressed Peoples and Classes.\"\n\nOn the report of Willi M\u00fcnzenberg, General Secretary of International Workers' Relief, an international organization called The League Against Imperialism and Colonial Oppression and For National Independence was established.\n\n14. 8th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014May 18-30, 1927.\n\n15. 9th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI\u2014Moscow\u2014Feb. 9-25, 1928.\n\nThe 9th Enlarged plenum opened on Feb. 9, 1928, with 44 voting delegates and 48 non-voting delegates from 27 countries in attendance.\n\nAn article in Pravda published shortly before the Plenum convened declared that the masses were moving to the left while international Social Democracy was shifting rightward.

During his brief life, he earned his celebrity by reporting on U.S. labor strikes, the Mexican revolution, World War I, and by being a founder of and international delegate for the Communist Labor Party. Early in Reed's career, Walter Lippman cautioned New Republic readers that he \u201cis many men at once, and those who have tried to . . . regard him as a writer, a correspondent, a poet, a revolutionist, or a lover, lose him.\u201d In 1981, younger generations were introduced to Reed in Warren Beatty\u2019s epic film Reds, and in 1999 a New York University panel of experts ranked his Ten Days That Shook the World seventh among the hundred best works of American twentieth-century journalism.\n\nReed was born on October 22, 1887, in Cedar Hill, his grandfather Henry Dodge Green\u2019s five-acre mansion near today\u2019s Washington Park in Portland. Although Green\u2019s widow sold the estate when Jack Reed was only three years old, he later remembered Cedar Hill as \u201csomething fantastic. . . . A lordly grey mansion modeled on a French Chateau.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s father, Charles \u201cC.J.\u201d Reed, was a U.S. marshal with an office in the Pioneer Courthouse in Portland. The family moved off the hill into town in 1890, and Reed\u2019s early education included the Friday Evening Dancing Class for West Hill society and the Portland Academy. He preferred expeditions to less elevated neighborhoods, such as Skid Row, the waterfront, and Chinatown. For Reed, the Industrial Workers of the World hall was the \u201cliveliest intellectual center in town.\u201d\n\nReed published his first work when he was fifteen, a poem called \u201cThe Columbia River,\u201d in the Troubadour, the literary magazine of the Portland Academy. Looking back in his most personal memoir, Almost Thirty, first published in the New Republic in 1936, Reed saw himself as \u201cneither one thing or another . . . that is why my impression of my childhood is an unhappy one and why I have so few close friends in Portland and why I don\u2019t want ever to live there again.\u201d\n\nAt sixteen, Reed was sent to boarding school in New Jersey and then on to Harvard, where much of his writing drew on his experiences in Oregon. He spent most summers in Portland, where he attended parties in the West Hills, charmed several local women, and wrote two of his most famous poems, \u201cThe Day in Bohemia\u201d (1913) and \u201cSangar\u201d (1913).\n\nHis final visit to Portland in 1914, to spend Christmas with his widowed mother Margaret, was the most memorable. Writer and activist Louise Bryant asked their mutual friends, Carl and Helen Walters, to introduce her to Reed. Within weeks, he had left Oregon and was living with Bryant on Washington Square in New York.\n\nReed was a central figure in America\u2019s cultural Bohemia and a political activist, and he spent the remainder of his career writing for radical publications such as The Masses and for magazines such as The Metropolitan. His best-known book was Ten Days That Shook the World, an eyewitness account of the Russian revolution published in 1919. Reed\u2019s enthusiasm for the revolution led to his death from typhus in October 1920 in a Moscow hospital. He is buried in the graveyard of revolutionary heroes near the Kremlin Wall.\n\nWhile Reed frequently expressed his contempt for Portland\u2019s conservatism, he revealed a familiarity with and affection for Portland in the Oregon Journal in 1914: \u201cPortlanders understand and appreciate how differently beautiful is this part of the world\u2014the white city against the deep evergreen of the hills, the snow mountains to the east, the ever-changing river and its boat life, the dusty oriental brilliancy of Chinatown\u2014and the grays, blues and greens, the smoke-dimmed sunsets and pearly hazes of August, so characteristic of the Pacific Northwest.

Reed deeply sympathized with the struggle of the Mexican people and vehemently opposed American intervention. Reed's reports were collected and published in the book Insurgent Mexico (1914).\n\nHis next experience was in Colorado, in April 1914, where he recounted the Ludlow massacre , a crime orchestrated by the chief owner of the mine John D. Rockefeller Jr and carried out by by the local militia during the Colorado Coalfield War. Reed investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July).\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914 he went to Europe as a correspondent of Metropolitan Magazine. He covered the battle fronts in Germany, Russia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. From these experiences he wrote the book, The War in Eastern Europe, published in April 1916, revealing the imperialist nature of the war."}, {"url": "https://helenrappaport.com/russia/lenin-stalin-revolution/john-reed-writing-the-russian-revolution/", "page_content": "Returning to New York in 1916 he continued writing inflammatory political articles in the radical press. That autumn he met and married the feminist journalist Louise Bryant. When revolution broke in Russia in February [OS] 1917 Reed was determined to be a witness of this great new Socialist utopia-in- the-making, and set about raising the money to fund his trip there with Bryant. The couple finally arrived in early September, somewhat late for the party, having missed the popular street protests of the very violent February Revolution; the struggles of the Provisional Government to hold on to power; the resumption of violence in early July; and the crisis of the Kornilov revolt at the end of August.\n\nReed had a lot of catching up to do and was at a distinct disadvantage from other foreign journalists already there, in that he arrived without any contacts or knowledge of the city. He went straight to the US Embassy on Furshtatskaya Ulitsa with a letter of recommendation for the US ambassador David R Francis, which, somewhat unconvincingly asserted that he and Bryant were \u2018visiting Russia with a view to studying conditions\u2019. The letter asked that the \u2018gentlemen of the Embassy\u2019 should extend any help and courtesy they could to them, but Francis was instantly suspicious. He was well aware that Reed was a notorious radical accredited to the New York left wing press. Here was no innocent \u2018visitor\u2019, but a reporter with a clear political agenda. Francis deemed him a \u2018dangerous Red\u2019 and had him watched.\n\nReed\u2019s unrepentant sympathies for the revolutionary cause and his championing of the victory of the masses ensured that from the first he would be an outsider in the expatriate community of Petrograd. He and Bryant never became integral members of that closed and clannish world, which was highly suspicious of their politics. Nor for that matter did other American, British and French journalists already operating in the city welcome them with open arms. Seasoned reporters in the Allied press circle, such as Arthur Ransome of the Daily News and Harold Williams of the Daily Chonicle, had been in Petrograd for some time, spoke fluent Russian and knew their way around. Unlike Reed with his burning socialist passion, they were far more sanguine about the realities of the new revolutionary order and its political players."}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_reed.html", "page_content": "John Reed, 1910. Library of Congress\n\n\"Even as an undergraduate he betrayed what many people believe to be the central passion of his life, an inordinate desire to be arrested.\" \u2014 Walter Lippman, 1914\n\nJohn Reed \u2014 writer, reporter, activist and playboy \u2014 was a legend even to his contemporaries. Born to a well-to-do Oregon family, a graduate of Harvard, and a steadfast socialist, Reed lived what many would call a terrifying life of his own making and desire.\n\nAdventurer\n\nIn the innocent, hopeful years before World War I, and scarcely out of Harvard, Reed embarked on a rebellious course that led him to befriend the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World), to write for Max Eastman's The Masses, to ride with the guerrilla forces of Pancho Villa, and to rush into the maw of the Russian Revolution just as the Bolsheviks brought an end to Czarist rule.\n\nBohemian Figure\n\nHe was a knight of American Bohemia, and a habitu\u00e9 of its capital, New York City's Greenwich Village. There he communed with an eclectic array of intellectuals, writers, and artists -- including Emma Goldman. His acquaintances advocated free speech and free love, and were committed to the cause of anarchism. One of them, the journalist Louise Bryant, became his wife and followed him to Russia twice -- once to write about the revolution as it continued to unfold, and once more to join her husband after his arrest and imprisonment. Reed and Bryant were determined \"to smash through the hull of custom and tradition,\" the editor Max Eastman observed, \"and touch at all times and over the earth the raw current of life.\"\n\nWar Protester\n\nWhen World War I broke out in Europe, it cast a pall over the generally pacifist \"lyrical Left.\" Reed wrote an article for The Masses entitled \"The Trader's War,\" criticizing the hypocritical mincing-machine of a war whose aim was profits through the sale of armaments. Three years later, at Emma Goldman's trial in June 1917 for obstructing the draft, Reed said the war was an \"overture to the blackest month for free men our generation has known. With hideous apathy the country has acquiesced in a regime of judicial tyranny, bureaucratic suppression and industrial barbarism. In America, law is merely the instrument for good or evil of the most powerful interest, and there are no Constitutional safeguards worth the powder to blow them to hell.\"\n\nWitness to Revolution\n\nReed's reporting of the Russian Revolution in 1917 brought him lasting fame. He arrived in Petrograd in time to witness the Bolshevik seizure of power in October. His now famous book, Ten Days That Shook the World was the first major account of the revolution to appear in America. \"From his typewriter,\" the historian Robert Rosenstone wrote, \"would flow hundreds of thousands of words about the origins and workings of Soviets, Kerensky and the Provisional Government, workers' control of factories, the state of the army, the character of the Russian people, Bolshevism, the personalities of Lenin, Trotsky, Lunacharsky and other leaders, the tangled web of foreign affairs, the meaning of counterrevolution, the implications of the revolution for the rest of the world.\" Reed's politics had always been passionately left-wing. They were now socialist in spirit, and communist in practice, meaning that his socialism responded to the Kremlin's dictates. From 1917 on, Reed's positions -- and those of other American left-wingers -- were always formed in dialogue, either for or against, with Moscow's Comintern (Communist International).\n\nTheory and Practice\n\nIn the fall of 1919, Reed made his last trip to Russia. After several months of observing how unstable Russia had become -- the government was now suppressing its citizens with summary executions -- Reed made plans to leave. The first leg of Reed's long journey home took him to the Astoria Hotel in Petrograd. Learning that Emma Goldman had just arrived in Russia after her deportation from the U.S., wrote Rosenstone, \"Jack burst into her room 'like a sudden ray of light.' Over a steaming cup of coffee, they celebrated a reunion.\" Almost immediately, Goldman brought up the uncomfortable topic of state power and demanded to know about the Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police). \"Reminded of all the old Russian revolutionists who had broken with the Bolsheviks, Jack blurted, 'You are a little confused by the Revolution in action because you have dealt with it only in theory.'\"\n\nUp Against the Revolution\n\nReed's causes often put him at mortal risk. Such was the case in Russia in 1919, as he passed through regions torn by civil war as he traveled home. He was arrested and imprisoned in Finland, just before the ship on which he stowed away was to sail to America. After his release, Reed returned to Petrograd to recover. In July 1919, he attended Comintern's Second Congress in Moscow. His militancy on the question of trade unionism alienated him from Russian leaders who had in mind consolidating their power over a populace that had to learn \"compromise\" and subjugation of individualist concerns.\n\nHero in Russia\n\nIn September 1919, at Reed's request, Louise Bryant traveled to Moscow to join her husband. She found him \"older and sadder.\" Their reunion was short-lived. Weak from prison and suffering from a long battle with kidney disease, Reed succumbed to typhus. He died on October 17, 1920, in a Moscow hospital with his Bryant by his side. He was thirty-three years old. John Reed was buried at the base of the Kremlin Wall, a Hero of the Revolution.\n\nImmortalized On Film\n\nIn 1981 actor and director Warren Beatty made a three-and-a-half-hour film based on Ten Days That Shook the World, using documentary interviews with Reed's surviving contemporaries as interludes in the film. Beatty himself played the character of John Reed, and Diane Keaton played Louise Bryant. Maureen Stapleton played Emma Goldman, winning an Oscar for her performance."}, {"url": "http://marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/comintern.html", "page_content": "ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY\n\nThe Communist International was the successor to the group of parties associated with the Left Wing of the Zimmerwald Conventions. First and foremost, of course, was the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) -- the organization which had seized the reins of the Russian empire in November of 1917 and was in the midst of consolidating its position in a bloody civil war. To a great extent, the establishment of the Comintern was a manifestation of the Russian desire for a final solution to its civil war through world revolution. Representatives of revolutionary parties and trends from around the globe were sought for participation in the new international organization.\n\n1. Founding Congress --- Moscow --- March 2-6, 1919.\n\nThe Founding Congress was attended by 34 delegates with decisive vote and 18 with consultative vote .\n\nA stenographic report of the Founding Congress of the Comintern was published in German in 1921 and in Russian translation that same year. An English translation of the Gerrman original was published by Pathfinder Press in 1987. [ Various speeches of the Founding Congress may be viewed here as html documents. ]\n\nThe First Congress did not elect an Executive Committee; it was to consist of delegates from the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Balkan Federation, Switzerrland, and Scandinavia.\n\nThe Communist Labor Party of America applied for Comintern membership on September 21, 1919.\n\nThe Communist Party of America applied for Comintern membership on November 24, 1919.\n\nThe Socialist Party of America applied for Comintern membership on March 12, 1920.\n\nDuring the first weeks of 1920, S.J. Rutgers and a small group of associates carried out instructions to establish a Western European Bureau of the Comintern at Amsterdam. President of this Bureau was Wijnkoop, and secretaries were Rutgers and Henriette Roland-Holst. The Amsterdam Bureau issued a bulletin in 3 languages.

Fraina the delegate); the British Socialist Party, the Workers' Socialist Federattion, and the Stop Stewards and Workers' Committees; the Swiss and Belgian Communist movements. There were also 5 delegates present with voice and no vote. Michael Borodin attended on behalf fo the Comintern.

A second edition in Russian was published in 1934, correcting some important errors. An English translation (in two volumes) of the German original was published by New Park Publications in 1977. [ This material may be viewed here as an html document. ]\n\nIn light of the hasty decision to convene the Founding Congress of the Comintern, with its list of delegates determined as much as anything by accidents of geography, in a certain sense the \"Second Congress\" of the Communist International should be regarded as the first.\n\nThe Communist Party of America dispatched two representatives to Moscow to serve as its delegates at the 2nd Congress (Louis C. Fraina and Alexander Stoklitsky) prior to the Bridgman Unity Convention of May 1920. The majority of the members of the old CPA refused to join the United Communist Party of America at this time, resulting in the continued existence of two communist organizations in America. After the conclusion of the Unity Convention, UCP member Edward Lindgren [\"Flynn\"] was sent to Moscow to serve as a Comintern Congress delegate, joining three other members of the former Communist Labor Party of America already there: former CLP International Delegates John Reed and Alexander Bilan, as well as Eadmonn MacAlpine. Lindgren brought news of the Unity Convention and the group decided to press for Comintern ratification of the new party by unseating the CPA delegation. No information on the Unity Convention and continued split had arrived from the old CPA, however, and the Credentials Commissionm, reluctant to make a ruling on the basis of incomplete information, upheld the mandates of Fraina and Stoklitsky. This decision, ratified by a 19-9 vote on the floor of the Congress, recognized the UCP as the majority party in America and accorded its delegates 6 votes, while the old CPA was regarded as the minority party and allocated 4 votes. [See the stenographic report of the brief debate on this matter, Lindgren speaking for the UCP and Fraina for the old CPA.]\n\nThe Second Congress approved the \"21 Conditions\" for admission to the Communist International.\n\nThe Second Congress elected an Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) for the first time. It consisted of delegates from Russia (5 members, 6 candidates), Germany (1 member, 1 candidate), France, Great Britainm The United States (2 delegates -- Reed of the UCP and Nicholas Hourwich [Gurvich; \"Andrew\"] of the Communist Party of America), Italy (1 member, 1 candidate) Czechoslovakia, Austria, Scandinavia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, the Far East, the Near East, Finland, Poland, Holland (2 delegates), Latvia (1 candidate), Hungary, Georgia, Java, and a Youth representative. This group in turn elected a small bureau consisting of Zinoviev, Bukharin, and Kobetsky (Russia); Runniansky (Hungary); and Meyer (Germany).\n\nThe small bureau was later enlarged to include Kun (Hungary), Rosmer (France), Koenen, and Radek (Russia).\n\nFirst Congress of Peoples of the East --- Baku --- September 1-8, 1920.\n\nA stenographic report of the First Congress of Peoples of the East was published in Russian in 1920. An English translation was published in Moscow in 1922 and a German translation that same year. A new English translation was made by Brian Pearce and published in London by Hammersmith Books in 1970. [ This stenographic report is available here as an html document. ]\n\nJohn Reed addressed the gathering on behalf of the workers of America.\n\nThe Congress approved in principle the adoption of two manifestos -- one to the toilers of the East and a second to the Workers of Europe, American, and Japan. Text of the resolutions was actually prepared after the congress and they were first published in Kommunisticheskii Internatsional No. 14 (Nov. 6, 1920).\n\nIn the words of British historian E.H. Carr:\n\nThe Baku congress, though described in its records as the first congress of eastern peoples, had no successor, and left little behind it in the way of machinery. The council of propaganda and action was set up at Baku, and made its first report to [ECCI] in November 1920. In December it announced the first issue of a journal, The Peoples of the East, to appear in Russian, Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. There is little other record of its activities. [fn. E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, v. 3, pp. 267-268.]\n\n4. 3rd World Congress --- Moscow --- June 22 - July 12, 1921.\n\nA stenographic report of the 3rd Congress of the Comintern was published in German in Hamburg in 1921 and in Russian translation in 1922. An abridged report of the proceedings in English was published in London by the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1921.\n\nThe Third Congress did not directly elect an Executive Committee, but decided that the 4 parties with 40 votes at the Congress should send two delegates and the 14 countries with 20 to 20 votes should send one delegate. The first American delegate dispatched to Moscow as a representative to the ECCI was Oscar Tyverovsky [\"Baldwin\"].\n\nThis body was subsequently \"enlarged\" in 1921-22; 15 new Communist Parties were allotted delegates with consultative votes and other parties were allowed a second vote. The United States was allotted two representatives by the time of the 4th Congress: Ludwig E. Katterfeld [\"Carr\"] -- who replaced Tyverovsky -- and James P. Cannon [\"Cook\"]. The ECCI elected a presidium consisting of Zinoviev, Radek, and Bukharin (Russia); Heckert (Germany); Souvarine (France); Genanri (Italy); Kun (Hungary); and Humbert-Droz (Switzerland). A three member Secretariat consisting of Kuusinen (Finland), Rakosi (Hungary), and Humbert-Droz handled day-to-day organizational details.\n\nAlthough not originally intended as such, the formal gatherings of the \"enlarged\" Executive Committee of the Comintern rapidly came to supplant the more cumbersome and logistically difficult World Congresses of that body. With communications between Moscow and the rest of the world still shaky in this period, the doubling of representation at the gathering allowed the dispatch of half the delegates home again to directly relate the decisions of the gathering to their repsective national parties.\n\nAmerican Delegates to the 3rd Congress included Max Bedacht.\n\nFirst Congress of Toilers of the Far East --- Moscow and Petrograd --- Jan. 21 - Feb. 2, 1922.\n\nThis gathering was attended by delegates from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and the peoples of Siberia.\n\nIt was not the Third Congress but rather the 1st Enlarged Plenum which actively advanced the slogan of the \"United Front\" -- the call for the gathering itself, made in January 1922, took the form of an open manifesto to the workers of the world entitled \" For the United Front of the Proletariat. \"\n\n5. 1st Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- Feb. 24 - March 4, 1922.\n\nThe First Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International was attended by 105 delegates from 36 sections. The Plenum considered the theses on the United Front, a proposal from the Vienna Union for a joint conference of the executives of the three Internationals, the war danger, communist work in the trade unions, and the situation in the French and British Communist Parties.\n\nThe Plenum elected a new Presidium, consisting of Zinoviev, Radek, and Bukharin (Russia); Brandler (Germany); Souvarine (France); Terracini (Italy); Keribich (Czechoslovakia); and Katterfeld (USA). Candidates were Genrik Valetskii (Russia) and Otto Kuusinen (Finland).\n\nMax Bedacht also was present as a delegate of the American Communist movement.\n\n6. 2nd Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- June 7-11, 1922.\n\nThe Second Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Comintern was attended by 41 delegates from 17 countries with voting powers, and 9 additional delegates with voice but no vote. In addition, there were 4 representatives of the Red International of Trade Unions and 4 representatives of the Communist Youth International with votes. Another account states that there were a total of 60 delegates in attendance.\n\nA great deal of time was spent by the plenum discussing the affairs of the Communist Party of France.\n\nThe Second Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International replaced Terracini, Keibich, and Katterfeld with Gramsci (Italy), Smeral (Czechoslovakia), and Jordanov. Candidate members were Cannon [\"Cook\"] (USA) and Kuusinen (Finland).\n\nBy the time of the 4th Congress, the ECCI was run by a 5 person Secretariat consisting of Kuusinen (Finland), Kon, Eberlein (Germany), Rakosi (Hungary), and Minkin.\n\nstanding: Jim Cannon (WPA), William Ross Knudsen (SLP), unidentified.\n\nseated: Alexander Trachtenberg (WPA), Arne Swabeck (TUEL), Rose Wortis (TUEL), Max Bedacht (CPA)\n\n7. 4th World Congress --- Petrograd and Moscow --- November 5 - December 5, 1922.\n\nA stenographic report of the 4th Congress of the Comintern was published in German in Hamburg in 1923 and in Russian translation that same year. A much-abridged report of the proceedings was published in London by the Communist Party of Great Britain circa 1923. The body opened at a meeting held in Petrograd on Nov. 5 before moving to Moscow for its subsequent meetings.\n\nThe 4th Congress was attended by a total of 393 delegates, including representatives of 58 Communist Parties. Some 340 of these delegates were given both voice and vote, 48 (including the Americans, members of a \"sympathetic\" rather than fully-affiliate party, the WPA) were allowed voice but not vote, and 5 were admitted as guests. The Workers Party of America sent three delegates, including Max Bedacht (who reported on the gathering to the Central Executive Committee of the WPA ) and Alexander Trachtenberg. Also present was Alfred S. Edwards (\"Sullivan\"), a hardline member of the party's left. Also at the gathering was Martin Abern, representing the Young Workers League of America, joined by his traveling companion and fellow YWL activist, John Edwards, who attended as an observer.\n\nThe 4th Congress appointed an American Commission to study the situation and develop policy for the Communist Party of America. This commission consisted of Radek, Bukharin, Kuusinen, and Losovsky (replaced by Melnichansky) from Russia; Valetskii and Domski (Poland); Katayama (Japan); Kurela (Finland); Raavenstein (Holland); Eberlein (Germany); Lackie (England); Kobler (Czechoslovakia); Gamelon (France); Assaria (Italy); McLean (Ireland); and McDonald (Canada). This American Commission rebuked Edwards for an attack he launched on the political line of The Worker,\n\nThe gathering heard a keynote report by V.I. Lenin entitled \"Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution.\"\n\nThe 4th Congress changed the structure of the Executive Committee of the Comintern. No longer would ECCI members be selected by member parties and responsible to those parties; henceforth the 25 members of the ECCI would be elected by one congress and be responsible for carrying out the decisions of that congress. These members of ECCI would be responsible only to the next congress. The 4th Congress elected en bloc a slate for the ECCI nominated by the Congress' Presidium.\n\n8. 3rd Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- June 12-23, 1923.\n\nA stenographic protocol of the 3rd Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1923.\n\nIsrael Amter attended the sessions of the 3rd Enlarged Plenum as the delegate of the Workers Party of America. He prepared an extensive report on the results of the gathering which was published in the party press in all languages in August 1923.\n\n9. 5th World Congress --- Moscow --- June 17 - July 8, 1924.\n\nThe 5th World Congress of the Communist international was attended by 406 delegates from 41 countries, of whom 324 were delegates with full voting rights. As the historian E.H. Carr has noted:\n\n\"By far the most important event occurring within the orbit of the Cominteren between its Fourth and Fifth Congresses was the failure of the attempted German revolution of October 1923. The Fifth Congress could hardly fail to reflect the widening gap between the one party which had a victorious revolution to its credit and the parties which had failed, or had not even made the attempt. * * * The German failure of October 1923 proved the general need for a leadership in foreign communist parties more amenable to Russian example and guidance.\" [fn. E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, (London: Macmillan, 1964) v. 7, pp. 70, 95.]\n\nThe failure of the German revolution was blamed on the \"Brandlerite\" leadership of the KPD and was used as cause for the removal of the current leadership and replacement with a new group hailing from the party's Left. At the same time, in Britain a Labour government came to power for the first time and accorded Soviet Russia with de jure recognition. As a result, the center of gravity of the international movement quickly shifted from Germany to England.\n\n[fn. E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia, (London: Macmillan, 1964) v. 7, pg. 72.]\n\nA stenographic report of the 5th Congress was published in German in 2 volumes in 1924. A Russian translation was published in Moscow in 1925. A much-abridged report of the proceedings in English was published by the Communist Party of Great Britain circa 1925.\n\n10. 4th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- June 12 and July 12-13, 1924.\n\nThe 4th Plenum of the Enlarged ECCI met for one day prior to the 5th World Congress and for two days after it ended. The July sessions dealt with matters referred to ECCI by the 5th Congress: reports for the Italian Commission by Manuilsky, for the Swedish Commission by Thaelmann, on behalf of the Bulgarian Commission, a resolution on Poland. The plenum also established a Negro Commission, including representatives of the British, French, and Belgian parties, to organize propaganda among the black population.\n\n11. 5th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- March 21 - April 6, 1925.\n\nA stenographic protocol of the 5th Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1925.\n\nThe American delegates to the 5th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI included William Z. Foster [\"Dorsey\"], James P. Cannon, and John Williamson (YWL) for the majority; C.E. Ruthenberg [\"Sanborn\"], Jay Lovestone [\"Powers\"], and John Pepper for the minority.

Foster and Lovestone were also appointed to the Peasant Commission.\n\nThe main report was delivered by Grigorii Zinoviev, which set the line on the \"partial stabilization\" of capitalism and advanced the slogan of \"Bolshevization\" of communist parties.\n\nJames P. Cannon delivered a speech on the problems of Bolshevization of the American party and the question of a Labor Party in America on March 30, 1925.\n\nThe 5th Plenum had an American Commission, chaired by Otto Kuusinen with Jules Humbert-Droz its secretary.\n\n12. 6th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- Feb. 17 - March 15, 1926.\n\nThe 6th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI met for the first time at 8 pm in the Andreev Hall of the Kremlin, the former throne room of the Tsar. A stenographic protocol of the 6th Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1926. Extensive excerpts of the proceedings were published in English in the pages of International Press Correspondence, beginning with the March 4, 1926 issue.\n\nThe welcoming speech to the gathering was made by Chairman of the Comintern Grigorii Zinoviev, after which the credentials committee reported that 23 of the 43 members of ECCI were present (all with decisive vote), as were 14 of 27 candidate members (5 serving as substitutes with decisive vote, the other 9 with consultative vote). In addition, another 93 delegates representing 32 parties were present -- 49 with decisive and 44 with consultative votes.

The Political Commission was headed by Zinoviev and included representatives of the parties of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Belorussia, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Estonia, Finland, France, Holland, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, Yugoslavia, and the Young Communist League.

In his speech, Zinoviev reaffirmed the idea of the \"temporary stabilization of capitalism.\" A dual \"perspective\" was advocated, whereby the move to a new revolutionary period might be either fast (for example, in 2 years) or slow (in 10 years). Regardless, Zinoviev stated, \"our diagnosis is the same as before: the death of capitalism, dictatorship of the proletariat within a comparatively short time!\" Zinoviev more than once emphasized the importance of the 3rd Congress of the Comintern (1921) over that of the 4th (1922) and 5th (1924), strongly advocating the continuance of the slogan \"To the Masses!\" and the unceasing utilization of \"United Front tactics.\" The goal, Zinoviev states, is to win the support of a majority of the working class to the leadership of the Communist Party -- something that was as yet unobtained.\n\nWith regards to the United States, Zinoviev called America \"but one of the links of world capitalsm as a whole (although the strongest link)\" and calls it \"the promised land of reformism.\" He sees a trend among the nations of Europe towards the \"Americanization\" of the labor movement, attempts to strip the trade unions of their radical political perspective and to reduce them to negotiating devices for purely monetary objectives. Zinoviev criticized both \"Ultra-Left\" (anti-United Front) and \"Right\" (Social Democratic) opposition movements within the Communist Parties, and is critical of the misapplication of United Front tactics by erstwhile well-meaning supporters of the Comintern general line. He advocated increased \"self-reliance and independence\" among the parties of the Comintern, while acknowledging situations in which the CI must \"dissolve some CC\" and \"appoint another in its place\" due to \"situations when this can not be helped.\"\n\n13. 7th Enlarged Plenum of the ECCI --- Moscow --- Nov. 22 - Dec. 16, 1926.\n\nA stenographic protocol of the 7th Enlarged Plenum was published in German in Hamburg in 1927.
