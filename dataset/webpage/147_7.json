A bit of a womaniser, Charles was always getting himself into trouble and was routinely banished from court.\n\nNot that being banished caused him any problems...\n\nNow 38, Henry Cavill is known around the world for a different role - that of Superman in the Man of Steel franchise.\n\nOther notable roles for the dashingly handsome Cavill are as Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher and Sherlock Holmes in Enola Holmes, starring Millie Bobby Brown.\n\nDid you spot Henry out in Hull when they were filming in the Old Town?\n\nNatalie Dormer\n\n(Image: Mirror)\n\nNatalie Dormer gave an unforgettable turn as Henry's second wife Anne Boleyn, drawing the King's eye and ending both his first marriage and the Pope's jurisdiction in England in the process.\n\nNow 39, Natalie Dormer is perhaps better known for her appearance in another TV series concerning kings and queens.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, Natalie starred as Margaery Tyrell in the HBO mega-series Game of Thrones, earning herself further acclaim and cementing her reputation as a fantastic period actor.\n\nOther notable roles include parts in The Hunger Games films and the mini series Penny Dreadful: City of Angels.\n\nSam Neill\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nSam Neill gave a brilliant performance as the cunning Cardinal Wolsey, who sought to get King Henry his divorce while holding onto his own position of power within the kingdom.\n\nSince then, many will recognise Sam Neill from his role in the first season of Peaky Blinders where he played Tommy Shelby's nemesis, the crafty Inspector Campbell who sought to clean up the streets of Birmingham.\n\nOther roles include parts in Alcatraz, Crusoe, Happy Town, and even some voice acting in Rick and Morty.\n\nNeill is now 74 and lives in New Zealand with his family. He has three children and one stepchild.\n\nJeremy Northam\n\nJeremy Northam played the role of Sir Thomas More, King Henry's trusted friend and councillor. More became a tormented character when Henry's desire for a divorce began to clash with his religious beliefs.\n\nIn the time since appearing on The Tudors, Northam has appeared in a range of other dramatic roles, and it would seem that he just cannot keep away from royalty...\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, Jeremy starred as Anthony Eden in the hit Netflix series, The Crown.\n\nJeremy is now 60 years old, meaning he has outlived Sir Thomas by quite some distance!\n\nJames Frain\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nJames Frain played the scheming and talented Thomas Cromwell, who rose from obscurity to be one of the most powerful men in King Henry's court.\n\nSince The Tudors, James Frain has gone on to enjoy a hugely successful acting career, including roles in HBO's vampire drama True Blood and the BBC's Orphan Black.\n\nAfter having a taste of royalty, Frain played Warwick the Kingmaker in 2013's The White Queen.\n\nSince 2017, James has played Spock's dad Sarek in Star Trek Discovery.\n\nFor all the latest news direct to your inbox, click here."}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/lucy_akhurst", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 61% The Land Girls (1998)\n\nLowest Rated: 9% Circus (2000)\n\nBirthday: Nov 18, 1975\n\nBirthplace: London, England, UK\n\nActress Lucy Akhurst was widely known for her presence on the silver screen.
