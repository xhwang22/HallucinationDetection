A bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Mohammad Nawaz while deciding bunch of petitona filed by the Karnataka State Judicial Officers Association and...\n\nKarnataka HIgh Court has held that 'New Pension Scheme' for judicial officers appointed post April 1, 2006, cannot be made mandatory by the government and it will be optional for the state cadre judicial officers to opt for the same.\n\nA bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Mohammad Nawaz while deciding bunch of petitona filed by the Karnataka State Judicial Officers Association and 87 judicial officers, challenging the Notification, dated March 31, 2006 issued by the State Government for introducing 'New Defined Contributory Pension Scheme' (for short, 'the New Pension Scheme') with effect from 1st April 2006 and the said scheme is made operational from April 1, 2010. The scheme provided for employees' contribution of 10% of the basic pay and dearness allowance (DA) with the matching contribution from the State Government. The new pension scheme is sought to be applied to the Judicial Officers, appointed on or after 1st April 2006.\n\nIt has restrain the State Government from applying the said the new pension scheme to the Judicial Officers without their consent in writing. No deductions from the salaries of the Judicial Officers shall be made on the basis of the aforesaid Government Orders. Further directed that the State Government, through its Law and Justice Department, shall call upon all the Judicial Officers who have been appointed on or after 1st April, 2006 to submit their option/consent in writing to opt for 'the new pension scheme' as per Government Order dated 31st March 2006. Such option shall be invited within a period of four weeks, by granting time to the Judicial Officers to exercise their option by 31st January 2020.\n\nIn case of Judicial Officers who do not opt for the new pension scheme, the State Government shall refund the amount already deducted from their respective salaries, refund shall be made on or before end of February 2020.\n\nSenior advocate K. Shashi Kiran Shetty argued for the petitioners:\n\nThe pay of the Judicial Officers is governed by the Orders of the Apex Court accepting both the reports with modifications and therefore, the act of applying the new pension scheme which requires 10% deduction from the salary of the Judicial Officers is completely in gross violation of the directions issued by the Apex Court. Moreover, by erroneously equating the services of the Judicial Officers with that of civil servants, the new pension scheme was applied to the Judicial Officers by the State Government. It is also pointed out that the payment of pension to the Judicial Officers is strictly governed by the Judicial Pay Commissions' recommendations and therefore, introducing the new pension scheme and applying the same to the Judicial Officers is contrary to the directions issued by the Apex Court and it is completely illegal.\n\nAdditional Advocate General R. Subramanya argued:\n\nThe payment of pension is concerned, the Judicial Officers are equivalent to the Government Servants except to an extent of certain modifications made by the first and second National Judicial Pay Commissions. He submitted that the recommendations of the second National Judicial Pay Commission were made after introduction of the new pension scheme by the State Government. However, the Pay Commissions report is silent about the applicability of the new pension scheme to the Judicial Officers. His submission is that as the Karnataka Judicial Service (Recruitment) Rules, 2004 were made in exercise of powers under Article 309 read with 233, 234 and 235 of the Constitution of India, the Judicial Officers are civil servants. He submitted that in the said Rules 2004, the word 'service' has been defined as 'Karnataka State Judicial Services' and, therefore, all the rules regulating conditions of service of the members of the State Civil Service are applicable to the Judicial Officers as well. He pointed out that the new Defined Contributory Pension Scheme was introduced by the Central Government after considering the reports from the experts and in terms of the said scheme, the State of Karnataka has framed the new pension scheme.\n\nThe bench:\n\nRejected the primary argument that the State Government is that the Judicial Service is also a civil service. By relying on the decision of The Apex Court, in the case of All India Judges' Association and others \u2013vs- Union of India and others. In which it is held that \"The judicial service is not service in the sense of 'employment'. The Judges are not employees. As members of the judiciary, they exercise the sovereign judicial power of the State. They are holders of public offices in the same way as the members of the council of ministers and the members of the legislature.\"\n\nIn regards to the argument that \"As the recommendations of Justice Padmanabhan Commission were accepted long after the decision of the State Government of introducing the new pension scheme made applicable to the government servants appointed after 1st April 2006, and as the Apex Court has not said anything about the applicability of the scheme, the same remains unaffected.\n\nJustice Oka said \"This contention is fallacious. The State of Karnataka which was before the Apex Court ought to have raised such a contention before the Apex Court. If really the State of Karnataka intended to apply the said new pension scheme even to the Judicial Officers, there was no legal impediment in the way the State Government raising such contention before the Apex Court. On the contrary, the order dated 26th July 2010 which records acceptance of the recommendations of the Second Pay Commission including the recommendations in respect of pension, notes that none of the States had any objection for passing the said order. Therefore, applying the different yardsticks for payment of pension to the Judicial Officers appointed on or after 1st April 2006 will be directly contrary to and in breach of the directions of the Apex Court. The State Government, without seeking the permission of the Apex Court, has no power to tinkle with the quantum of the salaries and pension payable to the Judicial Officers.\"\n\nClick here to download the Order"}, {"url": "https://en.everybodywiki.com/Anand_Kripalu", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nAnand Kripalu (born 2 October 1958), is the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of United Spirits Limited (USL)[1] an alcohol beverage company belonging to the international group, Diageo plc.[2] USL is listed both on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange, and features on the BSE 100[3] and NSE 100[4] lists.

In 1958, Professor Xie Xide (1921-2000) founded the major of Semiconductor Physics, the predecessor of the school. Relevant doctoral programs were initiated in 1984. In 1988, Microelectronics and Solid-state Electronics was rated as a national key discipline; in May 2015, the school became one of the first national demonstration school of microelectronics.\n\nWith presence at both Handan campus and Zhangjiang campus of Fudan University, the School of Microelectronics hosts a couple of national, provincial, and ministerial research platforms. It has founded (1) in 1992 the National Key Laboratory of Application Specific Integrated Circuit and System (Fudan University), the only national key lab in the field of integrated circuit, (2) in 2013 the Yangtze River Delta Collaborative Innovation Center for Integrated Circuit Design and Manufacture, a project led by the school and approved by Shanghai Education Commission, (3) in 2014 the International Training Base (Shanghai) of National Integrated Circuit Talents, and (4) in 2018 the National Integrated Circuit Innovation Center, a project under the national strategy of Manufacturing Power. The school is currently focusing on the establishment of the International Innovation Center for Micro/Nano Electronics and Quantum, the mainstay of the Zhangjiang-Fudan International Innovation Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjects and Programs\n\nUndergraduate program: The undergraduate major of Microelectronic Science and Engineering enrolls about 120 full-time students annually. In accordance with the 2020 Fudan Initiative to Enhance First-class Undergraduate Education, the school designs a \u201c2+X years\u201d cultivation system that integrates the six educational approaches of classroom learning, Fudan College sessions, research and entrepreneurship, social practices, overseas study, and new media. The integrated system that involves all faculty members and covers the entire teaching proceedings offers wider choices to the students and unleashes their potential.\n\nPostgraduate program: The major of Semiconductor Physics, the predecessor of the School of Microelectronics, launched its doctoral program in 1984. Microelectronics and Solid-state Electronics was rated as a national key discipline in 1988. The school has now built an all-around postgraduate study syllabus, providing both master and doctoral degree programs. It has launched a master program, a doctoral program, a M.Eng program, and an engineering doctorate program. Every year, around 200 admitted postgraduates receive instructions from accomplished faculty with rigorous attitude and rich experience. The school has 31 master supervisors and 33 doctoral supervisors, employs more than 50 senior instructors from enterprises, and has co-founded internship and training bases with national key institutions and renowned enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\n\nThe school upholds a talent development strategy combining introduction with cultivation of faculty members. Its well-structured faculty is characterized by innovative minds and world-class academic performance. The 136 faculty members of the school include 69 full-time teaching staff, 22 engineering test technicians, 9 administrative staff, 8 project-based researchers, 6 project assistants, and 22 research team assistants. Among them are 40 professors, 34 associate professors, 1 academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 4 awardees of the fund offered by the China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, 4 awardees of the fund offered by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars., and 1 research team whose project has been supported by the Ministry of Education. In addition, the school has employed a number of experts as chair professors from universities and enterprises at home and abroad.\n\nIn recent years, the school has paid high attention to talent development by organizing a special working group to facilitate general coordination. The school has built a practical and efficient mechanism of talent introduction that responds quickly to the need of teaching and research and makes employment decisions based on comprehensive considerations. The mechanism helps gather a large group of advanced talents of both integrity and capability. The school is also forming a talent cultivation system with Fudan characteristics in accordance with Excellence 2025, a talent cultivation initiative of the university. The initiative cultivates talents based on their specializations, which contributes to the goal of building a first-class faculty.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\nThe School of Microelectronics continues to enhance its research capability, as required by the Fudan initiative Progression 2025. With emphases on major platforms, research teams, projects, and achievements, the school relentlessly enhances its core competitiveness in scientific research, expecting a role transition from a follower to a leader. It is now constructing a technological innovation system in accordance with the national major development strategy and the development plan of the university. Led by strategic missions of the country, the system focuses on disciplinary research and develops disciplinary transformation and application. Currently, the school hosts the following major research platforms and innovation centers: the National Key Laboratory of Application Specific Integrated Circuit and System, the National Integrated Circuit Innovation Center, the Yangtze River Delta Collaborative Innovation Center for Integrated Circuit Design and Manufacture, and the International Innovation Center for Micro/Nano Electronics and Quantum (under construction).\n\nIn recent years, the school has made remarkable achievements in such research fields as the third type of storage technology, the two-dimensional neuromorphic devices, and the hypervelocity quasi-nonvolatile memory. On July 5, 2018, a professor of the school was awarded the first Best Paper Prize by Integration, the VLSI Journal at the 15th International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design in Prague. Several other papers have been brought to the International Solid-state Circuits Conference (ISSCC), the foremost forum on integrated circuit, and included in the conference publications.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Cooperation\n\nThe School of Microelectronics plays an active role in international cooperation. The International Training Base of National Integrated Circuit Talents, founded in November 2014, draws support from Shanghai, a city of industrial concentration and technological advancement. It incubates disciplinary integration and facilitates international communication and cooperation, expecting to cultivate more well-qualified professionals with a global vision for the integrated circuit industry of the Yangtze River Delta and the country at large. It has made notable progress in introducing global talents, cooperating with global universities, and high-end training. The school is committed to the construction of Zhangjiang Comprehensive National Science Center, the introduction of faculty from enterprises and abroad, and the integration of the curriculum with global perspectives, aiming at taking the lead in faculty capability and education quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}], "B.

Based on heritage values, they determined which historical information had to be retained. Even though the materials for the renovation could not be the same as those used in the past, the architect asked that the craftsmanship be as close as possible to the original, therefore maximising the expression of artistic value. Eventually, the interior structures, as well as the western fa\u00e7ade, were successfully preserved in a way that resembled the original.\n\n3.1 Reinforcing the beamless superstructure system\n\nYong\u2019an Warehouse represents one of the first implementations of a beamless superstructure system in China. The structural systems within the twin buildings were fully retained, but the interior walls had been repeatedly repainted. Thus, the design team used a high-pressure water gun to clean the entire structure of the remaining paint and carefully restored the reinforced concrete frame structures to their original state.\n\nThe architects analysed the building structure and frequently met with the local Cultural Heritage Department to discuss the seismic requirements. They came up with a solution to insert eight reinforced concrete core tubes, strengthen the horizontal supports and provide for emergency evacuation routes and equipment installation without the removal of any of the octagonal prismatic columns (Fig. 7). To address the rooftop\u2019s loading standards, they decided to insert steel interlayers into the top floor and rooftop structures, which invisibly increased the load capacity for the equipment.\n\nFig. 7 Plans of the Yong\u2019an Warehouse renovation (Source: Archi-Union Architects) Full size image\n\nFurthermore, the reinforced steel panels and frames in the original building were retained, and reinforced concrete was applied for renovation. The change in materials also reflected the transformation of the building structure as well as its interior space (Figs. 8 and 9).\n\nFig. 8 Renovated beam and slab structures on the top level (Source: Tianzhou Yang) Full size image\n\nFig. 9 Renovated beamless structural system of the interior (Source: Tianzhou Yang) Full size image\n\n3.2 Renovating the peripheral compartments\n\nYong\u2019an Warehouse was built in a modern style with a clear sense of architectural rhythm. The building\u2019s west wing most clearly retained the appearance of the original fa\u00e7ade. After the outer layer of paint was removed, the stuccoed texture of the concrete was clear to the eye. As the structural integrity of the interior walls was largely compromised due to repeated damage, for safety reasons, the design team decided that 80% of the walls needed to be renovated. Because of the difficulty of preserving the traces of erosion while making the structure stable, the team decided to restore the walls to their original state.\n\nThe architects collaborated with a group of experts to experiment with and test the concrete stuccoed technique to replicate the original appearance of the exterior walls. They also invited craftsmen equipped with traditional skills to repair the old aperture compartments.\n\nBalancing the new and the old through an understanding of their relationship, minimal intervention has always been the key to renovations of historic architecture. For Yong\u2019an Warehouse, a design process following the symbiotic twin strategy was used for the east wing building, which had less preservation value, to honour its historical origin and maintain the project\u2019s underlying coherence. Overall, characteristics such as the building\u2019s footage and the general silhouette were generally retained since the design details could distinguish the new from the old. (Fig. 10).\n\nFig. 10 Axonometric view of Yong\u2019an Warehouse (Source: Archi-Union Architects) Full size image\n\n3.3 Renovating the twin Fa\u00e7ades\n\nThe fact that the east wing building had gone through several severe reconstructions enabled the architects to move beyond an exact replication and to instead apply novel technologies to revive the rhythm and imagery of the original fa\u00e7ade. For instance, they used screen printing to reproduce the stuccoed texture on glass panels. The printed images were taken from the restored west building and transferred at an exact 1:1 ratio onto the glass panels (Figs. 11 and 12). After careful calibration, the panels, once installed, made the two buildings almost identical from a distance but distinctively different up close. In this way, the warehouse\u2019s three life phases, as represented by its historical fa\u00e7ade, the marks of previous renovations and the new fa\u00e7ade of screen-printed glass, were all shown in a single view. The high and low light of the twin buildings at night indicated the symbiotic twin relationship connecting the past and the future (Figs. 13 and 14).\n\nFig. 11 Internal view of the fa\u00e7ades made of screen-printed glass (Source: Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\nFig. 12 Details of the screen-printed glass panels (Source: left by Tianzhou Yang; right by Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\nFig. 13 Symbiotic Twin Fa\u00e7ades: the old and the new (Source: Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\nFig. 14 Walking path along the river (Source: Tianzhou Yang) Full size image\n\nTo meet the green building standards, the screen-printed glass became part of a triple-layered glass window system with insulating air between the layers. Each opening is composed of two of these glass panels. Similar techniques were applied to the loading dock on the west side and to the fa\u00e7ade of the side building. The loading dock was maintained in its original form. However, the side room built in 1990 was preserved only with its mainframe structure. The entrance was replaced with screen-printed glass panels as well.\n\n3.4 Rebuilding the historical water tank\n\nIn 2011, the original water tank was removed, which separated the two building volumes and destroyed the unique quality of the industrial structure in terms of the overall composition. To recreate the rhythmic silhouette, the architects decided to reuse the original water tank as a formal guideline for an observatory on the rooftop with a complete steel structure instead of a steel and concrete structure. The new form corresponds with that of the historic water tank, uses screen-printed glass for the fa\u00e7ades, and connects the two opposing building volumes with a public staircase. The upward sightseeing route provides grand views for visitors of the Yangpu waterfront (Figs. 7 and 15).\n\nFig. 15 Historical water tank vs. renovated observatory (Source: Fangfang Tian) Full size image\n\n3.5 Spatial reordering\n\nThe architects reemphasised the entrance by using steel plates and modernist design language to direct the public path into the twin buildings. New gigantic columns and staircases were added, which expanded the square footage of the second floor, created new circulation and the observatory, and provided shade for the middle pathway. The gigantic columns took their forms from the original octagonal prismatic columns\u2019 deconstructed curves, which constituted the rainwater drainage systems. The exaggerated forms overturned the stereotypical static impression of the warehouses and corresponded to the internal structures, making the middle pathway the building\u2019s focal point. The new parts were built separately from the original structure to ensure the reversibility of the operation (Fig. 16).\n\nFig. 16 Gigantic columns with built-in rainwater drainage system (Source: Archi-Union Architects) Full size image\n\nThrough an atrium and a public staircase in the east wing and the staggered arrangement of its sections, the additions were able to direct the natural light and make Yangpu Bridge\u2019s frame structure visible through the skylight, inviting visitors to ascend.\n\n3.6 Integrating into the urban environment\n\nThe architects indented the exterior walls one column span inwards to expose the original first-floor columns on the south, east and north sides, creating a 6 m wide transitional lounge. This not only showcased the beauty of the historic architecture to the city but also facilitated a pedestrian passage. The design raised the interior floor level to match the existing flood-control walls, creating a linear spatial experience between the interior, the colonnade, and the riverside recreational spaces."}, {"url": "http://english.shyp.gov.cn/ywb/DepartmentNews/20210705/385949.html", "page_content": "Recently, the 2021 International Archives Day & Yangpu Sub-Venue of the 2021 Shanghai Archives Culture Publicity Month was held in Yangpu District Archives Bureau.

After leaving Cambridge University in 1955, where he studied Economics and Law, Anand joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at which time he served as ambassador to Canada, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1972 Anand was appointed as Thailand's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, a job he held until 1976 when he was promoted to the highest civil service ranking as Permanent Secretary of Thailand's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\n\nAfter the turbulent events of 6 October 1976, Anand retired in 1979, ending 23 illustrious years in the foreign service. But Anand, not a person to keep still for long, began his second profession in the private sector, joining the Saha-Union Group that same year and becoming its Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1991. But fate was to take another twist. Following the military take-over in February 1991, Anand was invited to serve as Thailand's Prime Minister the following month. He assumed the political position reluctantly, but determined to minimize the damage inflicted on Thailand's democratic process, eventually establishing a civilian-dominated government that ensured a smooth and peaceful transition to an open society, and bringing about much-needed economic and social reforms.\n\n\n\nIn October 1992, he resumed his business career but continued his public service work in a personal capacity. He has been called upon to assist successive civilian governments in the areas of economic and social policies, human rights and governance. In recognition of his deep commitment to public service, in 1997, he was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service. In the international arena, Anand is a trustee of the U Thant Institute and a board member in many foundations. He is also a member of the Advisory Group of Anti-Corruption Issues for the East Asia and Pacific Region of the World Bank and the Advisory Council of Transparency International (TI). He has also served as UNICEF Ambassador for Thailand since 1996.\n\nCIA The World Factbook Interview with Anand Panyarachun,\n\nYuli Ismartono [time 27:20]\n\n\n\n8th March, 2006 Welcome to another edition of THE LEADERS. Today we are in the Thai capital of Bangkok, where protests against Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra have gone on for weeks. He has called for snap elections, further placing the country in an uproar. Thailand is known as one of the most democratic nations in Asia. Is democracy at risk here in Thailand?\n\n\n\nTo discuss with us, this issue and other issues on Thailand, is the country's foremost statesman and former prime minister, Anand Panyarachun. Khun Anand, welcome the program -- THE LEADERS. Yuli Ismartono: These are interesting times in Thailand. As a former leader, how do you assess the current political situation in the country? Anand Panyarachun: In any society, particularly in a democratic society, you would have political crises every now and then. Perhaps in a developing world, we have more incidents of greater frequency than the others. I'd like to take a more positive perspective of the whole Thai events. I think it's definitely a political crisis, but I hope it will not lead to any disasters. I think since the last upheaval in 1991 which led to a formation of a civilian government, which led later on to the writing of the people's appeals constitution. I think that we have progressed fairly considerably. You will have noticed that the past assembly, the street protesters, they did not generate any physical force or any physical confrontation. I think the demonstrators have behaved well in terms of a peaceful demonstration. I'd like to congratulate the authorities for ensuring that the police forces are unarmed and do not use any coercive measures which could lead to actual physical confrontation. But be that as it may, I think there's still room for concern that if the two sides -- particularly if the Prime Minister persists in doing what he has been doing all along, that could generate a high degree of intense heat, this type of confrontation. But I hope that it will end well to the satisfaction of the two sides. | 1 | 2 | 3 | Next >> Anand Panyarachun,\n\nAnand Panyarachun, Thailand's illustrious statesman, is chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission and former Prime Minister of Thailand.

Some vested sections among both sides-Ambedkarits and Marxists have tried to put both sides more in conflict than in agreement on many social issues. There are few scholars and activists, especially after the rise of Communal Hindutva and it getting state power in 2014, to focus this dialogue on more common grounds among the two thoughts. Many student organisations in JNU or in Hyderabad University or IIT\u2019s in Chennai and Kharagpur, have focussed on common grounds between Marxist revolutionary Bhagat Singh and Dalit liberation thinker Dr. Ambedkar, along with Periyar and Mahatma Phule.\n\nAnand Teltumbde, scholar in his own right, though closely related to Ambedkar family as well, has edited few incomplete writings of Dr. Ambedkar under the title-\u2018India and Communism\u2019 with his lucid introduction on the subject. It is mentioned in Publisher\u2019s Note Dr. Ambedkar has left a note in his papers that he wished to write a book entitled-India and Communism, he even drafted table of contents for the book, which were as-\n\nPart-1. The Pre-requisites of Communism\n\nChapter-1-The Birthplace of Communism\n\nChapter-2-Communism and Democracy\n\nChapter-3-Communism and Social Order\n\nPart-II\u2014India and the Pre-requisites of Communism\n\nChapter-4-The Hindu Social Order\n\nChapter-5-The Basis of Hindu Social Order\n\nChapter-6\u2014The Impediments to Communism arising from the Social Order\n\nPart-III\u2014What Then Shall We Do?\n\nChapter-1- Marx and the European Social Order\n\nChapter-2- Manu and the Hindu Social Order\n\nDr. Ambedkar could complete only few parts of this planned book-Chapter 4&5 with sixty three typed pages. In the same fold of papers there was an outline for another book-Can I be a Hindu? And Symbols of Hinduism as part of it.\n\nThese papers are likely typed in early 1950.\n\nAnad Teltumbde has reproduced these incomplete writings of Dr. Ambedkar with his 70 pages introduction-\u2018Bridging the Unholy Rift\u2019. The Text of Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s own papers is of 75 pages, with 50 pages of two chapters from book and 25 pages of additional section-Symbols of Hinduism.\n\nThus the unknown papers of Dr. Ambedkar with Anand Teltumbde\u2019s introduction bring fresh and more rational understanding of Dr. Ambedkar thought.\n\nIn opening page of the book, there is a quotation from Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s1936 major writing-\u2018Annihilation of the Caste\u2019-\n\n\u2018If the Socialists wish to make Socialism a definite reality, then they must recognise that the problem of social reform is fundamental and that for them there is no escape from it\u2019\n\nReading this statement 81 years after it was first penned, makes one realise that how much complex Indian society is and how the need for social reform has become more acute that even in 1936 and the intervening period has shown that how socialists or communists have failed in this task and now they stand almost marginalised in society, which they were leading one time.\n\nAnand Teltumbde also begins his introduction with a quote from radical black American thinker Malcolm X-\u2018The only way we\u2019ll get freedom for ourselves is to identify ourselves with every oppressed people in the world\u2019 (Page 9). The very first formulation of Anand Teltumbde is that those who project Ambedkar as anti-communist or anti-Marxism are grossly prejudiced, though he agrees that Ambedkar had serious reservation in accepting certain theoretical postulations of Marxism.\n\nAnand Teltumbde very harshly underlines the fact that-The entire post-Ambedkar Dalit movement reflects the singular obsession to treat Marxists as the enemy. This has allowed the Dalit \u2018leaders\u2019 to remain ensconced in the ruling circles, enjoying perks and privileges, while still calling themselves \u2018Ambedkarites\u2019 (Page 11). He has even named certain groups from Republican Party of India (RPI). In later period, Anand notes in sadness that even Dalit Panthers, the radicals on the pattern of Black Panthers of US, split on same pattern of RPI. He further notes that how notable Dalit leaders like-Ram Vilas Paswan, Udit Raj and Ramdas Athavale have walked over to the most reactionary Brahamnical party-Bhartiya Janta Party(BJP), but would not touch Communists even with a bargepole! These opportunist leaders are ready to go with utterly anti-Ambedkar thought of BJP, but attack Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s own grandson Prakash Ambedkar, who favours common front with Socialists and Communists as \u2018anti-Ambedkar\u2019 and even \u2018a Maoist sympathiser\u2019!\n\nAnand Teltumbde describes Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s relationship with Marxism as \u2018enigmatic\u2019, he was never a Marxist, but described himself as \u2018Socialist\u2019!\n\nAnand Teltumbde is not sure whether Dr. Ambedkar read Karl Marx\u2019s 25th June 1853 essay-The British rule in India, first published in New York Daily, in which Marx characterizes the Indian Castes as \u2018the most decisive impediment to India\u2019s progress and power\u2019. But Ambedkar never rejected the notion that \u2018struggle against caste is integral with class struggle\u2019 (Page 19). Ambedkar was unhappy at the Communists conception of class as only \u2018economic\u2019 excluding socio-religious aspects of it. Anand Teltumabde also underlines that though Ambedkar did not accept Marxian concept of class, he himself was treated caste as class-\u2018A Caste is an Enclosed Class\u2019, as per Anand, Ambedkar conception of class was more like Max Weber than like of Marx. Ambedkar formed his first political party as Independent Labour Party (ILP) in August 1936, which is described by Christopher Jeffrelot as \u2018first leftist party in India\u2019, as Communist party was either underground or working under umbrella of Congress party. ILP along with CSP (Congress Socialist Party) organised huge march of 20000 peasants in 1938 and showed the way to merge \u2018caste and class\u2019 in practice. In 1938 itself ILP and AITUC (CPI affiliated-All India Trade Union Congress) joined in calling massive strike of one lakh workers against Trade Disputes act of 1929, against which Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt had thrown bombs in Central assembly in April 1929. According to Anand, Ambedkar was in his radical best form in 1930\u2019s. Ambedkar ended this phase by dissolving ILP in 1942 and forming All India Scheduled caste Federation (AISCF).\n\nAnand Teltumbde has observed in his introduction to the book that Ambedkar was not hostile towards communism until the 1930\u2019s. Only his experience with Bombay communists made him bitter about everything communist. Ambedkar had a soft corner for Soviet Union leader Stalin, being the son of a shoemaker. He observed even fast on the day Stalin died.\n\nAccording to Anand Teltumbde much of the differences between Dr. Ambedkar and Communist leaders of his time had been due to Communist perception of \u2018Base and Superstructure\u2019, in which economic plight of Dalits as class was linked to their liberation from economic yoke of exploitation and their \u2018caste discrimination\u2019 being part of \u2018super structural\u2019 nature, would end with the change in base of society. Communist party in its opportunism was treating many comrades from Dalit background as \u2018showpiece\u2019 of their concern for Dalits, such was the case of Jiban Dhupi of Anushilan revolutionary group background, who was released from jail after eleven years in 1946, was flaunted as \u2018Scheduled Caste Fighter against Social injustice\u2019 in CPI central organ. . In contrast, K N Jogelkar, a senior CPI leader was not debarred from remaining member of \u2018Brahmin Sabha\u2019 for many years.\n\nThough Ambedkar remained targeted by CPI for many years, at personal level, Ambedkar kept his friendship warm with R B More, who had joined CPI.\n\nAccording to Anand, on the issue of nationalism and anti-imperialist struggles, Ambedkar and CPI had different perception, while CPI thought Congress party to be anti-imperialist and nationalist and felt friendlier towards it and was critical of Ambedkar. For Ambedkar, interests of Dalits were primary, who got some relief from British regime in terms of getting education and some job opportunities. Ambedkar wanted to protect the interests of Dalits in post British India and did not trust Gandhi or Congress party for that.\n\nAlthough today in changed circumstances due to RSS inspired BJP coming to power, Indian constitution drafted by Dr. Ambedkar is being seen as a defence mechanism against RSS designs of turning India into Hindu Rashtra, Anad Teltumbade quotes Dr. Ambedkar himself to show that how much Dr. Ambedkar was himself frustrated from this constitution. Anand quotes Ambedkar-\u2018I was a hack, what I was asked to do, I did much against my will\u2026But I am quite prepared to say that I shall be the first person to burn it out. I don\u2019t want it. It does not suit anybody\u2019. (Page 68-quoted from Rajya Sabha, 2nd September 1953). It is very interesting to see that the constitution which is being idealised today, was a class constitution to protect the interests of ruling rich oligarchies and not to protect, working class or Dalits, Ambedkar was quite clear about it, but our today\u2019s leftists and Ambedkarites are both eulogising a constitution, which was rejected by Ambedkar himself, despite being its author!\n\nComing over to present incomplete project of Dr. Ambedkar, Anand Teltumbde opines that though Ambedkar thought communism was an emancipatory philosophy and has huge attraction for toiling masses, yet it did not have much to offer to Dalits in getting rid of oppressive social structure . In Anand Teltumbde\u2019s opinion the early doctrinaire approach of CPI alienated Ambedkar like thinkers from Marxism. He quotes Marx about such doctrinaire approach saying that \u2018if that was Marxism, he was not Marxist himself!\u2019\n\nUnder the present circumstances Anand Teltumbade opines that just caste identity politics will not lead Dalit liberation to anywhere, rather it would only splinter them further. He favours class and caste integration to enhance the path of revolution and hopes that publication of Ambedkar\u2019s incomplete writings \u2018inspire the Dalits and communists to complete the belated task to shape India\u2019s and world\u2019s future\u2019. (Page 78)\n\nOne can look at Ambedkar\u2019s two chapters and other writing to see whether Anand\u2019s hope for Dalit-left unity is possible?\n\nIn his chapter-The Hindu Social Order: Its Essential Principles, Ambedkar begins by focusing on two fundamentals for free social order-1. Individual is an end in himself and 2. Social order must be founded on principles of liberty, equality and fraternity-three principles of French revolution.\n\nDr. Ambedkar discusses in detail the meaning and implications of these principles and tests the Hindu Social Order, whether it follows these foundational principles of \u2018free social order\u2019 or not; and he finds Hindu Social Order miserably failing to follow these essential principles. In the discussion Dr. Ambedkar underlines the most divisive and discriminatory aspects of Hindu social order. He gives an example from Brahmin caste alone from Punjab of those days, where out of one crore and a half population of main Brahmin caste, had 1886 sub-castes of Brahmins alone!\n\nDr. Ambedkar makes it clear that first and fundamental principle of Hindu social order is \u2018graded inequality\u2019, he gives illustrations from \u2018Manu Smriti\u2019 to prove his point, which underlines seven kinds of slaves and The Hindu law recognises slavery as a \u2018legal institution\u2019! (Page 98) Dr. Ambedkar has given ample examples from Hindu codified laws about the cruelty in different laws like that on adultery etc. Dr. Ambedkar underlines \u2018fixity of occupations for each class and continuance thereof by heredity\u2019 as the second principle of Hindu social order. Third principle of Hindu social order is explained as \u2018fixation of people within their respective classes. Dr. Ambedkar notes further that Hindu social order has \u2018ban on free interchange and intercourse between different classes of Hindu society. There is a bar against inter-dining and inter-marriage.\u2019(Page 108).\n\nIn another chapter-The Hindu Social Order: Its Unique Features. Dr. Ambedkar notes three special features of Hindu social order, the most striking being-\u2018the worship of the superman\u2019! In Ambedkar\u2019s own words-\u2018The Hindu social order is nothing but Nietzsche\u2019s Gospel put in action\u2019!(Page 111) Ambedkar considers that The Brahmin is the Superman of Hindu social order, who is entitled to certain privileges as he could not be hanged, even though he might be guilty of murder as per Manu Smriti. Dr. Ambedkar further explains Hindu social order by saying that-\u2018the rise of common man is antagonistic to the supremacy of the Superman\u2026..Common man is in a state of perpetual degradation\u2026\u2019 (Page 119)\n\nDr. Ambedkar is very firm in his opinion that-\u2018The Hindus are the only people in the world whose social order-the relation of man to man is consecrated by religion and made sacred, eternal and inviolate.\u2019 He concludes this chapter with these words-\u2018No one can deny that the Hindu social order has become the habit of the Hindus and as such is in full force\u2019. (Page 130)\n\nIn another chapter-Symbols of Hinduism-Ambedkar goes back to 305 B.C., focusing on Greek king Seleukos ambassador Megasthenes view-the social organisation of the Hindus was of a very strange sort\u2019. Megasthenes observed Indian population to be divided into seven parts. From 305 B.C., Ambedkar moves to 1030 A.D. by referring to Alberuni\u2019s travel accounts of India, who observed four major castes or varnas of Hindus, Brahmins being the highest in ladder. Ambedkar further refers to Portuguese official Duarte Barbosa being in India during 1500-1571, who gives detailed analyses of Indian castes. Ambedkar notes the Denzil Ibbetson writing about castes in Punjab during British colonial time. Editor Anand Teltambde consider him as \u2018the most important intellectual bureaucrats of the Census of India\u2019 (Page 147). In fact Denzil Ibbetson book \u2018Punjab Castes\u2019 is still published by Government of Punjab with his full name and title as Sir Denzil Charles Jelf Ibbetson K.C.S.I. as master source for data of castes in Punjab.\n\nDr. Ambedkar sees caste and class interlinked in Indian social set up. Dr. Ambedkar challenges the notion of caste being outcome of \u2018Varna\u2019, rather he says that \u2018Caste is perversion of Verna\u2019. Dr. Ambedkar touches the question of \u2018Swarna\u2019 Hindus, means being part of four Varna system, which include-Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras and \u2018Avarna\u2019 Hindus, means who are out of Varna system, called \u2018Antyaj\u2019 also, meaning worse than even Shudras! Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s manuscript breaks with these words-\u2018The Avarna Hindus comprise three\u2026..\n\nNo one can doubt the scholarship of Dr. Ambedkar in study of Indian society in general and Hindu society in particular with emphasis on Caste structure of Hinduism, which is most oppressive for Dalits. Reformers like Mahatma Gandhi and others tried to reform Hindu social order by offering to appropriate Dalits inside Hindu order by offering them some dignity, but not equality, whereas Dr. Ambedkar finds no scope for equality for Dalits inside Hindu social order, so he opts out of Hindu social order itself by accepting Buddhist faith and calling upon fellow Dalits to do the same. While he was left with little time after adopting Buddhism, his followers did not carry forward his scheme of taking Dalits out of Hindu social order and creating a new liberty, equality and fraternity based social order, not even Mayawati led Bahujun Samaj Party did it, neither earlier various Republican Party factions did it and now finding all of them at the mercy of RSS-Hindutva based party BJP.\n\nAnand Teltumbde by his enlightened introduction to these papers of Dr. Ambedkar has tried to open a window again for leftists and Ambedkarites to enter into debate and find common ground for changing the sliding down of Indian society into the clutches of RSS-Hindutva Hindu Social Order, resisted so passionately by Dr. Ambedkar. Modi is the Superman of Hindu Social Order as explained by Dr. Ambedkar, with whom Dalits can have no truck. Under present circumstances, leftists forces are probably closest allies of Ambedkar\u2019s imagined social order based on liberty, equality and fraternity, but would the both sides accept this challenge? Rosa Luxemburg the best leftist/Communist theoretician of Germany had given a resounding call for defeat of fascism by explaining the situation as \u2018Socialism or Barbarism\u2019! India is in perhaps same conditions today where it has to choose-\u2018Socialism or Barbarism\u2019! Socialism could be of Ambedkar variety or Bhagat Singh/Che Guevara variety or any other variety as being tried in different Latin American countries at the moment, but Barbarism of Hindutva social order is not an option!\n\nHope that Anand Teltumbde, Prakash Ambedkar like Ambedkarite thinkers and various leftist groups and parties find a common ground, as students are trying in many places like \u2018Bhagat Singh-Ambedkar-Periyar-Phule\u2019 groups as in IIT Chennai to lead the country out of morass of Hindutva fascist forces, which are quite strong at the moment, being in power at state level as well as in society with vigilante groups like-\u2018Gau Rakshaks\u2019 and many more like Sriram Sena, or Hindu Jagran Vedike, which are killing rationalists like Dabholkar-Pansare-Kalburgi-Gauri or Akhlaques-Junaids etc. by falsification of history and whipping up blind religious passions like Hitler and Mussolini whipped up in Germany and Italy of 1930\u2019s and whose price was paid by the whole world, not just these two countries. Same are the conditions today of the world with Trump and Modi in power in two powerful countries with huge populations!\n\nHope Indian and US people will learn some lessons from history and will not allow it to be repeated again, which will be much more destructive than the World War-II, caused by Hitler and Mussolini. Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s unfinished book can be guide to learn these lessons.\n\nChaman Lal is retired Professor from JNU, New Delhi and author of \u2018Understanding Bhagat Singh\u2019 and few books on Dalit Literature"}]}
