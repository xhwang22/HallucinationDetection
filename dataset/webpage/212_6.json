{"Jean Hugo illustrated books by Charles Baudelaire.": [{"url": "https://journals.openedition.org/interfaces/663", "page_content": "1 For further information on Baudelaire and illustration as they relate to image-text inquiry, pleas (...) 1A single text illustrated by several artists presents a unique opportunity for verbal-visual inquiry. Such is the case for \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau,\u201d \u201cThe Fountain,\u201d composed shortly before 1853 and included in the third edition of Charles Baudelaire\u2019s iconic Fleurs du mal. The very visual nature of this poem has attracted an array of book artists. As each illustrator has transposed the text into images that represent a unique \u201creading\u201d of it, our understanding of the verbal entity has been, in one way or another, affected by the graphic gesture. The traditional function of illustration as shedding light onto the word, or of actually extending its meaning to transcend habitual mimetic practices, has evolved with the advent of Modernity as modes of representation have often espoused fresh contours. Indeed, the time frame of the illustrators considered here spans eight decades, from 1916 to 1985, and thus coincides with the 20th-century\u2019s break from customary modes of illustrating text, in general, and of picturing poetry, in particular, as both literary and artistic interpretation have shifted from representation to abstraction.\n\n2\u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau\u201d is fundamentally a descriptive text. Rich in its poetic contours, lush in its languid dialectics, it lends itself readily to re-inscription via graphic modes. The action is restrained, the timbre is subtle, the atmosphere is sensual, and the mood is quietly erotic. The poet describes the essential configurations of his lover in her \u201cpose nonchalente\u201d while, in an adjacent courtyard, a fountain plays into the night. The poem\u2019s form, three stanzas separated by three refrains, and its subject immediately bring to mind Baudelaire\u2019s prodigious \u201cInvitation au Voyage.\u201d In both, the female is the object of the poet\u2019s gaze; she remains pictorially passive while he is verbally aggressive. The result of this \u201caggression\u201d is, of course, the poem.\n\n3The narrator\u2019s object of desire is introduced to the reader by her \u201cbeaux yeux,\u201d her \u201cbeautiful eyes.\u201d With no little insistence, he entreats her to keep them closed in order to perpetuate the dream-like state that has been induced by \u201cle plaisir,\u201d or \u201cpleasure,\u201d presumably the result of their love making. Closed eyes, insists the narrator, will serve as a way of retaining nocturnal modes of dream while refusing diurnal lapses back into reality. The poet likens this preferred state to the fountain which possesses the ability to retain ecstasy:\n\nLe jet d\u2019eau qui jase\n\nEt qui ne se tait ni nuit ni jour,\n\nEntretient doucement l\u2019extase\n\nO\u00f9 ce soir m\u2019a plong\u00e9 l\u2019amour.\n\n4The poet even assigns a language to the fountain as the verb \u201cjaser,\u201d or gossip, is employed to indicate what emanates incessantly from the water\u2019s spray in order to assure retention of the text\u2019s ecstatic aura. Throughout the poem, the five senses are evoked in a series of images that constantly conjure up a melancholic symphony whose tonalities are echoed in the sobbing sonorities -- \u201csangloter\u201d is the poet\u2019s verb choice -- of the playing fountain. Melancholy is, after all, the principle tenant of Baudelairian spleen. Thus, the unity of the poem is derived from the association of sensual pleasures with falling water, the latter echoing the former into an infinity, which encapsulates the pristine representation of the poem\u2019s \u201cmiroir de mon amour,\u201d \u201cthe mirror of my love.\u201d\n\nFig. 1: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Maggie Monier, pseud. for Madeleine Mounier, Paris: Librairie Nilsson, Collection Lotus, 1926.

Published in 1926, this watercolor, printed on tracing paper, sums up the mildly erotic content of the text. The horizontality of female figure is juxtaposed with the verticality of the fountain. Sumptuous interior and exterior scapes are separated only by a large, black curtain and a line of cushions, on which her body reposes. This theatricality conjures up an opulent stage set, which responds to the textual reverie and evokes an orientalist exoticism in all of its lavish splendor. Appropriately, the female\u2019s eyes are closed. The universe she inhabits is that proscribed by the narrator. However, Monier\u2019s image remains essentially static. Other than a slight tilt of the head in the direction of the fountain, this Art Deco odalisque remains fundamentally decorative. As such, she \u201cdecorates\u201d the text but does little more than please the eye of the beholder. In sum, this is representational illustration in the most traditional sense of the term. There is no attempt on the part of the artist to extend the meaning of the text onto the graphic plane or to transcend mimesis.\n\nFig 2: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by \u00c9mile Bernard, Paris: Ambrose Vollard, \u00e9diteur; l\u2019Imprimerie Nationale, 1916.

However, Bernard presents a darker version of the same scene in which sensual tonalities suddenly become overtly sexual. In this more daring rendition, we see into the very soul of the reposing female figure who responds graphically to Baudelaire\u2019s textual indications:\n\nAinsi ton \u00e2me qu\u2019incendie\n\nL\u2019\u00e9clair br\u00fblant des volupt\u00e9s\n\nS\u2019\u00e9lance rapide et hardie.\n\nFig. 3: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by \u00c9mile Bernard, Paris: Ambrose Vollard, editeur; l\u2019Imprimerie Nationale, 1916. (Second illustration.) Agrandir Original (jpeg, 23k)\n\n7More symbolically-charged in its appeal is Bernard\u2019s second illustration, an in-text image for \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau\u201d (fig. 3). Here, within a very small frame, the artist has limited his graphic gesture to an almost minimalist image. The two essential elements \u2013 the woman and the fountain \u2013 reign supreme in this illustration. Again, the eyes of the beloved are closed, but as a suggestion of her dream-like state, she appears to be floating slightly above the horizon line of the image. To accentuate the link between woman and water, the reader-viewer is obliged to gaze through the fountain to see her. Cleverly, Bernard has superimposed the two in order to demonstrate the inextricable link that binds them together in Baudelaire\u2019s text. Left to the viewer\u2019s imagination is the rest of the decor in this image. What interests the artist is the relationship between the poem\u2019s major players as they are synthesized into a single entity of desire, his sole focus. In this way, Bernard\u2019s imagery extrapolates upon the text and provides a way of approaching it with added insight.\n\nFig. 4: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Jacob Epstein, London : The Fanfare Press, 1940. Agrandir Original (jpeg, 26k)\n\n4 Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Jacob Epstein, London : The Fanfare Press, (...) 8If Bernard\u2019s two illustration for \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau\u201d proposed a transition from the sensual to the sexual, the image created by Jacob Epstein in 1940 rapidly evolves into explicit eroticism (fig. 4). With the addition of the narrator to the graphic plane, the woman-fountain duo assimilates into a trio. At the base of the fountain, the two lovers, facing one another, are pictured rising from the fountain\u2019s bowl. Then suddenly, their bodies are projected into the air by the force of the gushing water, presented here in two distinct arcs that effectively echo the duality of the lovers. Now, having been thrown aloft in their larger forms, one is poised directly above the other in a sort of symphonic suspension. With their closed eyes, both take part in the poem\u2019s dreamscape, which has seamlessly shifted from exotic to ecstatic. In sum, the poet\u2019s indication has been faithfully interpreted by the artist\u2019s rendering, which responds to the narrator\u2019s notion of prolonging the ecstasy: \u201cEntretient doucement l\u2019extase.\u201d Epstein extrapolates upon the text, pushing it beyond its borders to provide the reader-viewer with what just might be the narrator\u2019s ultimate aspiration.\n\nFig. 5: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by \u00c9douard Goerg, Paris, Marcel Sautier, 1952. (First two of three- page spread.) Agrandir Original (jpeg, 34k)\n\n5 Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by \u00c9douard Goerg, Paris, Marcel Sautier, 1952 9Not all illustrators add to a given text. Pausing for a moment to consider an example of such a case can help us understand that illumination of textual essence is not necessarily achieved by all artists. A case in point is \u00c9douard Goerg\u2019s 1944 lithographic illustration for \u201cLe Jeu d\u2019eau\u201d (fig. 5). In the first two-page spread of the three-page ensemble, the female figure is portrayed in a vertical position. At the uppermost part of the image, we can just make out the top of the fountain, which resembles a few palm fronds emanating from her head. This doubling up of both woman and fountain on the vertical plane, along with the wide-open eyes of the woman, does little to enhance either the dreamscape or the text. Unlike the classically draped female in Monier\u2019s illustration or the nude figures in the other images treated until now, Goerg\u2019s woman, dressed as she is in a provocative gown, suggests vulgarity. The female in Baudelaire\u2019s text may indeed be sensual, sexual or even erotic, but vulgarity has no place in his elegy of her beauty. Facing the woman on the opposite margin is Goerg\u2019s second rendition of the fountain. Like the first, it lacks grace. In truth, both the woman and the fountain are rather clumsy graphic rendering, ill-suited to portray the grace and refinement expressed so eloquently in the text.\n\nFig. 6: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by \u00c9douard Goerg, Paris, Marcel Sautier, 1952. Third illustration of three-page spread.) Agrandir Original (jpeg, 26k)\n\n10With the turning of the page, we have a second illustration of the female entity, now appearing \u2013 for no reason at all -- almost virginal in relation to her first portrayal (fig. 6). How this represents the text in any way, shape or form is unfathomable. Goerg\u2019s illustration seems almost at odds with Baudelaire\u2019s poem. Instead of shedding light upon the text, this image frankly detracts from it, demonstrating that an illustration does not always add force to or even sustain a verbal-visual ensemble.\n\nFig. 7: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Roger Bezombes, Paris: Les Bibliophiles de l\u2019Est, 1985. Agrandir Original (jpeg, 22k)\n\n6 Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Roger Bezombes, Paris: Les Bibliophiles de (...) 11Goerg singled out the fountain on the second page of his three-page spread. Roger Bezombes, in his 1985 collage illustration for \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau,\u201d choses to focus entirely upon it (fig. 7). The accordion-format of the book opens to a three-page spread. At its center, with text flanking it on both sides, a single bouquet dominates the visual plane. From the dour blacks of Goerg\u2019s graphism, Bezombe\u2019s colorific configuration explodes onto the page against a bright orange backdrop. A few petals are featured here, but the bouquet is principally composed of antique doll heads whose glass eyes stare out, lending a quazi-Surrealistic tone to the image. A pair of cat heads join in the collage to accentuate the feline qualities associated with the feminine idol. But clearly, female and fountain are combined in what is literally a grebe de fleurs, rather than the anticipated grebe d\u2019eau from the poem\u2019s refrain. In doing so, the artist skillfully insinuates that Les Fleurs du mal, are at the forefront of the author\u2019s intensions.\n\n12A closer look at the illustration may help clarify this idea. At first, nothing here seems to address the melancholic tone of the text. And yet, upon further inspection, the stem of the flower appears to be that of a thistle. Furthermore, the doll heads, intermingled as they are with thorns, are set against a black background. Is this the artist\u2019s subtle indication that the ecstatic interlude, so aptly captured in the text, cannot be maintained (\u201centretenir\u201d is Baudelaire\u2019s verb choice) past the poetic universe in which it is situated? Is this also a reminder that all flowers eventually wither and die? And, finally, is this why \u201cLa grebe \u00e9panouie / En mille fleurs\u201d of the refrain eventually falls into the base of the fountain in \u201clarges pleurs\u201d or large tears? Bezombes choses to picture a single element from Baudelaire\u2019s text, but his articulation of it proposes a glass through which the entire poetic gesture comes into focus. In doing so, the artist moves beyond mimesis. He brings to the text a visual scape that \u201creads\u201d it in new ways and thus offers far more than rote reproduction of textual information. Rather than resigning itself to a secondary role of sedentary slavery to the poem, Bezombes\u2019 pictorial frame extends the textual meaning and allows the reader to muse about the infinite possibilities of the verbal-visual intersections presented here.\n\n13Bezombes is the only illustrator of \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau\u201d to extend his artistic influence directly back onto the Baudelairian text. The refrain\u2019s \u201cmille fleurs\u201d is printed in red, and its \u201ccouleurs\u201d appears in blue. Such typographical adjustments are rare. In Bezombes case, however, they serve as a textual prefiguration of the graphic gesture. After all, his focus is entirely devoted to the floral entity and his treatment of it is fervently set on the use of color to distinguish his rendition of the bouquet. In sum, the introduction of color onto the typographical plane is yet another way in which the artist moves beyond the traditional boundaries of illustration.\n\nFig. 8: Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Andr\u00e9 Domin, Paris: Editions Ren\u00e9 Kieffer, 1920. Agrandir Original (jpeg, 18k)\n\n7 Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, illustrations by Andr\u00e9 Domin, Paris: Editions Ren\u00e9 Kieffer, (...) 14The final artist for our consideration is Andr\u00e9 Domin whose pochoir illustration for \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau\u201d appeared in 1926 (fig. 8). This inquiry opened with Maggie Monier\u2019s image which was clearly rooted in the Art Deco aesthetic. Such is the case with Domin\u2019s. However, as we shall see, the two artists differ vastly in their ways of portraying the poem. Whereas Monier was set on transcribing all of the textual information into a single frame, in which description was the sole goal, Domin seeks to capture the contours of the poem\u2019s essence rather than its precise elements. In this way, his interpretation more skillfully articulates the Symbolist tonalities of Baudelaire\u2019s text than Monier\u2019s replication of the poem\u2019s specifics. Rather than simply imaging the text, Domin imagines it.\n\n15An azurine backdrop reminiscent of A Thousand and One Nights serves as Domin\u2019s setting. A stylized fountain gracefully emerges from the center bottom, ascends to the center top, then descends back to its base. Pochoired in gold, the fountain is the epitome of elegance as it reigns at the center of the image. Importantly, we do not see the base of the fountain, nor do we see the top. Both extend past the upper and lower frames of the image. In doing so, the fountain inhabits a space larger than the illustration per se, just as it does in the text by virtue of its repeated refrains. The female body appears as a vision to the right. Again, with neither of her feet attached to the ground, she appears to float in the air much in the same way that the water spray gently rises and descends. The two share the poem\u2019s fluidity; both inhabit the same dreamscape.\n\n16In this illustration, the female presence is felt through a series of simple strokes outlining her form. They are more easily visible in the initial version of the poem prior to the addition of the pochoir coloring. With eyes closed and her head turned down toward the fountain\u2019s source, suggestion rather than precision is achieved. As with Matisse\u2019s cut-outs, the viewer is given the opportunity to imagine the precise elements of her beauty. Once the color is added to the illustration, it takes on a whole other dimension in which the nocturnal eclipses the diurnal and the oneiric triumphs. The contours of the demure stance of the female presence suffice for us to fill in the blanks as we share the narrator\u2019s space in which suggestion allows the imagination to flourish in much the same way that the poem\u2019s \u201cgrebe\u201d springs forth from the refrain into a floral entity. It is interesting to note that what made \u201cLe Jet d\u2019eau\u201d so popular was not its appearance in the third edition of Les Fleurs du mal, but rather its transcription into tonal poems by Debussy and a host of other composers. More than in any other graphic illustration of the poem, Domin\u2019s azur dreamatorium, highlighted in gold, seems to possess a subtle musicality in its eloquent and refined harmonies that accentuate Baudelaire\u2019s poetic intentionality. In doing so, the text is transposed onto a whole new plane of \u201cluxe, calme et volupt\u00e9, where suggestion and even abstraction extend its meaning beyond mere representation.\n\n17In conclusion, these six artists have each created a sort of graphic \u201c\u00e9criture\u201d whose goal has been to present, in one way or another, a visual snapshot of Baudelaire\u2019s poem. As we have seen, their creations define a vast array of ways in which texts can be pictured, from the purely representational or figurative to the insinuated and the abstract. If the function of book illustration has routinely been to retell, recast or replicate information provided by the author, artists such as Bernard, Epstein and Domin seek, in a Modernist mode, to extend the textual plane into the graphic frame, bringing new interpretive perspectives to the written word. These novel terrains of the illustrative function remind us of the potential riches of verbal-visual inquiry as it relates to the illustrated book. They also bring to mind the often profound and always intriguing implications of picturing ideas. In sum, this discussion of how twentieth-century artists have represented this nineteenth-century text once again re-frames and re-figures the intrinsic value of illustration as interpretation."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-hugo", "page_content": "The great-grandson of Victor Hugo, Jean Hugo was a French painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author.

He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/about/fellows/fellowships/2013-baudelaire-milewski.php", "page_content": "Illustrated Editions of Les Fleurs du Mal (1857) by Charles Baudelaire\n\nExhibition: Les Fleurs du Mal, An Illustrated History\n\nFellowship: Project Proposal \"My favorite part of the project, other than working in the Bandy Center, was designing the website.

He was twice named a junior fellow at the Library of Congress, where he worked on the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection of book illustration.\n\nKevin presented his project at the international conference \"Cultural Modernism II: Latin America\" at Vanderbilt University; at the Center for Teaching's 2014 \"Celebration of Learning;\" and at the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Pre-conference of the American Library Association in Las Vegas, NV.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-62592-8_83-1", "page_content": "Section 12 on women and courtesans begins with how many different types of women, in differing social situations, M.G. has portrayed, including the courtesan, and the actress as a creature \u201cof show.\u201d In this \u201cextensive gallery of London and Paris life,\u201d he says, there are many types of unattached women, and he goes through a list (428\u2013233). There are women of \u201cthe highest social circles\u201d (428); there are actresses from the \u201csuburban theaters,\u201d women seen at a caf\u00e9 door; contemplating the crowd; women in the amusement halls; women who show \u201cthe varied image of the shadier type of beauty\u201d which \u201ceither displays an alluring and barbaric form of elegance of her own invention, or she apes, more or less successfully, the simplicity current in higher circles\u201d (430). Women are identified here, throughout, with art, not with nature, and all, including the highest circles, are theatrical: but this is, of course, a compliment in Baudelaire; \u201cShe has a kind of beauty, which comes to her from sin (\u201cMal\u201d); always lacing spirituality, but at times tinged with fatigue masquerading as melancholy\u201d (430). Baudelaire shows that he has been talking about the courtesan, a category which T.J. Clark says was a created category, constructed by the bourgeoisie, who could not represent prostitution to themselves (Clark 1984: 109). Baudelaire speaks of \u201cthe woman in revolt at every level\u201d; women of the town; women \u201cconfined in hovels, often enough decorated like caf\u00e9s,\u201d with \u201cnothing they can call their own, not even the eccentric adornments that act as condiment to their beauty\u201d (431). But they include the woman \u201cin whom an innocent yet monstrous sort of fatuity is only too apparent,\u201d women who \u201ccarry in their faces and in their eyes, which look you brazenly in the face, the evident joy of being alive\u201d (431). The type appears in Manet\u2019s \u201cOlympia\u201d (1865), analyzed by Clark (79\u2013146), where the perhaps high-class prostitute looks back at the presumably male gaze. This is part of an analysis where the woman\u2019s eyes are said to be cast toward the horizon (430), which Benjamin discusses in the Arcades Project: saying that Guys is fascinated by backgrounds (compare Baudelaire 1972: 409). But \u201cbecause these pictures \u2026 are to be viewed from close up, the magic of distance is cancelled for the viewer without his having to renounce the judgment of distance\u201d (Benjamin 1999: J47,4). There is, in other words, nothing of the \u201caura\u201d in the presentation of the woman, no sense of a beauty which is ideal or traditionally \u201cartistic.\u201d\n\nBaudelaire continues the list of different types of women, concluding with the consumptive and \u201cgruesome nymphs and living dolls\u201d (432). But beauty takes no part in morality, and to find that true is to state a point about modernity: it is the opposite to what Plato believed. The types have all been portrayed by M.G. and illustrate \u201cthe beauty peculiar to evil, the beautiful in the horrible\u201d (432). To associate beauty with evil of course takes it outside traditional Platonism where it points to the ideal and immaterial world. It makes beauty something other than what looking at masterpieces would suggest; it makes it a challenge to find, and to accept, perhaps; it makes its origins material, of the city; and contestatory, not part of what may be easily accepted and recognized because it is on display. It is apparent here that beauty, which emerges in situations where it would not be expected to be found, is dual, as he has said at the beginning, both real and ideal and at the same time contesting that ideality, because if it did not \u201cthe first element would be indigestible, tasteless, unadapted, and inappropriate to human nature. I challenge anyone to find any sample whatsoever of beauty that does not contain these two elements\u201d (392). It may be said that beauty as dual, and confronting and challenging expectations, is an insight inseparable from city-existence. It is, then, not that there are two types of beauty, the eternal and the fleeting, so much as that beauty comprises both, and that makes it so difficult to locate, but that the urban allows the possibility for looking for it.\n\nThe essay winds to a close with a last section on \u201cCarriages,\u201d as seen in any park in big cities, where coaches and carriages, containing women, derive, from the fact of motion, \u201ca mysterious and complex gracefulness which is very difficult to note down\u201d (434). With urban civilization, art is bound toward representation of the fleeting. Every detail M.G. presents of coachwork \u201cis correct, every detail is in its right place, and does not need to be gone over again. In whatever position it is drawn, at whatever speed it may be going, a carriage, like a vessel, derives, from the fact of motion, a mysterious and complex gracefulness which is very difficult to note down in shorthand. The pleasure that the artist\u2019s eye gets from it comes apparently from the series of geometrical figures that the object \u2026 describes successively in space\u201d (434\u2013435). Paul de Man (1983: 160\u2013161) discusses this passage to think of the shorthand, and the way that movement can only be rendered in geometrical forms as containing Baudelaire\u2019s acceptance that writing cannot record the present, that modernity must rest content with allegory, being unable to capture the present as it is (another rejection of realism, of course). Beauty, then, can never be realized fully, nor modernity be captured, but it remains the project for art, and literature, confronted with the city."}, {"url": "https://library.brown.edu/cds/baudelaire/translations1.html", "page_content": "Translations: Baudelaire, Translator of Edgar Allan Poe\n\nHistoires extraordinaires | Le Corbeau\n\nManuscrit trouv\u00e9 dans une bouteille | La Chute de la maison Usher\n\n\n\nBaudelaire published extensive translations of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s works from 1852 until 1865. These translations reflect the affinity he felt for Poe as a poet and writer. Baudelaire admired the visionary quality of Poe\u2019s text and related to him on many levels . Both lived in poverty, suffered from addictions and depression. Both were under appreciated by the literary establishment of their times. Both embraced mysticism, the fantastic, the macabre and the grotesque in their writings. Finally, both were searching for answers to philosophical questions in their aesthetic and literary pursuits. It is also worth noting that Baudelaire\u2019s translations and critical notes provided some form of income to the poet who was constantly facing a difficult financial situation.\n\nWith the exception of four poems, Baudelaire\u2019s translations focused on Poe\u2019s short fiction. Baudelaire chose the tale \u201cMesmeric Revelation,\u201d published in the Wiley & Putnam edition of 1845,as his first translation of Poe. It appeared in 1848 in La Libert\u00e9 de penser, a philosophical and literary periodical that was published during the Second Republic. There was a hiatus of three years in Baudelaire\u2019s publication of translations during which he devoted time to reading and studying Poe\u2019s fiction, poetry and philosophy. Between 1848 and 1855 Baudelaire published some translations of Poe in newspapers such as Le Pays. Translations of complete works started appearing in 1856 with the publication of Histoires extraordinaires, followed by Nouvelles histoires extraordinaires in 1857, Aventures d\u2019Arthur Gordon Pym in 1858, Eureka in 1863, and Histoires grotesques et s\u00e9rieuses in 1865. Baudelaire\u2019s translations were published by Michel L\u00e9vy who bought the rights for several of the texts. Through his translations, commentary and criticism, Baudelaire contributed to the favorable reception Poe generally received in Europe and to the high esteem in which European symbolist and surrealist poets held Poe.\n\n\n\nPoe, Edgar Allan, 1809-1849\n\nHistoires extraordinaires / par Edgar Poe ;\n\ntraduction de Charles Baudelaire.\n\nParis : Michel L\u00e9vy fr\u00e8res, libraires \u00e9diteurs, 1856.\n\nJohn Hay Library Harris Collection\n\nof American Poetry and Plays\n\nThis first edition bound in quarter morocco over marbled boards is rare.

After five days of floating on the remains of the ship and avoiding a threatening whirlpool, the narrator observes a nearby vessel, whose presence creates waves strong enough to throw him onboard. While exploring the captain\u2019s cabin, he discovers some paper upon which he records the present manuscript, places it in a bottle and resolves to later toss it in the ocean. Shortly after he learns that the ship is heading directly for the South Pole, a giant sheet of ice cracks and exposes a whirlpool that devours the ship and its passengers, including the narrator. The story itself is a reproduction of the found manuscript. Regarded as one of Poe\u2019s best pieces of science fiction, \u201cManuscript Found in a Bottle\u201d received the award for best short story upon its original publication in a Baltimore newspaper. The success encouraged Poe to publish a collection of stories in 1840 under the name Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.\n\nPierre Falk\u00e9 (1884-1947) is a French artist who is well-known for his humoristic drawings in newspapers and magazines.

Physically and emotionally ill, Usher calls upon his friend to come to his decaying, gloomy and mysterious estate in the hopes that his company will cure his melancholy. Shortly after his arrival, Usher\u2019s twin sister, Madeline, also physically ill, dies of an unidentifiable disease. One night, while reading out loud, the narrator hears noises that Usher claims are coming from the tomb of his sister, whom he believes has been buried alive. Madeline then appears, cloaked in bloody white robes, and attacks Usher, who dies of fear. The narrator flees the enchanted house, which quickly crumbles to the ground. This story was originally published in Burton\u2019s Gentleman\u2019s Magazine in 1839, and later reprinted in a collection of stories in 1840 and 1845.\n\nThis edition of Edgar Poe\u2019s Tales contains three original drawings by Carlo Farneti (1892-1961).

Once upon a time in France, in classic frenemy-style (\"friend\" + \"enemy\"), Charles Baudelaire dedicated three poems in Les Fleurs du Mal to Victor Hugo AND THEN called him both \"stupid\" and \"an idiot.\" The Guardian's on the case!\n\nIn a January 1860 letter to an unknown correspondent, Baudelaire bemoans how Hugo \"keeps on sending me stupid letters\", adding that Hugo's continuing missives have inspired him \"to write an essay showing that, by a fatal law, a genius is always an idiot\". The letter is being auctioned by Christie's in New York, alongside a first edition of Baudelaire's celebrated poetry collection Les Fleurs du Mal, containing the six poems that were deleted from the second edition. The set is expected to fetch up to $100,000 (\u00a360,000), according to the auction house.\n\nPublication of the first edition of Les Fleurs du Mal in 1857 was followed by Baudelaire's prosecution for \"offending public morals\", with the judge ordering his publisher to remove six poems from the collection. Hugo supported Baudelaire after the prosecution in August 1857, telling him that \"your Fleurs du mal shine and dazzle like stars\", and, in 1859, that \"you give us a new kind of shudder\".\n\nBaudelaire had, in his turn, dedicated three poems in Les Fleurs du Mal to Hugo, but the Pulitzer prize-winning poet CK Williams has written of how despite this, \"Baudelaire secretly despised Hugo\". Rosemary Lloyd, meanwhile, writes of the \"corrosive envy\" of Hugo revealed by Baudelaire in his letters, in her Cambridge Companion to Baudelaire.The author, while praising Les Mis\u00e9rables in public in an 1862 review in Le Boulevard, described it as \"immonde et inepte\" \u2013 vile and inept \u2013 in a letter to his mother, adding, \"I have shown, on this subject, that I possessed the art of lying\".

Flowers of Evil was published in 1857 by Baudelaire's friend Auguste Poulet Malassis, who had inherited a printing business at Alen\u00e7on. Some of them had already appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes. The poet, the publisher, and the printer were found guilty of having offended against public morals.]\n\n[Pg 9]\n\nIn presenting to the American public this collection in English of perhaps the most influential French poet of the last seventy years, I consider it essential to explain the conditions under which the work has been done.\n\nBaudelaire has written poems that will, in all likelihood, live while poetry is used as a medium of expression, and the great influence that he has exercised on English and continental literature is mainly due to the particular quality of his style, his way of feeling or his method of thought. He is a master of analytical power, and in his highest ecstasy of emotional expression, this power can readily be recognized. In his own quotation he gave forth his philosophy on this point:\n\n\"The more art would aim at being philosophically clear, the more will it degrade itself and return to the childish hieroglyphic: on the other hand, the more art detaches itself from teaching, the more will it attain to pure disinterested beauty.... Poetry, under pain of death or decay, cannot assimilate Herself to science or ethics. She has not Truth for object, she has only Herself.\" What appears at first glance in the preceding phrases to be a contradiction is really a confirmation of Baudelaire's conception of the highest understanding of \u00e6sthetic principle. Baudelaire's ideal beauty is tempered with mystery and sadness, the real too, but never the commonplace.\n\nNo poet has brought so many new ideas in sensation into a literary style. Intellectually he is all sensation, though he seldom degenerates into abstract sentimentality. This sum totality of the power of absorbing external sensation is Baudelaire. From the effect of his[Pg 10] objectivity his art expresses itself as if solely subjective. This condition of mind and art makes him most difficult to translate into another language, in particular, English.\n\nThis collection of his verse and prose is gathered from those experiments in translation which I think will most effectively convey to the English reader those qualities that made Baudelaire what he is. There are numerous translations from Baudelaire in English but most of them may be dismissed as being seldom successful. Mr. Arthur Symons' translation of some of the prose poems is a most beautiful adventure in psychological sensations, effective though not always accurate in interpretation. Mr. F. P. Sturm's effort with the Flowers of Evil and the Prose Poems is always accurate, sometimes inspired, and often a tour de force of translation. Mr. W. J. Robertson's translations from the Flowers of Evil is the most successful of all. He maintains with amazing facility all the subtlety, beauty and one might also say the perfume of Baudelaire's verse. Mr. Shipley does a most meritorious work in his translations from the prose poems, and the reader will be everlastingly grateful to him for his fine painstaking translation of the Intimate Papers from Baudelaire's unpublished novels.\n\nThere are few interesting or valuable essays on the mind and art of Baudelaire in English, but the reader will find the following critical appreciations to be of inestimable use in the study of the poet:\n\n\"The Influence of Baudelaire\": G. Turquet-Milnes (Constable: 1913); \"The Baudelaire Legend\": James Huneker (Egoists: Scribner's: 1909); and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's essay on Baudelaire, of which an excellent English translation has been made by Prof. Sumichrast.\n\nI think that this anthology will give the reader an intelligent understanding of the mind and art of a very great French poet.\n\nT. R. SMITH.\n\nJune, 1919.\n\n[Pg 11]\n\nA STUDY BY F. P. STURM.\n\nI\n\nCharles Baudelaire was one of those who take the downward path which leads to salvation. There are men born to be the martyrs of the world and of their own time; men whose imagination carries them beyond all that we know or have learned to think of as law and order; who are so intoxicated with a vision of a beauty beyond the world that the world's beauty seems to them but a little paint above the face of the dead; who love God with a so consuming fire that they must praise evil for God's glory, and blaspheme His name that all sects and creeds may be melted away; who see beneath all there is of mortal loveliness, the invisible worm, feeding upon hopes and desires no less than upon the fair and perishable flesh; who are good and evil at the same time; and because the good and evil in their souls finds a so perfect instrument in the refined and tortured body of modern times, desire keener pleasure and more intolerable anguish than the world contains, and become materialists because the tortured heart cries out in denial of the soul that tortures it. Charles Baudelaire was one of these men; his art is the expression of his decadence; a study of his art is the understanding of that complex movement, that \"inquietude of the Veil in the temple,\" as Mallarm\u00e9 called it, that has changed the literature of the world; and, especially, made of poetry the subtle[Pg 12] and delicate instrument of emotional expression it has become in our own day.\n\nWe used to hear a deal about Decadence in the arts, and now we hear as much about Symbolism, which is a flower sprung from the old corruption\u2014but Baudelaire is decadence; his art is not a mere literary affectation, a mask of sorrow to be thrown aside when the curtain falls, but the voice of an imagination plunged into the contemplation of all the perverse and fallen loveliness of the world; that finds beauty most beautiful at the moment of its passing away, and regrets its perishing with a so poignant grief that it must needs follow it even into the narrow grave where those \"dark comrades the worms, without ears, without eyes,\" whisper their secrets of terror and tell of yet another pang\u2014\n\n\"Pour ce vieux corps sans \u00e2me et mort parmi les morts.\"\n\n\n\nAll his life Baudelaire was a victim to an unutterable weariness, that terrible malady of the soul born out of old times to prey upon civilisations that have reached their zenith\u2014weariness, not of life, but of living, of continuing to labour and suffer in a world that has exhausted all its emotions and has no new thing to offer. Being an artist, therefore, he took his revenge upon life by a glorification of all the sorrowful things that it is life's continual desire to forget. His poems speak sweetly of decay and death, and whisper their graveyard secrets into the ears of beauty. His men are men whom the moon has touched with her own phantasy: who love the immense ungovernable sea, the unformed and multitudinous waters; the place where they are not; the woman they will never know; and all his women are enigmatic courtesans whose beauty is a transfiguration of sin; who hide the ugliness of the soul beneath the perfection of the[Pg 13] body. He loves them and does not love; they are cruel and indolent and full of strange perversions; they are perfumed with exotic perfumes; they sleep to the sound of viols, or fan themselves languidly in the shadow, and only he sees that it is the shadow of death.\n\nAn art like this, rooted in a so tortured perception of the beauty and ugliness of a world where the spirit is mingled indistinguishably with the flesh, almost inevitably concerns itself with material things, with all the subtle raptures the soul feels, not by abstract contemplation, for that would mean content, but through the gateway of the senses; the lust of the flesh, the delight of the eye. Sound, colour, odour, form: to him these are not the symbols that lead the soul towards the infinite: they are the soul; they are the infinite. He writes, always with a weary and laborious grace, about the abstruser and more enigmatic things of the flesh, colours and odours particularly; but, unlike those later writers who have been called realists, he apprehends, to borrow a phrase from Pater, \"all those finer conditions wherein material things rise to that subtlety of operation which constitutes them spiritual, where only the finer nerve and the keener touch can follow.\"\n\nIn one of his sonnets he says:\n\n\"Je hais la passion et l'esprit me fait mal!\"\n\n\n\nand, indeed, he is a poet in whom the spirit, as modern thought understands the word, had little or no part. We feel, reading his terrible poems, that the body is indeed acutely conscious of the soul, distressfully and even angrily conscious, but its motions are not yet subdued by the soul's prophetic voice. It was to forget this voice, with its eternal Esto memor, that Baudelaire wrote imperishabl\u00ff of perishable things and their fading glory.\n\n[Pg 14]\n\nII\n\nCharles Baudelaire was born at Paris, April 21st, 1821, in an old turreted house in the Rue Hautefeuille. His father, a distinguished gentleman of the eighteenth-century school, seems to have passed his old-world manners on to his son, for we learn from Baudelaire's friend and biographer, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, that the poet \"always preserved the forms of an extreme urbanity.\"\n\nAt school, during his childhood, he gained many distinctions, and passed for a kind of infant prodigy; but later on, when he sat for his examination as bachelier \u00e8s lettres, his extreme nervousness made him appear almost an idiot. Failing miserably, he made no second attempt. Then his father died, and his mother married General Aupick, afterwards ambassador to Constantinople, an excellent man in every respect, but quite incapable of sympathising with or even of understanding the love for literature that now began to manifest itself in the mind of his stepson. All possible means were tried to turn him from literature to some more lucrative and more respectable profession. Family quarrels arose over this all-important question, and young Baudelaire, who seems to have given some real cause for offence to the step-father whose aspirations and profession he despised, was at length sent away upon a long voyage, in the hopes that the sight of strange lands and new faces would perhaps cause him to forget the ambitions his relatives could but consider as foolish and idealistic. He sailed the Indian Seas; visited the islands of Mauritius, Bourbon, Madagascar, and Ceylon; saw the yellow waters of the sacred Ganges; stored up the memory of tropical sounds and colours and odours for use later on; and returned to[Pg 15] Paris shortly after his twenty-first birthday, more than ever determined to be a man of letters.\n\nHis parents were in despair; no doubt quite rightly so from their point of view. Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, perhaps remembering the many disappointments and martyrdoms of his own sad life, defends the attitude of General Aupick in a passage where he poignantly describes the hopelessness of the profession of letters. The future author of The Flowers of Evil, however, was now his own master and in a position, so far as monetary matters were concerned, to follow out his own whim. He took apartments in the H\u00f4tel Pimodan, a kind of literary lodging-house where all Bohemia met; and where Gautier and Boissard were also at that period installed. Then began that life of uninterrupted labour and meditation that has given to France her most characteristic literature, for these poems of Baudelaire's are not only original in themselves but have been the cause of originality in others; they are the root of modern French literature and much of the best English literature; they were the origin of that new method in poetry that gave Mallarm\u00e9 and Verlaine to France; Yeats and some others to England. It was in the H\u00f4tel Pimodan that Baudelaire and Gautier first met and formed one of those unfading friendships not so rare among men of letters as among men of the world; there also the \"Hashish-Eaters\" held the s\u00e9ances that have since become famous in the history of literature. Hashish and opium, indeed, contribute not a little to the odour of the strange Flowers of Evil; as also, perhaps, they contributed to Baudelaire's death from the terrible malady known as general paralysis, for he was a man who could not resist a so easy path into the world of macabre visions. I shall return to this question again; there is internal evidence in his writings that shows he made good literary use of these opiate-born[Pg 16] dreams which in the end dragged him into their own abyss.\n\nIt was in 1849, when Baudelaire was twenty-eight years of age, that he made the acquaintance of the already famous Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, from whose admirable essay I shall presently translate a passage giving us an excellent pen-sketch of the famous poet and cynic\u2014for Baudelaire was a cynic: he had not in the least degree the rapt expression and vague personality usually supposed to be characteristic of the poetic mood. \"He recalls,\" wrote M. Dulamon, who knew him well, \"one of those beautiful Abb\u00e9s of the eighteenth century, so correct in their doctrine, so indulgent in their commerce with life\u2014the Abb\u00e9 de Bernis, for example. At the same time, he writes better verse, and would not have demanded at Rome the destruction of the Order of Jesuits.\"\n\nThat was Baudelaire exactly, suave and polished, filled with sceptical faith, cynical with the terrible cynicism of the scholar who is acutely conscious of all the morbid and gloomy secrets hidden beneath the fair exteriors of the world. Gautier, in the passage I have already mentioned, emphasises both his reserve and his cynicism: \"Contrary to the somewhat loose manners of artists generally, Baudelaire prided himself upon observing the most rigid convenances; his courtesy, indeed, was excessive to the point of seeming affected. He measured his sentences, using only the most carefully chosen terms, and pronounced certain words in a particular manner, as though he wished to underline them and give them a mysterious importance. He had italics and capital letters in his voice. Exaggeration, much in honour at Pimodan's, he disdained as being theatrical and gross; though he himself affected paradox and excess. With a very simple, very natural, and perfectly detached air, as[Pg 17] though retailing, \u00e0 la Prudhomme, a newspaper paragraph about the mildness or rigour of the weather, he would advance some satanically monstrous axiom, or uphold with the coolness of ice some theory of a mathematical extravagance; for he always followed a rigorous plan in the development of his follies. His spirit was neither in words nor traits; he saw things from a particular point of view, so that their outlines were changed, as objects when one gets a bird's-eye view of them; he perceived analogies inappreciable to others, and you were struck by their fantastic logic. His rare gestures were slow and sober; he never threw his arms about, for he held southern gesticulation in horror; British coolness seemed to him to be good taste. One might describe him as a dandy who had strayed into Bohemia; though still preserving his rank, and that cult of self which characterises a man imbued with the principles of Brummel.\" At this time Baudelaire was practically unknown outside his own circle of friends, writers themselves; and it was not until eight years later, in 1857, when he published his Flowers of Evil, that he became famous. Infamous would perhaps be a better word to describe the kind of fame he at first obtained, for every Philistine in France joined in the cry against a poet who dared to remind his readers that the grave awaits even the rich; who dared to choose the materials of his art from among the objects of death and decay; who exposed the mouldering secrecies of the grave, and painted, in the phosphorescent colours of corruption, frescoes of death and horror; who desecrated love in the sonnet entitled \"Causerie\":\n\n\"You are a sky of autumn, pale and rose!\n\nBut all the sea of sadness in my blood\n\nSurges, and ebbing, leaves my lip morose\n\n[Pg 18]Salt with the memory of the bitter flood.\n\n\n\nIn vain your hand glides my faint bosom o'er;\n\nThat which you seek, beloved, is desecrate\n\nBy woman's tooth and talon: ah! no more\n\nSeek in me for a heart which those dogs ate!\n\n\n\nIt is a ruin where the jackals rest,\n\nAnd rend and tear and glut themselves and slay!\n\n\u2014A perfume swims about your naked breast,\n\nBeauty, hard scourge of spirits, have your way!\n\nWith flame-like eyes that at bright feasts have flared\n\nBurn up these tatters that the beasts have spared!\"\n\n\n\nWe can recall nothing like it in the literary history of our own country; the sensation caused by the appearance of the first series of Mr. Swinburne's Poems and Ballads was mild in comparison; just as Mr. Swinburne's poems were but wan derivatives from Baudelaire\u2014at least as far as ideas are concerned; I say nothing about their beauty of expression or almost absolute mastery of technique\u2014for it is quite obvious that the English poet was indebted to Baudelaire for all the bizarre and Satanic elements in his work; as Baudelaire was indebted to Poe. Mr. Swinburne, however, is wild where Baudelaire is grave; and where Baudelaire compresses some perverse and morbid image into a single unforgettable line, Mr. Swinburne beats it into a froth of many musical lovely words, until we forget the deep sea in the shining foam.\n\nIf we call to mind the reception at first given to the black-and-white work of Aubrey Beardsley, it will give some idea of the consternation caused in France by the appearance of the Flowers of Evil. Beardsley, indeed, resembles Baudelaire in many ways, for he achieved in art what the other achieved in literature: the apotheosis of the horrible and grotesque, the perfecting of symbols to shadow forth intellectual sin, the tearing away of the decent veil of forgetfulness that hides our own corruption from our eyes, and his one prose romance, Under the Hill, unhappily incomplete at his death at the age of[Pg 19] twenty-four, beats Baudelaire on his own ground. The four or five chapters which alone remain of this incomplete romance stand alone in literature. They are the absolute attainment of what Baudelaire more or less successfully attempted\u2014a testament of sin. Not the sin of the flesh, the gross faults of the body that are vulgarly known as sin; but sin which is a metaphysical corruption, a depravity of pure intellect, the sin of the fallen angels in hell who cover their anguish with the sound of harps and sweet odours; who are incapable of bodily impurity, and for whom spiritual purity is the only terror. And since mortality, which is the shadow of the immortal, can comprehend spiritual and abstract things only by the analogies and correspondences which exist between them and the far reflections of them that we call reality, both Baudelaire and Beardsley, as indeed all artists who speak with tongues of spiritual truth, choose more or less actual human beings to be the shadows of the divine or satanic beings they would invoke, and make them sin delicate sins of the refined bodily sense that we may get a far-off glimpse of the Evil that is not mortal but immortal, the Spiritual Evil that has set up its black throne beside the throne of Spiritual Good, and has equal share in the shaping of the world and man.\n\nI am not sure that Baudelaire, when he wrote this sinister poetry, had any clear idea that it was his vocation to be a prophet either of good or evil. Certainly he had no thought of founding a school of poetry, and if he made any conscious effort to bring a new method into literature, it was merely because he desired to be one of the famous writers of his country. An inspired thinker, however, whether his inspiration be mighty or small, receives his thought from a profounder source than his own physical reason, and writes to the dictation of beings outside of and greater than himself. The famous Eliphas[Pg 20] Levi, like all the mystics who came before and after him, from Basilides the Gnostic to Blake the English visionary, taught that the poet and dreamer are the mediums of the Divine Word, and sole instruments through which the gods energise in the world of material things. The writing of a great book is the casting of a pebble into the pool of human thought; it gives rise to ever-widening circles that will reach we know not whither, and begins a chain of circumstances that may end in the destruction of kingdoms and religions and the awakening of new gods. The change wrought, directly or indirectly, by The Flowers of Evil alone is almost too great to be properly understood. There is perhaps not a man in Europe to-day whose outlook on life would not have been different had The Flowers of Evil never been written. The first thing that happens after the publication of such a book is the theft of its ideas and the imitation of its style by the lesser writers who labour for the multitude, and so its teaching goes from book to book, from the greater to the lesser, as the divine hierarchies emanate from Divinity, until ideas that were once paradoxical, or even blasphemous and unholy, have become mere newspaper commonplaces adopted by the numberless thousands who do not think for themselves, and the world's thought is changed completely, though by infinite slow degrees. The immediate result of Baudelaire's work was the Decadent School in French literature. Then the influence spread across the Channel, and the English \u00c6sthetes arose to preach the gospel of imagination to the unimaginative. Both Decadence and \u00c6stheticism, as intellectual movements, have fallen into the nadir of oblivion, and the dust lies heavy upon them, but they left a little leaven to lighten the heavy inertness of correct and academic literature; and now Symbolism, a greater movement than either, is in the ascendant,[Pg 21] giving another turn to the wheel, and to all who think deeply about such matters it seems as though Symbolist literature is to be the literature of the future. The Decadents and \u00c6sthetes were weak because they had no banner to fight beneath, no authority to appeal to in defence of their views, no definite gospel to preach. They were by turns morbid, hysterical, foolishly blasphemous, or weakly disgusting, but never anything for long, their one desire being to produce a thrill at any cost. If the hospital failed they went to the brothel, and when even obscenity failed to stimulate the jaded palates of their generation there was still the graveyard left. A more or less successful imitation of Baudelaire's awful verses entitled \"The Corpse\" has been the beginning of more than one French poet's corrupt flight across the sky of literature. That Baudelaire himself was one of their company is not an accusation, for he had genius, which his imitators, English or French, have not; and his book, even apart from the fact that it made straight the way for better things, must be admitted to be a great and subtly-wrought work of art by whosoever reads it with understanding. And, moreover, his morbidness is not at all an affectation; his poems inevitably prove the writer to have been quite sincere in his perversion and in his decadence.\n\nThe Symbolist writers of to-day, though they are sprung from him, are greater than he because they are the prophets of a faith who believe in what they preach. They find their defence in the writings of the mystics, and their doctrines are at the root of every religion. They were held by the Gnostics and are in the books of the Kabbalists and the Magi. Blake preached them and Eliphas Levi taught them to his disciples in France, who in turn have misunderstood and perverted them, and formed strange religions and sects of Devil-worshippers.[Pg 22] These doctrines hold that the visible world is the world of illusion, not of reality. Colour and sound and perfume and all material and sensible things are but the symbols and far-off reflections of the things that are alone real. Reality is hidden away from us by the five senses and the gates of death; and Reason, the blind and laborious servant of the physical brain, deludes us into believing that we can know anything of truth through the medium of the senses. It is through the imagination alone that man can obtain spiritual revelation, for imagination is the one window in the prison-house of the flesh through which the soul can see the proud images of eternity. And Blake, who is the authority of all English Symbolist writers, long since formulated their creed in words that have been quoted again and again, and must still be quoted by all who write in defence of modern art:\u2014\"The world of imagination is the world of Eternity. It is the divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death of the vegetated body. This world of imagination is infinite and eternal, whereat the world of generation, or vegetation, is finite and temporal. There exist in that eternal world the permanent realities of everything which we see reflected in this vegetable glass of nature!\"\n\nIn spite of the cry against Flowers of Evil, Baudelaire did not lack defenders among literary men themselves; and many enthusiastic articles were written in praise of his book. Thierry not unjustly compared him to Dante, to which Barbey d'Aurevilly replied, \"Baudelaire comes from hell, Dante only went there\"; adding at the finish of his article: \"After the Flowers of Evil there are only two possible ways for the poet who made them blossom: either to blow out his brains or become a Christian.\" Baudelaire did neither. And Victor Hugo, after reading the two poems, \"The Seven Old Men\" and \"The Little[Pg 23] Old Women,\" wrote to Baudelaire. \"You have dowered the heaven of art with one knows not what deathly gleam,\" he said in his letter; \"you have created a new shudder.\" The phrase became famous, and for many years after this the creation of a new shudder was the ambition of every young French writer worth his salt.\n\nWhen the first great wave of public astonishment had broken and ebbed, Baudelaire's work began to be appreciated by others than merely literary men, by all in fact who cared for careful art and subtle thinking, and before long he was admitted to be the greatest after Hugo who had written French verse. He was famous and he was unhappy. Neither glory, nor love, nor friendship\u2014and he knew them all\u2014could minister to the disease of that fierce mind, seeking it knew not what and never finding it; seeking it, unhappily, in the strangest excesses. He took opium to quieten his nerves when they trembled, for something to do when they did not, and made immoderate use of hashish to produce visions and heighten his phantasy. His life was a haunted weariness. Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater seems to have fascinated him to a great extent, for besides imitating the vices of the author, he wrote, in imitation of his book, The Artificial Paradises, a monograph on the effects of opium and hashish, partly original, partly a mere translation from the Confessions.\n\nHe remembered his visions and sensations as an eater of drugs and made literary use of them. At the end of this book, among the \"Poems in Prose,\" will be found one entitled \"The Double Chamber,\" almost certainly written under the influence of opium, and the last verse of \"The Temptation\"\u2014\n\n\"O mystic metamorphosis!\n\nMy senses into one sense flow\u2014\n\nHer voice makes perfume when she speaks,\n\nHer breath is music faint and low!\"\n\n\n\n[Pg 24]\n\nas well as the last six lines of that profound sonnet \"Correspondences\"\u2014\n\n\"Some perfumes are as fragrant as a child,\n\nSweet as the sound of hautboys, meadow-green;\n\nOthers, corrupted, rich, exultant, wild,\n\nHave all the expansion of things infinite:\n\nAs amber, incense, musk, and benzoin,\n\nWhich sing the sense's and the soul's delight,\"\n\n\n\nare certainly memories of a sensation he experienced under the influence of hashish, as recorded in The Artificial Paradises, where he has this curious passage:\u2014\"The senses become extraordinarily acute and fine. The eyes pierce Infinity. The ear seizes the most unseizable sounds in the midst of the shrillest noises. Hallucinations commence.... External objects take on monstrous appearances and show themselves under forms hitherto unknown.... The most singular equivocations, the most inexplicable transposition of ideas, take place. Sounds are perceived to have a colour, and colour becomes musical.\" Baudelaire need not have gone to hashish to discover this. The mystics of all times have taught that sounds in gross matter produce colour in subtle matter; and all who are subject to any visionary condition know that when in trance colours will produce words of a language whose meaning is forgotten as soon as one awakes to normal life; but I do not think Baudelaire was a visionary. His work shows too precise a method, and a too ordered appreciation of the artificial in beauty. There again he is comparable to Aubrey Beardsley, for I have read somewhere that when Beardsley was asked if ever he saw visions, he replied, \"I do not permit myself to see them, except upon paper.\" The whole question of the colour of sound is one of supreme interest to the poet, but it is too difficult and abstract a question to be written of here. A famous sonnet by Rimbaud on the colour[Pg 25] of the vowels has founded a school of symbolists in France. I will content myself with quoting that\u2014in the original, since it loses too much, by translation:\n\n\"A noir, E blanc, I rouge, U vert, O bleu, voyelles,\n\nJe dirai quelque jour vos naissances latentes,\n\nA, noir corset velu des mouches \u00e9clatantes\n\nQui bourdonnent autour des puanteurs cruelles,\n\n\n\nGolfes d'ombres; E, candeurs des vapeurs et des tentes,\n\nLances des glaciers fiers, rois blancs, frissons d'ombrelles;\n\nI, pourpres, sang crach\u00e9, rire des l\u00e8vres belles\n\nDans la col\u00e8re ou les ivresses p\u00e9nitentes;\n\n\n\nU, cycles, vibrements divins des mers virides,\n\nPaix des p\u00e2tis sem\u00e9s d'animaux, paix des rides\n\nQue l'alchimie imprime aux grands fronts studieux.\n\n\n\nO, supr\u00eame clairon, plein de strideurs \u00e9tranges,\n\nSilences travers\u00e9s des mondes et des anges.\n\n\u2014O l'Om\u00e9ga, rayon violet de ses yeux.\"\n\n\n\nIt is to be hoped that opium and hashish rendered Baudelaire somewhat less unhappy during his life, for they certainly contributed to hasten his death. Always of an extremely neurotic temperament, he began to break down beneath his excesses, and shortly after the publication of The Artificial Paradises, which shows a considerable deterioration in his style, he removed from Paris to Brussels in the hope of building up his health by the change. At Brussels he grew worse. His speech began to fail; he was unable to pronounce certain words and stumbled over others. Hallucinations commenced, no longer the hallucinations of hashish; and his disease, rapidly establishing itself, was recognised as \"general paralysis of the insane.\" Gautier tells how the news of his death came to Paris while he yet lived. It was false news, but prematurely true. Baudelaire lingered on for another three months; motionless and inert, his eyes the only part of him alive; unable to speak or even to write, and so died.\n\nHe left, besides The Flowers of Evil and Little Poems[Pg 26] in Prose (his masterpieces), several volumes of critical essays, published under the titles of \u00c6sthetic Curiosities and Romantic Art; The Artificial Paradises, and his translations of the works of Edgar Allan Poe\u2014admirable pieces of work by which Poe actually gains.\n\nIII\n\nBaudelaire's love of the artificial has been insisted upon by all who have studied his work, but to my mind never sufficiently insisted upon, for it was the foundation of his method. He wrote many arguments in favour of the artificial, and elaborated them into a kind of paradoxical philosophy of art. His hatred of nature and purely natural things was but a perverted form of the religious ecstasy that made the old monk pull his cowl about his eyes when he left his cell in the month of May, lest he should see the blossoming trees, and his mind be turned towards the beautiful delusions of the world. The Egyptians and the earliest of the Christians looked upon nature not as the work of the good and benevolent spirit who is the father of our souls, but as the work of the rebellious \"gods of generation,\" who fashion beautiful things to capture the heart of man and bind his Soul to earth. Blake, whom I have already quoted, hated nature in the same fashion, and held death to be the one way of escape from \"the delusions of goddess Nature and her laws.\" Baudelaire's revolt against external things was more a revolt of the intellect than of the imagination; and he expresses it, not by desiring that the things of nature should be swept away to make room for the things of the spirit, but that they should be so changed by art that they cease to be natural. As he was of all poets the most intensely modern, holding that \"modernity is one-half of art,\" the other half being something \"eternal and immutable,\" he preferred, unlike Blake and[Pg 27] his modern followers, to express himself in quite modern terms, and so wrote his famous and much misunderstood \u00c9loge du Maquillage to defend his views. As was usual with him, he pushed his ideas to their extreme logical sequence, and the casual reader who picks up that extraordinary essay is in consequence quite misled as to the writer's intention.\n\nIt seems scarcely necessary at this time of day to assert that the \u00c9loge du Maquillage is something more than a mere Praise of Cosmetics, written by a man who wished to shock his readers. It is the part expression of a theory of art, and if it is paradoxical and far-fetched it is because Baudelaire wrote at a time when French literature, in the words of M. Asselineau, \"was dying of correctness,\" and needed very vigorous treatment indeed. If the \u00c9loge du Maquillage had been more restrained in manner, if it had not been something so entirely contrary to all accepted ideas of the well-regulated citizen who never thinks a thought that somebody else has not put into his head, it might have been passed over without notice. It was written to initiate the profane; to make them think, at least; and not to raise a smile among the initiated. And moreover, it was in a manner a defence of his own work that had met with so much hatred and opposition.\n\nHe begins by attempting to prove that Nature is innately and fundamentally wrong and wicked. \"The greater number of errors relative to the beautiful date from the eighteenth century's false conceptions of morality. Nature was regarded in those times as the base, source, and type of all possible good and beauty.... If, however, we consent to refer simply to the visible facts,... we see that Nature teaches nothing, or almost nothing. That is to say, she forces man to sleep, to drink, to eat, and to protect himself, well or ill, against[Pg 28] the hostilities of the atmosphere. It is she also who moves him to kill and eat or imprison and torture his kind; for, as soon as we leave the region of necessities and needs to enter into that of luxuries and pleasures, we see that Nature is no better than a counsellor to crime.... Religion commands us to nourish our poor and infirm parents; Nature (the voice of our own interest) commands us to do away with them. Pass in review, analyse all that is natural, all the actions and desires of the natural man, and you will find nothing but what is horrible. All beautiful and noble things are the result of calculation. Crime, the taste for which the human animal absorbs before birth, is originally natural. Virtue, on the contrary, is artificial, supernatural, since there has been a necessity in all ages and among all nations for gods and prophets to preach virtue to humanity; since man alone would have been unable to discover it. Evil is done without effort, naturally and by fatality; good is always the product of an art.\"\n\nSo far the argument is straightforward and expresses what many must have thought, but Baudelaire, remembering that exaggeration is the best way of impressing one's ideas upon the unimaginative, immediately carries his argument from the moral order to the order of the beautiful, and applies it there. The result is strange enough. \"I am thus led to regard personal adornment as one of the signs of the primitive nobility of the human soul. The races that our confused and perverted civilisation, with a fatuity and pride entirely laughable, treats as savages, understand as does the child the high spirituality of the toilet. The savage and the child, by their na\u00efve love of all brilliant things, of glittering plumage and shining stuffs, and the superlative majesty of artificial forms, bear witness to their distaste for reality,[Pg 29] and so prove, unknown to themselves, the immateriality of their souls.\"\n\nThus, with some appearance of logic, he carries his argument a step farther, and this immediately brings him to the bizarre conclusion that the more beautiful a woman naturally is, the more she should hide her natural beauty beneath the artificial charm of rouge and powder. \"She performs a duty in attempting to appear magical and supernatural. She is an idol who must adorn herself to be adored.\" Powder and rouge and kohl, all the little artifices that shock respectability, have for their end \"the creation of an abstract unity in the grain and colour of the skin.\" This unity brings the human being nearer to the condition of a statue\u2014that is to say, \"a divine and superior being.\" Red and black are the symbols of \"an excessive and supernatural life.\" A touch of kohl \"lends to the eye a more decided appearance of a window opened upon infinity\"; and rouge augments the brilliance of the eye, \"and adds to a beautiful feminine face the mysterious passion of the priestess.\" But artifice cannot make ugliness any the less ugly, nor help age to rival youth. \"Who dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?\" Deception, if it is to have any charm, must be obvious and unashamed; it must be displayed \"if not with affectation, at least with a kind of candour.\"\n\nSuch theories as these, if they are sincerely held, necessarily lead the theorist into the strangest bypaths of literature. Baudelaire, like many another writer whose business is with verse, pondered so long upon the musical and rhythmical value of words that at times words became meaningless to him. He thought his own language too simple to express the complexities of poetic reverie, and dreamed of writing his poems in Latin. Not, however, in the Latin of classical times; that was too robust,[Pg 30] too natural, too \"brutal and purely epidermic,\" to use an expression of his own; but in the corrupt Latin of the Byzantine decadence, which he considered as \"the supreme sigh of a strong being already transformed and prepared for the spiritual life.\"\n\nOne of these Latin poems has appeared in all editions of The Flowers of Evil. Though dozens as good are to be found in the Breviary of the Roman Church, \"Francisc\u00e6 Me\u00e6 Laudes\" has been included in this selection for the benefit of those curious in such matters. It is one of Baudelaire's many successful steps in the wrong direction.\n\nIV\n\nIn almost every line of The Flowers of Evil one can trace the influence of Edgar Poe, and in the many places where Baudelaire has attained a pure imaginative beauty as in \"The Sadness of the Moon\" or \"Music\" or \"The Death of Lovers,\" it is a beauty that would have pleased the author of Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. Another kind of beauty, the beauty of death\u2014for in Baudelaire's crucible everything is melted into loveliness\u2014is even more directly traceable to Poe. In spite of the sonnet \"Correspondences,\" and in spite of his Symbolist followers of the present day, Baudelaire himself made but an imperfect use of such symbols as he had; and these he found ready to his hand in the works of the American poet. The Tomb, the symbol of death or of an intellectual darkness inhabited by the Worm, who is remorse; the Abyss, which is the despair into which the mortal part of man's mind plunges when brought into contact with dead and perishing substances; all these are borrowed from Poe. The Worm, who \"devours with a kiss,\" occasionally becomes Time devouring life, or the Demon, \"the obscure Enemy who gnaws the heart\"; and[Pg 31] when it is none of these it is the Serpent, as in that sombre poem \"To a Madonna\"\u2014the Serpent beneath the feet of conquering purity. Baudelaire's imagination, however, which continually ran upon macabre images, loved remorse more than peace, and loved the Serpent more than the purity that would slay it, so he destroys purity with \"Seven Knives\" which are \"the Seven Deadly Sins,\" that the Serpent may live to prey upon a heart that finds no beauty in peace. Even Love is evil, for his \"ancient arrows\" are \"crime, horror, folly,\" and the god Eros becomes a demon lying in wait:\n\n\"Let us love gently. Love, from his retreat\n\nAmbushed and shadowy, bends his fatal bow,\n\nAnd I too well his ancient arrows know:\n\nCrime, Horror, Folly....\"\n\n\n\nGautier pretends that the poet preserved his ideal under the form of \"the adorable phantom of La Beatrix, the ideal ever desired, never attained, the divine and superior beauty incarnated in an ethereal woman, spiritualised, made of light and flame and perfume, a vapour, a dream, a reflection of the seraphical world\"; but when Baudelaire has a vision of this same Beatrice he sees her as one of a crowd of \"cruel and curious demons\" who mock at his sorrow, and she, too, mocks him, and caresses the demons who are his spiritual foes.\n\nBaudelaire was too deeply in love with the artificial to care overmuch for the symbols he could have found among natural objects. Only once in The Flowers of Evil does he look upon the Moon with the eyes of a mystic; and that is when he remembers that all people of imagination are under the Moon's influence, and makes his poet hide her iridescent tear in his heart, \"far from the eyes of the Sun,\" for the Sun is lord of material labours and therefore hostile to the dreams and reveries[Pg 32] that are the activity of the poet. He sought more for bizarre analogies and striking metaphors than for true symbols or correspondences. He is happiest when comparing the vault of the heaven to \"the lighted ceiling of a music hall,\" or \"the black lid of the mighty pot where the human generations boil\"; and when he thinks of the unfortunate and unhappy folk of the world, he does not see any hope for them in any future state; he sees, simply, \"God's awful claw\" stretched out to tear them. He offers pity, but no comfort.\n\nSometimes he has a vision of a beauty unmingled with any malevolence; but it is always evoked by sensuous and material things; perfume or music; and always it is a sorrowful loveliness he mourns or praises. Perhaps of all his poems \"The Balcony\" is most full of that tender and reverential melancholy we look for in a poem of love; but even it tells of a passion that has faded out of heart and mind and become beautiful only with its passing away, and not of an existing love. The other love poems\u2014if indeed such a name can be given to \"A Madrigal of Sorrow,\" \"The Eyes of Beauty,\" \"The Remorse of the Dead,\" and the like\u2014are nothing but terrible confessions of satiety, or cruelty, or terror. I have translated \"The Corpse,\" his most famous and most infamous poem, partly because it shows him at his worst as the others in the volume at his best, partly because it is something of the nature of a literary curiosity. A poem like \"The Corpse,\" which is simply an example of what may happen if any writer pushes his theories to the extreme, does not at all detract, be it said, from Baudelaire's delicate genius; for though he may not be quite worthy of a place by Dante, he has written poems that Dante might have been proud to write, and he is worthy to be set among the very greatest of the moderns, alongside Hugo and Verlaine. Read the sonnet entitled[Pg 33] \"Beauty\" and you will see how he has invoked in fourteen lines the image of a goddess, mysterious and immortal; as fair as that Aphrodite who cast the shadow of her loveliness upon the Golden Age; as terrible as Pallas, \"the warrior maid invincible.\" And as Minerva loved mortality in the person of Ulysses, so Baudelaire's personification of Beauty loves the poets who pray before her and gaze into her eternal eyes, watching the rising and setting of their visionary Star in those placid mirrors.\n\nThe explanation of most of Baudelaire's morbid imaginings is this, that he was a man haunted by terrible dream-like memories; chief among them the memory that the loveliness he had adored in woman\u2014the curve of a perfect cheek, the lifting of a perfect arm in some gesture of imperial indolence, the fall of a curl across, a pale brow, all the minute and unforgettable things that give immortality to some movement of existence\u2014all these, and the woman and her lover, must pass away from Time and Space; and he, unhappily, knew nothing of the philosophy that teaches us how all objects and events, even the most trivial\u2014a woman's gesture, a rose, a sigh, a fading flame, the sound that trembles on a lute-string\u2014find a place in Eternity when they pass from the recognition of our senses. If he believed in the deathlessness of man's personality he gained no comfort from his belief. He mourned the body's decay; he was not concerned with the soul; and no heaven less palpable than Mohammed's could have had any reality in his imagination.\n\nHis prose is as distinguished in its manner as his verse. I think it was Professor Saintsbury who first brought The Little Poems in Prose, a selection from which is included in this volume, before the notice of English readers in an essay written many years ago. I am writing this in France, far from the possibility of[Pg 34] consulting any English books, but if my memory serves me rightly he considered the prose of these prose poems to be as perfect as literature can be. I think he said, \"they go as far as prose can go.\" They need no other introduction than themselves, for they are perfect of their kind, and not different in thought from the more elaborately wrought poems of The Flowers of Evil. Some of them, as for instance \"Every Man His Chim\u00e6ra,\" are as classical and as universally true as the myths and symbolisms of the Old Testament; and all of them, I think, are worthy of a place in that book the Archangel of the Presence will consult when all is weighed in the balance \u2014the book written by man himself, the record of his deep and shallow imaginings. Baudelaire wrote them, he said, because he had dreamed, \"in his days of ambition,\" \"of a miracle of poetical prose, musical without rhythm and without rhyme.\" His attitude of mind was always so natural to him that he never thought it necessary to make any excuse for the spirit of his art or the drear philosophy he preached; unless a short notice printed in the first edition of his poems, but withdrawn from the second edition, explaining that \"faithful to his dolorous programme, the author of The Flowers of Evil, as a perfect comedian, has had to mould his spirit to all sophisms as to all corruptions,\" can be considered as an excuse. From whatever point of view we regard him: whether we praise his art and blame his philosophy, or blame his art and praise his philosophy, he is as difficult to analyse as he is difficult to give a place to, for we have none with whom to compare him, or very few, too few to be of service to the critic. His art is like the pearl, a beautiful product of disease, and to blame it is like blaming the pearl.\n\nHe looked upon life very much as Poe, whom he so admired, looked upon it: with the eye of a sensitive[Pg 35] spectator in some gloomy vault of the Spanish Inquisition, where beauty was upon the rack; he was horrified, but unable to turn from a sight that fascinated him by its very terror. His moments of inspiration are haunted by the consciousness that evil beings, clothed with horror as with a shroud, are ever lingering about the temple of life and awaiting an opportunity to enter. He was like a man who awakens trembling from a nightmare, afraid of the darkness, and unable to believe the dawn may be less hopeless than the midnight. Perhaps he was haunted, as many artists and all mystics, by a fear of madness and of the unseen world of evil shapes that sanity hides from us and madness reveals. Is there a man, is there a writer, especially, who has not at times been conscious of a vague and terrible fear that the whole world of visible nature is but a comfortable illusion that may fade away in a moment and leave him face to face with the horror that has visited him in dreams? The old occult writers held that the evil thoughts of others beget phantoms in the air that can make themselves, bodies out of our fear, and haunt even our waking moments. These were the shapes of terror that haunted Baudelaire. Shelley, too, writes of them with as profound a knowledge as the magical writer of the Middle Ages. They come to haunt his Prometheus.\n\n\"Blackening the birth of day with countless wings,\n\nAnd hollow underneath, like death.\"\n\n\n\nThey are the elemental beings who dwell beside the soul of the dreamer and the poet, \"like a vain loud multitude\"; turning life into death and all beautiful thoughts into poems like The Flowers of Evil, or into tales like the satanic reveries of Edgar Poe.\n\n\"We are the ministers of pain, and fear,\n\nAnd disappointment, and mistrust, and hate,\n\n[Pg 36]And clinging crime; and as lean dogs pursue\n\nThrough wood and lake some struck and sobbing fawn,\n\nWe track all things that weep, and bleed, and live,\n\nWhen the great King betrays them to our will.\"\n\n\n\nAnd every man gives them of the substance of his imagination to clothe them in prophetic shapes that are the images of his destiny:\n\n\"From our victim's destined agony\n\nThe shade which is our form invests us round,\n\nElse we are shapeless as our mother Night.\"\n\n\n\nThe greatest of all poets conquer their dreams; others, who are great, but not of the greatest, are conquered by them, and Baudelaire was one of these. There is a passage in the works of Edgar Poe that Baudelaire may well have pondered as he laboured at his translation, for it reveals the secret of his life: \"There are moments when, even to the sober eye of reason, the world of our sad humanity may assume the semblance of a hell; but the imagination of man is no Carathis to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful; but, like the demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep or they will devour us\u2014they must be suffered to slumber or we perish.\"\n\n[Pg 37]\n\nTranslated by Arthur Symons\n\n[Pg 38]\n\nNOTE\n\nThe \"Petits Po\u00ebmes en Prose\" are experiments, and they are also confessions. \"Who of us,\" says Baudelaire in his dedicatory preface, \"has not dreamed, in moments of ambition, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm and without rhyme, subtle and staccato enough to follow the lyric motions of the soul, the wavering outlines of meditation, the sudden starts of the conscience?\" This miracle he has achieved in these bagatelles laborieuses, to use his own words, these astonishing trifles, in which the art is not more novel, precise and perfect than the quality of thought and of emotion. In translating into English a few of these little masterpieces, which have given me so much delight for so many years, I have tried to be absolutely faithful to the sense, the words, and the rhythm of the original. A. S.\n\n[Pg 39]\n\nI\n\nTHE FAVOURS OF THE MOON\n\nThe Moon, who is caprice itself, looked in through the window when you lay asleep in your cradle, and said inwardly: \"This is a child after my own soul.\"\n\nAnd she came softly down the staircase of the clouds, and passed noiselessly through the window-pane. Then she laid herself upon you with, the supple tenderness of a mother, and she left her colours upon your face. That is why your eyes are green and your cheeks extraordinarily pale. It was when you looked at her, that your pupils widened so strangely; and she clasped her arms so tenderly about your throat that ever since you have had the longing for tears.\n\nNevertheless, in the flood of her joy, the Moon filled the room like a phosphoric atmosphere, like a luminous poison; and all this living light thought and said: \"My kiss shall be upon you for ever. You shall be beautiful as I am beautiful. You shall love that which I love and that by which I am loved: water and clouds, night and silence; the vast green sea; the formless and multiform water; the place where you shall never be; the lover whom you shall never know; unnatural flowers; odours which make men drunk; the cats that languish upon pianos and sob like women, with hoarse sweet voices!\n\n\"And you shall be loved by my lovers, courted by my courtiers. You shall be the queen of men who have green eyes, and whose throats I have clasped by night in my caresses; of those that love the sea, the vast tumultuous green sea, formless and multiform water, the place where they are not, the woman whom they know not, the ominous[Pg 40] flowers that are like the censers of an unknown rite, the odours that trouble the will, and the savage and voluptuous beasts that are the emblems of their folly.\"\n\nAnd that is why, accursed dear spoilt child, I lie now at your feet, seeking to find in you the image of the fearful goddess, the fateful god-mother, the poisonous nurse of all the moonstruck of the world.\n\nII\n\nWHICH IS TRUE?\n\nI knew one Benedicta who filled earth and air with the ideal; and from whose eyes men learnt the desire of greatness, of beauty, of glory, and of all whereby we believe in immortality.\n\nBut this miraculous child was too beautiful to live long; and she died only a few days after I had come, to know her, and I buried her with my own hands, one day when Spring shook out her censer in the graveyards. I buried her with my own hands, shut down into a coffin of wood, perfumed and incorruptible like Indian caskets.\n\nAnd as I still gazed at the place where I had laid away my treasure, I saw all at once a little person singularly like the deceased, who trampled on the fresh soil with a strange and hysterical violence, and said, shrieking with laughter: \"Look at me! I am the real Benedicta! a pretty sort of baggage I am! And to punish you for your blindness and folly you shall love me just as I am!\"\n\nBut I was furious, and I answered: \"No! no! no!\" And to add more emphasis to my refusal I stamped on the ground so violently with my foot that my leg sank up to the knee in the earth of the new grave; and now, like a wolf caught in a trap, I remain fastened, perhaps for ever, to the grave of the ideal.\n\n[Pg 41]\n\nIII\n\n\"L'INVITATION AU VOYAGE\"\n\nThere is a wonderful country, a country of Cockaigne, they say, which I dreamed of visiting with an old friend. It is a strange country, lost in the mists of our North, and one might call it the East of the West, the China of Europe, so freely does a warm and capricious fancy flourish there, and so patiently and persistently has that fancy illustrated it with a learned and delicate vegetation.\n\nA real country of Cockaigne, where everything is beautiful, rich, quiet, honest; where order is the likeness and the mirror of luxury; where life is fat, and sweet to breathe; where disorder, tumult, and the unexpected are shut out; where happiness is wedded to silence; where even cooking is poetic, rich and highly flavoured at once; where all, dear love, is made in your image.\n\nYou know that feverish sickness which comes over us in our cold miseries, that nostalgia of unknown lands, that anguish of curiosity? There is a country made in your image, where all is beautiful, rich, quiet and honest; where fancy has built and decorated a western China, where life is sweet to breathe, where happiness is wedded to silence. It is there that we should live, it is there that we should die!\n\nYes, it is there that we should breathe, dream, and lengthen out the hours by the infinity of sensations. A musician has written an \"Invitation \u00e0 la Valse\": who will compose the \"Invitation au Voyage\" that we can offer to the beloved, to the chosen sister?\n\nYes, it is in this atmosphere that it would be good to live; far off, where slower hours contain more thoughts[Pg 42] where clocks strike happiness with a deeper and more significant solemnity.\n\nOn shining panels, or on gilded leather of a dark richness, slumbers the discreet life of pictures, deep, calm, and devout as the souls of the pointers who created it. The sunsets which colour so richly the walls of dining-room and drawing-room, are sifted through beautiful hangings or through tall wrought windows leaded into many panes. The pieces of furniture are large, curious, and fantastic, armed with locks and secrets like refined souls. Mirrors, metals, hangings, goldsmith's work and pottery, play for the eyes a mute and mysterious symphony; and from all things, from every corner, from the cracks of drawers and from the folds of hangings, exhales a singular odour, a \"forget-me-not\" of Sumatra, which is, as it were, the soul of the abode.\n\nA real country of Cockaigne, I assure you, where all is beautiful, clean, and shining, like a clear conscience, like a bright array of kitchen crockery, like splendid jewellery of gold, like many-coloured jewellery of silver! All the treasures of the world have found their way there, as to the house of a hard-working man who has put the whole world in his debt. Singular country, excelling others as Art excels Nature, where Nature is refashioned by dreams, where Nature is. corrected, embellished, remoulded.\n\nLet the alchemists of horticulture seek and seek again, let them set ever further and further back the limits to their happiness! Let them offer prizes of sixty and of a hundred thousand florins to whoever will solve their ambitious problems! For me, I have found my \"black tulip\" and my \"blue dahlia!\"\n\nIncomparable flower, recaptured tulip, allegoric dahlia, it is there, is it not, in that beautiful country, so calm and so full of dreams, that you live and flourish? There,[Pg 43] would you not be framed within your own analogy, and would you not see yourself again, reflected, as the mystics say, in your own \"correspondence\"?\n\nDreams, dreams ever! and the more delicate and ambitious the soul, the further do dreams estrange it from possible things. Every man carries within himself his natural dose of opium, ceaselessly secreted and renewed, and, from birth to death, how many hours can we reckon of positive pleasure, of successful and decided action? Shall we ever live in, shall we ever pass into, that picture which my mind has painted, that picture made in your image?\n\nThese treasures, this furniture, this luxury, this order, these odours, these miraculous flowers, are you. You too are the great rivers and the quiet canals. The vast ships that drift down them, laden with riches, from whose decks comes the sound of the monotonous songs of labouring sailors, are my thoughts which slumber or rise and fall on your breast. You lead them softly towards the sea, which is the infinite, mirroring the depths of the sky in the crystal clearness of your soul; and when, weary of the surge and heavy with the spoils of the East, they return to the port of their birth, it is still my thoughts that come back enriched out of the infinite to you.\n\nIV\n\nTHE EYES OF THE POOR\n\nAh! you want to know why I hate you to-day. It will probably be less easy for you to understand than for me to explain it to you; for you are, I think, the most perfect example of feminine impenetrability that could possibly be found.\n\n[Pg 44]\n\nWe had spent a long day together, and it had seemed to me short. We had promised one another that we would think the same thoughts and that our two souls should become one soul; a dream which is not original, after all, except that, dreamed by all men, it has been realised by none.\n\nIn the evening you were a little tired, and you sat down outside a new caf\u00e9 at the corner of a new boulevard, still littered with plaster and already displaying proudly its unfinished splendours. The caf\u00e9 glittered. The very gas put on all the fervency of a fresh start, and lighted up with its full force the blinding whiteness of the walls, the dazzling sheets of glass in the mirrors, the gilt of cornices and mouldings, the chubby-cheeked pages straining back from hounds in leash, the ladies laughing at the falcons on their wrists, the nymphs and goddesses carrying fruits and pies and game on their heads, the Hebes and Ganymedes holding out at arm's-length little jars of syrups or parti-coloured obelisks of ices; the whole of history and of mythology brought together to make a paradise for gluttons. Exactly opposite to us, in the roadway, stood a man of about forty years of age, with a weary face and a greyish beard, holding a little boy by one hand and carrying on the other arm a little fellow too weak to walk. He was taking the nurse-maid's place, and had brought his children out for a walk in the evening. All were in rags. The three faces were extraordinarily serious, and the six eyes stared fixedly at the new caf\u00e9 with an equal admiration, differentiated in each according to age.\n\nThe father's eyes said: \"How beautiful it is! how beautiful it is! One would think that all the gold of the poor world had found its way to these walls.\" The boy's eyes said: \"How beautiful it is! how beautiful it is! But that is a house which only people who are not like[Pg 45] us can enter.\" As for the little one's eyes, they were too fascinated to express anything but stupid and utter joy.\n\nSong-writers say that pleasure ennobles the soul and softens the heart. The song was right that evening, so far as I was concerned. Not only was I touched by this family of eyes, but I felt rather ashamed of our glasses and decanters, so much too much for our thirst. I turned to look at you, dear love, that I might read my own thought in you; I gazed deep into your eyes, so beautiful and so strangely sweet, your green eyes that are the home of caprice and under the sovereignty of the Moon; and you said to me: \"Those people are insupportable to me with their staring saucer-eyes! Couldn't you tell the head waiter to send them away?\"\n\nSo hard is it to understand one another, dearest, and so incommunicable is thought, even between people who are in love!\n\nV\n\nWINDOWS\n\nHe who looks in through an open window never sees so many things as he who looks at a shut window. There is nothing more profound, more mysterious, more fertile, more gloomy, or more dazzling, than a window lighted by a candle. What we can see in the sunlight is always less interesting than what goes on behind the panes of a window. In that dark or luminous hollow, life lives, life dreams, life suffers.\n\nAcross the waves of roofs, I can see a woman of middle age, wrinkled, poor, who is always leaning over something, and who never goes out. Out of her face, out of her dress, out of her attitude, out of nothing almost, I[Pg 46] have made up the woman's story, and sometimes I say it over to myself with tears.\n\nIf it had been a poor old man, I could have made up his just as easily.\n\nAnd I go to bed, proud of having lived and suffered in others.\n\nPerhaps you will say to me: \"Are you sure that it is the real story?\" What does it matter, what does any reality outside of myself matter, if it has helped me to live, to feel that I am, and what I am?\n\nVI\n\nCROWDS\n\nIt is not given to every man to take a bath of multitude: to play upon crowds is an art; and he alone can plunge, at the expense of humankind, into a debauch of vitality, to whom a fairy has bequeathed in his cradle the love of masks and disguises, the hate of home and the passion of travel.\n\nMultitude, solitude: equal terms mutually convertible by the active and begetting poet. He who does not know how to people his solitude, does not know either how to be alone in a busy crowd.\n\nThe poet enjoys this incomparable privilege, to be at once himself and others. Like those wandering souls that go about seeking bodies, he enters at will the personality of every man. For him alone, every place is vacant; and if certain places seem to be closed against him, that is because in his eyes they are not worth the trouble of visiting.\n\nThe solitary and thoughtful walker derives a singular intoxication from this universal communion. He who[Pg 47] mates easily with the crowd knows feverish joys that must be for ever unknown to the egoist, shut up like a coffer, and to the sluggard, imprisoned like a shell-fish. He adopts for his own all the occupations, all the joys and all the sorrows that circumstance sets before him.\n\nWhat men call love is small indeed, narrow and weak indeed, compared with this ineffable orgie, this sacred prostitution of the soul which gives itself up wholly (poetry and charity!) to the unexpected which happens, to the stranger as he passes.\n\nIt is good sometimes that the happy of this world should learn, were it only to humble their foolish pride for an instant, that there are higher, wider, and rarer joys than theirs. The founders of colonies, the shepherds of nations, the missionary priests, exiled to the ends of the earth, doubtless know something of these mysterious intoxications; and, in the midst of the vast family that their genius has raised about them, they must sometimes laugh at the thought of those who pity them for their chaste lives and troubled fortunes.\n\nVII\n\nTHE CAKE\n\nI was travelling. The landscape in the midst of which I was seated was of an irresistible grandeur and sublimity. Something no doubt at that moment passed from it into my soul. My thoughts fluttered with a lightness like that of the atmosphere; vulgar passions, such as hate and profane love, seemed to me now as far away as the clouds that floated in the gulfs beneath my feet; my soul seemed to me as vast and pure as the dome of the sky that enveloped me; the remembrance of earthly things came as faintly to my heart as the thin tinkle of the[Pg 48] bells of unseen herds, browsing far, far away, on the slope of another mountain. Across the little motionless lake, black with the darkness of its immense depth, there passed from time to time the shadow of a cloud, like the shadow of an airy giant's cloak, flying through heaven. And I remember that this rare and solemn sensation, caused by a vast and perfectly silent movement, filled me with mingled joy and fear. In a word, thanks to the enrapturing beauty about me, I felt that I was at perfect peace with myself and with the universe; I even believe that, in my complete forgetfulness of all earthly evil, I had come to think the newspapers are right after all, and man was born good; when, incorrigible matter renewing its exigencies, I sought to refresh the fatigue and satisfy the appetite caused by so lengthy a climb. I took from my pocket a large piece of bread, a leathern cup, and a small bottle of a certain elixir which the chemists at that time sold to tourists, to be mixed, on occasion, with liquid snow.\n\nI was quietly cutting my bread when a slight noise made me look up. I saw in front of me a little ragged urchin, dark and dishevelled, whose hollow eyes, wild and supplicating, devoured the piece of bread. And I heard him gasp, in a low, hoarse voice, the word: \"Cake!\" I could not help laughing at the appellation with which he thought fit to honour my nearly white bread, and I cut off a big slice and offered it to him. Slowly he came up to me, not taking his eyes from the coveted object; then, snatching it out of my hand, he stepped quickly back, as if he feared that my offer was not sincere, or that I had already repented of it.\n\nBut at the same instant he was knocked over by another little savage, who had sprung from I know not where, and who was so precisely like the first that one might have taken them for twin brothers. They rolled[Pg 49] over on the ground together, struggling for the possession of the precious booty, neither willing to share it with his brother. The first, exasperated, clutched the second by the hair; and the second seized one of the ears of the first between his teeth, and spat out a little bleeding morsel with a fine oath in dialect. The legitimate proprietor of the cake tried to hook his little claws into the usurper's eyes; the latter did his best to throttle his adversary with one hand, while with the other he endeavoured to slip the prize of war into his pocket. But, heartened by despair, the loser pulled himself together, and sent the victor sprawling with a blow of the head in his stomach. Why describe a hideous fight which indeed lasted longer than their childish strength seemed to promise? The cake travelled from hand to hand, and changed from pocket to pocket, at every moment; but, alas, it changed also in size; and when at length, exhausted, panting and bleeding, they stopped from the sheer impossibility of going on, there was no longer any cause of feud; the slice of bread had disappeared, and lay scattered in crumbs like the grains of sand with which it was mingled.\n\nThe sight had darkened the landscape for me, and dispelled the joyous calm in which my soul had lain basking; I remained saddened for quite a long time, saying over and over to myself: \"There is then a wonderful country in which bread is called cake, and is so rare a delicacy that it is enough in itself to give rise to a war literally fratricidal!\"\n\nVIII\n\nEVENING TWILIGHT\n\nThe day is over. A great restfulness descends into poor minds that the day's work has wearied; and[Pg 50] thoughts take on the tender and dim colours of twilight.\n\nNevertheless from the mountain peak there comes to my balcony, through the transparent clouds of evening, a great clamour, made up of a crowd of discordant cries, dulled by distance into a mournful harmony, like that of the rising tide or of a storm brewing.\n\nWho are the hapless ones to whom evening brings no calm; to whom, as to the owls, the coming of night is the signal for a witches' sabbat? The sinister ululation comes to me from the hospital on the mountain; and, in the evening, as I smoke, and look down on the quiet of the immense valley, bristling with houses, each of whose windows seems to say, \"Here is peace, here is domestic happiness!\" I can, when the wind blows from the heights, lull my astonished thought with this imitation of the harmonies of hell.\n\nTwilight excites madmen. I remember I had two friends whom twilight made quite ill. One of them lost all sense of social and friendly amenities, and flew at the first-comer like a savage. I have seen him throw at the waiter's head an excellent chicken, in which he imagined he had discovered some insulting hieroglyph. Evening, harbinger of profound delights, spoilt for him the most succulent things.\n\nThe other, a prey to disappointed ambition, turned gradually, as the daylight dwindled, sourer, more gloomy, more nettlesome. Indulgent and sociable during the day, he was pitiless in the evening; and it was not only on others, but on himself, that he vented the rage of his twilight mania.\n\nThe former died mad, unable to recognise his wife and child; the latter still keeps the restlessness of a perpetual disquietude; and, if all the honours that republics and princes can confer were heaped upon him, I believe that the twilight would still quicken in him the burning envy[Pg 51] of imaginary distinctions. Night, which put its own darkness into their minds, brings light to mine; and, though it is by no means rare for the same cause to bring about opposite results, I am always as it were perplexed and alarmed by it.\n\nO night! O refreshing dark! for me you are the summons to an inner feast, you are the deliverer from anguish! In the solitude of the plains, in the stony labyrinths of a city, scintillation of stars, outburst of gaslamps, you are the fireworks of the goddess Liberty!\n\nTwilight, how gentle you are and how tender! The rosy lights that still linger on the horizon, like the last agony of day under the conquering might of its night; the flaring candle-flames that stain with dull red the last glories of the sunset; the heavy draperies that an invisible hand draws out of the depths of the East, mimic all those complex feelings that war on one another in the heart of man at the solemn moments of life.\n\nWould you not say that it was one of those strange costumes worn by dancers, in which the tempered splendours of a shining skirt show through a dark and transparent gauze, as, through the darkness of the present, pierces the delicious past? And the wavering stars of gold and silver with which it is shot, are they not those fires of fancy which take light never so well as under the deep mourning of the night?\n\nIX\n\n\"ANYWHERE OUT OF THE WORLD\"\n\nLife is a hospital, in which every patient is possessed by the desire of changing his bed. One would prefer to suffer near the fire, and another is certain that he would get well if he were by the window.[Pg 52] It seems to me that I should always be happy if I were somewhere else, and this question of moving house is one that I am continually talking over with my soul.\n\n\"Tell me, my soul, poor chilly soul, what do you say to living in Lisbon? It must be very warm there, and you would bask merrily, like a lizard. It is by the sea; they say that it is built of marble, and that the people have such a horror of vegetation that they tear up all the trees. There is a country after your own soul; a country made up of light and mineral, and with liquid to reflect them.\"\n\nMy soul makes no answer.\n\n\"Since you love rest, and to see moving things, will you come and live in that heavenly land, Holland? Perhaps you would be happy in a country which you have so often admired in pictures. What do you say to Rotterdam, you who love forests of masts, and ships anchored at the doors of houses?\"\n\nMy soul remains silent.\n\n\"Or perhaps Java seems to you more attractive? Well, there we shall find the mind of Europe married to tropical beauty.\"\n\nNot a word. Can my soul be dead?\n\n\"Have you sunk then into so deep a stupor that only your own pain gives you pleasure? If that be so, let us go to the lands that are made in the likeness of Death. I know exactly the place for us, poor soul! We will book our passage to Torneo. We will go still further, to the last limits of the Baltic; and, if it be possible, further still from life; we will make our abode at the Pole. There the sun only grazes the earth, and the slow alternations of light and night put out variety and bring in the half of nothingness, monotony. There we can take great baths of darkness, while, from time to time,[Pg 53] for our pleasure, the Aurora Borealis shall scatter its rosy sheaves before us, like reflections of fireworks in hell!\"\n\nAt last my soul bursts into speech, and wisely she cries to me: \"Anywhere, anywhere, out of the world!\"\n\nX\n\nA HEROIC DEATH\n\nFancioulle was an admirable buffoon, and almost one of the friends of the Prince. But for persons professionally devoted to the comic, serious things have a fatal attraction, and, strange as it may seem that ideas of patriotism and liberty should seize despotically upon the brain of a player, one day Fancioulle joined in a conspiracy formed by some discontented nobles.\n\nThere exist everywhere sensible men to denounce those individuals of atrabiliar disposition who seek to depose princes, and, without consulting it, to reconstitute society. The lords in question were arrested, together with Fancioulle, and condemned to death.\n\nI would readily believe that the Prince was almost sorry to find his favourite actor among the rebels. The Prince was neither better nor worse than any other Prince; but an excessive sensibility rendered him, in many cases, more cruel and more despotic than all his fellows. Passionately enamoured of the fine arts, an excellent connoisseur as well, he was truly insatiable of pleasures. Indifferent enough in regard to men and morals, himself a real artist, he feared no enemy but Ennui, and the extravagant efforts that he made to fly or to vanquish this tyrant of the world would certainly have brought upon him, on the part of a severe historian, the epithet of \"monster,\" had it been permitted, in his dominions, to write anything whatever[Pg 54] which did not tend exclusively to pleasure, or to astonishment, which is one of the most delicate forms of pleasure. The great misfortune of the Prince was that he had no theatre vast enough for his genius. There are young Neros who are stifled within too narrow limits, and whose names and whose intentions will never be known to future ages. An unforeseeing Providence had given to this man faculties greater than his dominions.\n\nSuddenly the rumour spread that the sovereign had decided to pardon all the conspirators; and the origin of this rumour was the announcement of a special performance in which Fancioulle would play one of his best r\u00f4les, and at which even the condemned nobles, it was said, were to be present, an evident sign, added superficial minds, of the generous tendencies of the Prince.\n\nOn the part of a man so naturally and deliberately eccentric, anything was possible, even virtue, even mercy, especially if he could hope to find in it unexpected pleasures. But to those who, like myself, had succeeded in penetrating further into the depths of this sick and curious soul, it was infinitely more probable that the Prince was wishful to estimate the quality of the scenic talents of a man condemned to death. He would profit by the occasion to obtain a physiological experience of a capital interest, and to verify to what extent the habitual faculties of an artist would be altered or modified by the extraordinary situation in which he found himself. Beyond this, did there exist in his mind an intention, more or less defined, of mercy? It is a point that has never been solved.\n\nAt last, the great day having come, the little court displayed all its pomps, and it would be difficult to realise, without having seen it, what splendour the privileged classes of a little state with limited resources can show forth, on a really solemn occasion. This was a[Pg 55] doubly solemn one, both from the wonder of its display and from the mysterious moral interest attaching to it.\n\nThe Sieur Fancioulle excelled especially in parts either silent or little burdened with words, such as are often the principal ones in those fairy plays whose object is to represent symbolically the mystery of life. He came upon the stage lightly and with a perfect ease, which in itself lent some support, in the minds of the noble public, to the idea of kindness and forgiveness.\n\nWhen we say of an actor, \"This is a good actor,\" we make use of a formula which implies that under the personage we can still distinguish the actor, that is to say, art, effort, will. Now, if an actor should succeed in being, in relation to the personage whom he is appointed to express, precisely what the finest statues of antiquity, miraculously animated, living, walking, seeing, would be in relation to the confused general idea of beauty, this would be, undoubtedly, a singular and unheard of case. Fancioulle was, that evening, a perfect idealisation, which it was impossible not to suppose living, possible, real. The buffoon came and went, he laughed, wept, was convulsed with an indestructible aureole about his head, an aureole invisible to all, but visible to me, and in which were blended, in a strange amalgam, the rays of Art and the martyr's glory. Fancioulle brought, by I know not what special grace, something divine and supernatural into even the most extravagant buffooneries. My pen trembles, and the tears of an emotion which I cannot forget rise to my eyes, as I try to describe to you this never-to-be-forgotten evening. Fancioulle proved to me, in a peremptory, an irrefutable way, that the intoxication of Art is surer than all others to veil the terrors of the gulf; that genius can act a comedy on the threshold of the grave with a joy that binders it from seeing the[Pg 56] grave, lost, as it is, in a Paradise shutting out all thought, of the grave and of destruction.\n\nThe whole audience, blas\u00e9 and frivolous as it was, soon fell under the all-powerful sway of the artist. Not a thought was left of death, of mourning, or of punishment. All gave themselves up, without disquietude, to the manifold delights caused by the sight of a masterpiece of living art. Explosions of joy and admiration again and again shook the dome of the edifice with the energy of a continuous thunder. The Prince himself, in an ecstasy, joined in the applause of his court.\n\nNevertheless, to a discerning eye, his emotion was not unmixed. Did he feel himself conquered in his power as despot? humiliated in his art as the striker of terror into hearts, of chill into souls? Such suppositions, not exactly justified, but not absolutely unjustifiable, passed through my mind as I contemplated the face of the Prince, on which a new pallor gradually overspread its habitual paleness, as snow overspreads snow. His lips compressed themselves tighter and tighter, and his eyes lighted up with an inner fire like that of jealousy or of spite, even while he applauded the talents of his old friend, the strange buffoon, who played the buffoon so well in the face of death. At a certain moment, I saw his Highness lean towards a little page, stationed behind him, and whisper in his ear. The roguish face of the pretty child lit up with a smile, and he briskly quitted the Prince's box as if to execute some urgent commission.\n\nA few minutes later a shrill and prolonged hiss interrupted Fancioulle in one of his finest moments, and rent alike every ear and heart. And from the part of the house from whence this unexpected note of disapproval had sounded, a child darted into a corridor with stifled laughter.\n\n[Pg 57]\n\nFancioulle, shaken, roused out of his dream, closed his eyes, then re-opened them, almost at once, extraordinarily wide, opened his mouth as if to breathe convulsively, staggered a little forward, a little backward, and then fell stark dead on the boards.\n\nHad the hiss, swift as a sword, really frustrated the hangman? Had the Prince himself divined all the homicidal efficacy of his ruse? It is permitted to doubt it. Did he regret his dear and inimitable Fancioulle? It is sweet and legitimate to believe it.\n\nThe guilty nobles had enjoyed the performance of comedy for the last time. They were effaced from life.\n\nSince then, many mimes, justly appreciated in different countries, have played before the court of \u2014\u2014; but none of them have ever been able to recall the marvellous talents of Fancioulle, or to rise to the same favour.\n\nXI\n\nBE DRUNKEN\n\nBe always drunken. Nothing else matters: that is the only question. If you would not feel the horrible burden of Time weighing on your shoulders and crushing you to the earth, be drunken continually.\n\nDrunken with what? With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you will. But be drunken.\n\nAnd if sometimes, on the stairs of a palace, or on the green side of a ditch, or in the dreary solitude of your own room, you should awaken and the drunkenness be half or wholly slipped away from you, ask of the wind, or of the wave, or of the star, or of the bird, or of the clock, of whatever flies, or sighs, or rocks, or sings, or speaks, ask what hour it is; and the wind, wave, star, bird, clock, will answer you: \"It is the hour to be[Pg 58] drunken! Be drunken, if you would not be martyred slaves of Time; be drunken continually! With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you will.\"\n\nXII\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nWith heart at rest I climbed the citadel's\n\nSteep height, and saw the city as from a tower,\n\nHospital, brothel, prison, and such hells,\n\n\n\nWhere evil comes up softly like a flower.\n\nThou knowest, O Satan, patron of my pain,\n\nNot for vain tears I went up at that hour;\n\n\n\nBut, like an old sad faithful lecher, fain\n\nTo drink delight of that enormous trull\n\nWhose hellish beauty makes me young again.\n\n\n\nWhether thou sleep, with heavy vapours full,\n\nSodden with day, or, new apparelled, stand\n\nIn gold-laced veils of evening beautiful,\n\n\n\nI love thee, infamous city! Harlots and\n\nHunted have pleasures of their own to give,\n\nThe vulgar herd can never understand.\n\n\n\n[Pg 59]\n\nTranslated by Joseph T. Shipley\n\n[Pg 61]\n\nDEDICATION\n\nTo\n\nARS\u00c8NE HOUSSAYE\n\nMY DEAR FRIEND:\n\nI send you a little work of which it cannot be said, without injustice, that it has neither head nor tail; since all of it, on the contrary, is at once head and tail, alternately and reciprocally. Consider, I pray you, what convenience this arrangement offers to all of us, to you, to me and to the reader. We can stop where we wish, I my musing, you your consideration, and the reader his perusal\u2014for I do not hold the latter's restive will by the interminable thread of a fine-spun intrigue. Remove a vertebra, and the two parts of this tortuous fantasy rejoin painlessly. Chop it into particles, and you will see that each part can exist by itself. In the hope that some of these segments will be lively enough to please and to amuse you, I venture to dedicate to you the entire serpent.\n\nI have a little confession to make. It was while glancing, for at least the twentieth time, through the famous Gaspard de la Nuit, by Aloysius Bertrand (a book known to you, to me, and to a few of our friends, has it not the highest right to be called famous?), that the idea came to me to attempt an analogous plan, and to apply to the description of modern life, or rather of a life modern and more abstract, the process which he applied in the depicting of ancient life, so strangely picturesque.\n\nWhich of us has not, in his moments of ambition,[Pg 62] dreamed the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rime, sufficiently supple, sufficiently abrupt, to adapt itself to the lyrical movements of the soul, to the windings and turnings of the fancy, to the sudden starts of the conscience?\n\nIt is particularly in frequenting great cities, it is from the flux of their innumerable streams of intercourse, that this importunate ideal is born. Have not you yourself, my dear friend, tried to convey in a chanson the strident cry of the glazier, and to express in a "}, {"url": "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/charles-baudelaire", "page_content": "Charles Baudelaire is one of the most compelling poets of the 19th century. While Baudelaire\u2019s contemporary Victor Hugo is generally\u2014and sometimes regretfully\u2014acknowledged as the greatest of 19th-century French poets, Baudelaire excels in his unprecedented expression of a complex sensibility and of modern themes within structures of classical rigor and technical artistry. Baudelaire is distinctive in French literature also in that his skills as a prose writer virtually equal his ability as a poet. His body of work includes a novella, influential translations of the American writer Edgar Allan Poe, highly perceptive criticism of contemporary art, provocative journal entries, and critical essays on a variety of subjects. Baudelaire\u2019s work has had a tremendous influence on modernism, and his relatively slim production of poetry in particular has had a significant impact on later poets. More than a talent of 19th-century France, Baudelaire is one of the major figures in the literary history of the world.\n\nThe extent of the influence of Baudelaire\u2019s family background on his life and work has been the subject of some interest to critics. In his life-story there are classic ingredients for neurosis, and his adult life was shaped by a triangle of family relations that some believe explains his complicated psyche. Baudelaire\u2019s father, Fran\u00e7ois Baudelaire (1759\u20131827), came from a family of woodworkers, winegrowers, farm laborers, and craftsmen who had lived near the Argonne forest since the 17th century. He went to Paris on a scholarship and in the course of a long career there became a priest; worked as a tutor for the children of Count Antoine de Choiseul-Praslin, even composing a manual to teach Latin; resigned his priesthood during the Reign of Terror; married Rosalie Janin, a painter, and had a son, Alphonse Baudelaire (1805\u20131862); earned a living as a painter; and from the age of thirty-eight until retirement worked his way up the ranks of the civil service.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Baudelaire was 60 when he married the 26-year-old Caroline Dufayis (1793\u20131871) in 1819; Charles was their only child, born in Paris on April 9, 1821. Caroline was an orphan: her mother, who came from a family of solicitors from the same part of France as the Baudelaires, died in England, where she had emigrated for unknown reasons; little is known about Caroline\u2019s father except that his name was Charles Dufayis and that he was supposed to have died in July 1795 at Quiberon Bay in southern Brittany when Revolutionary forces put down a peasant revolt aided by \u00e9migr\u00e9s. It is not known whether or not the difference in his parents\u2019 ages affected their son, but Baudelaire was just six when his father died, so he had no opportunity to know his father well. The death of Fran\u00e7ois Baudelaire, though, set the scene for several major dramas in Baudelaire\u2019s life: his inheritance at 21 of a respectable fortune; the establishment of a board of guardians that was to control Baudelaire\u2019s financial fortunes for most of his adult life; and the remarriage of his mother to Jacques Aupick, a man with whom Baudelaire could not get along.\n\nAupick (1779?\u20131857), like Caroline Dufayis, was an orphan. His father was an Irishman who died in the military service in France; his mother, who might or might not have been his father\u2019s legal wife, died shortly afterward. The young Aupick made his way successfully in the military: with no real family advantages, he was a general by the end of his life, and he had served as the head of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (Polytechnic School) in Paris, as ambassador to Constantinople as well as to Spain, and as a senator. Caroline Dufayis Baudelaire met Aupick at the beginning of 1828, a year into her widowhood, and they were married rather precipitously on November 8, 1828, probably because of the stillborn child born a month later. Aupick was transferred to Lyon in December 1831, and in January 1836 he was transferred back to Paris, where he stayed until 1848, when he was sent as a diplomat to Constantinople.\n\nIt is understandable that Baudelaire might be jealous of his mother\u2019s new husband, as he was deeply attached to his mother both materially and emotionally. Their close relationship was of enduring significance, for during the course of his life he borrowed from his mother an estimated total of 20,473 francs and much of what is known of his later life comes from his extended correspondence with her. Although quite possibly Baudelaire\u2019s attachment to his mother did lead to his resentment and dislike of his stepfather, it is interesting to note that he did not manifest resentment early on. As a schoolboy in Lyons from 1832 to 1836 Baudelaire\u2019s letters to his parents were mostly affectionate and he referred to Aupick as his father. Easy relations within the family persisted through Baudelaire\u2019s high-school years at Louis-le-Grand in Paris, where Colonel Aupick had been transferred. Far from being \u201cmaudit\u201d (cursed) in the tradition of his later legend, Baudelaire was actually a prize student of whom both parents were proud. Even when he was expelled from Louis-le-Grand in 1839 for refusing to give up a note passed him by a classmate, stepfather and stepson appeared to be on good terms.\n\nBaudelaire began referring to his stepfather as \u201cthe General\u201d (Aupick had been promoted in 1839) in 1841, around the time his family contrived to send the young man on a voyage to the Indian Ocean. After passing the \u201cbac,\u201d or baccalaur\u00e9at (high-school degree), in 1839, several months after his expulsion from the lyc\u00e9e, Baudelaire spent two years in the Latin Quarter pursuing a literary career and, of particular concern to Aupick, accumulating debts. To save Baudelaire from his debts, a family council was called in which it was decided to send him on a long voyage in June of 1841, paid for from his future inheritance (the parents later agreed to pay for it themselves as a gesture of goodwill). Baudelaire did not want to go, and in fact he jumped ship at the Ile Bourbon, returning to Paris in February of 1842. If the stiff forms of address in his letters of this time are any indication, Baudelaire resented his family\u2019s intervention in his way of life and held his stepfather responsible for it.\n\nFamilial censure only became more institutionalized. By June of 1844 Baudelaire had spent nearly half of the capital of the 99,568 francs he had inherited two years before. The family decided that it was necessary to seek a conseil judiciaire (legal adviser) to protect the capital from Baudelaire, and on September 21, 1844 the court made Narcisse D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Ancelle, a lawyer, legally responsible for managing Baudelaire\u2019s fortune and for paying him his \u201callowance.\u201d The sum paid him was enough for a single young man to live on comfortably, but Baudelaire had expensive tastes and he was bitter about this intervention for the rest of his life. Relations among family members soured. Baudelaire could no longer bear to be around \u201cthe General\u201d and there were long periods of time when Mme Aupick was not permitted to see her son. For the next 15 years Baudelaire\u2019s letters to his mother are laced with reproach, affection, and requests for money, and it was only after her husband\u2019s death\u2014in 1857, the year of the publication of Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil)\u2014that relations between mother and son began to improve.\n\nFinancial constraint, alienation, and complex emotions defined Baudelaire\u2019s life, and it is against this backdrop of complicated family relations that some of the best poetry in the French language was written. Though Baudelaire\u2019s interest in verse was manifest as early as his days in the lyc\u00e9e, his public emergence as a poet was slow and complicated by many sideline activities through the early 1850s.\n\nBaudelaire began making literary connections as soon as he passed the bac, at the same time that he was amassing debts. From 1839 to 1841, while he was living in the Latin Quarter, he became associated with the \u00c9cole Normande (Norman School), a group of student-poets centered around Gustave Levavasseur, Philippe de Chennevi\u00e8res, and Ernest Prarond. None of these people became major poets, but they were involved in Baudelaire\u2019s first ventures with poetry. Prarond claims to have heard Baudelaire recite as early as 1842 some of the poems that were later published in Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire considered participating in a collective publication with Levavasseur, Prarond, and another person named Dozon. He withdrew his contribution, however, because Levavasseur wanted to correct the \u201cidiosyncrasies\u201d in his work. Baudelaire was never without literary acquaintances. His professional social activity continued throughout his life, and in the course of his literary career he became acquainted with writers such as Victor Hugo, Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. As his rejection of Levavasseur\u2019s corrections suggested, though, Baudelaire\u2014like the speakers in his poetry\u2014was always an individual within the crowd.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s first publications of poetry were probably disguised, for reasons known only to himself. 11 poems published between 1844 and 1847 in L\u2019Artiste under the name of Privat d\u2019Anglemont\u2014another friend in Baudelaire\u2019s literary circle\u2014have been attributed to Baudelaire, and in fact nine of these poems have been included in the definitive Pl\u00e9iade edition of Baudelaire\u2019s collected works published 1975\u20131979. The first poem published under Baudelaire\u2019s own name appeared in L\u2019Artiste on May 25, 1845; Baudelaire probably wrote the sonnet \u201cA Une Dame Cr\u00e9ole\u201d (To a Creole Lady), which celebrates the \u201cpale\u201d and \u201chot\u201d coloring of the lovely Mme Autard de Bragard, on his trip to the Indian Ocean. The poem is not a prodigious showing for someone who was already establishing a reputation for himself in Parisian circles as a poet, and Baudelaire\u2019s next official publication of verse did not take place until a full six years later, in 1851.\n\nIn De quelques \u00e9crivains nouveaux (On Some New Writers, 1852) Prarond described Baudelaire as a poet who had achieved a certain reputation without having published a verse. Although the statement was not technically accurate in 1852, it illustrates a facet of Baudelaire\u2019s reputation. Even though he had no record of solid achievements, Baudelaire, with his compelling personality, had the ability to impress others, and he was already deliberately cultivating his image with eccentric stories designed to shock and test his acquaintances. For example, he liked to recite to friends his poem \u201cNightmare,\u201d which features a man who witnesses the rape of his mistress by an entire army.\n\nEarly in his career Baudelaire\u2019s reputation was more solidly based on his nonpoetic publications. In 1847 he published his only novella, La Fanfarlo, an autobiographically based work that features a tortured hero named Samuel Cramer. He wrote a handful of essays and reviews for various journals, notably Le Corsaire Satan; these works\u2014including Le Mus\u00e9e classique du bazar Bonne-Nouvelle (The Classical Museum of the Bonne-Nouvelle Bazaar) and Comment on paie ses dettes quand on du g\u00e9nie (How to Pay Your Debts When You\u2019re a Genius)\u2014were collected in Curiosit\u00e9s esth\u00e9tiques (Esthetic Curiosities, 1868) as well as L\u2019Art romantique (Romantic Art, 1868), the second and third volumes in the posthumously published Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes (Complete Works, 1868\u20131873). Baudelaire also wrote two of the Salons that contribute to his reputation as a discerning, sometimes prophetic, and often amusing critic. Although Salon de 1845 (1845) went unnoticed by critics, the next year his Salon de 1846 made a good impression on a small circle.\n\nAlthough he does not develop an aesthetic theory in Salon de 1845, Baudelaire does launch his idea that heroism can exist in life\u2019s ordinary details. The essay notably displays a particularly charming feature of Baudelaire\u2019s critical writing: the sharp and colorful illustration of points. The works of one painter, for example, are witheringly dismissed: \u201cchaque ann\u00e9e les ram\u00e8ne avec leurs m\u00eames d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rantes perfections\u201d (each year brings them back with the same depressing perfections); another painter\u2019s works, writes Baudelaire, recall the pictures of travel brochures and evoke a China \u201co\u00f9 le vent lui-m\u00eame, dit H. Heine, prend un son comique en passant par les clochettes;\u2014et o\u00f9 la nature et l\u2019homme ne peuvent pas se regarder sans rire\u201d (where the wind itself, says H. Heine, sounds comical as it blows through bells; and where nature and man cannot look at each other without laughing).\n\nIn the important Salon de 1846 Baudelaire critiques particular artists and in a more general way lays the groundwork for the ideas about art that he continued to develop in his \u201cSalon de 1859,\u201d first published in Revue fran\u00e7aise in June and July of that year, and up until his essay \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d (The Painter of Modern Life), which appeared in Le Figaro in November and December of 1863. As Baudelaire defines it in Salon de 1846, art represents an ideal for Baudelaire: \u201cL\u2019art est un bien infiniment pr\u00e9cieux, un breuvage rafra\u00eechissant et r\u00e9chauffant, qui r\u00e9tablit l\u2019estomac et l\u2019esprit dans l\u2019\u00e9quilibre naturel de l\u2019id\u00e9al\u201d (Art is an infinitely precious thing, a warming and refreshing drink which reestablishes stomach and spirit in the natural equilibrium of the ideal). Although art leads to an abstraction, \u201cl\u2019id\u00e9al,\u201d the references to stomach and drink indicate that for Baudelaire the ideal is built on concrete particulars. Indeed, as he goes on to explain in Salon de 1846 \u201cAinsi l\u2019id\u00e9al n\u2019est pas cette chose vague, ce r\u00eave ennuyeux et impalpable qui nage au plafond des acad\u00e9mies; un id\u00e9al, c\u2019est l\u2019individu redress\u00e9 par l\u2019individu, rconstruit et rendu par le pinceau ou le ciseau \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9clatante v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de son harmonie native\u201d (Thus the ideal is not the vague thing, that boring and intangible dream which swims on the ceilings of academies; an ideal is the individual taken up by the individual, reconstructed and returned by brush or scissors to the brilliant truth of its native harmony).\n\nAt the time he wrote Salon de 1846 Baudelaire believed that Romanticism represented the ideal, and he presents the painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix as the best artist in that tradition. Baudelaire, though, also articulates principles that later took him beyond Romanticism to a more radical view of art. He propounds that beauty must contain the absolute and the particular, the eternal and the transitory, and in a section of Salon de 1846 titled \u201cDe l\u2019H\u00e9ro\u00efsme de la Vie Moderne,\u201d (The Heroism of Modern Life) he elaborates that the \u201cparticulier\u201d can be found in contemporary and ordinary urban life: \u201cLe spectacle de la vie \u00e9l\u00e9gante et des milliers d\u2019existences flottantes qui circulent dans les souterrains d\u2019une grande ville,\u2014criminels et filles entretenues,\u2014la Gazette des Tribuneaux et le Moniteur nous prouvent que nous n\u2019avons qu\u2019\u00e0 ouvrir les yeux pour conna\u00eetre notre h\u00e9ro\u00efsme\u201d (The spectacle of elegant life and of the thousands of existences which float in the underground of a big city\u2014criminals and kept women\u2014the Gazette des Tribuneaux and the Moniteur prove that we have only to open our eyes in order to recognize our heroism). Modern life as inspiration for art is an idea that Baudelaire develops in \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d with reference to the artist Constantin Guys. As Baudelaire observes in 1846, Delacroix works in the grand tradition, and a new tradition has not yet come into being.\n\nDespite several halfhearted attempts to indulge his parents\u2019 desire for his settled employment, throughout the 1840s Baudelaire was committed to his vocation as a poet, and as an artist he did his best to absorb the \u201cspectacle\u201d of Parisian life by living the life of a bohemian and a dandy. After the naming of the conseil judiciaire he affirmed a new identity by changing his name to Baudelaire-Dufayis, adding his mother\u2019s maiden name to his father\u2019s family name (this gesture lasted until the Revolution of 1848). He was particular about his dress, and virtually every contemporary description of him describes his changing hairstyles, from flowing locks to a shaved head to short, clipped hair. Early in the decade he took up with Jeanne Duval, the mixed-race mistress with whom he had a long and complicated affair; in the late 1840s he met Marie Daubrun, the second inspiration for the three love cycles of his poetry. He had already had a bout with gonorrhea by this time and had picked up syphilis, the disease that was probably the cause of his death. Baudelaire attempted suicide once, on June 30, 1845. He cultivated an interest in art and painting, which fueled his continued accumulation of debts\u2014he was a generally unlucky but enthusiastic collector. He began a pattern of moving from hotel to hotel to escape creditors and was well acquainted with the seamy side of Paris, a familiarity that is evident in his poems.\n\nThe year 1848 marked the beginning of a strange period in Baudelaire\u2019s life, one that does not quite fit with his life as a dandy, and which he himself later labeled \u201cMon ivresse de 1848\u201d (My frenzy in 1848) in his Journaux intimes (Intimate Journals, 1909). Baudelaire\u2014the product of a bourgeois household, the elitist poet of refined and elegant dress, the man who in the 1850s embraced Count Joseph de Maistre, an ultra-royalist aristocrat, and who had already expressed admiration for the aristocratic views of Edgar Allan Poe\u2014participated in the French Revolution of 1848 that lead to the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy.\n\nAs Richard Burton documents extensively in Baudelaire and the Second Republic: Writing and Revolution (1988), Baudelaire did have strong revolutionary sympathies during this period. He was influenced by thinkers such as Fran\u00e7ois Marie Charles Fourier, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Lamennais, and Emanuel Swedenborg. His dedication of Salon de 1846 to the \u201cbourgeois\u201d may well have been intended as ironic. Baudelaire wrote a positive and approving preface for Pierre Dupont\u2019s Chant des ouvriers (Song of the Workers, 1851), which praises the working man. He sought out Pierre-Joseph Prudhon, one of the great writers and thinkers of the 1848 revolution. With Champfleury, a journalist, novelist, and theoretician of the realist movement, he started a short-lived revolutionary newspaper after the provisional government was established. Most dramatically, he physically participated in the revolutions of February and June, actually fighting on a barricade and, according to some contemporaries\u2019 accounts, apparently shouting, \u201cIl faut aller fusiller le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Aupick\u201d (We must go shoot General Aupick).\n\nAlthough a school of criticism has grown up in which Baudelaire is labeled a revolutionary, it would be a mistake to reduce the life and thought of this complex man to political dogma. Baudelaire was undeniably fervent, but this fervor must be seen in the spirit of the times: the 19th-century Romantic leaned toward social justice because of the ideal of universal harmony but was not driven by the same impulse that fires the Marxist egalitarian. It is also possible, given Baudelaire\u2019s relationship with his stepfather and his famous cry on the barricades, that at least part of his zeal was motivated by personal feelings. Furthermore, even during this heady period Baudelaire never lost his critical acumen and spirit of contradiction. He rose repeatedly during speeches for the May 4 elections to interrupt idealistic speakers with pointed, embarrassing questions. In Mon coeur mis \u00e0 nu et Fus\u00e9es; journaux intimes (My Heart Laid Bare and Fus\u00e9es; Intimate Journals, 1909) he elaborates on the \u201civresse de 1848\u201d: \u201cDe quelle nature \u00e9tait cette ivresse? Go\u00fbt de la vengeance. Plaisir naturel de la d\u00e9molition (What was the nature of this drunkenness? A desire for vengeance. A natural pleasure in destruction).\n\nAfter Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1851, Baudelaire ceased all political activity. To the extent that he considered politics in his later years, his outlook was anti-egalitarian and anti-activist\u2014reminiscent of the aristrocratic conservatism represented by Poe and de Maistre, in other words: \u201cThere is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. ... A monarchy or a republic based upon democracy are equally absurd and feeble.\u201d For the most part, though, Baudelaire\u2019s Intimate Journals reveal his relative lack of interest in politics, his disillusionment with mankind and all of its institutions, and his ultimate faith in the classless aristocracy of the \u201cDandy.\u201d\n\nAfter a long period of incubation, of familial reproaches that he had wasted his life, and of a reputation based on potential, a few publications, and force of personality, Baudelaire came into his own as a literary personage in the 1850s. On 9 April 1851 eleven poems were published in the Messager de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e under the title \u201cLes Limbes\u201d (Limbo); these poems were later included in Les Fleurs du mal. In March and April 1852 Baudelaire\u2019s first major study of Poe was published in Revue de Paris. In \u201cEdgar Allan Poe, sa vie et ses ouvrages\u201d (Edgar Allan Poe, His Life and His Works) Baudelaire notes views that were probably influenced by de Maistre as well as brought out by Poe: belief in original sin; faith in the imagination, which Baudelaire called \u201cla reine des facult\u00e9s\u201d (the queen of faculties); approval of the cult of Beauty and of poetry for its own sake; and hatred for progress and nature.\n\nIn 1854 and 1855 Baudelaire\u2019s first translations of Poe\u2019s writings were published in Le Pays. A meticulous translator, Baudelaire was known to hunt down English-speaking sailors for maritime vocabulary. His translations of Poe culminated in Histoires extraordinaires (1856; Tales of Mystery and Imagination), which included \u201cEdgar Allan Poe, sa vie et ses ouvrages\u201d as a preface; Nouvelles Histoires extraordinaires (1856; New Tales of Mystery and Imagination); Aventures d\u2019Arthur Gordon Pym (1858; originally published as The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, 1838); Eureka (1863; originally published 1848); and Histoires grotesques et s\u00e9rieuses (1865; originally published as Tales of Grotesque and Arabesque, 1840).\n\nAlso in 1855 the Revue des deux mondes published eighteen poems with the title of Les Fleurs du mal. Two of Baudelaire\u2019s prose poems were published for the first time that same year in a festschrift, \u201cHommage \u00e0 C. F. Denecourt.\u201d The festschrift publication is particularly interesting because the prose poems were published alongside two poems in verse, so that \u201cCr\u00e9puscule du Soir\u201d (Dusk) appeared in verse and in prose.\n\nIn June of 1857 the first edition of Les Fleurs du mal was published by the fine letter press of Auguste Poulet-Malassis. Although Baudelaire considered publishing Les Fleurs du mal with the large printing house of Michel L\u00e9vy, which published his translations of Poe, he chose the smaller press of Poulet-Malassis out of a concern for quality. A tyrannical author, Baudelaire took rooms near the offices of his publishers so that he could better supervise the placement of every comma. The press was solicitous of Baudelaire\u2019s corrections, and Poulet-Malassis became a devoted friend: he lent Baudelaire large sums of money though he himself eventually went bankrupt and to debtor\u2019s prison for his own debts; he tended to Baudelaire during his last days in Brussels, though the writer had signed over Poulet-Malassis\u2019s legal rights on some works to the publisher Hetzel; and when on his deathbed Baudelaire chose L\u00e9vy to publish his Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes , Poulet-Malassis loyally rallied to the cause, ceding his legally exclusive rights to Baudelaire\u2019s works and doing what he could to help produce a satisfactory edition.\n\nAbout one month after Les Fleurs du mal went on sale in July 1857, a report was drawn up by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 Publique (Public Safety) section of the Ministry of the Interior stating that the collection was in contempt of the laws that safeguard religion and morality. Thirteen poems were singled out and put on trial. In contrast with the last time he went to court, when he acquiesced to the imposition of a conseil judiciaire, Baudelaire fought this battle to the last. The proceeding betrays some of the misunderstandings that have infected views of his poetry ever since.\n\nTo intercede with the government on his behalf Baudelaire made the unfortunate choice of Agla\u00e9 Sabatier, \u201cla Pr\u00e9sidente,\u201d a woman to whom he had been sending anonymous and admiring poems since 1852. The third muse for the trilogy of love cycles in Les Fleurs du mal, \u201cApollonie\u201d (as she was also known) was without great political influence, and her dubious social standing probably did not lend credibility to Baudelaire\u2019s claims for morality. Baudelaire\u2019s defense at the trial was threefold: that he had presented vice in such a way as to render it repellent to the reader; that if the poems are read as part of the larger collection, in a certain order, their moral context is revealed; and that his predecessors\u2014Alfred de Musset, Pierre-Jean B\u00e9ranger, George Sand, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac\u2014had written far more scandalously and gotten away with it. Baudelaire\u2019s lawyer unwisely emphasized the last point, which was easily dismissed: that others have gotten away with transgression does not justify one\u2019s own. Six of the poems were condemned\u2014the ban on them was not lifted until after World War II, on 31 May 1949\u2014and both Baudelaire and his editors were fined.\n\nThough the trial was an ordeal and certainly did not help improve the poet\u2019s relations with his mother (General Aupick was dead by this time), the trial was not ultimately detrimental to Baudelaire. The condemned poems were excised, and the book went back on sale. Baudelaire subsequently achieved a certain notoriety, for better and for worse. For the better, Les Fleurs du mal got good reviews from critics that counted. Emile Deschamps, a founding father of 1830s Romanticism, published a poem in praise of the collection in Le Pr\u00e9sent . Gustave Flaubert, who had endured a similar trial for Madame Bovary (1857), wrote to Baudelaire on 13 July 1858 that \u201cVous avez trouv\u00e9 moyen de rajeunir le romantisme. Vous ne ressemblez \u00e0 personne (ce qui est la premi\u00e8re de toutes les qualit\u00e9s). ... Vous \u00eates r\u00e9sistant comme le marbre et p\u00e9n\u00e9trant comme un brouillard d\u2019Angleterre\u201d (You have found a way to inject new life into Romanticism. You are unlike anyone else [which is the most important quality]. ... You are as resistant as marble and as penetrating as an English fog). On 30 August 1887 Hugo wrote to Baudelaire that his flowers of evil were as \u201cradiant\u201d and \u201cdazzling\u201d as stars. In contrast, the influential Sainte-Beuve maintained a significant silence. There were many negative reviews by lesser critics, but none that affected Baudelaire\u2019s reputation.\n\nFor the worse, Baudelaire\u2019s legend as a po\u00e8te maudit (cursed poet) exploded at this time, and Baudelaire, as always, contributed to this reputation by shocking people with elaborate eccentricities. He invited people over to see riding breeches supposedly cut from his father\u2019s hide, for example, or in the middle of a conversation casually asked a friend, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be agreeable to take a bath with me?\u201d It is difficult to sort out which stories about Baudelaire are true and which are fictive\u2014later on someone apparently thought that Baudelaire had actually gotten unreasonably angry with a poor window-glazier, misconstruing the prose poem \u201cLe Mauvais Vitrier\u201d (The Bad Glazier) as reality. Baudelaire\u2019s legend as a po\u00e8te maudit obscured his profound complexity, and Charles Asselineau\u2019s preface to Charles Baudelaire, sa vie et son oeuvre (Charles Baudelaire, His Life and Work, 1869), the first biography of the poet, only sealed his notorious image by passing on the more infamous anecdotes.\n\nAnother effect of the condemnation of Les Fleurs du mal is that the excision of six poems probably prompted Baudelaire to write the new and wonderful poems published in the collection\u2019s second edition of 1861. After the trial he experienced a surge of creative activity. In Baudelaire in 1859 (1988) Burton posits that this rebirth of energy had to do with a reconciliation with his mother. General Aupick had died in April of 1857, and in 1858 Baudelaire switched from the formal vous to the more intimate tu in addressing his mother. He wrote several of the important poems in the second edition\u2014including \u201cLe Voyage\u201d (The Voyage) and \u201cLa Chevelure\u201d (The Head of Hair)\u2014in 1859, during a long stay at Honfleur in the \u201cMaison Joujou\u201d (Playhouse) of his mother. Whatever the reason for this literary activity, Baudelaire wrote thirty-five new poems between 1857 and 1861, adding \u201cTableaux Parisiens\u201d to the already existing sections of Les Fleurs du mal and creating more or less the definitive version of the collection.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s only collection of verse is composed of six sections: \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al\u201d (Spleen and the Ideal), \u201cTableaux Parisiens\u201d (Parisian Tableaus), \u201cLe Vin\u201d (Wine), \u201cFleurs du mal\u201d (Flowers of Evil), \u201cR\u00e9volte\u201d (Revolt), and \u201cLa Mort\u201d (Death). In the trial of his poems Baudelaire had argued that there was an \u201carchitecture\u201d that organized the meaning of his work, and this organizing principle has been the subject of debate among critics. There is certainly a progression from \u201cAu lecteur\u201d (To the Reader), the poem that serves as the frontispiece, to \u201cLe Voyage,\u201d the final poem.\n\n\u201cAu lecteur\u201d invites the reader into the collection by portraying regretful yet irresistible corruption and ennui while forcing the reader into complicity with its well-known conclusion: \u201c\u2014Hypocrite lecteur,\u2014mon semblable,\u2014mon fr\u00e8re!\u201d (Hypocritical reader, my mirror-image, my brother!). Intervening poems explore various facets of the poet\u2019s experience, many of which represent struggles with what Blaise Pascal called the \u201cgouffre\u201d (the abyss). \u201cLe Voyage\u201d surveys the disappointed hopes of speakers who have traveled far and wide only to find what \u201cAu lecteur\u201d had promised, \u201cUne oasis d\u2019horreur dans un d\u00e9sert d\u2019ennui\u201d (An oasis of horror in a desert of tedium). The final cry of this poem, \u201cNous voulons ... / Plonger ... / Au fond de l\u2019Inconnu pour trouver du nouveau\u201d (We want ... / To plunge ... / To the bottom of the Unknown in order to find something new), is addressed to death and is ambiguous: it either launches the collection\u2019s journey on a new course from that set in \u201cAu lecteur,\u201d thus possibly concluding Les Fleurs du mal on a note of optimism, or it ends the poem\u2019s quest in death. In either case, there is clearly a movement toward closure, and perhaps resolution, in Les Fleurs du mal. Reading the poems by following too rigorous a system would do injustice to them, however. Although there is a general sense of progression in Les Fleurs du mal, individual works do not always fit the pattern assigned to their part in the collection.\n\nIn similar fashion, though Baudelaire\u2019s legend glossed him as the satanic poet of ennui, sordid details, and forbidden sensuality, in fact his poetry treats a variety of themes with a range of perspectives. He does deal with topics that fueled his scandalous reputation. As \u201cAu lecteur\u201d promised, the collection is dominated by the poet\u2019s Catholic sense of original sin. \u201cLe Mauvais Moine\u201d (The Bad Monk), in the section \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al,\u201d describes the poet as a \u201cmauvais c\u00e9nobite\u201d (a bad monk) who is trapped in the \u201codious\u201d grave of his soul. Redemption, given this situation, appears hopeless: \u201c\u2018 moine fain\u00e9ant! Quand saurai-je donc faire / Du spectacle vivant de ma triste mis\u00e8re / Le travail de mes mains et l\u2019amour de mes yeux? (O lazy monk! When will I ever know how to turn / the living spectacle of my sad misery / into the work of my hands and love of my eyes?) Many poems echo this expression of futility for man\u2019s spiritual condition, especially in \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al\u201d and notably in the four \u201cSpleen\u201d poems (LXXV, LXXVI, LXXVII, LXXVIII) within that section. While some poems end without hope, however\u2014\u201cSpleen LXXVIII\u201d concludes with \u201catrocious\u201d Anxiety staking the poet\u2019s skull with a black flag\u2014others betray the desire to break out of imprisonment in sin. \u201cLe Mauvais Moine\u201d concludes by expressing that wish (\u201cWhen will I ever know how ... ?\u201d), though it is in the tenuous form of a question.\n\nFor Baudelaire, the love of Beauty and sensual love are two specific examples of man\u2019s capacity for original sin. In Les Fleurs du mal Beauty is a compelling but often terrible phenomenon described in terms of hard, lifeless matter. Even the woman of \u201cLe Serpent qui danse\u201d (The Snake Which Dances), a poem about movement, has eyes that are \u201cdeux bijoux froids o\u00f9 se m\u00eale / L\u2019or avec le fer\u201d (two cold jewels where / Gold mixes with iron), and Beauty of \u201cLa Beaut\u00e9\u201d (Beauty) is like \u201cun r\u00eave de pierre\u201d (a dream of stone) that inspires love \u201c\u00e9ternel et muet ainsi que la mati\u00e8re\u201d (as eternal and mute as matter). The power of this inhuman Beauty is terrible. \u201cLa Beaut\u00e9\u201d reduces the poet to a \u201cdocile\u201d lover who is virtually chained to his idol. \u201cHymne \u00e0 la Beaut\u00e9\u201d (Hymn to Beauty) concludes with the same helpless devotion to Beauty\u2019s powers of distraction and more explicitly articulates Beauty\u2019s dual nature: her look is \u201cinfernal et divin\u201d (infernal and divine), and the poet is so addicted that he does not care whether She comes from Heaven, Hell, or both.\n\nBaudelaire does not just treat Beauty as an abstract phenomenon; he also writes about individual women. Baudelaire\u2019s three love cycles reflect his experiences with three different women\u2014Duval, Daubrun, and Mme Sabatier\u2014and discussions of his love poems are often organized around the poems associated with each woman. It is not always clear, however, which poems are associated with whom.\n\nJeanne Duval was a mixed-race person and a sometime actress who, according to Baudelaire, did not understand and in fact undermined his poetry and whose attraction was powerfully physical. Baudelaire met Duval in the early 1840s and lived with her periodically, but by the late 1840s he was writing to his mother that life with her had become a duty and a torment. Nonetheless, it was not until 1856 that they broke up; the rupture was at her instigation, and even afterward Baudelaire continued to support her financially: as usual, his was not the conventional response to a situation.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s relations with Marie Daubrun were less extended. She was a blonde, Rubenesque actress who seems never seriously to have reciprocated Baudelaire\u2019s fascination for her. Baudelaire had met her in the late 1840s or early 1850s but probably did not become intimately involved with her until around 1854. Their sporadic connection ended when Marie left Baudelaire to go back to Th\u00e9odore de Banville.\n\nApollonie Sabatier represented a different sort of attraction from that of Jeanne and Marie. \u201cLa Pr\u00e9sidente\u201d had been a model and the mistress of various men, one of whom left her a stipend that secured her independence. Her position as an independent woman who had a history with men placed her in the demimonde, the \u201chalf-world\u201d that is neither part of \u201cle monde,\u201d the world of social acceptability and prominence, nor part of the underworld of prostitutes. She was much admired as a tasteful, witty, intelligent woman, and her social evenings were attended by artists such as Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Maxime Du Camp, Ernest Feydeau, and Flaubert. Baudelaire\u2019s feelings for Mme Sabatier started as admiration from afar: he sent her anonymous letters accompanied by poems. Eventually he revealed his identity to her. When she finally responded to him, however, he dropped her with a letter in which he tells her that her capitulation, whether it was physical or emotional, had turned her from a Goddess into \u201ca mere woman.\u201d Despite the direct stares of Nadar\u2019s famous photographs, Baudelaire\u2019s was a complex personality. On the one hand he experienced animal love and a sense of duty with Jeanne; on the other hand he felt platonic love for Mme Sabatier and yet he betrayed her. His relations with women were far from entirely pleasant.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s complicated experiences with these women and with others undoubtedly shaped his poetry about them. Some readers view Baudelaire as a mere sensualist and in some poems he certainly does celebrate the sensuality of women, of scent, and of sensation, but it is important to note that his poetic descriptions of women are multidimensional. Although there are extremely sensual poems, such as \u201cParfum Exotique\u201d (Exotic Perfume), \u201cLa Chevelure\u201d (The Head of Hair), and \u201cL\u2019Invitation au Voyage\u201d (Invitation to a Voyage), Baudelaire also wrote poems, such as those dedicated to Beauty, in which a woman is admired as a hopelessly unattainable object of art\u2014\u201d Je t\u2019adore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne\u201d (I Adore You as the Vaulted Night Is High), for example, or \u201cAvec ses v\u00eatements ondoyants et nacr\u00e9s\u201d (With Her Undulating and Pearly Garments).\n\nIndeed, contrary to the stereotype of Baudelaire as a lustful idolater, in many of his sensual poems he alchemizes the physical elements of the woman into an ethereal substance. The ultimate importance of \u201cla chevelure\u201d is as a source of memories, and in \u201cParfum Exotique\u201d the initial scent of the woman\u2019s breast becomes the exotic perfume of an imaginary island. When Baudelaire idolizes the woman as a form of art, similarly, by the end of most poems the woman\u2019s body is conspicuous by its removal. In \u201cJe t\u2019adore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne\u201d the speaker tells the woman that he loves her \u201cd\u2019autant plus, belle, que tu me fuis\u201d (all the more, beautiful one, when you flee me). The image of \u201cla froide majest\u00e9 d\u2019une femme st\u00e9rile\u201d (the cold majesty of a sterile woman) in \u201cAvec ses v\u00eatements ondoyants et nacr\u00e9s\u201d does not invite embraces.\n\nFor Baudelaire, as for the English metaphysical poets, the human struggle starts with the flesh but ultimately takes place on the metaphysical plane. Woman, on this level, represents good or evil. Some poems portray the woman as demonic, in the tradition of \u201cHymne \u00e0 la Beaut\u00e9.\u201d In \u201cSed non Satiata\u201d (But she is Not Satisfied), the speaker cries to the woman: \u201c\u2018 d\u00e9mon sans piti\u00e9! verse-moi moins de flamme\u201d (O pitiless demon! Throw me less fire). \u201cLe Vampire\u201d (The Vampire) is about the symbiosis of the vampire woman and the enslaved poet. Other poems\u2014these are usually the ones associated with Mme Sabatier\u2014represent the woman as a redemptive angel against a somber background. The play between light and dark in these poems ranges from the simple to the complex. In \u201cReversibilit\u00e9\u201d (Reversibility) there is a simple counterpoint between the \u201cAnge plein de bonheur, de joie et de lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Angel full of happiness, of joy, and of lights) and the tortured speaker. A more complex interplay between light and dark occurs in \u201cAube Spirituelle\u201d (Spiritual Dawn) when the monstrance-like memory of the woman shines against a backdrop of the sun drowning in its congealing blood. Such complexity is again evident in \u201cConfession,\u201d when the \u201caimable et douce femme\u201d (amiable and sweet woman) confesses her \u201chorrible\u201d lack of faith in humanity.\n\nBehind Baudelaire\u2019s struggles with sin and ennui is an articulated awareness of Satan, notably in the section \u201cR\u00e9volte.\u201d \u201cLe Reniement de Saint Pierre\u201d (St. Peter\u2019s Denial) concludes with the speaker congratulating Peter for denying Jesus. In \u201cAbel et Ca\u00efn\u201d the narrative voice urges Cain to ascend to heaven and throw God to earth. \u201cLes Litanies de Satan\u201d (The Litanies of Satan) is addressed to Satan and has the refrain \u201c\u2018 Satan, prends piti\u00e9 de ma triste mis\u00e8re!\u201d (O Satan, have pity on my sad misery!). These are strong poems, understandably shocking to the readers of his day, but Baudelaire\u2019s struggles with evil do not ally him with Satan. In his poetry Baudelaire represents himself as trapped and cries out in a despair that suggests his awareness of sin as a burden. Baudelaire is not a diabolic preacher; with C. S. Lewis, he would point out that Satan is part of the Christian cosmology.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s \u201cDoctrine of Correspondences\u201d suggests a belief of sorts in a pattern for the world and in relationships between the physical world and a spiritual one. This view, probably influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg and viewed as an antecedent to symbolism, is presented in the poem \u201cCorrespondances.\u201d Nature is presented as a \u201ctemple\u201d whose living pillars speak to man and whose \u201cforest of symbols\u201d (for\u00eat de symboles) observe him. Baudelaire writes that \u201cLes parfums, les couleurs, et les sons se r\u00e9pondent\u201d (Perfumes, colors, and sounds interact with each other) like echoes in a \u201ct\u00e9n\u00e9breuse et profonde unit\u00e9\u201d (dark and deep unity). Although he does not include a direct expression of faith in God or gods in the poem, Baudelaire\u2019s profoundly mystical belief in the world\u2019s fundamental unity is clear. \u201cCorrespondances\u201d epitomizes Baudelaire\u2019s complicated spirituality.\n\nIndeed, the subject of Baudelaire\u2019s faith has been much debated. The references to God and to Satan in his poems, letters, and intimate journals have been counted; the validity of his last rites has been weighed; his confession of faith to Nadar has been examined. Most critics agree that Baudelaire\u2019s preoccupations are fundamentally Christian but that in Les Fleurs du mal he fails to embrace entirely Jesus Christ and his power of redemption. Debates about Baudelaire\u2019s Christianity have not resolved the matter, though, nor is a label for Baudelaire\u2019s faith necessarily desirable for reading his poetry. Les Fleurs du mal is best read on its own terms, with a respect for its complexity. The constant thrust of the collection is to impart to the reader an awareness of tension between the physically real and the spiritually ideal, of a hopeless but ever-renewed aspiration toward the infinite from an existence mired in sin on earth. This thrust is evident in poems in which the speaker bemoans enslavement to the soul\u2019s \u201cgouffre\u201d (abyss) or to Beauty\u2019s fascinations, in which he cries out to Satan in rage, in which he delves into the sensual to escape the physical world, and in which he articulates a feeble hope in love\u2019s redemptive capacity and the possibility of unity.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s ambiguous relationship with the material world and his desire for another world are evident in his poems about the city of Paris. While some critics, notably Edward Kaplan, have argued that \u201cTableaux Parisiens,\u201d the section added to the edition of 1861, shows a \u201cconversion to the real world as it exists,\u201d critics such as F. W. Leakey have pointed out that in these poems Baudelaire treats the city the way he treats the female body in \u201cJe t\u2019adore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne,\u201d that is, by moving away from it as a physical presence. \u201cPaysage\u201d (Landscape) invokes concrete details of Paris\u2014\u201dLes tuyaux, les clochers, ces m\u00e2ts de la cit\u00e9\u201d (the pipes, the bells, the masts of the city)\u2014but the poem concludes with the poet behind closed shutters, his head on his desk, resolving to make \u201cde mes pensers br\u00fblants une ti\u00e8de atmosph\u00e8re\u201d (a warm atmosphere from my burning thoughts).\n\nIn \u201cLe Soleil\u201d (The Sun) the poet walks the streets of Paris, but he appears to see the city as a literary text rather than on its physical terms. He goes \u201cFlairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime, / Tr\u00e9buchant sur les mots comme sur les pav\u00e9s\u201d (Seeking out the hazards of rhyme in all corners / Stumbling on words as on cobblestones). \u201cLe Cygne\u201d (The Swan) is a magnificent poem that records the changes wrought in Paris by the Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann. Although he accumulates concrete details, Baudelaire again removes himself from the physical presence he is recording by recasting what he sees: \u201cJe ne vois qu\u2019en esprit tout ce camp de baraques . . .\u201d (I see all these barracks ... only in spirit) and \u201ctout pour moi devient all\u00e9gorie\u201d (everything becomes an allegory for me). Baudelaire\u2019s reputation as the father of modern poetry about cities is largely based on the \u201cTableaux Parisiens,\u201d which describe the streets of Paris in such gritty detail; the importance of these street scenes for the poet, though, is that he usually plunges into them with the desire to transcend them.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s theory of correspondences and his introduction of such topics as the city and the ugly side of man\u2019s nature to poetry in verse are responsible for the modern quality of Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire also deals with a variety of themes in the Romantic tradition, however, including solitude; the mal de si\u00e8cle, which in Baudelaire\u2019s terms becomes ennui; the special plight of the poet; introspection; yearnings for the infinite; and romance. Furthermore, Baudelaire\u2019s prosody is traditional: his alexandrines are no more loosened than those of the Romantics, and he uses a wide variety of classical forms.\n\nEven in his treatment of Romantic themes, however, Baudelaire is radical for his time. He imagines solitude not as a state of nature but as it happens in cities, presenting it in counterpoint to city crowds. The person who experiences ennui, as opposed to mal de si\u00e8cle, is mercilessly self-aware and is troubled by original sin and a divided self. For Baudelaire the poet is endowed with special powers but is also a clumsy albatross (\u201cL\u2019Albatros\u201d) or slothful sinner (\u201cLe Mauvais Moine\u201d). No longer mournful meditation in picturesque settings, introspection turns ugly with Baudelaire, a guilty pleasure to be squeezed like \u201cune vieille orange\u201d (an old orange), as Baudelaire asserts in \u201cAu Lecteur.\u201d The infinite is no longer the divine perceived in stars; it is found in the expansiveness of scents, in the imagination, in poetry, in cold-hearted Beauty, in the desire to escape.\n\nTo traditional forms and traditional themes Baudelaire brought imagery and situations that had never before existed in French poetry. \u201cUne Charogne\u201d (A Cadaver) provides an excellent example of how Baudelaire uses Romantic and even classical themes to go beyond them. The poet takes a walk with his beloved and concludes that, although time passes, his poetry will immortalize her. Unlike Pierre de Ronsard\u2019s poem on that classical theme, \u201cQuand tu seras bien vielle\u201d (When You Are Very Old), however, Baudelaire\u2019s meditation is prompted by a human cadaver whose guts spill across the page, the poem graphically detailing the flies, vermin, and stink. The speaker instructs his beloved that when she, too, is a rotting corpse, she should tell the vermin\u2014who will eat her with kisses\u2014that \u201cj\u2019ai gard\u00e9 la forme et l\u2019essence divine / De mes amours d\u00e9compos\u00e9s!\u201d (I have maintained the form and divine essence / Of my decomposed loves!). Just as he exploits grotesque physical details only to extract from them an \u201cessence divine,\u201d so Baudelaire uses poetic convention while transforming it.\n\nSimilarly, Baudelaire\u2019s use and mastery of traditional technique revolutionized French poetry by so clearly representing a unique sensibility. In \u201cLe Cygne,\u201d a poem detailing the poet\u2019s thoughts as he walks through a changing Paris, Baudelaire sensitively communicates modern anxiety and a modern sense of displacement. The poem begins with an abrupt exclamation, \u201cAndromaque, je pense \u00e0 vous!\u201d (Andromache, I am thinking of you!). A series of repetitions compounds the initial sense of urgency. The frequent recurrence of the verb je pense \u00e0 (I am thinking about), though, also indicates the meditative nature of the poem; the repetition of words such as l\u00e0 (there)\u2014along with a myriad of sharp descriptions\u2014show that meditation interacts with the speaker\u2019s close observations. Syntax broken across stanzas conveys the reach of the poet\u2019s thoughts and observations as well as a sense of breathless haste.\n\nThe speaker returns to the same thoughts\u2014notably, a swan escaped from a zoo and Andromache, the wife of the Trojan hero Hector\u2014and the use of exclamation points is heavy: he is obsessed and slightly frantic. The gist of the speaker\u2019s meditations is that he is haunted by absences: by Paris as it is no longer, by the swan who has lost his native soil, by Andromache\u2019s losses. Those absences are present in this poem by virtue of Baudelaire\u2019s prosody. Andromache\u2019s fall into destitution is represented in the space caused by the enjambment between stanzas: \u201c \u2026 et puis [je pense] \u00e0 vous / Andromaque, des bras d\u2019un grand \u00e9poux tomb\u00e9e\u201d (And I think of you, / Andromache, fallen from the arms of a great husband). The lament of all who have suffered losses is emphasized by an enjambment that forces a quick draw of breath right before the end of the sentence and that accents the finality of \u201cjamais\u201d (never) at the beginning of the next sentence:\n\n\u201cJe pense . . .\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\u00c0 quiconque a perdu ce qui ne se retrouve\n\nJamais, jamais!\u201d\n\n(I think . . .\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n\nOf whomever has lost that which can\n\nNever, never be found again!).\n\n\n\nIn Les Fleurs du mal traditional prosody and themes combine with novel thoughts and inspiration to create works of supreme originality.\n\n\n\nAlthough there were not many reviews of the second edition of Les Fleurs du mal and not all of those published were favorable, Baudelaire became an established poet with its publication. Saint-Beuve\u2014though he never did review Les Fleurs du mal\u2014ranked him grudgingly among the leaders of a new generation of poets as he remarked that poets coming along seemed to be in the style of Hugo, Gautier, Banville, and \u201ceven Baudelaire.\u201d Younger poets started to dedicate poems to Baudelaire. Charles Asselineau in Charles Baudelaire: Sa vie et son oeuvre (1869) describes Baudelaire as accepted and blossoming with success after 1861. On the strength of that success, in fact, Baudelaire attempted an application to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1861, seeking\u2014many thought ironically\u2014the place of Henri Lacordaire, a Roman Catholic priest. The taint of the trial and of his reputation was too strong, though, and Baudelaire thought it prudent to let his candidacy drop before he met with certain failure.\n\nIn the 1860s Baudelaire diversified from poetry in verse to literary activity in several different spheres. He wrote Les Paradis artificiels, Opium et Haschisch (The Artificial Paradise, Opium and Hashish, 1860), in which he resumes the interest in drugs that he had first explored in 1851 with Du Vin et du haschisch (On Wine and Hashish), an article published in Le Messager del\u2019Assembl\u00e9e. He also wrote seven articles for Jacques Cr\u00e9pet\u2019s Les Po\u00e8tes Fran\u00e7ais (French Poets, 1862), including pieces on Hugo, Gautier, and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. These essays were published later along with others in Curiosit\u00e9s esth\u00e9tiques . The note on Baudelaire in Cr\u00e9pet\u2019s volume, written by Gautier, was fairly positive. This anthology established contact between Baudelaire and his first major biographer, Cr\u00e9pet.\n\nBaudelaire also continued with essay projects on topics of miscellaneous artistic interest, for example, the expression of his admiration for Wagner in 1861, Richard Wagner et \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d \u00e0 Paris, and a valedictory tribute to Delacroix in 1863. The most significant of these essays was his definitive article on modern art. Around 1859 Baudelaire met the sketch artist Constantin Guys and began writing \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d (The Painter of Modern Life). This essay, ultimately published in Le Figaro in 1863, brings to fruition his ideas about \u201cl\u2019h\u00e9ro\u00efsme de la vie moderne\u201d (the heroism of modern life) first expressed in Salon de 1845 and Salon de 1846. Where in the Salon de 1846 Baudelaire discusses the duality of art in general terms, in \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d that duality specifically defines art\u2019s modernity: \u201cLa modernit\u00e9, c\u2019est le transitoire, le fugitif, le contingent, la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019art, dont l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 est l\u2019\u00e9ternel et l\u2019immuable\u201d (Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, half of art, the other half of which is eternal and immutable). Art is composed of the eternal and the contingent; modernity\u2014which can occur in every historic era\u2014is a function of finite particulars \u201cqui sera, si l\u2019on veut, tour \u00e0 tour ou tout ensemble, l\u2019\u00e9poque, la mode, la morale, la passion\u201d (which, if you like, will be one by one or simultaneously the era, fashion, morals, passion). Baudelaire illustrates these principles by discussing in detail the interests and techniques of \u201cCG,\u201d his designation for the artist who wished to remain anonymous, from his brush stroke to his Crimean War drawings for the Illustrated London News.\n\nCentral to Baudelaire\u2019s estimation of Guys is that Guys is not an artist but is, rather, a man of the world. For Baudelaire, a broad interest in the world as opposed to the restricted perspective that he associates with most \u201cartistes\u201d is crucial to interesting art. Along with this line of thought Baudelaire elaborates his notion of the dandy, who is not only the elegant dresser of usual associations but also a man of the world who lives according to the highest aesthetic principles. Baudelaire also develops his ideas about \u201cla foule,\u201d the crowd, which is the solitary artist\u2019s domain \u201cas water is for the fish.\u201d He devotes an entire section to the aspects of modern life that the true artist must absorb: military life, the dandy, cars, women, prostitutes, and even makeup.\n\nIn that last section, \u201cEloge du Maquillage\u201d (In Praise of Makeup), Baudelaire makes explicit two more concepts that are important to his ethos. First, true to the metaphysical import of flesh already described in his poetry, Baudelaire makes it clear that for him there is a spiritual dimension to physical rituals: he speaks of \u201cla haute spiritualit\u00e9 de la toilette\u201d (the high spirituality of the toilet) and states that fashion must be considered \u201cun sympt\u00f4me du go\u00fbt de l\u2019id\u00e9al\u201d (a symptom of a taste for the ideal). Second, as a corollary to the importance he attaches to fashion, makeup, and the codes of the dandy, Baudelaire touches on his unromantic distaste for the natural. Everything beautiful is beautiful by calculation, he opines. Art is necessary to correct the natural state of man, which on the physical level is unattractive and on the spiritual level is a state of original sin. By the early 1860s Baudelaire had found a model for his ideals in the person of Guys, and he gave full expression to his artistic aesthetic in \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne.\u201d\n\nBaudelaire continued with scattered publications of poetry in the 1860s. In 1862 he published 20 prose poems in La Presse . This landmark year marks a shift in his creative endeavors from poetry in verse to poetry in prose: thereafter most of his creative publications are prose poems. Baudelaire managed to write only fifty of the one hundred prose poems he had projected. These poems were posthumously collected in 1869 as Petits po\u00e8mes en prose (Little Poems in Prose) and published with Les Paradis artificiels; later they were published by the better known title Le Spleen de Paris, petits po\u00e8mes en prose (The Spleen of Paris, Little Poems in Prose, 1917). Le Spleen de Paris is, as Baudelaire would say, a \u201csingular\u201d assemblage of works that represents an extremely ambitious literary project. In his correspondence he refers to the prose poems as a \u201cpendant\u201d (a completion of) to Les Fleurs du mal. He explains in what senses Le Spleen de Paris completes Les Fleurs du mal when he articulates his ambitions for the prose poems in \u201cA Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye,\u201d a letter that became the preface to the collection. Houssaye was the editor of L\u2019Artiste and La Presse , which published some of the prose poems individually.\n\nIn \u201cA Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye\u201d Baudelaire is careful to point out that the main predecessor for the genre of prose poetry was Aloysius Bertrand\u2019s Gaspard de la Nuit (Gaspard of the Night, 1842), a relatively little-known work about gothic scenes in Paris. Bertrand did not label his short pieces \u201cprose poems,\u201d though: Baudelaire is the first poet to make a radical break with the form of verse by identifying nonmetrical compositions as poetry. Baudelaire offered a tantalizing statement about his goals for the new form: \u201cQuel est celui de nous qui n\u2019a pas, dans ses jours d\u2019ambition, r\u00eav\u00e9 le miracle d\u2019une prose po\u00e9tique, musicale sans rythme et sans rime, assez souple et assez heurt\u00e9e pour s\u2019adapter aux mouvements lyriques de l\u2019\u00e2me, aux ondulations de la r\u00eaverie, aux soubresauts de la conscience?\u201d (Who among us has not, in his days of ambition, dreamed the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple and agile enough to adapt to the lyrical movements of the soul, to the undulations of daydreams, to the leaps of consciousness?).\n\nHaving mastered the forms of traditional verse, Baudelaire wanted to do nothing less than create a new language. Unlike Bertrand\u2019s \u201cpicturesque\u201d topics, Baudelaire associates his new language with the modern topic of the city. In \u201cA Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye\u201d he states that the ideal that obsesses him is born \u201csurtout de la fr\u00e9quentation des villes \u00e9normes, ... du croisement de leurs innombrables rapports\u201d (especially from frequenting large cities, ... from the interconnection of their innumerable points of relationship). In contrast with the \u201carchitecture\u201d of Les Fleurs du mal, these interconnections are presented without order. The work has \u201cni queue ni t\u00eate, puisque tout, au contraire, y est \u00e0 la fois t\u00eate et queue, alternativement et r\u00e9ciproquement\u201d (neither tail nor head because, on the contrary, everything is at once head and tail, alternately and reciprocally). Le Spleen de Paris is modern in that it represents a break with traditional form, is about urban life, and is consciously without order.\n\nIt is worth noting that in his preface Baudelaire refers to the form of the work as \u201cprose lyrique.\u201d He does not in the collection refer to the works as poems in prose, and the title, Le Spleen de Paris, petits po\u00e8mes en prose was chosen after Baudelaire\u2019s death by editors and critics. It is true that critics chose this title from titles that Baudelaire considered in his correspondence, and that in his correspondence Baudelaire most often refers to his endeavours as \u201cpo\u00e8mes en prose.\u201d Among the most significant challenges posed by Le Spleen de Paris, though, are the questions surrounding its form: is this poetry? Did Baudelaire succeed in his ambition to forge a new poetic language? In her classic tome on prose poetry Le Po\u00e8me en prose du Baudelaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nos jours (The Prose Poem from Baudelaire to the Present, 1959) Suzanne Bernard defined the important characteristics of the genre: \u201cl\u2019unit\u00e9, la gratuit\u00e9, la bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 (unity, gratuitousness, and brevity). Most critics have tended to discuss the themes of the poems rather than their form, however, accepting poetry in Baudelaire\u2019s wake as an attitude rather than a set of rules. This collection, which has been growing in popularity among critics, still contains much to be explored.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s poems in prose are short anecdotes, bitter satires, and reveries about unusual topics, including dogs, mud, aged tumblers, windows, widows, and poor people standing outside fancy eating establishments. Several critics, notably Pierre Emmanuel, have noted that there is more compassion in these works than in Baudelaire\u2019s poetry in verse. This compassion can take strange forms\u2014the speaker of \u201cLes Yeux des pauvres\u201d (The Eyes of the Poor) is so moved by a family of poor people that he hates the companion he had loved for her lack of sympathy. \u201cAssommons les Pauvres\u201d (Let\u2019s Knock Out the Poor) concludes with the speaker sharing his purse with a beggar, but it is after having beaten him like \u201ccooks who want to tenderize a steak.\u201d\n\nIt is true, though, that whereas Baudelaire most often offers visions of beauty in Les Fleurs du mal, he commonly and sympathetically treats the poor in Le Spleen de Paris. In fact, the speaker in \u201cMademoiselle Bistouri\u201d concludes by praying to God\u2014as opposed to the devil\u2014to have pity on crazy people. Furthermore, while many of the prose poems are about ugliness, they often accept and possibly even transcend ugliness. \u201cUn cheval de race\u201d (A Thoroughbred) is about a woman well past her prime who is \u201cbien laide\u201d (very ugly) but \u201cd\u00e9licieuse pourtant\u201d (nonetheless beautiful). In \u201cPerte d\u2019aur\u00e9ole\u201d (The Lost Halo) the speaker loses his \u201chalo\u201d in the mud, but concludes that he is better off without it and that the halo is actually much better suited to \u201csome bad poet.\u201d\n\nWhile the speaker in the poems of Les Fleurs du mal sought escape, in the prose poem \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0!\u201d Baudelaire describes a speaker who had escaped on a boat that then returned to shore. At first he alone among the passengers is regretful, but in the last paragraph of the poem he celebrates \u201cla terre avec ses bruits, ses passions, ses commodit\u00e9s, ses f\u00eates;\u201d (earth with its sounds, its passions, its conveniences, its celebrations). As with Les Fleurs du mal, it would be a mistake to pigeonhole the poems in this collection, which unlike his first has no headings. There are some harsh, disturbing poems in Le Spleen de Paris \u2014\u201cLe G\u00e2teau\u201d (The Cake), for example, which is about a fratricidal war between two natives over a piece of cake. As critics have noticed from the very beginning, however, the prose poems address banalities and travails of life quite differently from Les Fleurs du mal.\n\nIt is not coincidental that Baudelaire\u2019s departure from traditional form and his exploring new themes occurred in chronological conjunction with \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne.\u201d Certainly, Baudelaire\u2019s break with traditional notions of poetry had a far-reaching effect on subsequent poetry, from Arthur Rimbaud\u2019s Les Illuminations (1886) to modernist experimentation with form. In fact, Henri Peyre, an eminent scholar of French poetry, argues in Connaissance de Baudelaire (1951) that Le Spleen de Paris has had a greater influence on poetry than Les Fleurs du mal. This conclusion is surprising because it is only relatively recently that Baudelaire\u2019s prose poetry has attracted critical attention, but few critics have disagreed with Peyre. Le Spleen de Paris undoubtedly has had a significant influence on modern poetry.\n\nDuring the period in which he was seriously exploring prose poetry, Baudelaire experienced a series of financial disasters. He had sold his writings to Poulet-Malassis, who had gone bankrupt in 1862. La Presse stopped publishing his poetry in prose. He had signed over to Michel L\u00e9vy sole ownership for his translations of Poe for 2,000 francs, so he lost a regular income; furthermore, he could not get Lacroix and Verboeckhoven, another printing house based in Brussels, interested in his work. These circumstances led Baudelaire to travel to Brussels, where he hoped to earn money with a lecture series and to make contact with Victor Hugo\u2019s publisher, Lacroix et Verboeckhoven.\n\nBaudelaire arrived in Brussels on April 24, 1864 and checked into the Hotel du Grand Miroir, where he stayed, enduring a miserable sojourn, until his stroke in 1866. His lecture series was a failure: he got less money for the lectures than he was expecting, and though his first lecture got a good review, the rest were described by those who attended as disasters because of Baudelaire\u2019s stage fright. Baudelaire describes his last attempt to lecture in excruciating terms: there were three enormous drawing rooms, lit with chandeliers and candelabras, decorated with superb paintings, a \u201cprofusion\u201d of cake and wine\u2014and all for 10 or 12 people. He did not even bother to deliver the entire talk. In addition to the disappointment of the lecture series, Baudelaire did not make contact with Lacroix, who never accepted his invitations. Also, Baudelaire found the culture and climate of Belgium stifling, so stifling that while there he began writing a vitriolic indictment of the country titled \u201cPauvre Belgique!,\u201d which was pubblished in Oeuvres posthumes et correspondances in\u00e9dites (1887).\n\nDespite his unhappy situation, Baudelaire stayed on in Belgium, perhaps because he was hoping for a satirical book to come out of the stay, perhaps because he did not want to return to France without something to show for the trip, or perhaps because he could not pay his hotel bill. His time in Belgium was not in fact wasted: Poulet-Malassis had emigrated there to escape creditors in France, and with his help Baudelaire published Les \u00c9paves (The Wreckage, 1866), in which he assembled the condemned poems and other pieces left out of the French edition of Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire also became acquainted with Mme Hugo, even becoming a regular visitor at her home, and made contacts with local artists, notably with the engraver F\u00e9licien Rops.\n\nWhile visiting the Rops family, Baudelaire collapsed during a trip to the Eglise Saint-Loup on March 15, 1866. Baudelaire\u2019s health had been deteriorating for some time. There was no effective cure for syphilis in his day, and so although he thought he was cured of it in the early 1840s, his disease erupted in 1849, and again in the spring of 1861. In letters from January 1862 he describes recurrent and distressing symptoms. The doctors never mentioned syphilis in connection with his final illness, but it seems very likely that the cerebral hemorrhage of March 15 was caused by the debilitating effects of the disease.\n\nThe Rops took Baudelaire back to Brussels, and by March 31 paralysis had set in. He was transported to the Clinique Saint-Jean et Sainte Elisabeth on April 3. By April 4, Baudelaire was incapable of speaking coherently. Madame Aupick arrived in Brussels on April 14 and returned with Baudelaire to Paris at the end of June. Baudelaire was eventually moved into a hydrotherapeutic establishment, and it was there that he died on August 31, 1867.\n\nThe terrible irony of Baudelaire\u2019s story is that this supremely articulate man spent the last 17 months of his life reduced to incoherent monosyllables. This aphasic state was special torture for him because he seemed to understand what was going on around him but was unable to express himself. A particularly sad example of this situation touches on the publication of Baudelaire\u2019s complete works. He had wanted to find a publisher for them before his stroke, and his friends organized themselves to bring about what had become a last wish. Baudelaire conveyed with signs that he wanted L\u00e9vy as publisher, and this request was arranged. Ever the perfectionist, Baudelaire wanted to oversee the production of the manuscript. He knew, however, that he was in no condition to do so. In the hopes that he would eventually recover, Baudelaire used a calendar and a book published by L\u00e9vy to indicate that he wanted the process to wait until March 31. This date came with no improvement in Baudelaire\u2019s health, and his collected works had to be prepared without his supervision; the seven-volume Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes (Complete Works) were not published until after his death, between 1868 and 1873. Biographies were also quickly available: Asselineau\u2019s anecdotal Charles Baudelaire, sa vie et son oeuvre was published two years after the poet\u2019s death; the first scholarly biography of Baudelaire was written by Jacques Cr\u00e9pet in 1887 and completed by his son Eug\u00e8ne in 1907: Baudelaire. \u00c9tude biographique revue et compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par Jacques Cr\u00e9pet.\n\nBaudelaire had achieved an important reputation in the literary world by the time of his death; writers such as St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul Verlaine, and Rimbaud openly sang his praises. In his correspondence Rimbaud called him a \u201cg\u00e9nie, un voyant\u201d (genius, a visionary). In articles written for the journal L\u2019Art in November and December 1865 Verlaine credited Baudelaire with writing poetry about modern man. Mallarm\u00e9 celebrated Baudelaire in essays and took up many of his themes (Poe, escape from the physical world, and desire for the infinite). Baudelaire\u2019s influence has carried over into the 20th century and to other countries in the work of such writers as Pierre-Jean Jouve, Pierre Emmanuel, and T.S. Eliot.\n\nThough Baudelaire was accepted as a poet during his lifetime, his status with 19th-century critics was tenuous. Of 1500 books, 700 copies of Cr\u00e9pet\u2019s biographical study remained in 1892. Lurid articles that exaggerated Baudelaire\u2019s legendary eccentricities attended his death. Important scholars such as Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re and Gustave Lanson remained relatively ignorant of Baudelaire\u2019s achievements.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century small magazines began to perceive Baudelaire\u2019s work more clearly and to free him of the myth of decadence that had grown up around him. Baudelaire\u2019s importance was not fully recognized by the world of criticism until the 20th century, though. In 1926 Paul Val\u00e9ry\u2019s \u201cSituation de Baudelaire\u201d (The Situation of Baudelaire) was published as an introduction to Les Fleurs du mal; in 1927 Marcel Proust published the influential \u201cA propos de Baudelaire\u201d (On the Subject of Baudelaire). These essays and others brought about a renaissance for Baudelaire\u2019s fortunes in France, and by World War II his work was regularly anthologized and used in schools.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s writings have also come to be greatly appreciated abroad, notably in England, where he was introduced by the critic Arthur Symons and where the American poet Eliot subsequently introduced him to American and English modernist poetry. Baudelaire is now an important figure in the literary canon. Critical articles and books about him abound; the W.T. Bandy Center for Baudelaire Studies at Vanderbilt University is devoted to recording all major publications on the author and his work. In the 1980s and 1990s the prose poems seem to have become a particularly appealing topic for scholars of Baudelaire.\n\nBaudelaire\u2019s poetry has gone beyond what was once selective appreciation on the one hand and widespread notoriety on the other to general acclaim. Unlike Hugo, who cultivated his relationship with the public, Baudelaire in his career set himself apart by cultivating an eccentric image, by living an unconventional life, by writing poetry in verse that used Romantic topoi to upset them, and by launching a new form. While he did seek recognition, Baudelaire and his poetry are defined by their distinct individuality.\n\nIn Mon coeur mis \u00e0 nu, Baudelaire described a dynamic\u2014\u201cDe la vaporisation et de la centralisation du moi. Tout est l\u00e0.\u201d (The dispersion and the focusing of the self: those two movements are of the essence)\u2014that strongly characterizes his life as well as his work. Willing to outrage public opinion and yet desirous of popular acclaim, he spoke penetratingly on the human condition. From Baudelaire\u2019s personal, dark ruminations come epiphanies that illuminate even the 20th century. His poetry is read for those moments when, as Baudelaire wrote in his notebook, \u201cla profonder de la vie se r\u00e9v\u00e8le tout enti\u00e8re dans le spectacle, si ordinaire qu\u2019il soit, qu\u2019on a sous les yeux. Il en devient le symbole\u201d (the depth of life reveals itself in all its profundity in whatever one is looking at, however ordinary that spectacle might be. That vision becomes the symbol of life\u2019s depth)."}], "Jean Hugo illustrated books by Paul Verlaine.": [{"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/337130", "page_content": "Resources for Research\n\nThe Met's Libraries and Research Centers provide unparalleled resources for research and welcome an international community of students and scholars.\n\nThe Met Collection API is where all makers, creators, researchers, and dreamers can connect to the most up-to-date data and public domain images for The Met collection.

He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/29967.Paul_Verlaine", "page_content": "* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.

He was undoubtedly spoiled by his mother. At the Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte (now Condorcet) in Paris, he showed both ability and indolence and at 14 sent his first extant poem (\u201cLa Mort\u201d) to the \u201cmaster\u201d poet Victor Hugo. Obtaining the baccalaur\u00e9at in 1862, with distinction in translation from Latin, he became a clerk in an insurance company, then in the Paris city hall. All the while he was writing verse and frequenting literary caf\u00e9s and drawing rooms, where he met the leading poets of the Parnassian group and other talented contemporaries, among them Mallarm\u00e9, Villiers de L\u2019Isle-Adam, and Anatole France. His poems began to appear in their literary reviews; the first, \u201cMonsieur Prudhomme,\u201d in 1863. Three years later the first series of Le Parnasse contemporain, a collection of pieces by contemporary poets (hence the term Parnassian), contained eight contributions by Verlaine.\n\nThe same year, his first volume of poetry appeared. Besides virtuoso imitations of Baudelaire and Leconte de Lisle, Po\u00e8mes saturniens included poignant expressions of love and melancholy supposedly centred on his cousin \u00c9lisa, who married another and died in 1867 (she had paid for this book to be published). In F\u00eates galantes personal sentiment is masked by delicately clever evocations of scenes and characters from the Italian commedia dell\u2019arte and from the sophisticated pastorals of 18th-century painters, such as Watteau and Nicolas Lancret, and perhaps also from the contemporary mood-evoking paintings of Adolphe Monticelli. In June 1869 Verlaine fell in love with Mathilde Maut\u00e9, aged 16, and they married in August 1870. In the delicious poems written during their engagement (La Bonne Chanson), he fervently sees her as his long hoped-for saviour from erring ways. When insurrectionists seized power and set up the Paris Commune, Verlaine served as press officer under their council. His fear of resultant reprisals from the Third Republic was one factor in his later bohemianism. Incompatibility in his marriage was soon aggravated by his infatuation for the younger poet Arthur Rimbaud, who came to stay with the Verlaines in September 1871.\n\nVerlaine abandoned his wife and infant son, Georges, in July 1872, to wander with Rimbaud in northern France and Belgium and write \u201cimpressionist\u201d sketches for his next collection, Romances sans paroles (\u201cSongs Without Words\u201d). The pair reached London in September and found, besides exiled Communard friends, plenty of interest and amusement and also inspiration: Verlaine completed the Romances, whose opening pages, especially, attain a pure musicality rarely surpassed in French literature and embody some of his most advanced prosodic experiments; the subjects are mostly landscape or regret or vituperation of his estranged wife. The collection was published in 1874 by his friend Edmond Lepelletier; the author himself was then serving a two-year sentence at Mons for wounding Rimbaud with a revolver during an emotional storm in Brussels on July 10, 1873.\n\nContrition, prison abstinence, and pious reading (some in English, along with admiring study of Shakespeare and Dickens) seem to have produced a sincere return to Roman Catholicism in the summer of 1874, after his wife had obtained a separation. Leaving prison in January 1875, he tried a Trappist retreat, then hurried to Stuttgart to meet Rimbaud, who apparently repulsed him with violence. He took refuge in England and, for over a year, taught French and drawing at Stickney and Boston in Lincolnshire, then at Bournemouth, Hampshire, impressing all by his dignity and piety and gaining an appreciation of English authors as diverse as Tennyson, Swinburne, and the Anglican hymn writers. In 1877 he returned to France.\n\nFrom this period (1873\u201378) date most of the poems in Sagesse (\u201cWisdom\u201d), which was published in October 1880 at the author\u2019s expense (as were his previous books). They include outstanding poetical expressions of simple Catholic Christianity as well as of his emotional odyssey. Literary recognition now began. In 1882 his famous \u201cArt po\u00e9tique\u201d (probably composed in prison eight years earlier) was enthusiastically adopted by the young Symbolists. He later disavowed the Symbolists, however, chiefly because they went further than he in abandoning traditional forms: rhyme, for example, seemed to him an unavoidable necessity in French verse.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Lucien\u2019s death in April 1883, as well as that of the poet\u2019s mother (to whom he was tenderly attached) in January 1886, and the failure of all attempts at reconciliation with his wife broke down whatever will to \u201crespectability\u201d remained, and he relapsed into drink and debauchery. Now both famous and notorious, he was still writing in an attempt to earn a living but seldom with the old inspiration.\n\nJadis et nagu\u00e8re (\u201cYesteryear and Yesterday\u201d) consists mostly of pieces like \u201cArt po\u00e9tique,\u201d written years before but not fitting into previous carefully grouped collections. Similarly, Parall\u00e8lement comprises bohemian and erotic pieces often contemporary with, and technically equal to, his \u201crespectable\u201d ones. Verlaine frankly acknowledged the parallel nature of both his makeup and his muse. In Amour new poems still show the old magic, notably passages of his lament for Lucien L\u00e9tinois, no doubt intended to emulate Tennyson\u2019s In Memoriam, but lacking its depth. Prose works such as Les Po\u00e8tes maudits, short biographical studies of six poets, among them Mallarm\u00e9 and Rimbaud; Les Hommes d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, brief biographies of contemporary writers, most of which appeared in 1886; Mes H\u00f4pitaux, accounts of Verlaine\u2019s stays in hospitals; Mes Prisons, accounts of his incarcerations, including the story of his \u201cconversion\u201d in 1874; and Confessions, notes autobiographiques helped attract notice to ill-recognized contemporaries as well as to himself (he was instrumental in publishing Rimbaud\u2019s Illuminations in 1886 and making him famous). There is little of lasting value, however, in the rest of the verse and prose that Verlaine turned out in an unsuccessful effort to keep the wolf from a door shared usually with aging prostitutes such as Philom\u00e8ne Boudin and Eug\u00e9nie Krantz, prominent among the muses of his decadence. During frequent spells in hospitals, doctors gave him devoted care and friendship. He was feted in London, Oxford, and Manchester by young sympathizers, among them the critic Arthur Symons, who arranged a lecture tour in England in November 1893. Frank Harris and Cranmer Byng published articles and poems by Verlaine in The Fortnightly Review and The Senate. Relief pensions from admirers (1894) and the state (1895) were also recognition, however tardy or insufficient, of the esteem he attracted as a poet and a friend. He died in Eug\u00e9nie Krantz\u2019s lodgings in January 1896."}, {"url": "https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-08493-0.html", "page_content": "Crowned \u201cPrince of Poets\u201d in his later years, Paul Verlaine stands out among the iconoclastic founders of French modernist verse. This diglot anthology offers the most comprehensive selection of Verlaine\u2019s poetry available in English translation.\n\nVerlaine\u2019s famous works are presented here alongside poems never previously translated into English, including neglected political works and prison pieces only recently brought to light, which reveal social, homoerotic, and even pornographic inspirations. The poems are organized not by collections and date of publication but by themes and time of composition. This innovation, along with Valazza\u2019s extensive supporting materials, will help the curious student or scholar explore the master poet\u2019s work in the context of his troubled life: from the beginning of his literary career among the Parnassians to his affair with Rimbaud and the end of his marriage, his time in prison, and his bohemian lifestyle up to his death in 1896. Verlaine, the poet of ambiguity, has always been a challenge to translate. Rosenberg expertly crafts language that privileges the musicality of Verlaine\u2019s verse while respecting each poem\u2019s meaning and pace.\n\nFeaturing 192 poems in French with English translations, this collection will appeal to scholars and poetry enthusiasts alike."}, {"url": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/8426/8426-h/8426-h.htm", "page_content": "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Poems of Paul Verlaine, by Paul Verlaine This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

The while they celebrate in minor strain Triumphant love, effective enterprise, They have an air of knowing all is vain,\u2014 And through the quiet moonlight their songs rise, The melancholy moonlight, sweet and lone, That makes to dream the birds upon the tree, And in their polished basins of white stone The fountains tall to sob with ecstasy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUR L'HERBE.\n\n\"The abb\u00e9 rambles.\"\u2014\"You, marquis, Have put your wig on all awry.\"\u2014 \"This wine of Cyprus kindles me Less, my Camargo, than your eye!\" \"My passion\"\u2014\"Do, mi, sol, la, si.\"\u2014 \"Abb\u00e9, your villany lies bare.\"\u2014 \"Mesdames, I climb up yonder tree And fetch a star down, I declare.\" \"Let each kiss his own lady, then The others.\"\u2014\"Would that I were, too, A lap-dog!\"\u2014\"Softly, gentlemen!\"\u2014 \"Do, mi.\"\u2014\"The moon!\"\u2014\"Hey, how d'ye do?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL' ALL\u00c9E.\n\nPowdered and rouged as in the sheepcotes' day, Fragile 'mid her enormous ribbon bows, Along the shaded alley, where green grows The moss on the old seats, she wends her way With mincing graces and affected airs, Such as more oft a petted parrot wears. Her long gown with the train is blue; the fan She spreads between her jewelled fingers slim Is merry with a love-scene, of so dim Suggestion, her eyes smile the while they scan. Blonde; dainty nose; plump, cherry lips, divine With pride unconscious.\u2014Subtler, certainly, Than is the mouche there set to underline The rather foolish brightness of the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA LA PROMENADE.\n\nThe milky sky, the hazy, slender trees, Seem smiling on the light costumes we wear,\u2014 Our gauzy floating veils that have an air Of wings, our satins fluttering in the breeze. And in the marble bowl the ripples gleam, And through the lindens of the avenue The sifted golden sun comes to us blue And dying, like the sunshine of a dream. Exquisite triflers and deceivers rare, Tender of heart, but little tied by vows, Deliciously we dally 'neath the boughs, And playfully the lovers plague the fair. Receiving, should they overstep a point, A buffet from a hand absurdly small, At which upon a gallant knee they fall To kiss the little finger's littlest joint. And as this is a shocking liberty, A frigid glance rewards the daring swain,\u2014 Not quite o'erbalancing with its disdain The red mouth's reassuring clemency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLE FAUNE.\n\nAn ancient terra-cotta Faun, A laughing note in 'mid the green, Grins at us from the central lawn, With secret and sarcastic mien. It is that he foresees, perchance, A bad end to the moments dear That with gay music and light dance Have led us, pensive pilgrims, here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMANDOLINE.\n\nThe courtly serenaders, The beauteous listeners, Sit idling 'neath the branches A balmy zephyr stirs. It's Tircis and Aminta, Clitandre,\u2014ever there!\u2014 Damis, of melting sonnets To many a frosty fair. Their trailing flowery dresses, Their fine beflowered coats, Their elegance and lightness, And shadows blue,\u2014all floats And mingles,\u2014circling, wreathing, In moonlight opaline, While through the zephyr's harping Tinkles the mandoline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL'AMOUR PAR TERRE\n\nThe wind the other night blew down the Love That in the dimmest corner of the park So subtly used to smile, bending his arc, And sight of whom did us so deeply move One day! The other night's wind blew him down! The marble dust whirls in the morning breeze. Oh, sad to view, o'erblotted by the trees, There on the base, the name of great renown! Oh, sad to view the empty pedestal! And melancholy fancies come and go Across my dream, whereon a day of woe Foreshadowed is\u2014I know what will befall! Oh, sad!\u2014And you are saddened also, Sweet, Are not you, by this scene? although your eye Pursues the gold and purple butterfly That flutters o'er the wreck strewn at our feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEN SOURDINE\n\nTranquil in the twilight dense By the spreading branches made, Let us breathe the influence Of the silence and the shade. Let your heart melt into mine, And your soul reach out to me, 'Mid the languors of the pine And the sighing arbute-tree. Close your eyes, your hands let be Folded on your slumbering heart, From whose hold all treachery Drive forever, and all art. Let us with the hour accord! Let us let the gentle wind, Rippling in the sunburnt sward, Bring us to a patient mind! And when Night across the air Shall her solemn shadow fling, Touching voice of our despair, Long the nightingale shall sing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOLLOQUE SENTIMENTAL\n\nIn the deserted park, silent and vast, Erewhile two shadowy glimmering figures passed. Their lips were colorless, and dead their eyes; Their words were scarce more audible than sighs. In the deserted park, silent and vast, Two spectres conjured up the buried past. \"Our ancient ecstasy, do you recall?\" \"Why, pray, should I remember it at all?\" \"Does still your heart at mention of me glow? Do still you see my soul in slumber?\" \"No!\" \"Ah, blessed, blissful days when our lips met! You loved me so!\" \"Quite likely,\u2014I forget.\" \"How sweet was hope, the sky how blue and fair!\" \"The sky grew black, the hope became despair.\" Thus walked they 'mid the frozen weeds, these dead, And Night alone o'erheard the things they said.\n\nLa Bonne Chanson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSINCE SHADE RELENTS\n\nSince shade relents, since 'tis indeed the day, Since hope I long had deemed forever flown, Wings back to me that call on her and pray, Since so much joy consents to be my own,\u2014 The dark designs all I relinquish here, And all the evil dreams. Ah, done am I Above all with the narrowed lips, the sneer, The heartless wit that laughed where one should sigh. Away, clenched fist and bosom's angry swell, That knave and fool at every turn abound. Away, hard unforgivingness! Farewell, Oblivion in a hated brewage found! For I mean, now a Being of the Morn Has shed across my night excelling rays Of love at once immortal and newborn,\u2014 By favor of her smile, her glance, her grace, I mean by you upheld, O gentle hand, Wherein mine trembles,\u2014led, sweet eyes, by you, To walk straight, lie the path o'er mossy land Or barren waste that rocks and pebbles strew. Yes, calm I mean to walk through life, and straight, Patient of all, unanxious of the goal, Void of all envy, violence, or hate It shall be duty done with cheerful soul. And as I may, to lighten the long way, Go singing airs ingenuous and brave, She'll listen to me graciously, I say,\u2014 And, verily, no other heaven I crave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEFORE YOUR LIGHT QUITE FAIL\n\nBefore your light quite fail, Already paling star, (The quail Sings in the thyme afar!) Turn on the poet's eyes That love makes overrun\u2014 (See rise The lark to meet the sun!) Your glance, that presently Must drown in the blue morn; (What glee Amid the rustling corn!) Then flash my message true Down yonder,\u2014far away!\u2014 (The dew Lies sparkling on the hay.) Across what visions seek The Dear One slumbering still. (Quick, quick! The sun has reached the hill!)\n\nO'ER THE WOOD'S BROW O'er the wood's brow, Pale, the moon stares; In every bough Wandering airs Faintly suspire.... O heart's-desire! Two willow-trees Waver and weep, One in the breeze, One in the deep Glass of the stream.... Dream we our dream! An infinite Resignedness Rains where the white Mists opalesce In the moon-shower.... Stay, perfect hour!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCENE BEHIND THE CARRIAGE WINDOW-PANES\n\nThe scene behind the carriage window-panes Goes flitting past in furious flight; whole plains With streams and harvest-fields and trees and blue Are swallowed by the whirlpool, whereinto The telegraph's slim pillars topple o'er, Whose wires look strangely like a music-score. A smell of smoke and steam, a horrid din As of a thousand clanking chains that pin A thousand giants that are whipped and howl,\u2014 And, suddenly, long hoots as of an owl. What is it all to me? Since in mine eyes The vision lingers that beatifies, Since still the soft voice murmurs in mine ear, And since the Name, so sweet, so high, so dear, Pure pivot of this madding whirl, prevails Above the brutal clangor of the rails?\n\nTHE ROSY HEARTH, THE LAMPLIGHT'S NARROW BEAM The rosy hearth, the lamplight's narrow beam, The meditation that is rather dream, With looks that lose themselves in cherished looks; The hour of steaming tea and banished books; The sweetness of the evening at an end, The dear fatigue, and right to rest attained, And worshipped expectation of the night,\u2014 Oh, all these things, in unrelenting flight, My dream pursues through all the vain delays, Impatient of the weeks, mad at the days!\n\nIT SHALL BE, THEN, UPON A SUMMER'S DAY It shall be, then, upon a summer's day: The sun, my joy's accomplice, bright shall shine, And add, amid your silk and satin fine, To your dear radiance still another ray; The heavens, like a sumptuous canopy, Shall shake out their blue folds to droop and trail About our happy brows, that shall be pale With so much gladness, such expectancy; And when day closes, soft shall be the air That in your snowy veils, caressing, plays, And with soft-smiling eyes the stars shall gaze Benignantly upon the wedded pair.\n\nRomances sans Paroles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriettes Oubli\u00e9es\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIl pleut doucement sur la ville.\u2014ARTHUR RIMBAUD\n\nIt weeps in my heart As it rains on the town. What is this dull smart Possessing my heart? Soft sound of the rain On the ground and the roofs! To a heart in pain, O the song of the rain! It weeps without cause In my heart-sick heart. In her faith, what? no flaws? This grief has no cause. 'Tis sure the worst woe To know not wherefore My heart suffers so Without joy or woe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSon joyeux, importun, d'un clavecin sonore.\u2014P\u00c9TRUS BOREL\n\nThe keyboard, over which two slim hands float, Shines vaguely in the twilight pink and gray, Whilst with a sound like wings, note after note Takes flight to form a pensive little lay That strays, discreet and charming, faint, remote, About the room where perfumes of Her stray. What is this sudden quiet cradling me To that dim ditty's dreamy rise and fall? What do you want with me, pale melody? What is it that you want, ghost musical That fade toward the window waveringly A little open on the garden small?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, heavy, heavy my despair, Because, because of One so fair. My misery knows no allay, Although my heart has come away. Although my heart, although my soul, Have fled the fatal One's control. My misery knows no allay, Although my heart has come away. My heart, the too, too feeling one, Says to my soul, \"Can it be done, \"Can it be done, too feeling heart, That we from her shall live apart?\" My soul says to my heart, \"Know I What this strange pitfall should imply, \"That we, though far from her, are near, Yea, present, though in exile here?\"\n\nLe rossignol qui du haut d'une branche se regarde dedans, croit \u00eatre tomb\u00e9 dans la rivi\u00e8re. Il est au sommet d'un chene, et toutefois il a peur de se noyer. CYRANO DE BERGERAC. The trees' reflection in the misty stream Dies off in livid steam; Whilst up among the actual boughs, forlorn, The tender wood-doves mourn. How wan the face, O traveller, this wan Gray landscape looked upon; And how forlornly in the high tree-tops Lamented thy drowned hopes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaysages Belges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRUXELLES\n\nHills and fences hurry by Blent in greenish-rosy flight, And the yellow carriage-light Blurs all to the half-shut eye. Slowly turns the gold to red O'er the humble darkening vales; Little trees that flatly spread, Where some feeble birdling wails. Scarcely sad, so mild and fair This enfolding Autumn seems; All my moody languor dreams, Cradled by the gentle air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirds in the Night\n\nI You were not over-patient with me, dear; This want of patience one must rightly rate: You are so young! Youth ever was severe And variable and inconsiderate! You had not all the needful kindness, no; Nor should one be amazed, unhappily: You're very young, cold sister mine, and so 'Tis natural you should unfeeling be! Behold me therefore ready to forgive; Not gay, of course! but doing what I can To bear up bravely,\u2014deeply though I grieve To be, through you, the most unhappy man.\n\nII But you will own that I was in the right When in my downcast moods I used to say That your sweet eyes, my hope, once, and delight! Were come to look like eyes that will betray. It was an evil lie, you used to swear, And your glance, which was lying, dear, would flame,\u2014 Poor fire, near out, one stirs to make it flare!\u2014 And in your soft voice you would say, \"Je t'aime!\" Alas! that one should clutch at happiness In sense's, season's, everything's despite!\u2014 But 'twas an hour of gleeful bitterness When I became convinced that I was right!\n\nIII And wherefore should I lay my heart-wounds bare? You love me not,\u2014an end there, lady mine; And as I do not choose that one shall dare To pity,\u2014I must suffer without sign. Yes, suffer! For I loved you well, did I,\u2014 But like a loyal soldier will I stand Till, hurt to death, he staggers off to die, Still filled with love for an ungrateful land. O you that were my Beauty and my Own, Although from you derive all my mischance, Are not you still my Home, then, you alone, As young and mad and beautiful as France?\n\nIV Now I do not intend\u2014what were the gain?\u2014 To dwell with streaming eyes upon the past; But yet my love which you may think lies slain, Perhaps is only wide awake at last. My love, perhaps,\u2014which now is memory!\u2014 Although beneath your blows it cringe and cry And bleed to will, and must, as I foresee, Still suffer long and much before it die,\u2014 Judges you justly when it seems aware Of some not all banal compunction, And of your memory in its despair Reproaching you, \"Ah, fi! it was ill done!\"\n\nV I see you still. I softly pushed the door\u2014 As one o'erwhelmed with weariness you lay; But O light body love should soon restore, You bounded up, tearful at once and gay. O what embraces, kisses sweet and wild! Myself, from brimming eyes I laughed to you Those moments, among all, O lovely child, Shall be my saddest, but my sweetest, too. I will remember your smile, your caress, Your eyes, so kind that day,\u2014exquisite snare!\u2014 Yourself, in fine, whom else I might not bless, Only as they appeared, not as they were.\n\nVI I see you still! Dressed in a summer dress, Yellow and white, bestrewn with curtain-flowers; But you had lost the glistening laughingness Of our delirious former loving hours. The eldest daughter and the little wife Spoke plainly in your bearing's least detail,\u2014 Already 'twas, alas! our altered life That stared me from behind your dotted veil. Forgiven be! And with no little pride I treasure up,\u2014and you, no doubt, see why,\u2014 Remembrance of the lightning to one side That used to flash from your indignant eye!\n\nVII Some moments, I'm the tempest-driven bark That runs dismasted mid the hissing spray, And seeing not Our Lady through the dark Makes ready to be drowned, and kneels to pray. Some moments, I'm the sinner at his end, That knows his doom if he unshriven go, And losing hope of any ghostly friend, Sees Hell already gape, and feels it glow. Oh, but! Some moments, I've the spirit stout Of early Christians in the lion's care, That smile to Jesus witnessing, without A nerve's revolt, the turning of a hair!\n\nAquarelles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGREEN\n\nSee, blossoms, branches, fruit, leaves I have brought, And then my heart that for you only sighs; With those white hands of yours, oh, tear it not, But let the poor gift prosper in your eyes. The dew upon my hair is still undried,\u2014 The morning wind strikes chilly where it fell. Suffer my weariness here at your side To dream the hour that shall it quite dispel. Allow my head, that rings and echoes still With your last kiss, to lie upon your breast, Till it recover from the stormy thrill,\u2014 And let me sleep a little, since you rest.\n\nSPLEEN The roses were so red, so red, The ivies altogether black. If you but merely turn your head, Beloved, all my despairs come back! The sky was over-sweet and blue, Too melting green the sea did show. I always fear,\u2014if you but knew!\u2014 From your dear hand some killing blow. Weary am I of holly-tree And shining box and waving grass Upon the tame unending lea,\u2014 And all and all but you, alas!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTREETS\n\nLet's dance the jig! Above all else I loved her eyes, More clear than stars of cloudless skies, And arch and mischievous and wise. Let's dance the jig! So skilfully would she proceed To make a lover's bare heart bleed, That it was beautiful indeed! Let's dance the jig! But keenlier have I relished The kisses of her mouth so red Since to my heart she has been dead. Let's dance the jig! The circumstances great and small,\u2014 Words, moments... I recall, recall It is my treasure among all. Let's dance the jig!\n\nSagesse WHAT SAYST THOU, TRAVELLER, OF ALL THOU SAW'ST AFAR? What sayst thou, traveller, of all thou saw'st afar? On every tree hangs boredom, ripening to its fall, Didst gather it, thou smoking yon thy sad cigar, Black, casting an incongruous shadow on the wall? Thine eyes are just as dead as ever they have been, Unchanged is thy grimace, thy dolefulness is one, Thou mind'st one of the wan moon through the rigging seen, The wrinkled sea beneath the golden morning sun, The ancient graveyard with new gravestones every day,\u2014 But, come, regale us with appropriate detail, Those disillusions weeping at the fountains, say, Those new disgusts, just like their brothers, littered stale, Those women! Say the glare, the identical dismay Of ugliness and evil, always, in all lands, And say Love, too,\u2014and Politics, moreover, say, With ink-dishonored blood upon their shameless hands. And then, above all else, neglect not to recite Thy proper feats, thou dragging thy simplicity Wherever people love, wherever people fight, In such a sad and foolish kind, in verity! Has that dull innocence been punished as it should? What say'st thou? Man is hard,\u2014but woman? And thy tears, Who has been drinking? And into what ear so good Dost pour thy woes for it to pour in other ears? Ah, others! ah, thyself! Gulled with such curious ease, That used to dream (Doth not the soul with laughter fill?) One knows not what poetic, delicate decease,\u2014 Thou sort of angel with the paralytic will! But now what are thy plans, thine aims? Art thou of might? Or has long shedding tears disqualified thy heart? The tree is scarcely hardy, judging it at sight, And by thy looks no topping conqueror thou art. So awkward, too! With the additional offence Of being now a sort of dazed idyllic bard That poses in a window, contemplating thence The silly noon-day sky with an impressed regard. So totally the same in this extreme decay! But in thy place a being with some sense, pardy, Would wish at least to lead the dance, since he must pay The fiddlers,\u2014at some risk of flutt'ring passers-by! Canst not, by rummaging within thy consciousness, Find some bright vice to bare, as 't were a flashing sword? Some gay, audacious vice, which wield with dexterousness, And make to shine, and shoot red lightnings Heavenward! Hast one, or more? If more, the better! And plunge in, And bravely lay about thee, indiscriminate, And wear that face of indolence that masks the grin Of hate at once full-feasted and insatiate. Not well to be a dupe in this good universe, Where there is nothing to allure in happiness Save in it wriggle aught of shameful and perverse,\u2014 And not to be a dupe, one must be merciless! \u2014Ah, human wisdom, ah, new things have claimed mine eyes, And of that past\u2014of weary recollection!\u2014 Thy voice described, for still more sinister advice, All I remember is the evil I have done. In all the curious movements of my sad career, Of others and myself, the chequered road I trod, Of my accounted sorrows, good and evil cheer, I nothing have retained except the grace of God! If I am punished, 'tis most fit I should be so; Played to its end is mortal man's and woman's r\u00f4le,\u2014 But steadfastly I hope I too one day shall know The peace and pardon promised every Christian soul. Well not to be a dupe in this world of a day, But not to be one in the world that hath no end, That which it doth behoove the soul to be and stay Is merciful, not merciless,\u2014deluded friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FALSE FAIR DAYS\n\nThe false fair days have flamed the livelong day, And still they flicker in the brazen West. Cast down thine eyes, poor soul, shut out the unblest: A deadliest temptation. Come away. All day they flashed in flakes of fire, that lay The vintage low upon the hill's green breast, The harvest low,\u2014and o'er that faithfullest, The blue sky ever beckoning, shed dismay. Oh, clasp thy hands, grow pale, and turn again! If all the future savoured of the past? If the old insanity were on its way? Those memories, must each anew be slain? One fierce assault, the best, no doubt, the last! Go pray against the gathering storm, go pray!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIVE EAR UNTO THE GENTLE LAY\n\nGive ear unto the gentle lay That's only sad that it may please; It is discreet, and light it is: A whiff of wind o'er buds in May. The voice was known to you (and dear?), But it is muffled latterly As is a widow,\u2014still, as she It doth its sorrow proudly bear, And through the sweeping mourning veil That in the gusts of Autumn blows, Unto the heart that wonders, shows Truth like a star now flash, now fail. It says,\u2014the voice you knew again!\u2014 That kindness, goodness is our life, And that of envy, hatred, strife, When death is come, shall naught remain. It says how glorious to be Like children, without more delay, The tender gladness it doth say Of peace not bought with victory. Accept the voice,\u2014ah, hear the whole Of its persistent, artless strain: Naught so can soothe a soul's own pain, As making glad another soul! It pines in bonds but for a day, The soul that without murmur bears.... How unperplexed, how free it fares! Oh, listen to the gentle lay!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'VE SEEN AGAIN THE ONE CHILD: VERILY\n\nI've seen again the One child: verily, I felt the last wound open in my breast, The last, whose perfect torture doth attest That on some happy day I too shall die! Good icy arrow, piercing thoroughly! Most timely came it from their dreams to wrest The sluggish scruples laid too long to rest,\u2014 And all my Christian blood hymned fervently. I still hear, still I see! O worshipped rule Of God! I know at last how comfortful To hear and see! I see, I hear alway! O innocence, O hope! Lowly and mild, How I shall love you, sweet hands of my child, Whose task shall be to close our eyes one day!\n\n\"SON, THOU MUST LOVE ME! SEE\u2014\" MY SAVIOUR SAID \"Son, thou must love me! See\u2014\" my Saviour said, \"My heart that glows and bleeds, my wounded side, My hurt feet that the Magdalene, wet-eyed, Clasps kneeling, and my tortured arms outspread \"To bear thy sins. Look on the cross, stained red! The nails, the sponge, that, all, thy soul shall guide To love on earth where flesh thrones in its pride, My Body and Blood alone, thy Wine and Bread. \"Have I not loved thee even unto death, O brother mine, son in the Holy Ghost? Have I not suffered, as was writ I must, \"And with thine agony sobbed out my breath? Hath not thy nightly sweat bedewed my brow, O lamentable friend that seek'st me now?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHOPE SHINES\u2014AS IN A STABLE A WISP OF STRAW Hope shines\u2014as in a stable a wisp of straw. Fear not the wasp drunk with his crazy flight! Through some chink always, see, the moted light! Propped on your hand, you dozed\u2014But let me draw Cool water from the well for you, at least, Poor soul! There, drink! Then sleep. See, I remain, And I will sing a slumberous refrain, And you shall murmur like a child appeased. Noon strikes. Approach not, Madam, pray, or call.... He sleeps. Strange how a woman's light footfall Re-echoes through the brains of grief-worn men! Noon strikes. I bade them sprinkle in the room. Sleep on! Hope shines\u2014a pebble in the gloom. \u2014When shall the Autumn rose re-blossom,\u2014when?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLEEP, DARKSOME, DEEP\n\nSleep, darksome, deep, Doth on me fall: Vain hopes all, sleep, Sleep, yearnings all! Lo, I grow blind! Lo, right and wrong Fade to my mind.... O sorry song! A cradle, I, Rocked in a grave: Speak low, pass by, Silence I crave!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SKY-BLUE SMILES ABOVE THE ROOF\n\nThe sky-blue smiles above the roof Its tenderest; A green tree rears above the roof Its waving crest. The church-bell in the windless sky Peaceably rings, A skylark soaring in the sky Endlessly sings. My God, my God, all life is there, Simple and sweet; The soothing bee-hive murmur there Comes from the street! What have you done, O you that weep In the glad sun,\u2014 Say, with your youth, you man that weep, What have you done?\n\nIT IS YOU It is you, it is you, poor better thoughts! The needful hope, shame for the ancient blots, Heart's gentleness with mind's severity, And vigilance, and calm, and constancy, And all!\u2014But slow as yet, though well awake; Though sturdy, shy; scarce able yet to break The spell of stifling night and heavy dreams. One comes after the other, and each seems Uncouther, and all fear the moonlight cold. \"Thus, sheep when first they issue from the fold, Come,\u2014one, then two, then three. The rest delay, With lowered heads, in stupid, wondering way, Waiting to do as does the one that leads. He stops, they stop in turn, and lay their heads Across his back, simply, not knowing why.\"* Your shepherd, O my fair flock, is not I,\u2014 It is a better, better far, who knows The reasons, He that so long kept you close, But timely with His own hand set you free. Him follow,\u2014light His staff. And I shall be, Beneath his voice still raised to comfort you, I shall be, I, His faithful dog, and true. * Dante, Purgatorio.\n\n'TIS THE FEAST OF CORN 'Tis the feast of corn, 'tis the feast of bread, On the dear scene returned to, witnessed again! So white is the light o'er the reapers shed Their shadows fall pink on the level grain. The stalked gold drops to the whistling flight Of the scythes, whose lightning dives deep, leaps clear; The plain, labor-strewn to the confines of sight, Changes face at each instant, gay and severe. All pants, all is effort and toil 'neath the sun, The stolid old sun, tranquil ripener of wheat, Who works o'er our haste imperturbably on To swell the green grape yon, turning it sweet. Work on, faithful sun, for the bread and the wine, Feed man with the milk of the earth, and bestow The frank glass wherein unconcern laughs divine,\u2014 Ye harvesters, vintagers, work on, aglow! For from the flour's fairest, and from the vine's best, Fruit of man's strength spread to earth's uttermost, God gathers and reaps, to His purposes blest, The Flesh and the Blood for the chalice and host!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJadis et Nagu\u00e8re\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJadis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nOff, be off, now, graceless pack: Get you gone, lost children mine: Your release is earned in fine: The Chimaera lends her back. Huddling on her, go, God-sped, As a dream-horde crowds and cowers Mid the shadowy curtain-flowers Round a sick man's haunted bed. Hold! My hand, unfit before, Feeble still, but feverless, And which palpitates no more Save with a desire to bless, Blesses you, O little flies Of my black suns and white nights. Spread your rustling wings, arise, Little griefs, little delights, Hopes, despairs, dreams foul and fair, All!\u2014renounced since yesterday By my heart that quests elsewhere.... Ite, aegri somnia!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLANGUEUR\n\nI am the Empire in the last of its decline, That sees the tall, fair-haired Barbarians pass,\u2014the while Composing indolent acrostics, in a style Of gold, with languid sunshine dancing in each line. The solitary soul is heart-sick with a vile Ennui. Down yon, they say, War's torches bloody shine. Alas, to be so faint of will, one must resign The chance of brave adventure in the splendid file,\u2014 Of death, perchance! Alas, so lagging in desire! Ah, all is drunk! Bathyllus, hast done laughing, pray? Ah, all is drunk,\u2014all eaten! Nothing more to say! Alone, a vapid verse one tosses in the fire; Alone, a somewhat thievish slave neglecting one; Alone, a vague disgust of all beneath the sun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNagu\u00e8re\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nGlimm'ring twilight things are these, Visions of the end of night. Truth, thou lightest them, I wis, Only with a distant light, Whitening through the hated shade In such grudging dim degrees, One must doubt if they be made By the moon among the trees, Or if these uncertain ghosts Shall take body bye and bye, And uniting with the hosts Tented by the azure sky, Framed by Nature's setting meet,\u2014 Offer up in one accord From the heart's ecstatic heat, Incense to the living Lord!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParall\u00e8lement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION FAUSSE\n\nDame mouse patters Black against the shadow grey; Dame mouse patters Grey against the black. Hear the bed-time bell! Sleep forthwith, good prisoners; Hear the bed-time bell! You must go to sleep. No disturbing dream! Think of nothing but your loves: No disturbing dream, Of the fair ones think! Moonlight clear and bright! Some one of the neighbors snores; Moonlight clear and bright\u2014 He is troublesome. Comes a pitchy cloud Creeping o'er the faded moon; Comes a pitchy cloud\u2014 See the grey dawn creep! Dame mouse patters Pink across an azure ray; Dame mouse patters.... Sluggards, up! 'tis day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPo\u00e8mes Saturniens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nThe Sages of old time, well worth our own, Believed\u2014and it has been disproved by none\u2014 That destinies in Heaven written are, And every soul depends upon a star. (Many have mocked, without remembering That laughter oft is a misguiding thing, This explanation of night's mystery.) Now all that born beneath Saturnus be,\u2014 Red planet, to the necromancer dear,\u2014 Inherit, ancient magic-books make clear, Good share of spleen, good share of wretchedness. Imagination, wakeful, vigorless, In them makes the resolves of reason vain. The blood within them, subtle as a bane, Burning as lava, scarce, flows ever fraught With sad ideals that ever come to naught. Such must Saturnians suffer, such must die,\u2014 If so that death destruction doth imply,\u2014 Their lives being ordered in this dismal sense By logic of a malign Influence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelancholia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEVERMORE\n\nRemembrance, what wilt thou with me? The year Declined; in the still air the thrush piped clear, The languid sunshine did incurious peer Among the thinned leaves of the forest sere. We were alone, and pensively we strolled, With straying locks and fancies, when, behold Her turn to let her thrilling gaze enfold, And ask me in her voice of living gold, Her fresh young voice, \"What was thy happiest day?\" I smiled discreetly for all answer, and Devotedly I kissed her fair white hand. \u2014Ah, me! The earliest flowers, how sweet are they! And in how exquisite a whisper slips The earliest \"Yes\" from well-beloved lips!\n\nAPR\u00c8S TROIS ANS When I had pushed the narrow garden-door, Once more I stood within the green retreat; Softly the morning sunshine lighted it, And every flow'r a humid spangle wore. Nothing is changed. I see it all once more: The vine-clad arbor with its rustic seat.... The waterjet still plashes silver sweet, The ancient aspen rustles as of yore. The roses throb as in a bygone day, As they were wont, the tall proud lilies sway. Each bird that lights and twitters is a friend. I even found the Flora standing yet, Whose plaster crumbles at the alley's end, \u2014Slim, 'mid the foolish scent of mignonette.\n\nMON R\u00caVE FAMILIER Oft do I dream this strange and penetrating dream: An unknown woman, whom I love, who loves me well, Who does not every time quite change, nor yet quite dwell The same,\u2014and loves me well, and knows me as I am. For she knows me! My heart, clear as a crystal beam To her alone, ceases to be inscrutable To her alone, and she alone knows to dispel My grief, cooling my brow with her tears' gentle stream. Is she of favor dark or fair?\u2014I do not know. Her name? All I remember is that it doth flow Softly, as do the names of them we loved and lost. Her eyes are like the statues',\u2014mild and grave and wide; And for her voice she has as if it were the ghost Of other voices,\u2014well-loved voices that have died.\n\nA UNE FEMME To you these lines for the consoling grace Of your great eyes wherein a soft dream shines, For your pure soul, all-kind!\u2014to you these lines From the black deeps of mine unmatched distress. 'Tis that the hideous dream that doth oppress My soul, alas! its sad prey ne'er resigns, But like a pack of wolves down mad inclines Goes gathering heat upon my reddened trace! I suffer, oh, I suffer cruelly! So that the first man's cry at Eden lost Was but an eclogue surely to my cry! And that the sorrows, Dear, that may have crossed Your life, are but as swallows light that fly \u2014Dear!\u2014in a golden warm September sky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaysages Tristes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHANSON D'AUTOMNE\n\nLeaf-strewing gales Utter low wails Like violins,\u2014 Till on my soul Their creeping dole Stealthily wins.... Days long gone by! In such hour, I, Choking and pale, Call you to mind,\u2014 Then like the wind Weep I and wail. And, as by wind Harsh and unkind, Driven by grief, Go I, here, there, Recking not where, Like the dead leaf.\n\nLE ROSSIGNOL Like to a swarm of birds, with jarring cries Descend on me my swarming memories; Light mid the yellow leaves, that shake and sigh, Of the bowed alder\u2014that is even I!\u2014 Brooding its shadow in the violet Unprofitable river of Regret. They settle screaming\u2014Then the evil sound, By the moist wind's impatient hushing drowned, Dies by degrees, till nothing more is heard Save the lone singing of a single bird, Save the clear voice\u2014O singer, sweetly done!\u2014 Warbling the praises of the Absent One.... And in the silence of a summer night Sultry and splendid, by a late moon's light That sad and sallow peers above the hill, The humid hushing wind that ranges still Rocks to a whispered sleepsong languidly The bird lamenting and the shivering tree.\n\nCaprices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL BACIO\n\nKiss! Hollyhock in Love's luxuriant close! Brisk music played on pearly little keys, In tempo with the witching melodies Love in the ardent heart repeating goes. Sonorous, graceful Kiss, hail! Kiss divine! Unequalled boon, unutterable bliss! Man, bent o'er thine enthralling chalice, Kiss, Grows drunken with a rapture only thine! Thou comfortest as music does, and wine, And grief dies smothered in thy purple fold. Let one greater than I, Kiss, and more bold, Rear thee a classic, monumental line. Humble Parisian bard, this infantile Bouquet of rhymes I tender half in fear.... Be gracious, and in guerdon, on the dear Red lips of One I know, alight and smile!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c9PILOGUE\n\nI The sun, less hot, looks from a sky more clear; The roses in their sleepy loveliness Nod to the cradling wind. The atmosphere Enfolds us with a sister's tenderness. For once hath Nature left the splendid throne Of her indifference, and through the mild Sun-gilded air of Autumn, clement grown, Descends to man, her proud, revolted child. She takes, to wipe the tears upon our face, Her azure mantle sown with many a star; And her eternal soul, her deathless grace, Strengthen and calm the weak heart that we are. The waving of the boughs, the lengthened line Of the horizon, full of dreamy hues And scattered songs, all,\u2014sing it, sail, or shine!\u2014 To-day consoles, delivers!\u2014Let us muse.\n\nII So, then this book is closed. Dear Fancies mine, That streaked my grey sky with your wings of light, And passing fanned my burning brow, benign,\u2014 Return, return to your blue Infinite! Thou, ringing Rhyme, thou, Verse that smooth didst glide, Ye, throbbing Rhythms, ye, musical Refrains, And Memories, and Dreams, and ye beside Fair Figures called to life with anxious pains, We needs must part. Until the happier day When Art, our Lord, his thralls shall re-unite, Companions sweet, Farewell and Wellaway, Fly home, ye may, to your blue Infinite! And true it is, we spared not breath or force, And our good pleasure, like foaming steed Blind with the madness of his earliest course, Of rest within the quiet shade hath need. \u2014For always have we held thee, Poesy, To be our Goddess, mighty and august, Our only passion,\u2014Mother calling thee, And holding Inspiration in mistrust.\n\nIII Ah, Inspiration, splendid, dominant, Egeria with the lightsome eyes profound, Sudden Erato, Genius quick to grant, Old picture Angel of the gilt background, Muse,\u2014ay, whose voice is powerful indeed, Since in the first come brain it makes to grow Thick as some dusty yellow roadside weed, A gardenful of poems none did sow,\u2014 Dove, Holy Ghost, Delirium, Sacred Fire, Transporting Passion,\u2014seasonable queen!\u2014 Gabriel and lute, Latona's son and lyre,\u2014 Ah, Inspiration, summoned at sixteen! What we have need of, we, the Poets True, That not believe in Gods, and yet revere, That have no halo, hold no golden clue, For whom no Beatrix leaves her radiant sphere, We, that do chisel words like chalices, And moving verses shape with unmoved mind, Whom wandering in groups by evening seas, In musical converse ye scarce shall find,\u2014 What we need is, in midnight hours dim-lit, Sleep daunted, knowledge earned,\u2014more knowledge still! Is Faust's brow, of the wood-cuts, sternly knit, Is stubborn Perseverance, and is Will! Is Will eternal, holy, absolute, That grasps\u2014as doth a noble bird of prey The steaming flanks of the foredoomed brute,\u2014 Its project, and with it,\u2014skyward, away! What we need, we, is fixedness intense, Unequalled effort, strife that shall not cease, Is night, the bitter night of labor, whence Arises, sun-like, slow, the Master-piece! Let our Inspired, hearts by an eye-shot tined, Sway with the birch-tree to all winds that blow, Poor things! Art knows not the divided mind\u2014 Speak, Milo's Venus, is she stone or no? We therefore, carve we with the chisel Thought The pure block of the Beautiful, and gain From out the marble cold where it was not, Some starry-chitoned statue without stain, That one far day, Posterity, new Morn, Enkindling with a golden-rosy flame Our Work, new Memnon, shall to ears unborn Make quiver in the singing air our name!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poems of Paul Verlaine, by Paul Verlaine *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POEMS OF PAUL VERLAINE *** ***** This file should be named 8426-h.htm or 8426-h.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: http://www.gutenberg.org/8/4/2/8426/ Produced by Michael Castelluccio, and David Widger Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

Verlaine was also one of the models for the Decadent movement that began in the 1870s. His numerous poetry collections include Invectives (1896), Chair (1896), Confessions (1895), Femmes (1890), Les Po\u00e8tes maudits (1884), Sagesse (1880), Romances sans paroles (1874), La Bonne Chanson (1870), and Po\u00e8mes saturniens (1866). Although he was known as \u201cthe Master\u201d to his friends and admirers by the time of his death in 1896, Verlaine endured a rocky relationship with the public during his life. As much as for his literary reputation, his fame rests on his stormy personal relationship with the poet Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nVerlaine was the son of Nicolas Verlaine, a captain in the army, and St\u00e9phanie Deh\u00e9e, the daughter of a farmer from Arras. Nicolas Verlaine was cold and authoritarian by nature, but St\u00e9phanie Deh\u00e9e was devoted to her son, who was born 13 years into his parents\u2019 marriage, after three successive miscarriages. After he resigned from the army in 1851, Nicolas Verlaine and his family moved to Paris with an orphaned cousin, Elisa Moncomble. Verlaine was enrolled at the Institution Landry. A tempestuous child, Verlaine\u2019s extreme and irrepressible fits of anger foreshadowed his personality as an adult. In fact, Verlaine already possessed his own inner poetic voice. Emotionally unstable, he wrote about escaping from the world in his first poems: \u201cAigle, au r\u00eaveur hardi, pour l\u2019enlever du sol, / Ouvre ton aile! / Eclair, emporte-moi!\u201d (\u201cEagle, open your wing to the fearless dreamer, / And take him away! / Lightning, take me away!\u201d).\n\n\n\nPosturing himself as a soul in search of the absolute, by his late teens Verlaine was already absorbed in his dreams and sensations, questioning the world and confronting it with a world of his own creation. A mediocre student whose only interest was writing poems, Verlaine was more often in the caf\u00e9s of the Quartier Latin than at the lectures at the law school where he was enrolled. In 1863 he published \u201cMonsieur Prudhomme,\u201d his first sonnet. Worried about his son\u2019s artistic pretensions, Nicolas Verlaine forced him to accept a job at the H\u00f4tel de Ville (mayor\u2019s office) in Paris. After work the young Verlaine would join the capital\u2019s fashionable literary circles and meet various poets, including Th\u00e9odore de Banville, with whom he discussed the latest poetic techniques. But beset by overwhelming and contradictory feelings of fear and hope, Verlaine was prey to despair. Only in poetry could he find temporary peace. In 1866 he published his first collection of poems, Po\u00e8mes saturniens (Saturnian Poems). The title was inspired by one of Charles Baudelaire\u2019s verses at the beginning of Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil, 1857). Most of the poems in the book were dedicated to Verlaine\u2019s cousin Elisa Moncomble, whom the poet secretly loved.\n\n\n\nThe early work of a poet in search of himself, Po\u00e8mes saturniens was written during the author\u2019s adolescence. Influenced by models including Banville and Victor Hugo, the young man imitated rather than created his own style. Though he admired Baudelaire\u2019s detachment toward his work, Verlaine was fully involved in his own creations, sharing with Baudelaire an aspiration to a world of dreams. Love and sensuality are at the heart of Po\u00e8mes saturniens. Verlaine\u2019s \u201cr\u00eav\u00e9 familier\u201d (familiar dream) is that of \u201cune femme inconnue, et que j\u2019aime, et qui m\u2019aime\u201d (a nameless woman, whom I love and who loves me); most probably his beloved cousin, who was far from being an \u201cinconnue\u201d (unknown). Published not long after Po\u00e8mes saturniens, Verlaine\u2019s second collection, F\u00eates galantes (Gallant Festivals, 1869), is dominated by the image of the moon. Ghostly characters dance in a spectral countryside; Harlequins and Columbines jump, turn, and waltz in melancholic parks, around majestic fountains, and \u201cSous les ramures chanteuses\u201d (under fluttering boughs) in quest of a heavenly place which perpetually fades away. Verlaine evoked the techniques and paintings of 18th-century artists Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, and also drew upon Walter Pater, Hugo, G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, William Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (1605), and the Italian commedia dell\u2019arte. However, F\u00eates galantes was a commercial failure. A few months later the poet met Mathilde Maut\u00e9 and fell deeply in love. His next collection of poems, La bonne chanson (The Good Song, 1870), is dedicated to her. La bonne chanson offers a more direct form of expression, reflecting Verlaine\u2019s attempt to regularize his life and achieve peace of mind\u2014he had become aware of the realities of life and yearned for some sort of mental purification. Hastily written, most of the poems in the collection are similar to those the author sent to Mathilde after they had first met. Though the two married soon after they met, their relationship would soon be consumed in the storm of Verlaine\u2019s feelings for the young poet Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nIn 1871 Verlaine met Rimbaud, who read him one of his poems, \u201cLe Bateau ivre\u201d (The Drunken Boat). Rimbaud had initially contacted Verlaine by letter, and Verlaine invited the young poet to stay with him and his wife\u2019s family. The two men soon became inseparable. In the meantime, Verlaine\u2019s marriage started to deteriorate. He beat and threatened Mathilde over her criticism of his behavior and of his friendship with Rimbaud, whom she abhorred. During this time Rimbaud\u2019s extremely antisocial behavior and the apparent relationship between the two men became public knowledge. In October 1871 Mathilde gave birth to a son, Georges. A few months later, Verlaine and Rimbaud left for Belgium and eventually embarked for England. Left alone, Mathilde sought a divorce from Verlaine.\n\n\n\nVerlaine and Rimbaud spent the following three years traveling between London, Brussels, and Paris. In 1872 and 1873 multiple separations and reunions occurred between the lovers, and Verlaine was eventually sent to prison for two years after a violent argument with Rimbaud. Written during the poets\u2019 escape to Belgium and then England, Romances sans paroles was published in March 1874. Verlaine received the first copies of his book in his prison cell. Just 21 poems in four sections, Romances sans had originally been dedicated to Rimbaud, but the dedication was subsequently dropped for being a provocation. The first section of nine poems, \u201cAriettes oubli\u00e9es,\u201d shows a change in Verlaine\u2019s tone. The poet confides in the reader in an allusive and nostalgic, familiar manner. Under the influence of Rimbaud, Verlaine discovered how the power of words enables the poet \u201cchanger la vie\u201d (to change life). The poems written while Verlaine and Rimbaud were in Belgium reveal the poets\u2019 amorous adventures on the road. Hence, in \u201cWalcourt,\u201d Verlaine writes:\n\nBriques et tuiles,\n\nO les charmants\n\nPetits asiles\n\nPour les amants!\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nGares prochaines,\n\nGais chemins grands . . .\n\nQuelles aubaines,\n\nBons juifs-errants!\n\n(Bricks and tiles,\n\nOh, charming cover\n\nSnug asylums\n\nFor the lovers\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nStations near,\n\nGay roads to choose . . .\n\nWhat windfalls here,\n\nGood wandering Jews?)\n\n\n\nThe poems also reveal Verlaine\u2019s mixed feelings of guilt and recrimination toward Mathilde and their unhappy marriage. One year after the publication of Romances sans paroles, Verlaine was released from his Parisian prison and left for London, where he worked as a French teacher. In 1879, after a quick trip to Paris, the poet left again for England, this time with a new friend and lover, Lucien L\u00e9tinois. A year later Verlaine bought a farm in the north of France for L\u00e9tinois. Madly in love and unconcerned with the promotion of his work, the poet soon had to sell the farm because of his debts.\n\n\n\nIn December 1880, Verlaine published Sagesse (Wisdom), which has come to be seen as a major work of his, as well as one of his most beautiful. Breaking with his debauched life, the poet distanced himself from Rimbaud and rejected his friend\u2019s \u201cpoetical and spiritual initiation\u201d to life. Sagesse comprises more than 40 poems, some religious, others profane, through which one can see Verlaine\u2019s torment and remorse; faced with new realities, the poet felt lonely and lost. Returning to Paris, he tried to reestablish contact with the French literary circles he had deserted some ten years earlier. He made unfruitful attempts to get back the clerk position that he once held. No one seemed to recognize him or wished to remember him. Through the efforts of some of his friends the poet at last found work and contributed to several Parisian literary journals: R\u00e9veil, Paris Moderne, Lut\u00e8ce, and Le Chat Noir. In 1883 L\u00e9tinois died of typhoid. The poet was profoundly affected and sank into depression and dissolution. He was repeatedly condemned for \u201coutrages aux bonnes moeurs\u201d (affronts to public decency), a serious offense at the time that could carry a heavy sentence in court.\n\n\n\nAs Rimbaud was gaining notoriety, Jadis et nagu\u00e8re (Recently and Formerly), Verlaine\u2019s next book of poems, was published in 1884, a few months before his divorce from Mathilde was pronounced. Hastily gathered, the poems of Jadis et nagu\u00e8re were born from the necessity for Verlaine to live on his writings and to capitalize on the poet\u2019s own growing fame. His sonnet \u201cLangueur\u201d (\u201cLanguor\u201d), published in Le Chat Noir (May 1883), became the ars poetica of the Decadents, a group of late-19th- and early-20th-century writers who held that art was superior to nature and that the finest beauty was that of dying or decaying things. Decadents attacked the accepted moral, ethical, and social standards of their time. Joris-Karl Huysmans, above all, contributed to the rise of Verlaine\u2019s fame. In his novel A rebours (1884; translated as Against the Grain, 1922) Huysmans writes of the \u201cvagues et d\u00e9licieuses confidences\u201d (vague and delicious confidences) of Verlaine\u2019s art. Verlaine, however, had already distanced himself from this style, and Huysmans\u2019s critique applies only to the last poems of Sagesse. Verlaine\u2019s conversion to Christianity and his wish to lead a quiet life dissolved readily.\n\n\n\nIn 1886 the sudden death of Verlaine\u2019s mother left him personally devastated and financially ruined. He never recovered. The same year, Rimbaud\u2019s Illuminations came out, with a preface by his former lover, whose health was rapidly deteriorating. In need of money and comfort, Verlaine published a new collection of poems, Amour (Love), in March 1888. The book seemed to stimulate little interest, although Banville wrote an enthusiastic letter about it to its author.\n\n\n\nThough reduced to total poverty and prone to heavy drinking, Verlaine reestablished contacts with the Parisian literary circles and gave several readings. In 1889 Verlaine published Parall\u00e8lement (Parallelism), a series of erotic and religious poems in which he draws a parallel between his debauched life and the innocence of religious life. In 1891, the year that Rimbaud died, Bonheur (Happiness), a collection of poems written over a period of four years, was published. Unlike any other of his books to that point, Bonheur displays a range of often-contradictory emotions. Religious poems are combined with others in which Verlaine insults Mathilde, yet the poet always manages to gain his reader\u2019s sympathy. That same year he published Chansons pour elle (Songs for Her), inspired by the affair that he had with a prostitute. \u201cSoyons scandaleux sans plus nous g\u00eaner\u201d (\u201cLet us not care and be scandalous\u201d), declared the poet, whose life was then drawing to an end.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1890s, suffering from illness and alcoholism, Verlaine spent several months in the hospital. By then recognized as a major French poet, his presence was requested for several conferences across Europe, in Leyde, Amsterdam, Brussels, Anvers, and Gand. The prospect for a successful tour was jeopardized by his health problems, however; his audiences could barely understand him when he spoke, since he was unable to articulate properly due to his alcoholism. In 1894 Verlaine published Dans les limbes (In the Limbs), announcing that he was no longer inspired to write and that the book would be his last. He published another collection of poems before his death, however\u2014Epigrammes (Epigrams, 1894)\u2014and completed two others, Chair (Flesh, 1896) and Invectives (Invectives, 1896).\n\n\n\nIn 1895, as he was dying, Verlaine was elected \u201cPrince des Po\u00e8tes\u201d (\u201cPrince of Poets\u201d) by the French literary world. A few days before his death, he published his last poem, \u201cMort\u201d (\u201cDeath\u201d). On January 8, 1896 he died of pulmonary congestion. 3,000 people attended his funeral two days later."}, {"url": "http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/hugo_jean.html", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot be responsible for the content of external web sites.\n\n\n\nAll images and text on this Jean Hugo page are copyright 1999-2015 by John Malyon/Specifica, Inc., unless otherwise noted.

He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/23993.Jean_Cocteau", "page_content": "Showing 30 distinct works.\n\nsort by popularity original publication year title average rating number of pages\n\nTwo Screenplays: The Blood of a Poet and The Testament of Orpheus\n\n* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.

He was born in Paris and died in his home at the Mas de Fourques, near Lunel, France. Brought up in a lively artistic environment, he began teaching himself drawing and painting and wrote essays and poetry from a very early age.

His grandfather, Charles Hugo was a journalist, pioneer of early photographic techniques and a campaigner against the death penalty, and his father Georges Hugo was a published author and a recognised painter. His paternal aunt was the socialite Jeanne Hugo.His mother, Pauline M\u00e9nard-Dorian, was the daughter of Paul-Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9nard, conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral and d\u00e9put\u00e9 of the H\u00e9rault department during the 1870s\u201380s, by his wife Aline Dorian, daughter of Pierre Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorian, minister of works during the siege of Paris.Jean Hugo was married twice, first in 1919 to Valentine Hugo (n\u00e9e Valentine Gross, no children from this civil marriage) and then in 1949 to Lauretta Hope-Nicholson, daughter of Hedley Hope-Nicholson. Jean Hugo and Lauretta had seven children: Charles Hugo (farmer), Marie Hugo (artist), Jean-Baptiste Hugo (artist), Ad\u00e8le Hugo (artist), Jeanne Hugo-Chabrol (teacher), Sophie Hugo-Lafont (librarian), L\u00e9opoldine Hugo (artist).Jean Hugo's half-brother Fran\u00e7ois Hugo designed limited-edition jewellery interpretations for Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Ernst and Coco Chanel during the '20s Modern period. Pierre Hugo \u2013 son of Fran\u00e7ois Hugo \u2013 is also a jewellery designer and has written a book about the artistic legacy of the Hugo family, Les Hugo \u2013 Un t\u00e9moignage (Rocher, France, 2007).PaintingsHugo is predominantly known for his sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often executed in small formats. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes and produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo designed the sets and costumes for Carl Theodor Dreyer's film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). His paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France \u2013 where there is a room dedicated to his paintings.Jean Hugo's painting is unique in the artistic panorama of the first half of the 20th century and maintains originality while evoking avant-garde themes of magical realism or metaphysical painting. At the start of the 1930s, in between na\u00efve and happy scenes and various theatrical projects \u2013 such as Jean Cocteau's Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel \u2013 he produced a series of works in brooding, unsettling, tones (Solitude, 1933).He showed an interest in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. His painting were based on the sketchbooks that he had with him at all times. He used to say that \"Inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it\".L'Imposteur (1931) concludes Hugo's first artistic period, which coincides with his move from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, following the death of his grandmother. This imposing painting is an assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Fran\u00e7ois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.In the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.Jean Hugo's work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories. He never felt the need to participate in the artistic debates of his time and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public.His auction record is $US308,200, for Les Plaisirs et les Jours, set at Fran\u00e7ois de Ricql\u00e8s' auction, Paris, on 26 November 1999.Selected exhibitionsHugo's work has been widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the USA.Jean Hugo and Max Jacob, Claridge Gallery, London, 1929The Art of Jean Hugo, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 1973Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Paul Val\u00e9ry, S\u00e8te, 1974Jean Hugo '77, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977Jean Hugo, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1977\u201378Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau, Sotheby's, London, 1981Jean Hugo: Costumes pour \"l'Homme qui rit\", Maison de Victor Hugo, Paris, 1984Jean Hugo: 1894\u20131984, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985Jean Hugo: palettes et souvenirs, Mus\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Dessins des ann\u00e9es de guerre (1915\u20131919), Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt Mus\u00e9e de la coop\u00e9ration franco-am\u00e9ricaine, 1994\u201395Jean Hugo: Une R\u00e9trospective, Pavillon du Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier, 1995Jean Hugo: a Retrospective, Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne, Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001Jean Hugo, le manuscrit enlumin\u00e9, Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9dard, Lunel, 2014Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien, Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014Published workLe Retour de l'enfant terrible: Lettres 1923\u20131966 by Jean Bourgoint, Jean Hugo, Jean Mouton (Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1975)Avant d'oublier (Before I Forget), autobiography (Fayard, 1976), was a humorous memoir of his family and a first-hand account of the 1920s French Surrealist movement.Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire (Actes Sud, 1983) \u2013 Jean Hugo's memoirs of the period from 1914 to 1945.

He was, and remains the very image of that perfect humility of the illuminators, for whom daily truths trumpeted decorative graces. His powerful hand, his big Jupiterian eye, his olympism in a way, did not use thunder but little watercolours so vast that it seemed as if their size was the result of a phenomenon of perspective. Indeed, he seems to view the sea in Brittany from a distance, and the garrigue by the big end of the telescope, which does not prevent him from evoking around us the mysterious odour of seaweed and wild herbs. Jean Hugo, subtle peasant, medieval monk, chases the angel from the bizarre through knowing all its tricks by heart.\"Gustave Thibon: \"I knew him intimately. He was a strange being, admirable, a mystic, a lover, a great artist, who no doubt sinned by excess of modesty. He had been a little tired of fame by his name, which was extremely heavy. [...]Jean Hugo spent his youth in that golden world of the big families of the Third Republic, the Berthelot, the Favre, the Renan, the Daudet, a world that he moved away from for a more isolated life in Lunel. His work is far better known, and valued, in America than in France, where he still suffers a little of being eclipsed by his name. I consider him a great painter, and a great painter that is relatively unknown. If he hadn't found others to look after publicising him, he would never have sold a single painting. Picasso, who was a good friend of his, used to say to him \"you do nothing for your fame\". And indeed he did nothing for it \u2013 others did it to him.Once again, he was a pure being. If the word innocence could be applied to anyone it was him. He was very handsome, and of prodigious vitality \u2013 dare I say Hugolian. He was detached enough not to install himself in his own name \u2013 while still showing unconditional admiration for the work of his great ancestor, that he knew in detail.\" Entretiens avec Gustave Thibon by Philippe Barthelet (\u00c9ditions du Rocher, Monaco, 2001)Maurice Sachs: \"Jean Hugo was calm, kind and generous. Life flowed calmly before him and we knew of no enemies of his. He carried the heavy burden of his family name with elegance. Like his father Georges Hugo he was a man of the world, a man of great distinction in heart and spirit, a kind friend, a man you would want to have in your life.\" La D\u00e9cade de l'illusion (Paris, Gallimard, 1950 pp. 14\u201316)Paul Morand: \"Jean Hugo's artistic temperament holds its own outside of all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the relaxation of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tales of a thousand and one nights.\"ReferencesExternal linksNew York Times Obituary \u2013 June 23, 1984 \"Jean Hugo, Artist, Dies at 89\"Presentation of the Jean Hugo room at the Musee Fabre, Montpellier (in French) Archived 21 September 2014 at the Wayback MachineJean Hugo paintings on WikiArtJean Hugo collection at the Barnes Foundationwebsite of Jean Hugo's home, the Mas de FourquesPast auction results for Jean Hugo at Christie's\n\n\n\nBiography from Wikipedia (see original) under licence CC BY-SA 3.0"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-cocteau", "page_content": "Jean Maurice Eug\u00e8ne Cl\u00e9ment Cocteau (French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 k\u0254kto]; 5 July 1889 \u2013 11 October 1963) was a French writer, designer, playwright, artist and filmmaker. Cocteau is best known for his novel Les Enfants Terribles (1929), and the films The Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents Terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946) and Orpheus (1949). His circle of associates, friends included Kenneth Anger, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Gertrude Stein, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Yul Brynner, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, Albert Gleizes, Igor Stravinsky, Marie Laurencin, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix, \u00c9dith Piaf, Panama Al Brown, Colette, Jean Genet, and Raymond Radiguet.\n\n\n\nCocteau was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, a town near Paris, to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family. His father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900\u20131904, Cocteau attended the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet where he met and began a physical relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos who would later reappear throughout Cocteau's oeuvre. He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, Aladdin's Lamp, at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as The Frivolous Prince, the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man \"to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...\"\n\n\n\nIn his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Maurice Barr\u00e8s. In 1912, he collaborated with L\u00e9on Bakst on Le Dieu bleu for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in Parade in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie, Francis Poulenc and Maurice Ravel. \"If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,\" wrote Cocteau, \"with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.\" He denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement. Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio Oedipus rex, which had its original performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 30 May 1927.\n\n\n\nAn important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Cocteau\u2019s artistic practice was closely tied to his roles as an instigator and patron of the visual and literary French avant-gardes, as well as a socialite.\n\nBorn into a cultured, bourgeois Parisian family, Cocteau belonged to an influential social network that also introduced him to important developments in modern art. In particular, during the years 1910\u201312, Cocteau met the writer Andr\u00e9 Gide, the aristocratic patron of modern painting and music Count Etienne de Beaumont, and the socialite and patron Misia Sert. Through Sert, he was introduced to the experimental world of the Ballets Russes, run by Sergei Diaghilev, which included the renowned dancer Vaslav Nijinsky as well as the composer Igor Stravinsky. In 1912 Cocteau became involved in the conception and staging of many groundbreaking Ballets Russes productions. His most celebrated early work, Parade, was conceived during a trip in Italy with Pablo Picasso, and was staged by Diaghilev at the Paris-based Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in May 1917. The ballet was a modernist fusion of the arts, bringing together a scenario by Cocteau, the music of Erik Satie, sets and costumes by Picasso, and choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. Among Cocteau\u2019s subsequent theatrical collaborations were Le Boeuf sur le toit, a short musical farce with music by Darius Milhaud and sets by Raoul Dufy that premiered in 1920, and Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, with a collective score by the group of young composers known as Les Six (Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, and Germaine Tailleferre) and designs by Jean Hugo, staged by the Ballets Su\u00e9dois in 1921.\n\nBy the 1920s Cocteau\u2019s writings and drawings, which he had started making around 1917, played a key role in modernism\u2019s return to classical themes. Like many other artists and poets during this time period, he demonstrated a renewed interest in Catholicism spearheaded by the philosopher Jacques Maritain. In 1925 Cocteau\u2019s first major drama, Orph\u00e9e, a synthesis of antiquity and modernism, fantasy and reality, reached the stage in Paris. The following year Cocteau published Le Rappel \u00e0 l\u2019ordre: discipline et libert\u00e9, the title of which has come to stand for the general trend toward classicism in the arts of the 1920s.\n\nFrom 1925, Cocteau stayed for extended periods in Villefranche-sur-Mer. There, he established connections with many artists and patrons living in the south of France and began to incorporate Mediterranean imagery into his work. With the financial backing of art patron Charles de Noailles, in 1930 Cocteau directed his first film, Le sang d\u2019un po\u00e8te, which marked the beginning of a long-lasting engagement with this medium. Though Cocteau was recognized as a prominent artist later in his life, he never stopped collaborating with more emerging talents, including the actor Jean Marais, who gained fame after starring in Cocteau\u2019s 1946 movie adaptation of La Belle et la b\u00eate, and the painter Raymond Moretti. In 1953, Cocteau served as president of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival and continued to work in film until late in his life; his final movie, Le Testament d'Orph\u00e9e, was produced by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut in 1960."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-cocteau", "page_content": "Jean Maurice Eug\u00e8ne Cl\u00e9ment Cocteau (French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 k\u0254kto]; 5 July 1889 \u2013 11 October 1963) was a French writer, designer, playwright, artist and filmmaker.

From 1900\u20131904, Cocteau attended the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet where he met and began a physical relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos who would later reappear throughout Cocteau's oeuvre. He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, Aladdin's Lamp, at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as The Frivolous Prince, the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man \"to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...\"\n\n\n\nIn his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Maurice Barr\u00e8s. In 1912, he collaborated with L\u00e9on Bakst on Le Dieu bleu for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in Parade in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie, Francis Poulenc and Maurice Ravel. \"If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,\" wrote Cocteau, \"with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.\" He denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement. Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio Oedipus rex, which had its original performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 30 May 1927.\n\n\n\nAn important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

He was the great- grandson of the poet and writer Victor Hugo (1802 \u2013 1885), and young Jean showed a keen interest in art and poetry from a very early age. His career spanned the period from the First World War, through the innovative and exciting Parisian inter-war years, up to his death in 1984. He mixed in artistic circles throughout his life, including Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Erik Satie, Marcel Proust, Max Jacob, Cecil Beaton and many other artists and writers.\n\nJean Hugo is predominantly known for his small, slightly na\u00efve paintings in either oil or gouache. He also illustrated books, designed theatre sets and costumes, and produced ceramics, murals and textile designs. His paintings are unique, following no particular 20th century movement, maintaining an authentic originality, evoking a very personal vision of both city and pastoral scenes, imbuing both with a certain magical quality. The writer Paul Morand said of his work, \u201cJean Hugo\u2019s artistic temperament holds it\u2019s own outside all fashions. His work reminds us of the marvels that the leisure of some prince of ancient times might have produced, as can be found in the tale of \u2018One Thousand and One Nights\u2019.\u201d\n\nJean Hugo\u2019s paintings can be viewed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadephia, and are also present in collections in London, Tokyo, Toronto, Paris, Marseille, and at the Mus\u00e9e Fabre in Montpelier, France. He died in 1984."}, {"url": "https://www.leightonfineart.co.uk/artist/jean-hugo/", "page_content": "Biography\n\nJean Hugo was the great-grandson of Victor Hugo. He was self-taught, and studied literature before devoting himself to painting. He related his experiences in World War I in The Perspective of Memory ( Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire). After the war he associated himself with Cocteau, Radiguet, the composers known as Group of Six ( Groupe des Six), as well as Satie, Max Jacob, Picasso, Diaghilev and Stravinsky. He was married to Valentine Gross. From the 1920s he turned towards religion, and in 1929 he retreated to Mas de Fourques, near Lunel. He became particularly known for his stagings of Victor Hugo\u2019s dramas. He had a romantic temperament, and was most at home with gouache, quicker to dry than oil, and thus more apt for capturing fleeting inspiration, and a more substantial medium than watercolour. He was able to adapt medieval and romantic sources to a more contemporary treatment. It was by means of this somewhat Baroque side of his imagination that he often brushed with Surrealism, as is evidenced in his humorous, strange costume and set designs which he conceived in 1921 for Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau. The latter was a production of the Swedish Ballet, for which he developed a whole comical series of \u20181900\u2019 characters, such as cyclists and bathers. He also designed for the ballet-pantomime Romeo and Juliet, mounted in 1924, by the company, Paris Evenings ( Soir\u00e9es de Paris). Both productions were conceived by Jean Cocteau. Hugo then withdrew to the Midi region, where he painted still-lifes, and gouache landscapes in lively tones of the Languedoc, England, Paris and Russia. He was also an imaginative illustrator, some of his compositions including Cheeks on Fire ( Les Joues en feu) by Raymond Radiguet; Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau and Climates ( Climats) by Andr\u00e9 Maurois, one of his strangest illustrative works. He also illustrated many other works, such as those of Max Jacob, P\u00e9guy, Ren\u00e9 Char and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet.\n\nIn 1994, a collection of his works was shown at the Mus\u00e9e-biblioth\u00e8que Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet in Al\u00e8s. In 1995, the Mus\u00e9e National de la Coop\u00e9ration Franco-Am\u00e9ricaine organised an exhibition at the Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt in Chauny of drawings executed at the front during World War I. A retrospective of his work was shown at the Maison de Victor Hugo in Paris in 1995, and another was presented at the Mus\u00e9e Fabre de Montpellier in the same year.\n\nMuseum and Gallery Holdings\n\nMontpellier (Mus.
