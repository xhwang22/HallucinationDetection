{"The Brown Box was a console that could be connected to a television set and used to play a variety of games.": [{"url": "https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/the-father-of-the-video-game-the-ralph-baer-prototypes-and-electronic-games/biography", "page_content": "Biography\n\n1923\n\nRalph Baer was born March 8, 1922, in Germany\u2014a dangerous time and place for Jewish children and their families. Baer faced increasing anti-Semitism growing up. The Nuremberg Laws\u2014a series of highly repressive measures passed in 1935 that deprived German Jews of political and social freedom\u2014forced him to leave school at age thirteen, though he pursued his studies on his own.\n\n\n\nUnlike so many during that time, the Baer family was fortunate to have the means to escape Germany for America months before Kristallnacht\u2014the Night of Broken Glass\u2014in 1938. On November 9 of that year, Nazi troops throughout Germany smashed windows of stores and homes owned by Jews and set fire to synagogues, injuring\u2014and even killing\u2014German citizens of Jewish decent. These state-sponsored, anti-Jewish riots are considered to be the start of the Holocaust. Because most of his mother\u2019s family had immigrated to the United States in 1895, there were plenty of relatives who were willing to sponsor Ralph Baer and his family, a key immigration law requirement in America at that time.\n\n\n\n1939 As a young immigrant, Baer had the freedom to choose his own future. He graduated as a radio service technician in 1940 and worked in the field for three years until he was drafted into the U.S. Army. He served one year stateside and two years overseas in Europe where he was assigned to Military Intelligence.\n\nAfter the war, Baer attended the American Television Institute of Technology in Chicago on the G.I. Bill. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television Engineering in 1949 and was consistently employed as an engineer afterwards. In 1955, he joined Sanders Associates, an electronics firm that did most of its work for the military.\n\nDuring this same period, Baer started his own family. He and Dena Whinston married in 1952 and they had three children: sons James (born 1955) and Mark (born 1957) and daughter Nancy (born 1960). To be closer to his family, Baer set up a lab in his basement to work on any after-hours projects.\n\n1944\n\nIn 1966, Baer had an epiphany while waiting at a bus stop. He remembered how, as a new graduate in 1951, he had proposed to the television company that employed him that they should build games into their brand of television sets to differentiate them from those of their competitors. The proposal was rejected, but, fifteen years later, Baer realized that the idea still had merit. By the 1960s, millions of Americans had invested in televisions for their homes, which meant that there was already a large potential market for a product that would allow them to interact with their television sets.\n\nThe next morning at work, Baer wrote a detailed four-page memo specifying his ideas, and how they could be applied, to convince his company to support a modest research and development project. Baer, in an oral history interview that can be found at the National Museum of American History\u2019s Archive Center, recalled that \u201cwhat stands out is the intent. I\u2019m in a military electronics company and I\u2019m starting to write a document\u2014it\u2019s a disclosure\u2014saying to myself, \u2018How do I write this? This has nothing to do with anything! I don\u2019t want anybody who reads this to get turned off.\u2019 So, I made it sound like it applied to whatever the hell it was I was supposed to be doing. So the first thing I don\u2019t do is call it a toy. But I can call it gaming.\u201d Gaming was a term regularly used in the military and gave the project the appearance of being within the company\u2019s scope of interest\n\nHowever, even Baer recognized that this was going to be a stretch. This was one of the reasons he intended video games to be a commercial product from the very start. He would later admit that \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to be embarrassed or what to be. . . . At Sanders, I was supposed to be running a division, not fussing around with TV games, which is what they were called for many years.\u201d\n\nFortunately, this did not deter Baer\u2019s supervisors. They agreed to a modest research project. In 1967, Baer with the assistance of Bob Tremblay, a technician who worked with Baer at Sanders, created the first of several video game test units. Called TVG#1 or TV Game Unit #1, the device, when used with an alignment generator, produced a dot on the television screen that could be manually controlled by the user.\n\nOnce Baer had established how it was possible to interact with the television set, he and his team, comprised of engineers William Harrison and William Rusch, were able to design and build increasingly sophisticated prototypes. Sanders senior management were impressed with Baer\u2019s progress and charged him with the task of turning this technology into a commercially viable product. After a few years and numerous tests and advancements, Baer and his colleagues developed a prototype for the first multiplayer, multiprogram video game system, nicknamed the \u201cBrown Box.\u201d Sanders licensed the Brown Box to Magnavox, which released the device as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972.\n\n\n\nBaer continued to be interested in video game development and to be involved in various projects, both acting for Sanders and under his own initiative. When Sanders decided they wanted to be more directly involved with the video game business, Baer led a team to develop a series of arcade games for them to license. He also encouraged Magnavox to improve Odyssey.\n\nWhen Coleco Telstar, another first-generation video game system, did not pass interference tests needed for Federal Communications Commission approval, the company turned to Sanders and Ralph Baer in hopes that Baer\u2019s experience would be able to help them. Baer found their solution within the week. Coleco received its FCC approval and Coleco Telstar sold over one million units in 1976.\n\nIn 1975, Baer began an independent consulting business, separate from his work at Sanders, to develop electronic toys and games. He partnered with Marvin Glass & Associates in Chicago, the toy design firm responsible for some of the most successful American toys of the 20th century, on several electronic games. The most successful of these was Simon, the electronic memory game. Baer officially retired from Sanders in 1987 to work full time on his consulting business. He continued to invent electronic toys and games until his passing on December 6, 2014.\n\n\n\nRalph Baer donated his video game prototypes, objects, notes, and schematics to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in 2006. In 2014, the Museum collected his workshop to become the landmark object for its Innovation Wing."}, {"url": "https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/31/the-history-of-gaming-an-evolving-community/", "page_content": "Since its commercial birth in the 1950s as a technological oddity at a science fair, gaming has blossomed into one of the most profitable entertainment industries in the world.\n\nThe mobile technology boom in recent years has revolutionized the industry and opened the doors to a new generation of gamers. Indeed, gaming has become so integrated with modern popular culture that now even grandmas know what Angry Birds is, and more than 42 percent of Americans are gamers and four out of five U.S. households have a console.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nThe first recognized example of a game machine was unveiled by Dr. Edward Uhler Condon at the New York World\u2019s Fair in 1940. The game, based on the ancient mathematical game of Nim, was played by about 50,000 people during the six months it was on display, with the computer reportedly winning more than 90 percent of the games.\n\nHowever, the first game system designed for commercial home use did not emerge until nearly three decades later, when Ralph Baer and his team released his prototype, the \u201cBrown Box,\u201d in 1967.\n\nThe \u201cBrown Box\u201d was a vacuum tube-circuit that could be connected to a television set and allowed two users to control cubes that chased each other on the screen. The \u201cBrown Box\u201d could be programmed to play a variety of games, including ping pong, checkers and four sports games. Using advanced technology for this time, added accessories included a lightgun for a target shooting game, and a special attachment used for a golf putting game.\n\nAccording to the National Museum of American History, Baer recalled, \u201cThe minute we played ping-pong, we knew we had a product. Before that we weren\u2019t too sure.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBrown Box\u201d was licensed to Magnavox, which released the system as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. It preceded Atari by a few months, which is often mistakenly thought of as the first games console.\n\nBetween August 1972 and 1975, when the Magnavox was discontinued, around 300,000 consoles were sold. Poor sales were blamed on mismanaged in-store marketing campaigns and the fact that home gaming was a relatively alien concept to the average American at this time.\n\nHowever mismanaged it might have been, this was the birth of the digital gaming we know today.\n\nOnward To Atari And Arcade Gaming\n\nSega and Taito were the first companies to pique the public\u2019s interest in arcade gaming when they released the electro-mechanical games Periscope and Crown Special Soccer in 1966 and 1967. In 1972, Atari (founded by Nolan Bushnell, the godfather of gaming) became the first gaming company to really set the benchmark for a large-scale gaming community.\n\nThe nature of the games sparked competition among players, who could record their high scores \u2026 and were determined to mark their space at the top of the list.\n\nAtari not only developed their games in-house, they also created a whole new industry around the \u201carcade,\u201d and in 1973, retailing at $1,095, Atari began to sell the first real electronic video game Pong, and arcade machines began emerging in bars, bowling alleys and shopping malls around the world. Tech-heads realized they were onto a big thing; between 1972 and 1985, more than 15 companies began to develop video games for the ever-expanding market.\n\nThe Roots Of Multiplayer Gaming As We Know It\n\nDuring the late 1970s, a number of chain restaurants around the U.S. started to install video games to capitalize on the hot new craze. The nature of the games sparked competition among players, who could record their high scores with their initials and were determined to mark their space at the top of the list. At this point, multiplayer gaming was limited to players competing on the same screen.\n\nThe first example of players competing on separate screens came in 1973 with \u201cEmpire\u201d \u2014 a strategic turn-based game for up to eight players \u2014 which was created for the PLATO network system. PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operation), was one of the first generalized computer-based teaching systems, originally built by the University of Illinois and later taken over by Control Data (CDC), who built the machines on which the system ran.\n\nAccording to usage logs from the PLATO system, users spent about 300,000 hours playing Empire between 1978 and 1985. In 1973, Jim Bowery released Spasim for PLATO \u2014 a 32-player space shooter \u2014 which is regarded as the first example of a 3D multiplayer game. While access to PLATO was limited to large organizations such as universities \u2014 and Atari \u2014 who could afford the computers and connections necessary to join the network, PLATO represents one of the first steps on the technological road to the Internet, and online multiplayer gaming as we know it today.\n\nAt this point, gaming was popular with the younger generations, and was a shared activity in that people competed for high-scores in arcades. However, most people would not have considered four out of every five American households having a games system as a probable reality.\n\nHome Gaming Becomes A Reality\n\nIn addition to gaming consoles becoming popular in commercial centers and chain restaurants in the U.S., the early 1970s also saw the advent of personal computers and mass-produced gaming consoles become a reality. Technological advancements, such as Intel\u2019s invention of the world\u2019s first microprocessor, led to the creation of games such as Gunfight in 1975, the first example of a multiplayer human-to-human combat shooter.\n\nWhile far from Call of Duty, Gunfight was a big deal when it first hit arcades. It came with a new style of gameplay, using one joystick to control movement and another for shooting direction \u2014 something that had never been seen before.\n\nAs home gaming and arcade gaming boomed, so too did the development of the gaming community.\n\nIn 1977, Atari released the Atari VCS (later known as the Atari 2600), but found sales slow, selling only 250,000 machines in its first year, then 550,000 in 1978 \u2014 well below the figures expected. The low sales have been blamed on the fact that Americans were still getting used to the idea of color TVs at home, the consoles were expensive and people were growing tired of Pong, Atari\u2019s most popular game.\n\nWhen it was released, the Atari VCS was only designed to play 10 simple challenge games, such as Pong, Outlaw and Tank. However, the console included an external ROM slot where game cartridges could be plugged in; the potential was quickly discovered by programmers around the world, who created games far outperforming the console\u2019s original designed.\n\nThe integration of the microprocessor also led to the release of Space Invaders for the Atari VCS in 1980, signifying a new era of gaming \u2014 and sales: Atari 2600 sales shot up to 2 million units in 1980.\n\nAs home and arcade gaming boomed, so too did the development of the gaming community. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the release of hobbyist magazines such as Creative Computing (1974), Computer and Video Games (1981) and Computer Gaming World (1981). These magazines created a sense of community, and offered a channel by which gamers could engage.\n\nPersonal Computers: Designing Games And Opening Up To A Wider Community\n\nThe video game boom caused by Space Invaders saw a huge number of new companies and consoles pop up, resulting in a period of market saturation. Too many gaming consoles, and too few interesting, engaging new games to play on them, eventually led to the 1983 North American video games crash, which saw huge losses, and truckloads of unpopular, poor-quality titles buried in the desert just to get rid of them. The gaming industry was in need of a change.\n\nAt more or less the same time that consoles started getting bad press, home computers like the Commodore Vic-20, the Commodore 64 and the Apple II started to grow in popularity. These new home computer systems were affordable for the average American, retailing at around $300 in the early 1980s (around $860 in today\u2019s money), and were advertised as the \u201csensible\u201d option for the whole family.\n\nThese home computers had much more powerful processors than the previous generation of consoles; this opened the door to a new level of gaming, with more complex, less linear games. They also offered the technology needed for gamers to create their own games with BASIC code. Even Bill Gates designed a game, called Donkey (a simple game that involved dodging donkeys on a highway while driving a sports car). Interestingly, the game was brought back from the dead as an iOS app back in 2012.\n\nWhile the game was described at the time as \u201ccrude and embarrassing\u201d by rivals at Apple, Gates included the game to inspire users to develop their own games and programs using the integrated BASIC code program.\n\nMagazines like Computer and Video Games and Gaming World provided BASIC source code for games and utility programs, which could be typed into early PCs. Games, programs and readers\u2019 code submissions were accepted and shared.\n\nIn addition to providing the means for more people to create their own game using code, early computers also paved the way for multiplayer gaming, a key milestone for the evolution of the gaming community.\n\nEarly computers such as the Macintosh, and some consoles such as the Atari ST, allowed users to connect their devices with other players as early as the late 1980s. In 1987, MidiMaze was released on the Atari ST and included a function by which up to 16 consoles could be linked by connecting one computer\u2019s MIDI-OUT port to the next computer\u2019s MIDI-IN port.\n\nWhile many users reported that more than four players at a time slowed the game dramatically and made it unstable, this was the first step toward the idea of a deathmatch, which exploded in popularity with the release of Doom in 1993 and is one of the most popular types of games today.\n\nThe real revolution in gaming came when LAN networks, and later the Internet, opened up multiplayer gaming.\n\nMultiplayer gaming over networks really took off with the release of Pathway to Darkness in 1993, and the \u201cLAN Party\u201d was born. LAN gaming grew more popular with the release of Marathon on the Macintosh in 1994 and especially after first-person multiplayer shooter Quake hit stores in 1996. By this point, the release of Windows 95 and affordable Ethernet cards brought networking to the Windows PC, further expanding the popularity of multiplayer LAN games.\n\nThe real revolution in gaming came when LAN networks, and later the Internet, opened up multiplayer gaming. Multiplayer gaming took the gaming community to a new level because it allowed fans to compete and interact from different computers, which improved the social aspect of gaming. This key step set the stage for the large-scale interactive gaming that modern gamers currently enjoy. On April 30, 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain, but it would be years before the Internet was powerful enough to accommodate gaming as we know it today.\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons/Evan-Amos\n\nThe Move To Online Gaming On Consoles\n\nLong before gaming giants Sega and Nintendo moved into the sphere of online gaming, many engineers attempted to utilize the power of telephone lines to transfer information between consoles.\n\nWilliam von Meister unveiled groundbreaking modem-transfer technology for the Atari 2600 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in 1982. The new device, the CVC GameLine, enabled users to download software and games using their fixed telephone connection and a cartridge that could be plugged in to their Atari console.\n\nThe device allowed users to \u201cdownload\u201d multiple games from programmers around the world, which could be played for free up to eight times; it also allowed users to download free games on their birthdays. Unfortunately, the device failed to gain support from the leading games manufacturers of the time, and was dealt a death-blow by the crash of 1983.\n\nReal advances in \u201conline\u201d gaming wouldn\u2019t take place until the release of 4th generation 16-bit-era consoles in the early 1990s, after the Internet as we know it became part of the public domain in 1993. In 1995 Nintendo released Satellaview, a satellite modem peripheral for Nintendo\u2019s Super Famicom console. The technology allowed users to download games, news and cheats hints directly to their console using satellites. Broadcasts continued until 2000, but the technology never made it out of Japan to the global market.\n\nAccessing the Internet was expensive at the turn of the millennium.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, Sega, Nintendo and Atari made a number of attempts to break into \u201conline\u201d gaming by using cable providers, but none of them really took off due to slow Internet capabilities and problems with cable providers. It wasn\u2019t until the release of the Sega Dreamcast, the world\u2019s first Internet-ready console, in 2000, that real advances were made in online gaming as we know it today. The Dreamcast came with an embedded 56 Kbps modem and a copy of the latest PlanetWeb browser, making Internet-based gaming a core part of its setup rather than just a quirky add-on used by a minority of users.\n\nThe Dreamcast was a truly revolutionary system, and was the first net-centric device to gain popularity. However, it also was a massive failure, which effectively put an end to Sega\u2019s console legacy. Accessing the Internet was expensive at the turn of the millennium, and Sega ended up footing huge bills as users used its PlanetWeb browser around the world.\n\nExperts related the console\u2019s failure to the Internet-focused technology being ahead of its time, as well as the rapid evolution of PC technology in the early 2000s \u2014 which led people to doubt the use of a console designed solely for gaming. Regardless of its failure, Dreamcast paved the way for the next generation of consoles, such as the Xbox. Released in the mid-2000s, the new console manufacturers learned from and improved the net-centric focus of the Dreamcast, making online functionality an integral part of the gaming industry.\n\nThe release of Runescape in 2001 was a game changer. MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) allows millions of players worldwide to play, interact and compete against fellow fans on the same platform. The games also include chat functions, allowing players to interact and communicate with other players whom they meet in-game. These games may seem outdated now, but they remain extremely popular within the dedicated gaming community.\n\nThe Modern Age Of Gaming\n\nSince the early 2000s, Internet capabilities have exploded and computer processor technology has improved at such a fast rate that every new batch of games, graphics and consoles seems to blow the previous generation out of the water. The cost of technology, servers and the Internet has dropped so far that Internet at lightning speeds is now accessible and commonplace, and 3.2 billion people across the globe have access to the Internet. According to the ESA Computer and video games industry report for 2015, at least 1.5 billion people with Internet access play video games.\n\nOnline storefronts such as Xbox Live Marketplace and the Wii Shop Channel have totally changed the way people buy games, update software and communicate and interact with other gamers, and networking services like Sony\u2019s PSN have helped online multiplayer gaming reach unbelievable new heights.\n\nEvery new batch of games, graphics and consoles seems to blow the previous generation out of the water.\n\nTechnology allows millions around the world to enjoy gaming as a shared activity. The recent ESA gaming report showed that 54 percent of frequent gamers feel their hobby helps them connect with friends, and 45 percent use gaming as a way to spend time with their family.\n\nBy the time of the Xbox 360 release, online multiplayer gaming was an integral part of the experience (especially \u201cdeathmatch\u201d games played against millions of peers around the world for games such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare). Nowadays, many games have an online component that vastly improves the gameplay experience and interactivity, often superseding the importance of the player\u2019s offline game objectives.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been told as a blanket expectation is that 90% of players who start your game will never see the end of it\u2026\u201d says Keith Fuller, a longtime production contractor for Activision.\n\nAs online first-person shooter games became more popular, gaming \u201cclans\u201d began to emerge around the world. A clan, guild or faction is an organized group of video gamers that regularly play together in multiplayer games. These games range from groups of a few friends to 4,000-person organizations with a broad range of structures, goals and members. Multiple online platforms exist, where clans are rated against each other and can organize battles and meet-ups online.\n\nThe Move Toward Mobile\n\nSince smartphones and app stores hit the market in 2007, gaming has undergone yet another rapid evolution that has changed not only the way people play games, but also brought gaming into the mainstream pop culture in a way never before seen. Rapid developments in mobile technology over the last decade have created an explosion of mobile gaming, which is set to overtake revenue from console-based gaming in 2015.\n\nThis huge shift in the gaming industry toward mobile, especially in Southeast Asia, has not only widened gaming demographics, but also pushed gaming to the forefront of media attention. Like the early gaming fans joining niche forums, today\u2019s users have rallied around mobile gaming, and the Internet, magazines and social media are full of commentaries of new games and industry gossip. As always, gamers\u2019 blogs and forums are filled with new game tips, and sites such as Macworld, Ars Technica and TouchArcade push games from lesser-known independent developers, as well as traditional gaming companies.\n\nThe gaming industry was previously monopolized by a handful of companies, but in recent years, companies such as Apple and Google have been sneaking their way up the rankings due to their games sales earnings from their app stores. The time-killing nature of mobile gaming is attractive to so many people who basic games such as Angry Birds made Rovio $200 million in 2012 alone, and broke two billion downloads in 2014.\n\nMore complex mass multiplayer mobile games such as Clash of Clans are bringing in huge sums each year, connecting millions of players around the world through their mobile device or League of Legends on the PC.\n\nThe Future\n\nThe move to mobile technology has defined the recent chapter of gaming, but while on-the-move gaming is well-suited to the busy lives of millennials, gaming on mobile devices also has its limitations. Phone screens are small (well, at least until the iPhone 6s came out), and processor speeds and internal memories on the majority of cellphones limit gameplay possibilities. According to a recent VentureBeat article, mobile gaming is already witnessing its first slump. Revenue growth has slowed, and the cost of doing business and distribution costs have risen dramatically over the last few years.\n\nAlthough mobile gaming has caused the death of hand-held gaming devices, consoles are still booming, and each new generation of console welcomes a new era of technology and capabilities. Two industries that could well play a key role in the future of gaming are virtual reality and artificial intelligence technology.\n\nThe next chapter for gaming is still unclear, but whatever happens, it is sure to be entertaining.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) company Oculus was acquired by Facebook in 2014, and is set to release its Rift headset in 2016. The headset seems to lean perfectly toward use within the video games industry, and would potentially allow gamers to \u201clive\u201d inside an interactive, immersive 3D world. The opportunities to create fully interactive, dynamic \u201cworlds\u201d for MMORPG, in which players could move around, interact with other players and experience the digital landscapes in a totally new dimension, could be within arms reach.\n\nThere have been a lot of advancements over the last few years in the world of language-processing artificial intelligence. In 2014, Google acquired Deep Mind; this year, IBM acquired AlchemyAPI, a leading provider in deep-learning technology; in October 2015, Apple made two AI acquisitions in less than a week. Two of the fields being developed are accuracy for voice recognition technology and open-ended dialogue with computers.\n\nThese advances could signify an amazing new chapter for gaming \u2014 especially if combined with VR, as they could allow games to interact with characters within games, who would be able to respond to questions and commands, with intelligent and seemingly natural responses. In the world of first-person shooters, sports games and strategy games, players could effectively command the computer to complete in-game tasks, as the computer would be able to understand commands through a headset due to advances in voice recognition accuracy.\n\nIf the changes that have occurred over the last century are anything to go by, it appears that gaming in 2025 will be almost unrecognizable to how it is today. Although Angry Birds has been a household name since its release in 2011, it is unlikely to be remembered as fondly as Space Invaders or Pong. Throughout its progression, gaming has seen multiple trends wane and tide, then be totally replaced by another technology.

[13]\n\nMagnavox contracted Nintendo, then a Japanese company that made a number of consumer goods including toys, to produce the light guns for the Magnavox Odyssey in 1971, adapting an existing Nintendo light gun toy for this purpose.[14][15][16]\n\nOn January the 27th, 1972 production of the Magnavox Odyssey began.[17]\n\nThe name Odyssey was chosen as a nod to the Stanley Kubrick film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[18]\n\nMagnavox launched the Magnavox Odyssey in May of 1972.[6][17] The cost of the Odyssey was $99.95,[18] which included 12 pack in games.[19]\n\nFor reasons unrelated to the Odyssey, Dutch company Philips acquired the American company Magnavox in 1974.[20][1] The Philips company was founded in 1891, making it among the oldest companies to have a large involvement in the gaming industry.[21][22]\n\nThe Magnavox Odyssey 100 was released in 1975, with used four integrated circuits to greatly simplify hardware.[23]\n\nProduction of the Magnavox Odyssey ended in 1975.[24] The console was followed by the Odyssey series of dedicated consoles. The console would later receive a proper followup in the Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2.\n\nThe Magnavox Odyssey sold less then 100,000 consoles it's first year and about 350,000 total[25] due to poor marketing.[6] Magnavox salespeople would often incorrectly imply that a Magnavox Television was required to use the console to sell more Magnavox televisions, despite it's compatibility with nearly all televisions.[26][27]\n\nThe Magnavox Odyssey would inspire Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell to have his company make Pong, eventually leading Magnavox to take legal action against Atari.[27][28]\n\nIn 1973, following the launch of the Odyssey, Baer demonstrated a concept All Purpose Box console pioneered a number of concepts which are now common.[29] The Multimedia Box would run games, including some which could be advertiser supported, educational content, and mail order shopping.[29]\n\nIn 2021 Handball for the Brown Box prototype would be the first video game to be depicted on currency produced by the United States Mint.[30]\n\nBecause it is commonly recognized as the first home game console, the Magnavox Odyssey is also nearly universally categorized as a first generation console.\n\nDue to it's wildly different technical architecture, and a reliance on physical objects, accurate emulation of the Odyssey relies on much different techniques compared to standard emulators.\n\nIn 2017 a team at the University of Pittsburgh began working to preserve Odyssey related materials.[31]\n\nTable Tennis on the Odyssey. Overlays were used to make the limited graphical capabilities of the Odyssey more expressive.\n\nThe Magnavox Odyssey lacked a computer, instead using analog circuitry and game cards that manipulate internal jumpers to achieve desired results.[32][33] Display output was limited to a line and three white blocks[27], so color overlays and physical items were used to enhance gameplay.[34] Overlays attached to the CRT televisions via either the static electricity generated by the television, or manually with tape.[35]\n\nThe system is powered by six C type batteries.[36], though an optional AC adapter was available.[37] Inserting a game card turned on the power, so the unit lacks a power button.[38]\n\nBecause the Odyssey lacked a computer, and was primarily a graphics generating device, games for the Magnavox Odyssey were simple, and were often versions of real sports like tennis.[39] Other games included a US Geography quiz game, and a roulette game.[39] No matter the game, the Odyssey relies a lot on its players to use their imaginations, as well do things like keep score or enforce rules.\n\nThe front of the Odyssey.

The following morning, he turned his notes that he written down into a four-page paper which described the idea of playing television games on a home television set. The document listed various types of games that might be playable using a standard television set, such as action games, board games, sports games, chase games and many others. Baer was creating what is now known as video game genres even before a system was created. The four paged document is now located at the Smithsonian along with all of the game hardware that was created over the next three years.\n\nWhat Baer originally had in mind was to develop a small game box that would play simplistic games and perhaps cost $25 at retail. He asked one of the engineers in his division at Sanders Associates to read, date and sign the document he created as this was a standard procedure to establish a legal record. This document was used years later in 1974 in Federal Courts in Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Ottawa and many other cities in pursuit of patent infringement which would result in millions of dollars changing hands.\n\nSanders Associates was a military electronics company and video games had absolutely nothing to do with the normal business of developing complex military electronic systems. At the time Baer was a Division Manager and Chief Engineer for Equipment Design at Sanders where he ran eight departments with up to 500 technical and support personnel. He also supervised much of the internal research and development work at Sanders. Baer was running a large operation at the time and could afford to utilize a technician to do some experimental work without affecting his division\u2019s productivity. After a few demonstrations to the Corporate Director of Research & Development at Sanders it wasn\u2019t long before the project became official and would eventually payoff very handsomely for Sanders.\n\nThe development of the gaming device continued through 1968 with most of the work being done by two engineers, Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch. Both of these engineers made important contributions to the game concept as Baer supervised the activity which was being done at Sanders Canal Street building in Nashua, New Hampshire. Several game systems were developed which allowed them to play different types of sports games such as Ping-Pong, volleyball, handball, soccer, hockey and several others. They also developed a light-gun which could be used to shoot at targets on the screen of the television set. Though this was not the first light gun game it was the first light gun developed to work on a television set, the first to be used in a video game and was the first video game peripheral.\n\nBy late 1968 Baer finished building their final demonstration game system, the \u201cBrown Box\u201d. It was switch programmable and played a large number of sports, maze and quiz games. The system also had several games based on the light-gun which was created and gave the ability to shoot at stationary or moving targets displayed on the screen.\n\nThe system was finally complete and the technology that went into the system was something that could be massed produced at a reasonable cost to allow for it to be marketed to the general public. Baer tried to introduce video games to the cable television industry in 1968 but was not successful. He then proceeded to approach American television manufacturers throughout 1969 in hopes that they would be interested in this new concept. The \u201cBrown Box\u201d was demonstrated to representatives at RCA, Sylvania, GE and Motorola but no one was willing to take the risk involved in marketing the new concept to the general public.\n\nRepresentatives from Magnavox went to Sanders Associates in Nashua, New Hampshire where Baer and his team demonstrated the \u201cBrown Box\u201d for them. The reactions were overwhelmingly favorable but still it was seen as a large risk for Magnavox and they held off on moving forward. Two years later in 1971 Magnavox revisited the idea of television gaming and finally took a license from Sander Associates. Their 1972 Odyssey home video game system, a production engineered version of the \u201cBrown Box\u201d was the result. This was the first home video game console and was the beginning of the home video game market which is now a multibillion-dollar industry."}, {"url": "https://www.tellmebest.com/history-of-gaming-consoles/", "page_content": "The history of gaming consoles takes on a decades-long journey from the first video game to the hundred billion dollar industry we have today\n\nBy Doug Norrie |\n\nThe video gaming world has become an industry that does hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year and is only growing. In many ways, video gaming is ubiquitous in our everyday life, taking place in nearly every aspect of the online world. What started as something that could only be played on a few select computers in the world, is now something that you see in every nook and cranny of our lives. But where did it all start? What is the history of gaming consoles and how did they end up becoming so pervasive and captivating?\n\nIt\u2019s a somewhat winding path but going back to the beginning helps to see how we\u2019ve gotten to this place. Here at Tell Me Best, we\u2019ll take a look at the history of gaming consoles to see how it became the industry it is today.\n\nWHAT WAS THE FIRST VIDEO GAME?\n\nWhen we think of the history of gaming consoles, or at least their origins, it\u2019s easy to conjure up an image of Pong, that 1972 game from Atari which is the basic representation of two sides of a controller \u201cbattling\u201d it out for dot supremacy. But what\u2019s probably not known is that a version of this game was actually created about a decade and a half earlier by a dude named William Higinbotham who was working with early computers in a variety of fashions.\n\nHe first created Tennis for Two in 1958 and put it on display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for a three-day exhibition. As would become a hallmark of the video game industry, really forever, kids freaking loved this thing. Sure, it was played on a computer the size of a big microwave and had a screen that more represented a radar readout than what we know now, but in many ways, the video game industry was born here.\n\nWhile this game was only on display at the Brookhaven for a total of three days, it was a major hit among the crowd. It was reported at the time that folks, and especially teenagers, were very into the idea and the concept of competing in a game this way. Essentially, the mechanics and setup for Tennis for Two weren\u2019t all that dissimilar from what we know and love today. The computer was set up and had \u201ccontrollers\u201d the users wielded to dictate the action on the screen. With one hand they would turn a knob to move what was basically the paddle, and the button determined the speed at which they would \u201chit\u201d the ball. In the history of gaming consoles, this is an origin story.\n\nHiginbotham came up with the concept after having spent years working in high-end computer and scientific development. He\u2019d also had a hand in the Manhattan Project. And he realized that the computer-controlled readouts for incoming missiles (or theoretical missiles at least) had a function that would change the direction of the projectile if there was wind present. Basically, he used this idea and changed the missile to the \u201cball\u201d and the wind was now controlled by the players. A computer game was born.\n\nUnfortunately, while it would have seemed like this game would immediately become the next big technological thing, heading into mass production for the population who might have been dying to get their collective hands on the next video game, this was anything but the case. In fact, quite the opposite ended up happening, giving the history of gaming consoles a weird start.\n\nAfter the next year\u2019s exhibition, the group saw fit to use the video game computer parts on other projects. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cthis game will rot your brain out\u201d moment, but it just didn\u2019t seem like Higinbotham or Brookhaven necessarily saw the long-term and commercial viability of such a game. Using it for spare parts and other initiatives became that first game\u2019s fate.\n\nNEXT BIG MOVE, BUT STILL NO GAMING CONSOLE\n\nWhat would the history of gaming consoles be without the marriage of technology with the science fiction element? I would contend the two are completely interlinked and interconnected. Sure, the first console focused on \u201csports\u201d but by the time we were ready to start ramping things up, fighting off aliens was the place to go. And the other place to go was MIT where a group of students was at work building SpaceWar! in 1962. Because what else would they be doing?\n\nKidding aside, this MIT group led by Steve Russell was using a PDP-1 from Digital Equipment Corporation and they developed what amounted to what would eventually look like some of the early space games on video game consoles. Basically, using a screen not unlike what we saw with Tennis for Two, two players are engaged in a space battle, moving around the gravitational pull of a \u201cstar\u201d and trying to shoot each other down. You can see an approximation of the early game below in what is a touchpoint in the history of gaming consoles.\n\nWere you glued to the edge of your seat for the non-stop action of SpaceWar!? Me too. The game caught on quickly among other students and universities in the area who had similar access to the PDP-1 on campuses. This game was developed in such a way that it could be brought to other machines and the code was open source, so those who sought it out could put it on their own systems. SpaceWar! was passed around gaming communities for the better part of the 1960s though its creator Steve Russell never saw any licensing money from its \u201cgrowth\u201d such as it were. But the mechanics and theme were something we would see in later years, acting as something of a baseline in the history of gaming consoles.\n\nFIRST AT-HOME VIDEO GAME CONSOLE\n\nNow we\u2019re starting to cook with digital grease. It was in 1967 that the history of gaming consoles really starts to move ahead. That\u2019s because it was during this time that the famous \u201cBrown Box\u201d was sold to Magnavox and the gaming industry went from crawling to walking fast. The Brown Box was created by Ralph Baer who some would end up calling the Father of Video Games. That\u2019s because Baer figured out something that his predecessors either hadn\u2019t cared about or never thought of themselves.\n\nHe sought to make a device that could connect and interact with television sets. It seems easy to think about this now as a \u201cduh\u201d moment, but remember at the time there wasn\u2019t really a logical connection between the worlds of computers and televisions. They had decidedly different purposes.\n\nBaer and his team ended up figuring out a way to connect a gaming console (The Brown Box) to television sets and programmed it so that players could control the movement of a ball on a screen. It wasn\u2019t dissimilar to the concepts put forth with Tennis for Two and SpaceWar! except that those two games needed specific (and not all that popular) computer systems to play. Baer\u2019s box could be reproduced and it could connect to television sets in households. In the history of gaming consoles, this is an inflection point.\n\nBaer sold this to Magnavox who worked to bring about the video gaming console to the masses in the form of an at-home device anyone could hook up and play. It was a smashing success right? Turning Magnavox into a billion-dollar company because they were at the forefront of one of the biggest commercial movements ever, right? Wrong. The company fizzled in its approach to selling its Odyssey product to the masses. Only 350,000 units were sold in total. The high price point and some confusion about mechanics (or what you were even supposed to do) saw to it that the console never caught on.\n\nATARI FIGURES IT OUT\n\nWhen thinking about the history of gaming consoles, most would probably put Atari as the starting point. This is for a few pretty easy reasons. If you are of a certain age and remember when this kind of thing began to gain real traction in homes, Atari is typically the first console to come to mind. It was the first to bring on a number of different, commercially viable, and popular games into homes across the United States (and the world). And it laid the groundwork for the gaming console wars that would soon follow.\n\nThough Magnavox was a dud, it did inspire a late-70s boom in arcade gaming with coin-op machines beginning to roll out into different locations. It was an important point in the history of gaming consoles because it essentially brought the medium into the zeitgeist. This put video games in front of more eyes and also laid the groundwork for Atari to bring the model to full scale. Capitalizing on the early success of the coin-op version of Pong as well as some other games, Atari began to manufacture their Atari 2600 in the late 1970s.\n\nWhat set the Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS) apart from the first generation in the history of gaming consoles was the introduction of the cartridge into the model. This was something taking off within the industry at the time and key to the growth of the computer game model. Basically, once someone owned the 2600 console, they could then play a variety of games as long as they purchased the different cartridges. Storing each game\u2019s code on its own, portable cartridge kick-started a whole new wave of growth and this is when we saw coin-op games like Space Invaders, Pong, and Asteroids make their way into homes.\n\nIt was an \u201ceasy\u201d 1-to-1 transition because those games had already established significant brand recognition in arcades and the like. This is just one example in the history of gaming consoles in which we saw the outside name brought into the at-home experience.\n\nWhile Atari was far from the only gaming console during this time, it was the most popular. Over the course of its entire run, more than 30 million Atari 2600 units were sold worldwide, igniting a number of other companies to begin trying the same thing. The uptick in the competition ended up saturating the market though, causing something like a video game console bubble in the early 1980s. Though some companies didn\u2019t make it through the crash, there were a few left standing and one was primed to take hold of the whole industry.\n\nSUPER MARIO AND NINTENDO TAKE HOLD\n\nIt was in 1985 that a little piece of 8-bit glory in the form of a little gray box began to hit shelves in the United States. That was the Nintendo Entertainment System which had already begun to make waves in Japan. If Atari helped the gaming console to start walking, Nintendo is where things took off at a dead sprint. Not only was Nintendo able to fully \u201ccolorize\u201d the gaming industry in homes, but it also brought over a wealth of games almost from the jump. Users and consumers getting their hands on the box for the first time had an assortment of games to choose from that were already gaining massive (and I mean massive) popularity. Some of those first game characters and names still ring out today almost 40 years later, a testament to what Nintendo created at the time.\n\nWhile Nintendo had started making in-roads into the American consumer system in the 1980s with a variety of products that included arcade games as well as a quasi-computer setup meant to hook to televisions, the real moment was when NES hit stands. One reason the company was so successful following what amounted to an industry crash in previous years, was the time and care they took in approving games that could be on the system.\n\nThey blamed the previous generation\u2019s failings on allowing just about anything to hit a console. That wasn\u2019t the case with Nintendo. It led to Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt being part of the original game pack with 15 other games available at the time of its release. And man did it ever take hold of America\u2019s youth.\n\nIf you want to see a hilarious, though nostalgically accurate, representation of just how much Nintendo gripped the imagination of American youth in the 1980s, go and check out 8-Bit Christmas on HBO Max. Starring Neil Patrick Harris, the movie takes a fictional look at a group of kids trying to get their hands on the Nintendo during the Christmas rush of this time period. In all, 1.1 million NES units were sold in just 1986, accounting for more than 30% of the global market.\n\nVIDEO GAMING CONSOLES IN YOUR HANDS\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo took its show on the proverbial road when it introduced Game Boy and ensured that you would see puzzle-like block stacking in your dreams. That\u2019s because Tetris was the first game for the new, battery-powered handheld system and this brought in a new wave of video gaming.\n\nNo longer confined to living rooms or bedrooms, the Game Boy was part of the ecosystem which meant gamers could bring their games with them and tune out the rest of the world. Oh, the glory. Game Boy would go through a number of different iterations over the years, building out its own library of games for that specific system. They took off and have maintained popularity over the years. As of this writing, more than 118 million Game Boy units have been sold worldwide.\n\nTHE GAMING CONSOLE WARS\n\nWith Nintendo proving the commercial viability of the home video gaming console it was time for the next big player to enter the market. Sega had been hanging around the space for years, so they weren\u2019t necessarily some plucky little upstart. But by the late 1980s and early 1990s, they began to make a push to take some of Nintendo\u2019s overwhelming market share. And they were able to do just that.\n\nThis time period saw major competition between the two outfits with Nintendo releasing the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega rivaling it with Sega Genesis. Battle lines were being drawn. And unlike the crash of the 1980s, the market was big enough to essentially sustain both systems even if they were in fierce competition.\n\n8-bit graphics were so yesterday and now 16-bit graphics were the wave of the future. Both systems worked to greatly increase the user experience with games that looked light-years better than their predecessors. There were other companies kind of thrown in here with TurboGrafx-16 and Atari 7800 trying to take market share. But those paled in comparison to the big kids on the block. Sega released Sonic the Hedgehog as their gaming console add-in at purchase, a character that is still alive and speeding on the big screen today.\n\nDuring the video game console wars, massive numbers of units were sold between these two outfits. It\u2019s estimated that SNES sold about 49 million units with Genesis moving about 31 million. Those combined for about 89% of the overall market share of video game consoles in a four-year stretch. These two were dominating.\n\nSONY ENTERS THE HISTORY OF GAMING CONSOLES\n\nWhile Sega and Nintendo showed market dominance for the better part of the 1990s, there was another company about to make a major leap into the space and exert its strength on the industry. That was Sony who in 1995 released their Playstation console to rival that of the Nintendo64 and Sega Genesis. To say it worked is a complete understatement. Playstation quickly became an industry leader with Sony leveraging its technological footing to produce a fantastic system and a wealth of games to go along with it. Between Playstation and Playstation 2 five years later, the company moved more than 257 million units at somewhere between $200 and $300 a pop. Some back-of-the-napkin math on that put the company well into the many billions in profit.\n\nBesides just the graphic element, which Sony Playstation was winning the way with, they also made it a point to develop games that could be played for much longer stretches with considerably more backstory. It wasn\u2019t the only piece of the puzzle here, but it certainly helped with time spent using the console.\n\nRole-playing games, which had already been around gained significantly more popularity during this time and this next generation started to get a little closer to what we see today with game style and graphic elements. Sony has never really loosened its grip on the industry either seeing as how they remain at basically the top of the mountain. They are now on their fifth iteration of the Playstation system.\n\nA THREE-TEAM RACE FOR GAMING CONSOLES\n\nThe early and mid-2000s would see further market consolidation when it came to video game consoles. With Sega out of the mix, and moving more to a third-party development route, there were basically three groups left standing. Microsoft joined the fray with the XBOX 360 2005 and promptly moved close to 85 million units. Playstation was on version number three and still dominating sales. And Nintendo switched over to the Nintendo Wii which offered a differing approach to the console game with its user-interactive, motion-control remote. It gained enormous popularity early in its divergent approach to the competition, ushering in a new group of games meant to more simulated real-world actions.\n\nAround this time, Nintendo would also step it up with the Nintendo Switch, a handheld console that gained enormous popularity as well. Bringing the controller essentially into a portable system with excellent graphics gave gamers a chance to almost fully recreate the at-home system as they moved around the world.\n\nCURRENT STATE OF VIDEO GAMING\n\nThese days there are still the major players on the block with Sony and Microsoft continuing to duke it out in the console space. Though computers have taken a major footing here as well with the traditional console approach becoming something of a hybrid model. These two places for gaming now have turned an ever-growing market into a full-blown ecosystem with even a foray into virtual reality. Check out our Best Oculus Quest 2 Games for that list.\n\nThe gaming industry accounted for around $155 billion (you read that correctly) in revenue in 2020 with estimates it will hit well over $250 billion in the next few years. The history of video game consoles has been building towards this over the last many decades and there is no end in sight. Though new players may come along, and the Metaverse and its contemporaries (for lack of a better word) taking hold as part of the overall experience, there could be a shift away from the traditional console. But the gaming industry itself is doing just fine. It has some of those first pioneers and innovators to thank for where it is now."}, {"url": "https://ultimatehistoryvideogames.jimdofree.com/brown-box", "page_content": "Brown Box\n\nTrivia:\n\n1) First game console prototype created by Ralph H.

The game cards do not contain any components, but have a series of \"jumpers\" \u2014 simple electrical connections \u2014 between pins of the card connector. These jumpers interconnect different logic and signal generators in the console to produce the desired game logic and screen output.\n\n5) In late 1967 the \"Chase\" game got a machine-controlled third dot, as well as compatibility with the first ever \u2018light-gun\u2019 peripheral.

Sales for the console were hurt by poor marketing and misinformation as many consumers believed that the Odyssey would only work on a Magnavox brand television. This led to other consoles in the future writing an explanation on their box saying \u201cWorks on any television set, black and white or color\u201d to avoid any confusion. Magnavox restricted the sales of the Odyssey to Magnavox franchised dealer stores only which narrowed the potential sales base considerably as the system was not widely available in many areas. Magnavox also mismanaged the sale of the additional game packs and system add-ons as sales personnel were not educated on the Odyssey. Magnavox discontinued the Odyssey in 1975 after releasing 12 game cards with the ability to play 28 games in total during the system\u2019s lifespan.\n\nAtari was extremely successful in the video arcade market so they decided the next logical step was to expand into the home video game market. It was 1974 when Atari started to design a home version of \u201cPong\u201d an idea that was proposed by engineer Harold Lee. At the time there was only one company in the home video game market which was Magnavox. With the Odyssey\u2019s not being adopted by many customers mainly due to the misconception of it only being compatible with Magnavox television sets it seemed like the perfect time for Atari to take a stab at the home video game market.\n\nAtari was able to incorporate advance features into their \u201cPong\u201d home console that gave them an edge of their competitors. The system used a single chip that provided the game with digital onscreen scoring and sound.\n\nIn 1975, Atari started looking for ways to distribute their new home \u201cPong\u201d system but it wasn\u2019t easy finding a distributor due to the track record that Magnavox had with the Odyssey. Retailers felt the price of the system was too expensive to draw an interest from the general public. After being rejected by numerous toys and electronics manufacturers Atari tried contacting Sears & Roebuck to see if they would have any better luck trying to work out distribution agreement. They were directed to Tom Quinn who was the buyer for Sears\u2019 sporting goods department and he expressed interest but wanted the system demonstrated for a few executives first. Al Alcorn travelled to Chicago to demonstrate the pong home system prototype for the Sears executives and despite some minor technical issues with the prototype was able to obtain their approval.\n\nNow that the executives gave their blessing, Quinn started to work with Nolan Bushnell to see if they could reach an agreement. Quinn wanted exclusive rights to the system as well as 150,000 systems units before the holiday season. Bushnell agreed to the terms even though he knew that Atari would not be able to produce 150,000 units with their current facility. Atari acquired a new factory through funding by venture capitalist Don Valentine in order to produce the promised 150,000 units for Sears. In the end Atari was able to fulfill the order for Sears. All systems manufactured in 1975 were branded with Sears\u2019 \u201cTele-Games\u201d name but in 1976 Atari started releasing a version under their own brand name."}, {"url": "https://www.pcmag.com/news/infographic-evolution-of-the-console-from-brown-box-to-wii-u", "page_content": "Quick: What was the original video game console? Nope, not the Atari 2600, or even the popular Nintendo NES from the '80s.\n\nIn fact, the very first console dates back to 1967, when \"The Brown Box\" was released, five years before the Magnavox Odyssey launched in the early '70s, according to RIPT Apparel(Opens in a new window), which compiled a complete history of video game consoles into a tidy timeline (see below).\n\nHome video games didn't take off until about 1973, when Atari's Pong arcade machine became so popular that the company decided to market the game as a home console two years later.\n\nIn the same year, Magnavox developed the Odyssey 100 and 200, in an effort to improve upon its former system. The TV manufacturer continued to release more Odyssey boxes, turning out the 300, 400, and 500 series in 1976. They were overshadowed the next year, though, when Atari's iconic 2600 hit the market.\n\nNintendo, meanwhile, delivered its first console with 1978's Color TV Game Series, which, according to RIPT Apparel, followed the Atari Pong-style games and was only available for sale in Japan.\n\nCabbage Patch Kids maker Coleco had a decent run in the late '70s, pushing out five consoles in two years, and also introduced a line of ROM cartridges for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision before exiting the video game business in a few years later.\n\n\"As the struggle for domination continues between Nintendo and Sega, each of them released brand new consoles to challenge each other's positions,\" RIPT said, pointing to the classic Nintendo Entertainment System (1983) and the No. 1 console of its time, the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1988).\n\nTwo years later, the Super NES system rang in a new decade with massive competition.\n\nThe first few years of the '90s marked what RIPT called a \"notable shift in the medium used for storing games,\" moving from cartridges to the more modern compact discs, helping to increase the capacity for video gaming and prompting a transition from 2D graphics to 3D.\n\nSony finally entered the console fight in 1994 when it introduced the Playstation, competing for interest along with the cartridge-based Sega Genesis 2 and 3 (released in 1994 and '97, respectively), and the new Sega Saturn, aimed at rivaling other CD-compatible consoles. Nintendo stuck with the cartridge system for its Nintendo 64, which hit shelves in the mid '90s.\n\nIn 1998, Sega became an Internet-gaming pioneer with the Sega Dreamcast's built-in modem for online playing. By the new millennium, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo began taking over the market, with the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, respectively.\n\n\"Finally, the current generation of video game console only has room for three major competitors: Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii,\" RIPT said. With the first two's full 1080p HD graphics and the Wii's innovative movement-sensing remote, \"it seems that video gaming had indeed come a long, long way,\" the graphic said.\n\nFor a full look at the decades-spanning video game industry, check out RIPT Apparel's infographic below.

The first video game that was made popular in the 1960s was Pong. It was 1966 when the first video game was designed by a man named Ralph Baer. He built seven prototypes that each played multiple video games.\n\nThe first game to be designed by Ralph Baer was called Chase Game, and consisted of a pair of squares that chased each other around the screen. It was a two-player game where one player could control each square. Before he designed this game, he kept a record of four different games he felt could be played on a video game system. The games were divided into the categories of board games, chasing games, sports games and action games. Players had a choice of tennis, ping-pong, volleyball and handball games.\n\nIn 1968, Baer and a co-worker built a prototype called the Brown Box, which allowed people to play target shot games and Ball & Paddle games. The Brown Box was considered the first ever video game console. Baer also built Corndog, the first video game that could be played on a television set. Brown Box was later purchased by the Magnavox company and the first batch was released to consumers in 1972. Magnavox renamed it the Odyssey.\n\nUnlike modern day game systems, the Odyssey did not use processors. Instead it used circuits that were hardwired, as well as D-cells. The game cartridges had just a few wires that would communicate with the needed components in the video game console. These consoles were able to support games that could be played by multiple people simultaneously. At that time, players had to make note of their own scores in the game, because the console did not have the ability to handle keeping and displaying each person\u2019s score.\n\nToday\u2019s video game consoles provide a rich soundtrack and stunning graphics, but in the days of the Brown Box, game consoles had primitive graphics and no sound. Lines and white dots were the only graphics to be found in the games designed for the Brown Box. Due to the lack of graphics built into the game, the company included clear screen overlays which players could put on their TV screen to have a colored background. Games such as table tennis did not require a background, but many games did. The overlays were available for TV screens that were 23-25 inches long and for screens that were 18-21 inches long.\n\nVideo games of today include text when it is needed. However, the video games of the 1960s did not have elaborate texts because the technology to support them had not been discovered yet. This means that certain video games came with game cards, much like a board game would. The six game cards that came with the system included Table Tennis, Simon Says, Tennis, Hockey & Football, Cat and Mouse, Submarine and Roulette. Score cards were also included with each game so scores could be kept manually because the console did not have the ability to save game progress.\n\nWhen compared to the Brown Box, the game consoles of today (PlayStation 3, XBox 360, etc) are super-advanced technology. All of today\u2019s game consoles support realistic looking graphics and sound effects game designers of the 1960s could only dream of. Today, players can customize game characters, choose their own weapons and even use his or her body as the game controller. Today\u2019s consoles contain a hard drive and, in some cases, a WIFI connection that allows players to interact with other players all over the world. The PlayStation 3 uses a cell processor to power the console and comes with 256MB of RAM.\n\nPopular video games today fall into the categories of action, role-playing, strategy and simulation. Video games are much more advanced than they were in the past and they are a lot more interactive as well. Most games have dozens, if not hundreds of levels to keep players coming back for more. This is drastically different than the video games of the 1960s. Popular games of today include the Resident Evil series, Grand Theft Auto and Counterstrike. These games can be played on most consoles available today.\n\nThese days, the various game consoles available serve as competition for each other. This competition did not consist in the 1960s because the Maganvox Odyssey was the only console available until Atari came along."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/electronic-game", "page_content": "electronic game , also called computer game or video game , any interactive game operated by computer circuitry . The machines, or \u201cplatforms,\u201d on which electronic games are played include general-purpose shared and personal computers, arcade consoles , video consoles connected to home television sets, handheld game machines, mobile devices such as cellular phones, and server-based networks. The term video game can be used to represent the totality of these formats, or it can refer more specifically only to games played on devices with video displays: television and arcade consoles.\n\nFrom chess to Spacewar! to Pong\n\nThe idea of playing games on computers is almost as old as the computer itself. Initially, the payoffs expected from this activity were closely related to the study of computation. For example, the mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon proposed in 1950 that computers could be programmed to play chess, and he questioned whether this would mean that a computer could think. Shannon\u2019s proposal stimulated decades of research on chess- and checkers-playing programs, generally by computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nMany computer games grew out of university and industrial computer laboratories. Several historically important games functioned originally as technology demonstrations, after having been developed as \u201cafter hours\u201d amusements by students and technical staff. For example, in 1958 William A. Higinbotham of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York used an analog computer, control boxes, and an oscilloscope to create Tennis for Two as part of a public display for visitors to the laboratory. Only a few years later Steve Russell, Alan Kotok, J. Martin Graetz, and others created Spacewar! (1962) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This game began as a demonstration program to show off the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1) minicomputer donated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to MIT and the new Precision CRT Display Type 30 attached to it. This new technology appealed to the \u201chacker\u201d culture of the Tech Model Railroad Club on campus, and its authors were members of this group. They wrote software and built control boxes that gave players the ability to move spaceships about on accurate star maps, maneuvering and firing space torpedoes at each other. Spacewar! was distinctly a product of MIT computing.\n\nThe widespread adoption of the PDP line of minicomputers on other campuses and laboratories in the 1960s and \u201970s made Spacewar! a ubiquitous part of computing culture. One such institution was the University of Utah, home of a strong program in computer graphics and an electrical engineering student named Nolan Bushnell. After graduating in 1968, Bushnell moved to Silicon Valley to work for the Ampex Corporation. Bushnell had worked at an amusement park during college and after playing Spacewar! he dreamed of filling entertainment arcades with such electronic games. Together with one of his coworkers at Ampex, Ted Dabney, Bushnell designed Computer Space (1971), a coin-operated version of Spacewar! set in a wildly futuristic arcade cabinet. Although the game\u2014manufactured and marketed by Nutting Associates, a vendor of coin-operated arcades\u2014was a commercial failure, it established a standard design and general technical configuration for arcade consoles.\n\nBritannica Quiz Final Fantasy Games Quiz\n\nIn 1972 Bushnell, Dabney, and Al Alcorn, another Ampex alumnus, founded the Atari Corporation. Bushnell asked Alcorn to design a simple game based on Ping-Pong, explaining by way of inspiration that Atari had received a contract to make it. While there was in fact no such contract, Alcorn was adept at television electronics and produced a simple and addictive game, which they named Pong. Unable to interest manufacturers of pinball games in this prototype, Bushnell and Alcorn installed it in a local bar, where it became an immediate success as a coin-operated game. After clearing a legal obstacle posed by the Magnavox Company\u2019s hold on the patent for video games (discussed in the next section), Atari geared up to manufacture arcade consoles in volume. It thus created the \u201ccoin-op\u201d game industry, achieving such success that it drew competitors into its new business space, the electronic game arcade, which became perhaps the main source for innovative electronic games well into the 1980s.
