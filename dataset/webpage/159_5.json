While both had been companions of the Fourth Doctor, neither had appeared on screen before. A Pilot episode was made for the show, 'A girls Best Friend', but was never made a reality afterwards. It was show on the 28th December 1981 as a Christmas Special.\n\nWhen the Doctor and Romana travel to the parallel universe of E-Space, K-9 is severely damaged, in 'Warriors Gate'. The damage was such that K-9 could only function in E-Space; when Romana decided to stay and forge her own path, the Doctor gave K-9 to her. This meant that K-9 would become the Third version of The mechanical dog and while it is a different dog, it still had the memories of previous adventures.\n\nProducers wanted to get Sladen back on the show for her popularity, they wanted her back for the transistion from The Fourth Doctor to The Fifth, Sladen didnt want to come back though just to play the same function. Likewise, producers wanted K-9 to return for his popularity with chilldren, however, he was impracticle to have on set and made what should be easy scenes complex. Therefore, a decision was made ot mke a spin off series featuring K-9 as the lead, however a Leading Lady would of been needed. The idea was pitched to Sladen who accepted on the grounds that she would be the Heroine and not the sidekick.\n\nOrigins of the Series\n\nK-9 and Company was a production that stemmed from an idea by the then-producer John Nathan Turner. He proposed the idea to actress Elisabeth Sladen, with the initial condition from Sladen that JNT and the writer stay true to the character of Sarah Jane Smith.\n\nHowever, when she recieved the final shooting, Elisabeth Sladen was not satisfied by the end result. She then decided to take it up with the producer, who subsequently went on to promise his lead actress that the problem would be remedied in the script henceforth and immediately.\n\nWas this guide helpful?

Over the years K9 has left and returned, most memorably with Sarah Jane Smith in the 2006 episode, School Reunion, starring David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler .\n\nHere\u2019s our handy guide to four decades with the tin dog!\n\nOne Previous Owner\n\nAs we discovered in the aforementioned story The Invisible Enemy (pictured below), K9 was actually built by Professor Marius in the year 5,000. Described by his maker as a \u201ccomputer\u201d, Marius had to return to Earth and gave K9 to the Fourth Doctor and Leela .\n\nThankfully, he was TARDIS-trained.\n\nThere\u2019s more than one!\n\nIn even more shocking news, K-9 is not unique. The original left with his mistress Leela at the end of the 1978 epic, The Invasion of Time.\n\nBut, being the sentimental sort, the Doctor couldn\u2019t live without his little chum and so immediately had a Mark II ready to go!\n\nThis version accompanied the Doctor and Romana on a hunt for the Key To Time (pictured above being repaired in The Stones of Blood) and eventually left with, fittingly, Romana II as the denouement of the 1981 four-parter, Warriors\u2019 Gate. Sadly, this time, there was to be no replacement.\n\nOr was there\u2026?\n\nNot a master of all terrains\n\nThough a well-informed and talented computer, K9 lacked a certain something when it came to alien (and sometimes human) worlds.\n\nThe marshes of Kroll (in The Power Of Kroll), Brighton beach (The Leisure Hive, pictured above) and even the streets of Paris (City of Death) all proved too much for K-9, and had to sit out entire adventures with his master and mistress.\n\nLoved a bit of chess\n\nOn numerous occasions, K-9 faced-off against his master in the game of chess and was able to defeat the Time Lord in just six moves.\n\nFirst Doctor Who Spin-Off!\n\n1981\u2019s K9 & Company left you in no doubt who was the star of the show. K9 returned or, rather, Mark III made his debut on the very first Doctor Who spin off, K9 & Company.\n\nSarah Jane Smith was sent him as a present from the Doctor and the two soon became firm friends. K-9 Mark III would reappear briefly in 1983\u2019s The Five Doctors and then again in\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s back, again!\n\n\u2026 2006\u2019s School Reunion. K9 Mark III made the ultimate sacrifice and saved Deffry Vale School after it had been overrun with Krillitane.\n\nBut, yet again, everyone\u2019s favourite Time Lord couldn\u2019t resist creating a replacement. The Tenth Doctor left Sarah Jane with another K-9, Mark IV if you will, to keep her company and protect the Earth.\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures\n\nThe following year, the spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures launched with K-9 making an occasional appearance to help out on Bannerman Road and also returned to Doctor Who to save the day in dramatic style in the Series 4 finale, Journey\u2019s End (pictured above).\n\nAnd, let\u2019s not forget, K-9 was reunited with the Tenth Doctor in a 2009 story from The Sarah Jane Adventures. The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith (pictured below) saw the Time Lord team up with Sarah Jane\u2019s chums and come face to face with The Trickster.\n\nRemember the time K9 was on The Weakest Link?\n\nBack in 2007, the lovable robot was a contestant on a very special Doctor Who edition, The Weakest Link (a quiz show which appeared in the 2005 finale). K-9 appeared alongside Wholumni such as David Tennant (The Tenth Doctor ), Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith ) and Captain Jack himself, John Barrowman.\n\nSadly, our little chum was voted off in first round by his \u201cfriends\u201d\u2026\n\nAll of K-9\u2019s adventures are available on DVD."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073828301/", "page_content": "Short, Sci-Fi\n\nFollow the Doctor on his incredible journeys across the universe and throughout time.

Image Courtesy Big Finish Productions\n\nDoctor Who audio spin-off The Robots continues today with the release of its second volume \u2013 which features two very familiar characters\u2026\n\nFor fans of classic Tom Baker story The Robots of Death, you\u2019re going to be pretty happy about this news. The second volume of Doctor Who audio spin-off series The Robots, starring Nicola Walker as Liv Chenka and Claire Rushbrook as her sister Tula, is out today.\n\nNot only is it a series that explores Kaldor \u2013 the world depicted in The Robots of Death -in a huge amount of depth. But it also features the return of two major characters from the original serial: Toos and Poul, as played by Pamela Salem and David Collings.\n\nDavid Collings\n\nThe Robots represents some of the last work from Collings, who passed away earlier this year. A veteran character actor, we\u2019ve been reviewing some of his appearances in other Big Finish audios this month, including Jago & Litefoot, where he played the rather sinister Gabriel Sanders; The King of Sontar, in which his scientist Rosato becomes extremely misguided, and Full Fathom Five. The last example especially stands out, as he plays a rather terrifying version of the Doctor.\n\nWhile The Robots 2 features one of his final performances, this won\u2019t be the last we\u2019ll hear of him, as producer David Richardson reveals.\n\nI was delighted to invite [Collings] to join The Robots to reprise the part of Poul, and how lucky we were to secure time to record his great contributions for volumes 2, 3 and 4. He was a lovely man to work with, and of course still such a brilliant actor. It\u2019s been said before but I\u2019ll say it again: he was the best Doctor Who we never had.\n\nSo it\u2019s not just this volume that we get to hear Collings return to his key role as Poul \u2013 we can also look forward to subsequent appearances for the character in later box sets.\n\nBuildup\n\nPamela Salem resumes her role of Toos, who originally appeared in The Robots of Death.(Image credit: The Robots/Doctor Who/Big Finish Productions. Image Courtesy: Big Finish Productions.)\n\nBut what else do we have to look forward to from this series? Well, according to script editor John Dorney, events will be gradually escalating on Kaldor.\n\nThat sounds extremely promising. The first volume of The Robots was great at establishing the series. It didn\u2019t do too much at once but clearly hinted that things were slowly changing on Kaldor, while still giving us some very intimate and character-focused dramas. Volume 2 looks set to give us more of the same while tying even more directly to the original Doctor Who story.\n\nThe Robots 2 is out now on CD and download directly from Big Finish\u2019s website. You can purchase it on its own or as part of a bundle for the complete series.

Ever.\n\nYet several other spin-offs have also been mooted over the years; from prequels to animated series, to shows based around the Doctor\u2019s greatest enemies.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the spin-offs that never were\u2026\n\nThe Daleks\n\nDoctor Who has been courting spin-offs since the \u201960s, when Dalek creator Terry Nation wanted to remove his precious pepper pots from the show and create a series revolving around them to be made in the US.\n\nInspired by \u2018The Daleks\u2019 Masterplan\u2019, The Daleks would have followed the heroic Space Security Service (including Jean Marsh\u2019s Sara Kingdom) as they fought against the Daleks. Nation wrote a pilot, \u2018The Destroyers\u2019, but the series was never picked up and so the Skarosians were deposited back into the main show.\n\nIf you\u2019re intrigued, those trusty people at Big Finish adapted the pilot for audio back in 2010, as part of their The Lost Stories series.\n\nK-9 and Company\n\nThe cancelled Who spin-off that got the furthest along, 1981\u2019s K-9 and Company was actually the first off-shoot to star Sarah Jane \u2013 despite her being rather unfairly described as \u2018company\u2019 in the title.\n\nOnly a pilot episode of the series was broadcast, titled \u2018A Girl\u2019s Best Friend.\u2019 It sees the intrepid reporter being given a model of K-9 by the Doctor and proceeding to investigate not aliens or even mad scientists but\u2026 a witch\u2019s coven.\n\nDespite the failure of K-9 and Company, it is firmly canon, as Sarah Jane and K-9 later appeared together in \u2018The Five Doctors\u2019, \u2018School Reunion\u2019 and, of course, in The Sarah Jane Adventures.\n\nDoctor Who: The Animated Series\n\nAnimated Doctor Who has been made several times, but never quite as successfully as hoped. For instance, the Tenth Doctor starred in \u2018The Infinite Quest\u2019 and \u2018Dreamland\u2019, both of which seemingly tried to start a running fixture that never happened.\n\nBack in the 1980s, animation company Nelvana (they made the Care Bears) started work on a Doctor Who cartoon that was later shelved. Bizarrely, their Doctor looked like a cross (or a hybrid!) between Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee.\n\nThere was also \u2018Scream of the Shalka\u2019, an animated serial starring Richard E Grant, who later appeared as The Great Intelligence in 2012-2013. This wasn\u2019t so much a spin-off as an aborted version of the actual series, as it was made shortly before the 2005 revival.\n\nContinued on next page\u2026"}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138972/reviews", "page_content": "6 /10\n\nHmm some people really have it in for K9 AND COMPANY the first - And to date - only spin off from DOCTOR WHO . I guess if there was any potential spin offs from the legendary fantasy show then two would spring to mind . The first one obviously being a series featuring the Daleks . Terry Nation actually approached American television studios in the late 1960s seeking funding for the metallic meanies but since America never experienced Dalekmania you can see why they wouldn't want to invest in a concept they have no knowledge of . It would have probably been too expensive anyway and almost certainly unfilmable . The recent series of DOCTOR WHO contained breath taking Dalek sequences but that's because television technology has moved on in the last 40 years . The other obvious spin off would have been a show featuring Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart and UNIT but again the amount of military hardware involved would probably have made it prohibitive on financial grounds ( though THE X - FILES isn't a million miles removed from this premise when you think about it ) so instead of what we might have got we ended up with a former journalist and a robotic dog !\n\n\n\nI was never keen on K9 during the fourth Doctor's tenure . Every time Tom Baker would be chained to a wall about to be tortured you just knew that K9 was going to appear out of the shadows and shoot the villains with his blaster . So in other words he was a plot device used by very lazy writers during the poorest period of the show seen at that time . As for Sarah Jane Smith I always thought she was slightly overrated as a companion ( She wins every single poll as favourite companion ) possibly because she was the Doctor's sidekick when the show achieved its highest ratings and most critical acclaim in the mid 1970s . I guess John Nathan Turner thought he was onto a winner by resurrecting two popular companions in a pilot for a proposed series\n\n\n\nWhat is very clear by watching this pilot is how self limiting the format is . It's set on present day Earth with no monsters with the villains being pagan worshipers . If it had gone to a full series we'd have seen Sarah and K9 and girlie boy Brendan tackle mad scientists and .. and .. and ... maybe they'd have brought back pagan worshipers for a rematch . Or maybe JNT could have had an alien invasion every third week to break up the monotony of mad scientists and pagan worshipers . No doubt Sarah could have tackled the aliens with her karate ( Where did she learn that ? ) and if that wasn't enough K9 could zap the aliens with his laser - As long as the aliens didn't run up a flight of stairs or hide behind a greenhouse or were able to run faster than three miles per hour .\n\n\n\nDespite the poor format there are some good points to this pilot . It contains some impressive night filming which lends itself to some atmospheric moments such as the policeman gingerly walking down a lonely country lane and it's nowhere as badly acted as some people claim , I mean try watching some DOCTOR WHO from the mid to late 1980s to see what bad acting is . Sean Chapman as Peter Tracey has a scene where he bursts into tears of despair and I often think that crying must be difficult for an actor to portray convincingly but here Chapman manages it . I'm not saying he deserves an Oscar but think of all the scenes you've seen on television and in movies where an actor is supposed to be crying and you're asking yourself if their character is laughing or crying ? As for the really crap title sequence or more appropriately the music that goes with it blame Ian Levine , someone who would later produce records for Take That , aka Robbie Williams and those other blokes\n\n\n\nHardly brilliant but not as bad as some people claim K-9 AND COMPANY gets six out of ten"}, {"url": "https://guide.doctorwhonews.net/person.php?name=DavidCollings", "page_content": "David Collings is an English actor.

As the longest-running sci-fi show, it has left a lot of spin-offs in its wake. Some of these tv shows feature the Doctor's old companions as they go off on their own adventures.\n\nSome are kid-friendly and animated; others, especially the 2016 show \u2014 Class, target a decidedly more mature audience. There are also tons of projects that were taken up and abandoned. The Doctor Who multiverse can be a tad confusing for newcomers and veterans alike when it comes to the spin-offs.\n\nDespite all of that, if you've been itching to clamber onto the bandwagon, here is a detailed look into every Doctor Who spin-off project that was released since the show started in 1963:\n\nK-9 and Company\n\nIn 1981, the first official attempt at creating a Doctor Who spin-off was made. It featured the beloved android dog \u2014 K-9 \u2014 and Sarah Jane, one of the Doctor's more iconic companions.\n\nWhile K-9 and Sarah Jane didn't meet in the main show until season 2, episode 3, they were the 4th Doctor's companions at one point. But, even though the show's pilot garnered a ton of attention and had a whopping 8.4 million viewership, the show never ended up getting picked up. Instead, the pilot was aired as a Christmas special.\n\nTorchwood\n\nCreated after the successful revival of Doctor Who, this 2006 show takes aim at adults. It features multiple beloved characters from the main show. Captain Jack Harkness, Gwen Cooper, Toshiko Sato, Owen Harper, and Ianto Jones combine forces to keep track of alien forces and activity on Earth and defend the planet from extraterrestrial attacks if the need arises.\n\nSeason 1 and 2 of this show are 13 episodes each. Season 3 is five episodes long and is subtitled Children of Earth, while season 4 is ten episodes long and called Miracle Day. Miracle Day was also a concerted effort to draw in United States viewers and was co-produced with and aired on STARZ.\n\nInfinity Quest\n\nInfinity Quest was released in 2007 as 12 three-and-a-half minutes long episodes. It's an animated series where David Tennant and Freema Agyeman reprise their roles as the 10th Doctor and one of his companions, Martha Jones.\n\nInfinity Quest was released as a segment of Totally Doctor Who \u2014 a 25-episodes-long kid's tv show produced and initially released by BBC between 2006 \u2013 2007.\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures\n\nReleased between 2007 and 2011, the CBBC show The Sarah Jane Adventures features the adventures of Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane. Created by legendary Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies, after he brought the iconic companion for a few episodes of the revived show, The Sarah Jane Adventures is kid-friendly and features Sarah Jane back as an investigative journalist who uses her smarts, sass, and snazzy gadgets to fend off villainous alien forces and keep the Earth safe from attack.\n\nK-9, robot dog extraordinaire, appeared in the first two seasons before he left to star in a spin-off of his own. The show lasted five seasons and was only canceled upon Sladen's death.\n\nDreamland\n\nIf you have ever wanted to know what happened to the Doctor's daughter, this show may have some answers for you. The 2009 animated mini-series features David Tennant as the 10th Doctor. His wife \u2014 Georgia Tennant \u2014 also reprises her role as the Doctor's daughter in this show.\n\nK-9 Adventures\n\nFirst aired in 2009, K-9 Adventures has 26 episodes and three seasons. Produced by Jetix Europe, this show again features K-9, the robot canine, except now he is the star of his own show. Before BBC backed out of the project in late 2010, K-9 Adventures was a show about how K-9 came to be part of the frontline of the Earth's defense against malicious extraterrestrial forces.\n\nClass\n\nWritten by Patrick Ness, this 2016 show only has one season despite critics' favorable reviews, but due to poor viewership ratings. It is set in Coal Hill School \u2014 a fictional academy often mentioned in the original series since the release of the Doctor Who pilot \u2013 \u201cAn Unearthly Child\u201d \u2013 in 1963.\n\nThis show deals with the students and staff members of the school, and their varied desires, anxieties, and wants. Decidedly not a children's show, this one features dark arcs and themes and raises questions about the consequences of time travel and the Doctor's constant manipulations of the timeline.\n\nSpecial Mention: Scream of the Shalka\n\nThis 40th-anniversary animated show features Richard E. Grant as the \u201calternate\u201d 9th Doctor. BBC then went on to announce Eccleston as the 9th Doctor. The story is centered around the Doctor's (mis)adventures as he attempts to help a village deal with and fight off an alien race called the Shalka. Incidentally, Richard E. Grant had also played an \u201calternate\u201d 10th Doctor in the 1999 comedy short for Red Nose Day (\u201cThe Curse of Fatal Death\u201d) before appearing in other roles in the main show.\n\nThis article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks.\n\nFeatured Image Courtesy of BBC."}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/K9AndCompany", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/K9AndCompany\n\nHope you're in the mood for a lot of the countryside...\n\nThe one that can't decide if it's for kids or not.\n\nAiring on December 28, 1981, a week before Peter Davison's debut as the Fifth Doctor, this little special brought back Doctor Who fan favorites Sarah Jane Smith and K-9.\n\nAlthough K-9 and Company was conceived as a spinoff of Doctor Who, it wasn't picked up, airing as a single special, also called \"A Girl's Best Friend\". Nonetheless, K-9's subsequent appearances with Sarah Jane in The Five Doctors and \"School Reunion\" confirm that the special is part of the Whoniverse Canon, and many elements of it define the character of Sarah Jane Smith after her departure in \"The Hand of Fear\". More than 25 years later, a second, more successful spinoff for Sarah Jane was made in The Sarah Jane Adventures, with K-9 making occasional appearances. Subsequently, K-9 also got his own show in Australia. (However, some of these stories feature different K-9 robots - the K-9 of the solo series is Leela's K-9, last seen on TV in \"The Invasion Of Time\". And the K-9 solo series was made with the rights to the character but not to the Doctor or the larger Whoniverse, making its canon status ambiguous.)\n\nSarah Jane Smith spends the Christmas holiday at her Aunt Lavinia's house in Moreton Harwood to watch her ward, Brendan Richards. In the house, Sarah Jane spots a large crate that was left in the attic for a few years. Inside is K-9 Mark III, a present from the Doctornote A message which the Doctor actually means, for once. \"Give Sarah Jane Smith my fondest love. Tell her I shall remember her always.\"\n\nThere's also a cult going around doing nasty cult stuff, like kidnapping Brendan. Sarah Jane and K-9 investigate and find out that almost everyone in town is a part of this cult, called the Cult of Hecate. At night, the Cult of Hecate prepare Brendan as a sacrifice for the Winter Solstice, but Sarah Jane and K-9 save him just in the nick of time.\n\nThat's pretty much it really. Can you imagine what a full series would be like?\n\nK-9 and Company provides examples of the following tropes:"}]}
