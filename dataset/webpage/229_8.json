{"Johannes Andreas August Grabau was a proponent of the theory of continental drift, and his work helped to lay the foundations for modern plate tectonics.": [{"url": "http://concordiahistoricalinstitute.libraryhost.com/repositories/2/resources/1031", "page_content": "Johann Andreas August Grabau was born 18 March 1804 in Olvenstedt, Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia, the son of Johann Andreas Grabau (d. 1822) and Anna Dorothea Grabau n\u00e9e Jericho. J.A.A. Grabau had a brother John and a sister Lisette. He was married in Erfurt on 15 July 1834, to Christine Sophia n\u00e9e Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth n\u00e9e Beulke. They had at least three children: Johann (pastor in Bergholz, New York), Wilhelm (married Maria von Rohr, pastor in Cedarburg, Wisconsin), and Beata (whose married name was Gram). Grabau died on 2 June 1879 in Buffalo, New York.\n\n\n\nGrabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809-1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818-1825) and finally at the University of Halle (1825-1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew\u2019s Church in Erfurt in June 1834.\n\n\n\nIn 1836 Grabau ran afoul of the Prussian state church for his opposition to the Union Agenda. After two years\u2019 imprisonment (1837-1839), Grabau was finally granted permission to emigrate along with his congregation. This group, under the leadership of Grabau and Captain Heinrich von Rohr, departed for America in the summer of 1839. Grabau and a majority of his congregation settled in Buffalo while von Rohr and some of the families continued to Wisconsin. In Buffalo the settlers established Trinity Old Lutheran Church, quickly followed by the founding of a school.\n\n\n\nGrabau and his congregation soon met with controversy, however. First was a split with a congregation of Silesian Lutherans who had accompanied Grabau\u2019s congregation across the Atlantic. While the Silesian pastor, Leberecht Friedrich Ehregott Krause, was in Germany, Grabau excommunicated the Silesians because of an unsettled debt to the shipping agent who had arranged their passage. The Silesians denied Grabau\u2019s authority in the matter, but Pr. Krause, who passed through Buffalo again in 1841 on his way to take up a call to Wisconsin, sided with Grabau. The Silesians approached the Saxon pastor E.M. B\u00fcrger [Buerger] who was passing through Buffalo at the time, intending to return to Germany, and B\u00fcrger, having investigated the situation, finally accepted their call and became the pastor of the congregation, known in distinction from Grabau\u2019s as First Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\n\n\nRelations between Grabau\u2019s group and the Saxon Lutherans in Missouri had already been placed on a shaky footing by Grabau\u2019s 1840 Hirtenbrief, a letter which he had written in response to the situation of the emigrants who had traveled with von Rohr to Freistadt, Wisconsin. In the absence of a pastor, they had appointed a schoolteacher to preach and administer the sacraments among them, a practice of which Grabau strongly disapproved. Grabau sent a copy of the Hirtenbrief to C.F.W. Walther and G.H. Loeber. The Missouri pastors disagreed with Grabau\u2019s teaching but were not able to send a response until 1843. An increasingly acrimonious exchange between the two groups continued for several decades, providing impetus for Walther\u2019s Voice of our Church on the Question Concerning the Church and the Ministry. The gap between Grabau and the Saxons widened further as portions of the Wisconsin congregations in Freistadt, Milwaukee, and Kirchhayn, offended by Pr. Krause\u2019s liberal use of excommunication, sought Saxon pastors to serve them.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Grabau proceeded with the work of church organization. In 1845 the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia [Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche] was formed by Grabau, von Rohr (who had in the meantime been trained and ordained as a pastor), Krause and Pr. G. A. Kindermann, a Pomeranian whose congregation had emigrated to Wisconsin. Grabau was elected senior ministerii or president of the synod, popularly known as the Buffalo Synod. The synodical paper, Kirchliches Informatorium, was established in 1851 under Grabau\u2019s editorship. In 1853/4 the Synod established the German Martin Luther College in Buffalo with Grabau as its rector.\n\n\n\nIn 1866 a schism arose within the Buffalo Synod itself. At the synodical assembly in June of that year, a majority of the Buffalo pastors, including von Rohr, turned against Grabau, accusing him of false doctrine. Grabau and three pastors withdrew, claiming to constitute the legitimate Buffalo Synod. In November von Rohr and his fellow pastors agreed to a colloquium with representatives of the Missouri Synod. As a result of this meeting, a majority of the Buffalo Synod pastors, under the leadership of Pr. Christian Hochstetter of Buffalo, joined the Missouri Synod at once. A rump group, under von Rohr\u2019s leadership until his death in 1874, continued to constitute a separate Buffalo Synod until 1877.\n\n\n\nGrabau continued as pastor of Trinity Old Lutheran Church in Buffalo and as president of the Buffalo Synod, which consisted of Grabau and those pastors who had refused to join in the condemnation of 1866. After a legal battle with von Rohr\u2019s Buffalo Synod, Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College in Buffalo and remained as its rector.

The skin has been broken into many different plates because of differences in the density of the rock and differences in subsurface heating between one region and the next.\n\nAlthough this has yet to be proven with certainty, most geologists and geophysicists agree that plate movement is caused by the convection (that is, heat transfer resulting from the movement of a heated fluid) of magma in Earth\u2019s interior. The heat source is thought to be the decay of radioactive elements. How this convection propels the plates is poorly understood. Some geologists argue that upwelling magma at spreading centres pushes the plates, whereas others argue that the weight of a portion of a subducting plate (one that is forced beneath another) may pull the rest of the plate along.\n\nGerman meteorologist Alfred Wegener is often credited as the first to develop a theory of plate tectonics, in the form of continental drift . Bringing together a large mass of geologic and paleontological data, Wegener postulated that throughout most of geologic time there was only one continent, which he called Pangea , and the breakup of this continent heralded Earth\u2019s current continental configuration as the continent-sized parts began to move away from one another. (Scientists discovered later that Pangea fragmented early in the Jurassic Period .) Wegener presented the idea of continental drift and some of the supporting evidence in a lecture in 1912, followed by his major published work, The Origin of Continents and Oceans (1915).\n\nplate tectonics, theory dealing with the dynamics of Earth\u2019s outer shell\u2014the lithosphere\u2014that revolutionized Earth sciences by providing a uniform context for understanding mountain-building processes, volcanoes, and earthquakes as well as the evolution of Earth\u2019s surface and reconstructing its past continents and oceans.\n\nThe concept of plate tectonics was formulated in the 1960s. According to the theory, Earth has a rigid outer layer, known as the lithosphere, which is typically about 100 km (60 miles) thick and overlies a plastic (moldable, partially molten) layer called the asthenosphere. The lithosphere is broken up into seven very large continental- and ocean-sized plates, six or seven medium-sized regional plates, and several small ones. These plates move relative to each other, typically at rates of 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) per year, and interact along their boundaries, where they converge, diverge, or slip past one another. Such interactions are thought to be responsible for most of Earth\u2019s seismic and volcanic activity, although earthquakes and volcanoes can occur in plate interiors. Plate motions cause mountains to rise where plates push together, or converge, and continents to fracture and oceans to form where plates pull apart, or diverge. The continents are embedded in the plates and drift passively with them, which over millions of years results in significant changes in Earth\u2019s geography.\n\nDiscover the facts behind the theory of continental drift See all videos for this article\n\nThe theory of plate tectonics is based on a broad synthesis of geologic and geophysical data. It is now almost universally accepted, and its adoption represents a true scientific revolution, analogous in its consequences to quantum mechanics in physics or the discovery of the genetic code in biology. Incorporating the much older idea of continental drift, as well as the concept of seafloor spreading, the theory of plate tectonics has provided an overarching framework in which to describe the past geography of continents and oceans, the processes controlling creation and destruction of landforms, and the evolution of Earth\u2019s crust, atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and climates. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it became apparent that plate-tectonic processes profoundly influence the composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans, serve as a prime cause of long-term climate change, and make significant contributions to the chemical and physical environment in which life evolves.\n\nFor details on the specific effects of plate tectonics, see the articles earthquake and volcano. A detailed treatment of the various land and submarine relief features associated with plate motion is provided in the articles tectonic landform and ocean."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/continental-drift-versus-plate-tectonics/", "page_content": "We don\u2019t perceive that the continents we live on are moving. After all, it\u2019s not as if an airplane flight between Europe and Africa takes five hours one year but only three hours the next. But the continents actually are shifting, very slowly, relative to one another. In the early 20th century, a scientific theory called continental drift was proposed about this migration of the continents . That theory was initially ridiculed, but it paved the way for another theory called plate tectonics that scientists have now accepted to explain how Earth\u2019s continents move.\n\n\n\nThe story begins with Alfred Wegener (1880\u20131930), a German meteorologist and geophysicist who noticed something curious when he looked at a map of the world. Wegener observed that the continents of South America and Africa looked like they would fit together remarkably well\u2014take away the Atlantic Ocean and these two massive landforms would lock neatly together. He also noted that similar fossils were found on continents separated by oceans, additional evidence that perhaps the landforms had once been joined. He hypothesized that all of the modern-day continents had previously been clumped together in a super continent he called Pangaea (from ancient Greek, meaning \u201call lands\u201d or \u201call the Earth\u201d). Over millions of years, Wegener suggested, the continents had drifted apart. He did not know what drove this movement, however. Wegener first presented his idea of continental drift in 1912, but it was widely ridiculed and soon, mostly, forgotten. Wegener never lived to see his theory accepted\u2014he died at the age of 50 while on an expedition in Greenland.\n\n\n\nOnly decades later, in the 1960s, did the idea of continental drift resurface. That\u2019s when technologies adapted from warfare made it possible to more thoroughly study Earth. Those advances included seismometers used to monitor ground shaking caused by nuclear testing and magnetometers to detect submarines. With seismometers , researchers discovered that earthquakes tended to occur in specific places rather than equally all over Earth. And scientists studying the seafloor with magnetometers found evidence of surprising magnetic variations near undersea ridges: alternating stripes of rock recorded a flip-flopping of Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\n\n\nTogether, these observations were consistent with a new theory proposed by researchers who built on Wegener\u2019s original idea of continental drift \u2014the theory of plate tectonics . According to this theory , Earth\u2019s crust is broken into roughly 20 sections called tectonic plates on which the continents ride. When these plates press together and then move suddenly, energy is released in the form of earthquakes. That is why earthquakes do not occur everywhere on Earth\u2014they\u2019re clustered around the boundaries of tectonic plates. Plate tectonics also explains the stripes of rock on the seafloor with alternating magnetic properties: As buoyant, molten rock rises up from deep within Earth, it emerges from the space between spreading tectonic plates and hardens, creating a ridge. Because some minerals within rocks record the orientation of Earth\u2019s magnetic poles and this orientation flips every 100,000 years or so, rocks near ocean ridges exhibit alternating magnetic stripes.\n\n\n\nPlate tectonics explains why Earth\u2019s continents are moving; the theory of continental drift did not provide an explanation. Therefore, the theory of plate tectonics is more complete. It has gained widespread acceptance among scientists. This shift from one theory to another is an example of the scientific process: As more observations are made and measurements are collected, scientists revise their theories to be more accurate and consistent with the natural world.\n\n\n\nBy running computer simulations of how Earth\u2019s tectonic plates are moving, researchers can estimate where the planet's continents will likely be in the future. Because tectonic plates move very slowly\u2014only a few centimeters per year, on average\u2014it takes a long time to observe changes. Scientists have found that the planet\u2019s continents will likely again be joined together in about 250 million years. Researchers have dubbed this future continental configuration \u201c Pangaea Proxima.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne intriguing aspect of Pangaea Proxima is that it will likely contain a new mountain range with some of the world\u2019s highest mountains. That is because as Africa continues to migrate north it will collide with Europe, a collision that will probably create a Himalaya-scale mountain range. However, Christopher Scotese, one of the scientists who developed these simulations , cautions that it is difficult to predict exactly how the continents will be arranged in millions of years. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know the future, obviously,\u201d Scotese told NASA. \u201cAll we can do is make predictions of how plate motions will continue, what new things might happen, and where it will all end up.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://geo.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Geography_(Physical)/The_Physical_Environment_(Ritter)/15%3A_Tectonics_and_Landforms/15.01%3A_Plate_Tectonics_and_Continental_Drift", "page_content": "Introduction The surface of the lithosphere is fractured into a number of tectonic plates (also known as lithospheric or crustal plates) which are in constant motion. As these plates move and collide, the lithosphere buckles, warps, and is torn apart. When this occurs, the Earth's surface shakes with great force, like that which accompanies earthquakes. Volcanoes are common along many plate boundaries as well. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\): Major Tectonic plates of the world (Diagram Courtesy of USGS)\n\nPlate Tectonics Plate tectonics refers to the process of plate formation, movement, and destruction. It finds its foundations in two theories, continental drift and sea-floor spreading. Continental drift describes the movements of continents over the Earth's surface. Sea-floor spreading refers to the creation new oceanic plate material and movement away from the mid-ocean ridge. It was Alfred Wegener in the early 1900's who brought forth the concept that the \"shell\" of the Earth's surface was fractured, and these \"pieces\" drifted about. Blasphemy in the minds of scientists of Wegener's day, some 50 years later his ideas were finally accepted. Wegener was able to piece together (pardon the pun) several bits of information which led to his conclusion that the present configuration of the continents is not the same as it was in the past. In fact, the continents were one \"super-continent\" called Pangea. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): The supercontinent of Pangea (Diagram Courtesy of USGS) Look at a map of the Earth like that in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\). Carefully examine the east coast of South America and then let your eyes drift to the west coast of Africa. It looks like you could \"fit\" South America up against Africa like a puzzle. The same can be said for the fit between North America, Africa, and Europe (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)) Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\): Present location of world land masses. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\): Fit of continental land masses When we slide the continents together, some over lap between the land masses occurs. This is possibly due to the creation of exotic terrain, new land that has been formed somewhere else and moved to its present location. This remarkable correspondence provides circumstantial evidence for the theory of continental drift.\n\nLooking for the evidence If the continents were in one piece at some time in the past, we should find similar fossils and rocks on both continents which is precisely what Wegener discovered. By studying the geologic record, the fossil record, and climatic record, he found remarkable similarities between Africa and South America. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\): Fossil Glossopteris leaf, Ellsworth Land, Antarctica. Click image to enlarge (Photo Credit USGS DDS21) Fossils of the same species of plants and animals were found in similar geologic formations in different parts of the world, most notably South America, Africa, and India. For example, fossils of the Glossopteris, an ancient fern, are found in South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and Australia. It was hypothesized that such a distribution could only come about if the continents were all part of the one super-continent. Examining the stratigraphy (vertical sequences) of the rock record, Wegener could point to further evidence for Pangea and continental drift. Wegener noted that the rock sequences in South America, Africa, India, and Australia are very similar. Wegener showed that the same three bottoms layers occurred on each of the continents. The bottom layer, called tillite, was thought to be of glacial origin. The middle layer composed of coal beds, shale and sandstone contained Glossopteris fossils, as did the bottom tillite layer. The top most and youngest layer is lava flows. Such a strong similarity in the rock record of these localities, now separated by great geographic distance, lent credence to Wegener's notion of continental drift. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{6}\\): Simplified stratigraphic profile for portions of South America, Antarctica, Australia, Africa and India (Courtesy of USGS) The occurrence of glacial features (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\)) in the geologic record of South America, Africa, India ,and Australia provides further evidence for the notion of continental drift.

Wegener suggested it was the spin of the Earth that caused plates to \"plow\" their way through the mantle beneath (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{9}\\)). Figure \\(\\PageIndex{9}\\): Wegener's proposed movement of plates (Courtesy of USGS) Interestingly, there appeared to be a split in the scientific community in a geographical sense at the time. Geologists in the Northern hemisphere were less accepting as those living in the Southern hemisphere who were familiar with the rocks Wegener used to support his hypothesis. It wasn't until 1928 that a Scottish geologist proposed a mechanism to drive continental drift. Arthur Holmes believed a fluid mantle possessed convection currents created by heat trapped beneath the Earth's surface. Holmes hypothesized that convection currents welled up toward the surface and then drug continents across the surface. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{10}\\): Holmes' convection current model. (Courtesy of USGS) Figure \\(\\PageIndex{11}\\): Mid-ocean Ridge (Courtesy USGS) (Click image to enlarge) In the late 1950's and early 1960's oceanographic research was opening the final frontier on Earth, the mysteries of the ocean floor. During the 1950's seismologists showed that earthquake activity was concentrated along the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, the mid-ocean ridge. Known for over a century, the mid-ocean ridge system in the Atlantic Ocean rises some 6,500 feet above the surrounding ocean floor and extends for more that 37,500 miles (60,000 km) in all the world's oceans. At the crest of the ridge system lies a trough or rift. These rifts are about 20 miles wide (30 km) and 6,500 feet (2,900 m) deep and are a site where lava is expelled on to the ocean floor. The youngest material is found near the ridge with rocks of increasing age further away. It appears that the mid-ocean ridge is the site of sea floor spreading leading to plate movement. The key to sea floor spreading was found in the magnetic properties of rock lying on the sea floor. Figure \\(\\PageIndex{12}\\): Sea floor spreading and magnetic stripes Geoscientists found that as new material is extruded from the mid-ocean ridge onto the ocean floor, the polarity of the rocks is frozen in time. Dragging a magnetometer across the ridge, they noticed that the polarity recorded a series of \"flips\" when the polarity of the rocks reversed. Parallel stripes of magnetic reversals on either side of the ridge was supporting evidence for sea floor spreading. (See animation of magnetic stripe formation - caution large file) (For more details see: North Cascades Geology - Sea Floor spreading\" and Magnetic Stripes and isotope clocks (USGS). These ideas set the stage for further research that has given us a plausible explanation for the movement of the crust and the drifting of continents first proposed by Wegener."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/johannes.grabau/3766575", "page_content": "Johannes Grabau\n\nclergyman\n\nMarch 18, 1804 (age 75) Stadtkreis Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany\n\nAfter teaching for four years in Magdeburg and Sachsa, Grabau was elected pastor of St. Andreas in Erfurt March 3, 1834, and was ordained June 17, in the Barfiisser Kirche.

Although Wegener did not manage to persuade the scientific world of continental drift, Du Toit\u2019s work continued to amass evidence of it.

After a year as instructor he proceeded to graduate study at Harvard, gaining the M.S. and D.Sc. in 1898 and 1900.\n\nGrabau soon became professor of paleontology at Columbia University after a short stay (1899\u20131901) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In the succeeding twenty years he became a leading scientist in paleontology, stratigraphy, and sedimentary petrology, as well as a highly respected teacher. During the hysteria of World War I, Grabau\u2019s tenure at Columbia was embittered by accusations of pro-German sympathies and hints and rumors originating at the highest levels. Moving to China in 1920, he became professor of paleontology at the National University and chief paleontologist of the Geological Survey of China.\n\nGrabau married Mary Antin, a Polish immigrant and a distinguished author and sociologist, in 1901. Her health was poor when he left for China, and she remained with a daughter in the United States. Grabau, rather a stocky man, suffered a deterioration of circulation that limited his capacity to work in the field during his later years in the United States; he became an invalid, requiring a wheelchair or requiring crutches after moving to China. Students, associates, and books increasingly became his sources of information.\n\nThe principal distinction of Grabau\u2019s work is his anticipation of several principles of stratigraphy and paleontology that were to become more generally recognized by later geologists. Of North American stratigraphers of the early years of the century, he seems to have been the best informed on the relationships in foreign lands. Yet he traveled to Europe only once, when he was over forty, and to Asia at the age of fifty. He was imaginative and philosphical. A pioneer in sedimentary petrology, he proposed a genetic classification of sedimentary rocks that strongly influenced advances in the field. Grabau early emphasized the importance of the environment of deposition in determining rock characters and organic assemblages: the field of paleoecology. He produced such theories as the polar control theory of climatic control through the movement of the crust over the interior of the earth, and the pulsation theory, which endeavored to attribute the changing distribution of lands and seas to fluctuations in sea level. Moreover, he made substantial contributions in paleontology, both in the systematic study of fossils of several classes and in the interpretation of their phylogeny and classification.\n\nThe relationship of marine bionomy to stratigraphy was the subject of a fifty-page paper published in 1899, a pioneering analysis of knowledge of the living conditions of modern organisms applied to the environment of ancient sedimentary rocks. The article is a masterly outline of the principles of what is now the science of paleoecology. Grabau early emphasized the impact of environment on the fauna and its relationship to the facies of the rocks, that the lateral changes in time-equivalent rocks might be analogous to their succession. In this respect he was a great admirer of Johannes Walther, who held similar views. Grabau was an antagonist of Edward Oscar Ulrich, the popular authority of the early twentieth century who held that faunas relate to marine invasions from several independent oceanic realms; and in general he concurred with Charles Schuchert in his emphasis on environment and lateral facies.\n\nIn paleontology Grabau was influenced in his interest in phylogeny and ontogeny by his association at Cambridge with the great paleobiologists Alpheus Hyatt and Robert T. Jackson. His own early studies were directed toward these ends, particularly his work on gastropods. Subsequently he prepared several monographs on such diverse subjects as Chinese Paleozoic corals, Devonian brachiopods, and Permian faunas; these were excellent systematic paleontologic treatises in the manner of the nineteenth-century classic monographs in North America, with attention to anatomic details that might relate to genetic relationships. He had the good fortune to be in Peking when the Peking man was discovered, and he advised on its study.\n\nGrabau\u2019s \u201cClassification of Sedimentary Rocks\u201d (American Geologist, 33 [1904]) was a portent of the emphasis on the interpretation of origin, as well as texture and composition, in the classification of the deposited rocks. The original terminology was cumbersome in its having Latin-based names formed from terms for origin, texture, and composition; thus hydrosilicarenyte referred to a marine-laid quartz rock with the texture of sand. The use of a genetic term introduced a subjective element that deterred the direct application of the classification to the rock specimens. Adopted only reluctantly in the beginning, the textural-composition elements became widely used in the middle years of the century, only to be succeeded by other, more sophisticated classifications that further emphasize the aspects he recognized as most pertinent. Thus, Grabau had a great influence in directing the critical study of sedimentary petrology.\n\nEarly excursions in the Buffalo, New York, region brought Grabau into contact with the deposits of the continental glaciers. In the 1930\u2019s he developed the polar control theory of the distribution of climatic zones through the geologic record. He thought that the poles remained stable with respect to the earth\u2019s interior, retaining latitudinal climatic zones, but that the outer crust wandered from these poles. Thus the changing relations of continents to poles caused climatic changes, such as led to glaciation. In his day only a heretic could question the relative permanence of present relationships; half a century later, such a hypothesis came to be appreciably reasonable.\n\nGrabau further believed that the continents once formed a single continental mass, Pangaea, that had been disrupted through relative movements among its dismembered parts. Thus, he was an early protagonist of a theory of continental drift, but one different from those devised by Frank B. Taylor and Alfred Wegener. He thought mountains were rising at the fore of the shifting continental plates and volcanism was at their rear. These theories were ingenious and nearly plausible, for few stratigraphic geologists had Grabau\u2019s broad grasp of world geology or his interest in its collation. With the great advances in geophysical science in the latter half of the twentieth century, many such conjectures became subject to more rigorous analysis. Although Grabau could not have anticipated some of this present knowledge, his concepts of the nature of continental movements and climatic zonations have much to commend them.\n\nThe pulsation theory attributed the distribution of the principal stratigraphic units to great rhythmic advances and regressions of the seas, which were in turn dependent on restriction and expansion of capacities of ocean basins: eustatic control. He gave distinctive names to his pulsation systems, such as Taconian, Cambrian, Cambrovician, Skiddavian, Ordovician, Silurian, and Siluronian. Fourteen of these cycles were placed in the Paleozoic era, five in the Mesozoic, and two in the Cenozoic, partially to replace the conventional systems. He thought each pulsation had had a duration of about 30 million years, the contraction of seas at the close of each period leading to marked changes in organisms.\n\nPerhaps Grabau thought his pulsation theory was his greatest contribution, for he wrote many volumes endeavoring to relate the distribution of lands and seas to pulsing transgressions and retrogressions and saying that it was further controlled by provincial warping movements accentuating or reversing the effects, of the eustatic movements. As has been the case with other endeavors to alter the general geologic classification, based appreciably on historical accidents rather than on clearly natural principles, authorities have never agreed on more ubiquitous natural spans and thus continue to use the established systems.\n\nThe greatest effect of Grabau\u2019s scientific work probably has been in his contributions to the principles of paleoecology and to the genetic aspects of sedimentary petrology. His stratigraphic work was influential in bringing about a three-dimensional attitude toward sedimentary rock distribution, rather than merely emphasizing the faunal correlation of exposed rock sections. His stratigraphy was dynamic, the source of understanding earth movements. He anticipated the attitudes that became prevalent when the petroleum industry added knowledge of subsurface sections to that of the surface outcrops. The concepts involved in his polar control theory, pulsation theory, and the separation of Pangaea encouraged imaginative syntheses of geologic evidence. This heritage, brought to his students and associates, has contributed far beyond the words and thoughts that he recorded.\n\nThe esteem in which Grabau was held was reflected in the honors and prizes that he received but was shown more fittingly in the commemorative volumes that were published by Chinese geologists on his sixtieth birthday and in his burial within the gates of the National University. Among his greatest contributions were the stimulus that he gave to scientific life in China and the instruction and enthusiasm that was productive in his many students. For example, in the first ten years of his residence in China, nineteen of the twenty-five monographs of Palaeontologia sinica were prepared by his students.\n\nGrabau was a fellow of the Geological Society of America, the New York Academy of Science (vicepresident, 1906\u20131907), and the Geological Society of China (vice-president, 1925); corresponding member of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences and the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher; and an honorary member of the Peking Society of Natural History, the China Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Academia Sinica, and the Academia Peipinensis.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nI. Original Works. Grabau was the author of some 300 publications, of which more than a score were substantial monographs and other books. The full bibliography is listed in the publications in the secondary literature. The principal volumes are listed in three categories: paleontological studies, stratigraphic studies, and textbooks and collative works.\n\nThe paleontological treatises contain substantial systematic descriptions of fossil organisms. Because his associates were exploring in regions that had not been known, the greatest contributions are to faunas from China: Phylogeny of Fusus and Its Allies (Washington, D. C., 1904); Ordovician Fossils From North China (Peking, 1922); Silurian Faunas of Eastern Yunnan (Peking, 1926);Paleozoic Corals of China (Peking, 1928); Devonian Brachiopods of China (Peking, 1931); and Early Permian Fossils of China, 2 vols. (Peking, 1934\u20131936). The Relations of Marine Bionomy to Stratigraphy (Buffalo, 1899) is a substantial introduction to the field of paleoecology.\n\nIn stratigraphic geology, Grabau\u2019s first publications were descriptions of stratigraphic sequences in various localities: Geology and Paleontology of Eighteen Mile Creek and the Lakesbore Section of Erie County, New York (Buffalo. 1898); Guide to the Geology and Paleontology of Niagara Falls and Vicinity (Albany, 1901); \u201cClassification of Sedimentary Rocks,\u201d in American Geologist, 33 (1904), 228\u2013247 and Guide to the Geology and Paleontology of the Schoharie Valley in Eastern New York, (Albany, 1906). The Monroe Formation of Southern Michigan and Adjacent Regions (Lansing, Mich., 1910) was prepared with W. H. Sherzer. The Permian of Mongolia (New York, 1931) included description of faunas collected on the central Asia expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History. The Stratigraphy of China was essentially a summary of knowledge. Probably his best-known work is The Principles of Stratigraphy (New York, 1913), repr. with preface by Marshall Kay (New York, 1960), one of the most influential texts of the early twentieth century.\n\nGrabau published Textbook of Geology, 2 vols. (New York. 1920\u20131921), which did not receive wide usage. His five-volume Paleozoic Formations in the Light of the Pulsation Theory (Peking. 1936\u20131938), intended to be the first encyclopedic summary of world stratigraphy, was developed to support his pulsation theory. Rhythm of the Ages (Peking, 1940) and the posthumously published, twenty year-old MS of The World We Live In (Taipei, 1961), were popular summaries of his philosophy. North American Index Fossils (New York, 1909\u20131910), written with W. H. Shimer, with illustrations of more than 2,000 distinctive invertebrate fossils, was the standard reference work for more than thirty years. He also published Principles of Salt Deposition (New York, 1920).\n\nII. Secondary Literature. The full bibliography of Grabau is contained in three biographic papers, H. W. Shimer, in Proceedings of the Geological Society of America for 1946 (1947), 161\u2013166; V. K. Ting in Grabau Anniversary. the commemorative vol. presented to Grabau on his fiftieth birthday, Bulletin of the Geological Society of China, 10 (l931). ix-xviii; and the intro. to The World We Live In (Taipei, 1961), xii-xxv.\n\nMarshall Kay"}]}
