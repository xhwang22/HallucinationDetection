In particular, actor Ha Jung-woo, who is drawing keen attention with his return after the propofol controversy two years ago, revealed the name of the actor whom he had wanted to work with since 2005.\n\nActors Ha Jung-woo, Hwang Jung-min, Park Hae-soo, Jo Woo-jin, Yoo Yeon-seok, and director Yoon Jong-bin attended the press conference for Netflix\u2019s original series \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d held on September 7th and told various stories.\n\nHa Jung-woo and Hwang Jung-min are two representative actors of the Korean film industry who boast outstanding acting skills and experiences, but \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d is the first time the two starred together in the same work.\n\nHa Jung-woo said, \u201cWhen I first joined my agency after graduating from college, he (Hwang Jung-min) took care of me a lot. One of the most memorable moments for me was when he attended the first press conference for the movie \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019 in 2005 to encourage me\u201d, expressing his gratitude to Hwang Jung-min, who took great care of him when he was a rookie actor.\n\nThe actor continued, \u201cSince then, I had dreamed of working with Hwang Jung-min. I didn\u2019t expect it to take such a long time. I felt grateful for every hour that I spent working on \u2018Narco-Saints\u2019 with him\u201d, revealing that he waited 17 years to have an opportunity to work with Hwang Jung-min.\n\nFlustered by Ha Jung-woo\u2019s confession, Hwang Jung-min jokingly said, \u201cWhat? You even dreamed of that?\u201d, and confessed that he had also wanted to work with Ha Jung-woo since he was younger. Hwang Jung-min even thanked \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d director Yoon Jong-bin for allowing him to belatedly meet Ha Jung-woo through this drama.\n\nIn fact, many other actors also wished to participate in the same production as the veteran actor Hwang Jung-min.\n\nYoo Yeon-seok, Park Hae-jin and Jo Woo-jin, who also appeared in \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d, also confessed that they met Hwang Jung-min for the first time through this work and showed their respect to the great senior, saying that they had dreamed of acting alongside Hwang Jung-min since a long time ago.\n\nIn response to the series of compliments from his juniors, Hwang Jung-min got embarrassed. Since then, Ha Jung-woo has expressed his deep affection for Hwang Jung-min wherever he goes.\n\nOn September 13th, Ha Jung-woo continued to mention Hwang Jung-min in an interview with the media. He said, \u201cIt felt very comfortable acting with him. Since he is a master, he seemed to have no pressure even when filming action scenes. He is always considerate of other actors so that we can act together comfortably\u201d, showing admiration for Hwang Jung-min\u2019s skills.\n\nHe also shared, \u201cI used to think Hwang Jung-min was a scary hyung, but after meeting him in person, I realized that he\u2019s warmer and more reliable than anyone else.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d tells the story that takes place when a civilian, who was falsely accused of being the drug lord who is taking control of the South American country Suriname, accepts the secret mission by the NIS. Since its release on September 9th, \u201cNarco-Saints\u201d, which features many talented actors, has been enjoying its box-office success.\n\nSource: insight"}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls004758210/", "page_content": "This is the list of best South Korean actors, in my opinion!

He came from a family of four, including his mother, father, and one younger brother. Jung-woo's father Kim Yong-Geon is a well known actor, who has appeared in many movies and television series, while his younger brother (Kim Yeong-hoon) is an aspiring actor. Since Jung-woo was 4 or 5 years old he has always dreamed of becoming an actor like his father. As a young adult, Jung-woo did not want to major in acting, but wanted to pursue acting as a career. His mom then suggested to Jung-woo to take up acting in college and even took him to a management company. Before entering college, Jung-woo enrolled at a private acting institute and at one point had actor Lee Beom-Su as his instructor [1]. Ha Jung-Woo then enrolled at Chung-Ang University as a theater major. While at the university Jung-woo acted on the stage.\n\nIn 1998, Jung-woo started his military service, working in the Armed Forces Public Relations Department. He put his acting experience to good use during this time, appearing in 10 promotional films for the military. In 2002, Jung-woo made his acting debut in the SBS sitcom \"Honest Living\" (Ddokbaro Salara) and his feature film debut in the 2002 film \"Madeleine.\" For the next few years, Jung-woo's acting career was relatively low-key, appearing in several supporting roles, but not receiving a lot of attention. Things started to change in 2005. Ha Jung-Woo signed with talent agency Sidus HQ and with their recommendation changed his named to \"Ha Jung-woo\" from Kim Seong-hun. Jung-woo would also appear in his first starring role in the the indie film \"The Unforgiven\" - a film centered around the relationships between military personnel. Jung-woo would then appear in Ki-duk Kim's \"Time\" & \"Breath,\" which would bring more attention to Jung-woo's acting talents in Korea and overseas. During this time, Jung-woo also starred in the popular MBC drama series \"H.I.T\" - portraying Jae-yoon Hah, a prosecutor who is romantically involved with police officer Hyeong-jeong Ko (played by Hyeon-jeong Ko). Jung-woo's portrayal of Jae-yoon Hah garnered the attention of many female fans. Jung-woo also appeared in the American indie film \"Never Forever,\" which garnered praise from the film festival circuit.\n\nJung-woo's next major role came in the 2008 serial killer film \"The Chaser.\" The movie became a hit at the Korean box office, raking in over 5 million ticket sales, while also garnering high praise from critics. Jung-woo's performance as the psychopath killer in \"The Chaser,\" brought shivers to many audience members, while also elevating Ha Jung-Woo's status as one of the most sought after actors working in the Korean film industry. Since \"The Chaser,\" Ha Jung-Woo has been working virtually non-stop for the next two years, appearing in films like \"My Dear Enemy,\" \"The Moonlight of Seoul,\" \"Boat,\" & \"Take Off.\" Ha Jung-Woo plans to work once again with director Na Hong-Jin (\"The Chaser\"), for his next film \"The Yellow Sea\". \"The Yellow Sea\" is expected to start shooting in December and will take 5-6 months to complete.\n\nHa Jung-Woo held his first art exhibition for the 5th annual Seoul Open Art Fair (April 22-26. 2010). His exhibition was part of the \"With\u2606Invitation\" section featuring famous Korean celebrities like Eom Tae-Woong & Ko Ah-Sung. Ha Jung-Woo displayed three different paintings all done in a modernistic style.\n\nActor\n\nMovies\n\nThe Closet (2020) - Sang-Won\n\n(2020) - Sang-Won Ashfall | Baekdusan (2019) - Jo In-Chang\n\n| Baekdusan (2019) -
