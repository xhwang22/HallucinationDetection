{"Frank Abagnale Jr. claimed to have assumed no fewer than eight identities, including an airline pilot, a physician, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer.": [{"url": "https://testmaxprep.com/blog/bar-exam/frank-abagnale-jr", "page_content": "If you've been busy studying for the bar exam and don't know who Frank Abagnale Jr. is, not to worry. Take a little break and learn all about the life of one of America's best conmen. His story was the basis for the movie Catch Me If You Can, starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nThe movie was about Frank Abagnale Jr., an American security consultant known for his history as a confident trickster, imposter, and escape artist. A young Leonardo DiCaprio gives us a lovely performance as a charismatic Abagnale running around the country, tricking hundreds of people into believing his various stories.\n\nAbagnale became one of the most famous imposters of all time, having assumed no fewer than eight different identities as an airline pilot, a doctor, a US Bureau of Prisons agent, and, yes, even a lawyer. He escaped from police custody twice, and all before he was the ripe age of 21 years old.\n\nThe Real Frank Abagnale Jr.\n\nFrank Abagnale was born in the Bronx, NY, in 1948. His parents divorced during his adolescence, and he moved with his mother and stepfather to Mount Vernon, NY. He states that he committed his first crime at 15, when he stole a neighbor's car and ended up leaving his father on the hook for the theft, amounting to a $3,400 bill.\n\nHe quickly ramped up in the seriousness of his crimes, and by 1968, at 20 years old, claims to have disguised himself as a TWA deadhead pilot and moved to Louisiana. There he talked himself into the company of a minister who hosted him, and he claimed to be a former pilot turned social worker. After his host family grew suspicious and contacted TWA to verify his identity, he was found to be a fraud and arrested.\n\nEventually, it was found that he was also in possession of bank checks from his host family and was sentenced to 12 years of probation, but instead, he fled to Europe. After defrauding people in Europe for a few weeks, he was caught and served two months in a Swedish prison, then was extradited back to the United States.\n\nAbagnale Jr.'s life only got more interesting from there. After returning to the US, he resumed his deadhead pilot schtick, this time as a Pan Am pilot, and traveled around to college campuses, claiming to be a part of a program looking for potential Pan Am stewardesses. Portraying himself as part pilot and part doctor, he also conducted phony physical exams on unsuspecting women who wanted to join the fake program.\n\nHe scaled up the con by cashing personal checks he forged to look like Pan Am paychecks, and after cashing a series of them, the FBI took notice. By November 1970, he was apprehended in Cobb County, GA, for forging a total of $1,448.60 in phony checks. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was released on parole after only serving 2 years.\n\nAfter his time in prison, he gave up his cons, which he attributes to finding love and starting a family. He founded a consulting firm, \"Abagnale and Associates,\" which advises its clients on fraud and document storage. He also speaks about his life story at conventions around the country.\n\nDifferences Between the Movie and Reality\n\nThe biggest difference between Catch Me If You Can and Frank Abagnale Jr.'s real-life story is the character of Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks. In real life, no such character existed. While it's true that Abagnale was hounded and ultimately apprehended by the FBI, he did not form a bond with any specific FBI agent. Furthermore, for a conman who is avoiding apprehension to continually seek out communication with an FBI agent (like that Christmas Eve phone call) would be extremely unlikely.\n\nHowever, movies are different from reality for a reason. Movies like Catch Me If You Can are only fun if there's a cat and mouse element, and without Tom Hanks' character, there just wouldn't be the same sense of suspense.\n\nAbagnale's Time as an Attorney\n\nFor those who know of Abagnale's story, you may have heard about how he faked his way into being an attorney. As the story goes, Abagnale forged a Harvard Law School transcript, passed the Louisiana bar exam, and got a job at the Louisiana Attorney General's office at nineteen.\n\nWhile he was posing as a Pan Am Officer, he told a stewardess he was dating that he was a Harvard Law student, and she introduced him to a lawyer friend. That attorney mentioned to Abagnale that the bar needed more lawyers, which gave Abagnale the idea to apply. Abagnale forged a transcript from Harvard and applied to take the bar exam. He studied hard, and after failing the exam twice, he passed the Louisiana exam on the third try after eight weeks of studying.\n\nAccording to Abagnale, he was not fond of his job as an attorney. He described his legal job as a \"gopher boy,\" having to fetch coffee and knickknacks for his boss. Eventually, Abagnale left because there was a real Harvard Law graduate who worked for the attorney general, and he had begun to ask too many questions about Abagnale's Harvard past. Abagnale didn't want to be discovered, so he quit after eight months of working as an attorney.\n\nA Grain of Salt\n\nWhile all of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s story seems incredible, and a book about his life and the blockbuster movie definitely make it seem like there's truth behind his claims, it's important to take all of his stories with a healthy grain of salt. Over the years, many of Abagnale's claims have been proven to be exaggerated and straight-up lies.\n\nThe biggest one? That he was an attorney or even passed the bar at all. There is no record of Abagnale having passed the bar in Louisiana (or elsewhere), and he never worked in the Attorney General's office. After a late-night talk show appearance, he was even challenged with questions about the former Louisiana Attorney General he claimed to have worked for and failed to answer any of them accurately.\n\nSo don't slack on your bar exam prep, thinking that you might be able to skate by on sheer luck. If it didn't work for America's best conman, you're better off putting in the hard work and actually becoming an attorney."}, {"url": "https://www.nairaland.com/1084249/frank-abagnale-true-life-story", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\ufffc\n\n\n\nFrank Abagnale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis biographical article needs additional citations for verification.

He became notorious in the 1960s for passing $2.5 million worth of meticulously forged checks across 26 countries over the course of five years, beginning when he was 16 years old.\n\n\n\nIn the process, he became one of the most famous impostors ever,[3] claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight separate identities as an airline pilot, a doctor, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer. He escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary), before he was 21 years old.[4]\n\n\n\nHe served fewer than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government. He is a consultant and lecturer at the academy and field offices for the FBI. He also runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.[5]\n\n\n\nAbagnale's life story provided the inspiration for the feature film Catch Me If You Can, as well as the Broadway musical with the same name, which opened in April 2011, and ghostwritten autobiography of the same name.\n\n\n\nChildhood\n\n\n\nAbagnale was one of four children and spent the first sixteen years of his life in Bronxville, New York.[6] His French mother, Paulette, and father, Frank Abagnale Sr., divorced when he was 16. At the divorce hearing, Abagnale ran away never to see his father again.[7] According to Abagnale, his father did not necessarily want him, but to reunite his family, he would attempt to win his mother back until his father's death in 1974. His father was also an affluent local who was very keen on politics and theatre, and was a major role model for Abagnale Jr.[8]\n\n\n\nFirst con\n\n\n\nHis first victim was his father who gave Frank a gas credit card and a truck to assist him in commuting to his part-time job. Frank Jr. devised a scheme to help pay for his dates with women. He used the credit card to \"buy\" tires, batteries, and other car-related items at gas stations. He made a deal with the attendants in which they gave him cash in return for them keeping the products. Ultimately, his father was liable for a bill of several thousand dollars.[9]\n\n\n\nBank fraud\n\n\n\nAbagnale's first confidence trick was writing personal checks on his own overdrawn account. This, however, would work for only a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so he moved on to opening other accounts in different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time, he experimented and developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect copies of checks, depositing them and persuading banks to advance him cash on the basis of money in his accounts.\n\n\n\nOne of Abagnale's famous tricks was to print his account number on blank deposit slips and add them to the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.\n\n\n\nIn a speech, Frank described one instance where he noticed the location where airlines and car rental businesses such as United Airlines and Hertz would drop off their daily collections of money in a zip-up bag and deposit it into a drop box on the airport premises. Using a security guard disguise he bought at a local costume shop, he put a sign over the box saying \"out of service, place deposits with security guard on duty\" and collected money that way. Later he disclosed how he could not believe this idea had actually worked, stating with some astonishment: \"How can a drop box be out of service?\"[10]\n\n\n\nImpersonations\n\n\n\nAirline pilot\n\n\n\nAbagnale decided to imitate a pilot because he wanted to fly throughout the world for free. He got a uniform by calling PanAm, telling them that he was a pilot working for them who had lost his uniform, and going to get a new one with a fake employee ID. He then forged an FAA pilot's license. [11]Pan American World Airways estimated that between the ages of 16 and 18, Abagnale flew over 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km) on over 250 flights and flew to 26 countries, at Pan Am's expense, by deadheading. He was also able to stay at hotels for free during this time. Everything from food to lodging was billed to the airline company. Abagnale stated that he was often invited by actual pilots to take the controls of the plane in-flight. On one occasion, he was offered the courtesy of flying at 30,000 ft (9,100 m). He took the controls, and enabled the autopilot, \"very much aware that I had been handed custody of 140 lives, my own included ... because I couldn't fly a drone\".[12]\n\n\n\nTeaching assistant\n\n\n\nHe forged a Columbia University degree and taught sociology at Brigham Young University for a semester, working as a teaching assistant by the name of Frank Adams.[13]\n\n\n\nDoctor\n\n\n\nFor eleven months he impersonated a chief resident pediatrician in a Georgia hospital under the alias Frank Conners. He chose this course after he was nearly arrested disembarking a flight in New Orleans. Afraid of possible capture, he retired temporarily to Georgia. When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as \"doctor\", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote \"pilot\". After befriending a real doctor who lived in the same apartment complex, he agreed to act as resident supervisor of interns as a favor until the local hospital could find someone else to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work. However, he was nearly exposed when an infant almost died from oxygen deprivation; he had no idea what a nurse meant when she said there was a \"blue baby\". He was able to fake his way through most of his duties by letting the interns handle the cases coming in during his late-night shift, setting broken bones and other mundane tasks. When the hospital found a replacement he returned to piloting, leaving only after he realized he could put lives at risk by his inability to respond to situations like the blue baby.[8]\n\n\n\nAttorney\n\n\n\nAbagnale forged a Harvard University law transcript, passed the bar exam of Louisiana and got a job at the Louisiana Attorney General's office at the age of nineteen. This happened while he was posing as Pan Am First Officer \"Robert Black.\" He told a stewardess he had briefly dated that he was also a Harvard law student, and she introduced him to a lawyer friend. Abagnale was told the bar needed more lawyers and was offered a chance to apply. After making a fake transcript from Harvard, he prepared himself for the compulsory exam. Despite failing twice, he claims to have passed the bar exam legitimately on the third try after eight weeks of study, because \"Louisiana at the time allowed you to take the Bar over and over as many times as you needed. It was really a matter of eliminating what you got wrong.\"[14]\n\n\n\nIn his biography, he described the premise of his legal job as a \"gopher boy\" who simply fetched coffee and books for his boss. However, there was a real Harvard graduate who also worked for that attorney general, and he hounded Abagnale with questions about his tenure at Harvard. Naturally, Abagnale could not answer questions about a university he had never attended, and he later resigned after eight months to protect himself, after learning the suspecting graduate was making inquiries into his background.\n\n\n\nCapture and imprisonment\n\n\n\nAbagnale was eventually caught in France in 1969 when an Air France attendant he had dated in the past recognized him and notified the police. When the French police apprehended him, 12 of the countries in which he had committed fraud sought his extradition. After a two-day trial, he first served prison time in Perpignan's House of Arrest in France\u2014a one-year sentence that was reduced by the presiding judge at his trial to six months. At Perpignan he was held nude in a tiny, filthy, lightless cell that he was never allowed to leave. The cell lacked toilet facilities, a mattress, or a blanket, and food and water were severely restricted.[15]\n\n\n\nHe was then extradited to Sweden where he was treated fairly well under Swedish law. During trial for forgery, his defense attorney almost had his case dismissed by arguing that he had \"created\" the fake checks and not forged them, but his charges were instead reduced to swindling and fraud. He served six months in a Malm\u00f6 prison, only to learn at the end of it he would be tried next in Italy. Later, a Swedish judge asked a U.S. State Department official to revoke his passport. Without a valid passport, the Swedish authorities were legally compelled to deport him to the United States, where he was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for multiple counts of forgery.[16]\n\n\n\nAlleged escapes\n\n\n\nWhile being deported to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner as it was turning onto a taxi strip at New York's JFK International Airport. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes and pick up a set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing US$20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, a country with which the U.S. had no extradition treaty. On his way to Montreal, he had a close call at a Mac's Milk in Dundas, Ontario. He was later caught by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing in line at the ticket counter and subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.[citation needed]\n\n\n\nBeing sentenced to 12 years in the Federal Correction Institution at Petersburg, Virginia, in April 1971, Abagnale also reportedly escaped the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, Georgia while awaiting trial, which he considers in his book to be one of the most infamous escapes in history. During the time, U.S. prisons were being condemned by civil rights groups and investigated by congressional committees. In a stroke of luck that included the accompanying U.S. marshal forgetting his detention commitment papers, Abagnale was mistaken for an undercover prison inspector and was even given privileges and food far better than the other inmates. The FDC in Atlanta had already lost two employees as a result of reports written by undercover federal agents, and Abagnale took advantage of their vulnerability. He contacted a friend (called in his book \"Jean Sebring\" who posed as his fianc\u00e9e and slipped him the business card of \"Inspector C.W. Dunlap\" of the Bureau of Prisons, which she had obtained by posing as a freelance writer doing an article on \"fire safety measures in federal detention centers\". She also handed over a business card from \"Sean O'Riley\" (later revealed to be Joe Shea), the FBI agent in charge of Abagnale's case, which she doctored at a stationery print shop. Abagnale told the corrections officers that he was indeed a prison inspector and handed over Dunlap's business card as proof. He told them that he needed to contact FBI Agent Sean O'Riley, on a matter of urgent business.[citation needed]\n\n\n\nO'Riley's phone number (actually the number altered by Sebring) was dialed and picked up by Jean Sebring, at a payphone in an Atlanta shopping-mall, posing as an operator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, he was allowed to meet unsupervised with O'Riley in a predetermined car outside the detention center. Sebring, incognito, picked Abagnale up and drove him to an Atlanta bus station where he took a Greyhound bus to New York, and soon thereafter, a train to Washington, D.C. Abagnale bluffed his way through an attempted capture by posing as an FBI agent after being recognized by a motel registration clerk. Still bent on making his way to Brazil, Abagnale was picked up a few weeks later by two NYPD detectives when he inadvertently walked past their unmarked police car.[8]\n\n\n\nLegitimate jobs\n\n\n\nIn 1974, after he had served less than five years, the United States federal government released him on the condition that he would help the federal authorities without pay against crimes committed by fraud and scam artists, and sign in once a week.[16] Not wanting to return to his family in New York, he left the choice of parole up to the court, and it was decided that he would be paroled in Texas.\n\n\n\nAfter his release, Abagnale tried several jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist, but he was fired from most of these upon having his criminal career discovered via background checks and not informing his employers that he was a former convict. Finding them unsatisfying, he approached a bank with an offer. He explained to the bank what he had done, and offered to speak to the bank's staff and show various tricks that \"paperhangers\" use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his speech helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $500 with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks.[17] The banks were impressed by the results, and he began a legitimate life as a security consultant.[18][citation needed]\n\n\n\nHe later founded Abagnale & Associates,[18] which advises businesses on fraud. Abagnale is now a millionaire through his legal fraud detection and avoidance consulting business based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Abagnale also continues to advise the FBI, with whom he has associated for over 35 years, by teaching at the FBI Academy and lecturing for FBI field offices throughout the country. According to his website,[19] more than 14,000 institutions have adopted Abagnale's fraud prevention programs.\n\n\n\nHe lives in Charleston, South Carolina[20] with his wife, whom he married one year after becoming legitimate. They have three sons, including one who currently works for the FBI.\n\n\n\nAbagnale and Joe Shea, the FBI agent on whom the character of Carl Hanratty was based for the film Catch Me If You Can, remained close friends until Shea's death.\n\n\n\nVeracity of claims\n\n\n\nThe authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits was questioned even before the publishing of Catch Me If You Can. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that \"Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.\"[21]\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness rather vaguely with a statement posted on his company's website. The statement said in part \"I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.\"[22]\n\n\n\nMedia appearances\n\n\n\n\ufffc\n\n\n\nFrank Abagnale and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n\n\nIn 1977, Abagnale appeared on the TV quiz show To Tell the Truth, along with two contestants also presenting themselves as him. A reenactment of this episode appeared in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002), featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio in his place. This movie is based on the semi-autobiographical book of the same name, written by Abagnale with the help of Stan Redding. The real Abagnale makes a cameo appearance in this film as one of the French police officers taking his character into custody.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Abagnale was featured as a recurring guest on the UK Channel 4 television series The Secret Cabaret. The show was based around magic and illusions with a sinister, almost gothic presentation style. Abagnale was featured as an expert exposing various confidence tricks.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Abagnale appeared in a short role as a speaker in the BBC TV series The Real Hustle. He spoke of different scams run by fraudsters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupation\n\n\n\nCEO of Abagnale & Associates (security consultants)\n\n\n\nSpouse\n\n\n\nKelly[1]\n\n\n\nChildren\n\n\n\nScott, Chris, Sean[1]\n\n\n\nFrank William Abagnale, Jr. (\ufffc /\u02c8\u00e6b\u0259\u0261ne\u026al/, Italian pronunciation: [aba\u0272\u02c8\u0272ale]; born April 27, 1948)[2] is an American security consultant known for his history as a former confidence trickster, check forger, impostor, and escape artist.

Without a valid passport, the Swedish authorities were legally compelled to deport him to the United States, where he was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for multiple counts of forgery.[16]\n\n\n\nAlleged escapes\n\n\n\nWhile being deported to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner as it was turning onto a taxi strip at New York's JFK International Airport. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes and pick up a set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing US$20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, a country with which the U.S. had no extradition treaty. On his way to Montreal, he had a close call at a Mac's Milk in Dundas, Ontario. He was later caught by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing in line at the ticket counter and subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.[citation needed]\n\n\n\nBeing sentenced to 12 years in the Federal Correction Institution at Petersburg, Virginia, in April 1971, Abagnale also reportedly escaped the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, Georgia while awaiting trial, which he considers in his book to be one of the most infamous escapes in history. During the time, U.S. prisons were being condemned by civil rights groups and investigated by congressional committees. In a stroke of luck that included the accompanying U.S. marshal forgetting his detention commitment papers, Abagnale was mistaken for an undercover prison inspector and was even given privileges and food far better than the other inmates. The FDC in Atlanta had already lost two employees as a result of reports written by undercover federal agents, and Abagnale took advantage of their vulnerability. He contacted a friend (called in his book \"Jean Sebring\" who posed as his fianc\u00e9e and slipped him the business card of \"Inspector C.W. Dunlap\" of the Bureau of Prisons, which she had obtained by posing as a freelance writer doing an article on \"fire safety measures in federal detention centers\". She also handed over a business card from \"Sean O'Riley\" (later revealed to be Joe Shea), the FBI agent in charge of Abagnale's case, which she doctored at a stationery print shop. Abagnale told the corrections officers that he was indeed a prison inspector and handed over Dunlap's business card as proof. He told them that he needed to contact FBI Agent Sean O'Riley, on a matter of urgent business.[citation needed]\n\n\n\nO'Riley's phone number (actually the number altered by Sebring) was dialed and picked up by Jean Sebring, at a payphone in an Atlanta shopping-mall, posing as an operator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, he was allowed to meet unsupervised with O'Riley in a predetermined car outside the detention center. Sebring, incognito, picked Abagnale up and drove him to an Atlanta bus station where he took a Greyhound bus to New York, and soon thereafter, a train to Washington, D.C. Abagnale bluffed his way through an attempted capture by posing as an FBI agent after being recognized by a motel registration clerk. Still bent on making his way to Brazil, Abagnale was picked up a few weeks later by two NYPD detectives when he inadvertently walked past their unmarked police car.[8]\n\n\n\nLegitimate jobs\n\n\n\nIn 1974, after he had served less than five years, the United States federal government released him on the condition that he would help the federal authorities without pay against crimes committed by fraud and scam artists, and sign in once a week.[16] Not wanting to return to his family in New York, he left the choice of parole up to the court, and it was decided that he would be paroled in Texas.\n\n\n\nAfter his release, Abagnale tried several jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist, but he was fired from most of these upon having his criminal career discovered via background checks and not informing his employers that he was a former convict. Finding them unsatisfying, he approached a bank with an offer. He explained to the bank what he had done, and offered to speak to the bank's staff and show various tricks that \"paperhangers\" use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his speech helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $500 with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks.[17] The banks were impressed by the results, and he began a legitimate life as a security consultant.[18][citation needed]\n\n\n\nHe later founded Abagnale & Associates,[18] which advises businesses on fraud. Abagnale is now a millionaire through his legal fraud detection and avoidance consulting business based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Abagnale also continues to advise the FBI, with whom he has associated for over 35 years, by teaching at the FBI Academy and lecturing for FBI field offices throughout the country. According to his website,[19] more than 14,000 institutions have adopted Abagnale's fraud prevention programs.\n\n\n\nHe lives in Charleston, South Carolina[20] with his wife, whom he married one year after becoming legitimate. They have three sons, including one who currently works for the FBI.\n\n\n\nAbagnale and Joe Shea, the FBI agent on whom the character of Carl Hanratty was based for the film Catch Me If You Can, remained close friends until Shea's death.\n\n\n\nVeracity of claims\n\n\n\nThe authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits was questioned even before the publishing of Catch Me If You Can. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that \"Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.\"[21]\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness rather vaguely with a statement posted on his company's website. The statement said in part \"I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted.

(March 2010)\ufffcFrank AbagnaleOccupationCEO of Abagnale & Associates (security consultants)SpouseKelly[1]ChildrenScott, Chris, Sean[1]Frank William Abagnale, Jr. (\ufffc /\u02c8\u00e6b\u0259\u0261ne\u026al/, Italian pronunciation: [aba\u0272\u02c8\u0272ale]; born April 27, 1948)[2] is an American security consultant known for his history as a former confidence trickster, check forger, impostor, and escape artist. He became notorious in the 1960s for passing $2.5 million worth of meticulously forged checks across 26 countries over the course of five years, beginning when he was 16 years old.In the process, he became one of the most famous impostors ever,[3] claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight separate identities as an airline pilot, a doctor, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer. He escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary), before he was 21 years old.[4]He served fewer than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government. He is a consultant and lecturer at the academy and field offices for the FBI. He also runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.[5]Abagnale's life story provided the inspiration for the feature film Catch Me If You Can, as well as the Broadway musical with the same name, which opened in April 2011, and ghostwritten autobiography of the same name.ChildhoodAbagnale was one of four children and spent the first sixteen years of his life in Bronxville, New York.[6] His French mother, Paulette, and father, Frank Abagnale Sr., divorced when he was 16. At the divorce hearing, Abagnale ran away never to see his father again.[7] According to Abagnale, his father did not necessarily want him, but to reunite his family, he would attempt to win his mother back until his father's death in 1974. His father was also an affluent local who was very keen on politics and theatre, and was a major role model for Abagnale Jr.[8]First conHis first victim was his father who gave Frank a gas credit card and a truck to assist him in commuting to his part-time job. Frank Jr. devised a scheme to help pay for his dates with women. He used the credit card to \"buy\" tires, batteries, and other car-related items at gas stations. He made a deal with the attendants in which they gave him cash in return for them keeping the products. Ultimately, his father was liable for a bill of several thousand dollars.[9]Bank fraudAbagnale's first confidence trick was writing personal checks on his own overdrawn account. This, however, would work for only a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so he moved on to opening other accounts in different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time, he experimented and developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect copies of checks, depositing them and persuading banks to advance him cash on the basis of money in his accounts.One of Abagnale's famous tricks was to print his account number on blank deposit slips and add them to the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.In a speech, Frank described one instance where he noticed the location where airlines and car rental businesses such as United Airlines and Hertz would drop off their daily collections of money in a zip-up bag and deposit it into a drop box on the airport premises. Using a security guard disguise he bought at a local costume shop, he put a sign over the box saying \"out of service, place deposits with security guard on duty\" and collected money that way. Later he disclosed how he could not believe this idea had actually worked, stating with some astonishment: \"How can a drop box be out of service?\"[10]ImpersonationsAirline pilotAbagnale decided to imitate a pilot because he wanted to fly throughout the world for free. He got a uniform by calling PanAm, telling them that he was a pilot working for them who had lost his uniform, and going to get a new one with a fake employee ID. He then forged an FAA pilot's license. [11]Pan American World Airways estimated that between the ages of 16 and 18, Abagnale flew over 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km) on over 250 flights and flew to 26 countries, at Pan Am's expense, by deadheading. He was also able to stay at hotels for free during this time. Everything from food to lodging was billed to the airline company. Abagnale stated that he was often invited by actual pilots to take the controls of the plane in-flight. On one occasion, he was offered the courtesy of flying at 30,000 ft (9,100 m). He took the controls, and enabled the autopilot, \"very much aware that I had been handed custody of 140 lives, my own included ... because I couldn't fly a drone\".[12]Teaching assistantHe forged a Columbia University degree and taught sociology at Brigham Young University for a semester, working as a teaching assistant by the name of Frank Adams.[13]DoctorFor eleven months he impersonated a chief resident pediatrician in a Georgia hospital under the alias Frank Conners. He chose this course after he was nearly arrested disembarking a flight in New Orleans. Afraid of possible capture, he retired temporarily to Georgia. When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as \"doctor\", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote \"pilot\". After befriending a real doctor who lived in the same apartment complex, he agreed to act as resident supervisor of interns as a favor until the local hospital could find someone else to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work. However, he was nearly exposed when an infant almost died from oxygen deprivation; he had no idea what a nurse meant when she said there was a \"blue baby\". He was able to fake his way through most of his duties by letting the interns handle the cases coming in during his late-night shift, setting broken bones and other mundane tasks. When the hospital found a replacement he returned to piloting, leaving only after he realized he could put lives at risk by his inability to respond to situations like the blue baby.[8]AttorneyAbagnale forged a Harvard University law transcript, passed the bar exam of Louisiana and got a job at the Louisiana Attorney General's office at the age of nineteen. This happened while he was posing as Pan Am First Officer \"Robert Black.\" He told a stewardess he had briefly dated that he was also a Harvard law student, and she introduced him to a lawyer friend. Abagnale was told the bar needed more lawyers and was offered a chance to apply. After making a fake transcript from Harvard, he prepared himself for the compulsory exam. Despite failing twice, he claims to have passed the bar exam legitimately on the third try after eight weeks of study, because \"Louisiana at the time allowed you to take the Bar over and over as many times as you needed. It was really a matter of eliminating what you got wrong.\"[14]In his biography, he described the premise of his legal job as a \"gopher boy\" who simply fetched coffee and books for his boss. However, there was a real Harvard graduate who also worked for that attorney general, and he hounded Abagnale with questions about his tenure at Harvard. Naturally, Abagnale could not answer questions about a university he had never attended, and he later resigned after eight months to protect himself, after learning the suspecting graduate was making inquiries into his background.Capture and imprisonmentAbagnale was eventually caught in France in 1969 when an Air France attendant he had dated in the past recognized him and notified the police. When the French police apprehended him, 12 of the countries in which he had committed fraud sought his extradition. After a two-day trial, he first served prison time in Perpignan's House of Arrest in France\u2014a one-year sentence that was reduced by the presiding judge at his trial to six months. At Perpignan he was held nude in a tiny, filthy, lightless cell that he was never allowed to leave. The cell lacked toilet facilities, a mattress, or a blanket, and food and water were severely restricted.[15]He was then extradited to Sweden where he was treated fairly well under Swedish law. During trial for forgery, his defense attorney almost had his case dismissed by arguing that he had \"created\" the fake checks and not forged them, but his charges were instead reduced to swindling and fraud. He served six months in a Malm\u00f6 prison, only to learn at the end of it he would be tried next in Italy. Later, a Swedish judge asked a U.S. State Department official to revoke his passport.

In a stroke of luck that included the accompanying U.S. marshal forgetting his detention commitment papers, Abagnale was mistaken for an undercover prison inspector and was even given privileges and food far better than the other inmates. The FDC in Atlanta had already lost two employees as a result of reports written by undercover federal agents, and Abagnale took advantage of their vulnerability. He contacted a friend (called in his book \"Jean Sebring\"who posed as his fianc\u00e9e and slipped him the business card of \"Inspector C.W. Dunlap\" of the Bureau of Prisons, which she had obtained by posing as a freelance writer doing an article on \"fire safety measures in federal detention centers\". She also handed over a business card from \"Sean O'Riley\" (later revealed to be Joe Shea), the FBI agent in charge of Abagnale's case, which she doctored at a stationery print shop. Abagnale told the corrections officers that he was indeed a prison inspector and handed over Dunlap's business card as proof. He told them that he needed to contact FBI Agent Sean O'Riley, on a matter of urgent business.[citation needed]O'Riley's phone number (actually the number altered by Sebring) was dialed and picked up by Jean Sebring, at a payphone in an Atlanta shopping-mall, posing as an operator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, he was allowed to meet unsupervised with O'Riley in a predetermined car outside the detention center. Sebring, incognito, picked Abagnale up and drove him to an Atlanta bus station where he took a Greyhound bus to New York, and soon thereafter, a train to Washington, D.C. Abagnale bluffed his way through an attempted capture by posing as an FBI agent after being recognized by a motel registration clerk. Still bent on making his way to Brazil, Abagnale was picked up a few weeks later by two NYPD detectives when he inadvertently walked past their unmarked police car.[8]Legitimate jobsIn 1974, after he had served less than five years, the United States federal government released him on the condition that he would help the federal authorities without pay against crimes committed by fraud and scam artists, and sign in once a week.[16] Not wanting to return to his family in New York, he left the choice of parole up to the court, and it was decided that he would be paroled in Texas.After his release, Abagnale tried several jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist, but he was fired from most of these upon having his criminal career discovered via background checks and not informing his employers that he was a former convict. Finding them unsatisfying, he approached a bank with an offer. He explained to the bank what he had done, and offered to speak to the bank's staff and show various tricks that \"paperhangers\" use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his speech helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $500 with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks.[17] The banks were impressed by the results, and he began a legitimate life as a security consultant.[18][citation needed]He later founded Abagnale & Associates,[18] which advises businesses on fraud. Abagnale is now a millionaire through his legal fraud detection and avoidance consulting business based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Abagnale also continues to advise the FBI, with whom he has associated for over 35 years, by teaching at the FBI Academy and lecturing for FBI field offices throughout the country. According to his website,[19] more than 14,000 institutions have adopted Abagnale's fraud prevention programs.He lives in Charleston, South Carolina[20] with his wife, whom he married one year after becoming legitimate. They have three sons, including one who currently works for the FBI.Abagnale and Joe Shea, the FBI agent on whom the character of Carl Hanratty was based for the film Catch Me If You Can, remained close friends until Shea's death.Veracity of claimsThe authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits was questioned even before the publishing of Catch Me If You Can. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that \"Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.\"[21]In 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness rather vaguely with a statement posted on his company's website. The statement said in part \"I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.\"[22]Media appearancesFrank Abagnale and Leonardo DiCaprio.In 1977, Abagnale appeared on the TV quiz show To Tell the Truth, along with two contestants also presenting themselves as him. A reenactment of this episode appeared in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002), featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio in his place. This movie is based on the semi-autobiographical book of the same name, written by Abagnale with the help of Stan Redding. The real Abagnale makes a cameo appearance in this film as one of the French police officers taking his character into custody.In the early 1990s, Abagnale was featured as a recurring guest on the UK Channel 4 television series The Secret Cabaret. The show was based around magic and illusions with a sinister, almost gothic presentation style. Abagnale was featured as an expert exposing various confidence tricks.In 2007, Abagnale appeared in a short role as a speaker in the BBC TV series The Real Hustle. He spoke of different scams run by fraudsters."}, {"url": "https://www.documentarytube.com/videos/catch-me-if-you-can-frank-abagnale-talks-at-google/", "page_content": "Frank William Abagnale Jr. is an American security consultant.

Some say he is the best, although pedants would point out that the best confidence tricksters are the ones you\u2019ve never heard about. Nonetheless, Abagnale led an extraordinary life where he assumed up to eight identities, cashed approximately $2.5 million worth of bad checks (his estimate), and lived a fast-paced life filled with drama and suspense; all by the time, he was 21 years old. The movie \u2018Catch Me If You Can\u2019 is based on his life story, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the role of Abagnale.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHe was born on April 27, 1948, in New York and his father, Frank Sr., and mother, Paulette, divorced when he was 14 years old. Abagnale was extremely close to his father, and he viewed him as a role model. He used to attend business meetings with his father, and this is where he learned details about business transactions. Despite having a relatively stable childhood, Abagnale soon resorted to petty crimes such as shoplifting. However, he quickly grew bored of it and sought a greater criminal challenge.\n\nIronically, Abagnale\u2019s father was the first victim of his con artist career. When he was 15, he called various gas stations and told the owners to ring him up for merchandise (such as tires), but gave him a cash sum well below the real value of the products. Abagnale used his father\u2019s charge card for the scam for about a month, until his father received a bill for $3,400. What Abagnale didn\u2019t know was that his father was struggling financially.\n\nHis mother sent him to a school for \u2018troubled boys,\u2019 and during that period his father lost his business. Meanwhile, Abagnale left home at the age of 16 and earned just $1.50 an hour for his first job. He believed the low pay was due to his age rather than the lack of a high school degree, so he altered his ID to pretend he was 10 years older.\n\nThe Beginning of a Crime Spree\n\nAbagnale was a master check forger and was apparently the first to exploit the routing of checks via the numbers on the code line. However, he had difficulties at the beginning because the practice of writing bad checks and overdrawing his account only happened for so long before banks demanded payment.\n\nAs a result, it was necessary to use innovative methods of conning people out of money. On one occasion, he took a batch of bank deposit slips, prefilled his account number and placed them back in the stack. The reason? Abagnale noticed that most people left the account number section blank, but the banks always went by the section if it was filled. The next morning, he woke up to find $42,000 in his account.\n\nAbagnale soon realized that he would have more success with his bad checks if he could showcase an air of authority. He knew that pilots were well-respected individuals, so he used his cunning to acquire a uniform. It was here that his career as a con artist quite literally \u2018took off.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Frank-Abagnale-Jr/6000000034493607043", "page_content": "About Frank William Abagnale, Jr.\n\nFrank Abagnale\n\nimposter\n\nFrank William Abagnale, Jr. is an American security consultant known for his history as a former confidence trickster, check forger, and impostor between the ages of 15 and 21.

Known for his history as a former check forger and impostor, he became one of the most infamous impostors ever, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities in the process. Abagnale's life story was the inspiration for the feature film \"Catch Me If You Can,\" starring Leonardo Dicaprio as Abagnale.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale was born April 27, 1948 in Bronxville, New York to a French mother and an Italian American father. He spent the first 16 years of his life in New Rochelle, New York. His parents separated when he was 16. He escaped from police custody twice before he was 21 years old. As a youth, Abagnale's parents divorced and Frank, Jr. often tagged along on his dad's business dealings. It was during this time that Frank, Jr. learned a lot about white-collar businesses. As a teenager, he got caught up in petty crimes, but it wasn't long before he moved on to more sophisticated crimes.\n\nHis first victim was his father, and he was just 15 at the time. Abagnale began his crime spree using his father's gas credit card and convincing gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash, allowing them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart when Frank's father got the credit card bill. In December 1964, Frank enlisted in the United States Navy but was discharged after three months and arrested for forgery shortly after. He was arrested again the following year for car theft in Eureka, California, after he stole a Ford Mustang from one of his father's neighbors. Abagnale was pictured in the local newspaper, seated in a car and being questioned by a special agent in the FBI.\n\nHe found his crime 'sweet spot' when he discovered the art of writing bad checks and impersonating everyone from a doctor to a pilot, a fraud tactic that lasted until he was finally caught in France in 1969. He was sentenced to four months but only served three. He was then extradited to Sweden where he was convicted of gross fraud by forgery. Frank served two months in prison and was banned from returning to Sweden for eight years, and required to recompense his Swedish victims, which he never did. He was deported back to the United States in June 1970.\n\nAfter he returned to the U.S, Abagnale began impersonating a pilot and went around college campuses, saying he was there to recruit flight attendants for Pan Am, passing bad checks the entire time. At the University of Arizona, he claimed that he was a pilot and a doctor and conducted physical exams on several female college students who wanted to be part of flight crews. It was after he began to forge Pan Am payroll checks across five different states that he came to the attention of the FBI. He was arrested in Georgia in November 1970 after cashing 10 fake Pan Am payroll checks in different towns. He escaped from the local jail and was found a few weeks later in NYC. He was sentenced to ten years for forging checks with an additional two years for escaping from jail. He was released on parole after two years served at the Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg, Virginia. Unwilling to return to his father's house in New York, Frank left the parole location choice up to the court, which chose Houston, Texas.\n\nAfter his release, Abagnale tried his hand at numerous jobs but was fired from most after it was discovered he had been hired without revealing his past crimes. He again posed as a pilot in 1974 to obtain a job at Camp Manison, a summer children's camp in Texas where he was arrested for stealing cameras from his co-workers. During this time, he also falsified his resume to falsely reflect that he had worked with the Los Angeles Police Department and Scotland Yard. It was around this time that he decided to change his life\u2013by this point, he had a wife and three sons. The family moved to Tulsa and stayed in the same house for 25 years.\n\nAbagnale & Associates\n\nFrank then worked undercover for the FBI for more than 30 years as an informant on fraud issues and went on to open his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which also educates on how to avoid becoming a fraud victim. Abagnale also wrote the books The Art of the Steal and Stealing Your Life, both on the topic of fraud prevention. In 2015, Abagnale was named the AARP Fraud Watch Ambassador, where he helps \"to provide online programs and community forums to educate consumers about ways to protect themselves from identity theft and cybercrime. In 2018 Frank started hosting the AARP podcast \"The Perfect Scam.\"\n\nHe's also appeared in the media a variety of times including three times on \"The Tonight Show.\" He also had a regular slot on the British net work TV series \"The Secret Cabaret\" in the '90s. A book about Abagnale, \"Catch Me If You Can,\" was turned into a movie by Steven Spielberg in 2002 and featured Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. The real Frank Abagnale made a cameo in the film, playing a French police officer taking DiCaprio into custody.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHe and his wife Kelly have three sons. After the children left home for college, Kelly suggested she and Frank should leave Tulsa.

He later impersonated various white-collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started his own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of his life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about his personal history was shared in his 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via his website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties.\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr. started his own business.\n\nAbagnale would later state that he had a stable childhood and was especially close to his father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When his mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to her husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were his siblings devastated, but so was his father, who was still in love with his wife. As his mother worked toward her independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with his father after the divorce, and he often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white-collar transactions.\n\nCredit Card Schemes\n\nAs a teenager, Abagnale got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. He soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using his father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Abagnale convinced gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when his father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, his father was struggling financially.\n\nDismayed over her son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent him to a school for wayward boys. Undone by his father's newfound circumstances and caught between his parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old.\n\nAbagnale had little in his bank account and no formal education. Abagnale altered his driver\u2019s license to make himself 10 years older than he was and exaggerated his education. This helped him get better-paying jobs, but he still barely made ends meet.\n\nAbagnale decided to quit working and wrote bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn his account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that he would eventually be caught, he went into hiding.\n\nImpersonations Meant to Impress\n\nAbagnale realized that he could cash more bad checks if he dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. He decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so he schemed his way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that he had lost his uniform while traveling. HQ told him where to go to pick up a new one, which he did \u2014 and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D.\n\nAbagnale then learned all he could about flying \u2014 once, by pretending he was a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am \u2014 and cleverly forged his own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. His ruse earned him valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which he did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world.\n\nOnce Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, he decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought his identity was blown \u2014 but instead, he was invited to visit the local hospital, where he became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Abagnale eventually gave up the gig and left town.\n\nOver the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with him when he settled down in Montpelier, France. He had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized his face on a wanted poster, she turned him in to authorities.\n\nJail Time and Consultancy\n\nAbagnale served time in France (reputedly in the harsh confines of Perpignan, where he became seriously ill), Sweden and the United States for his crimes, during which time his father died. Abagnale was eventually granted parole after several years from a Petersburg, Virginia prison. He eventually found lecturing work as a white-collar crime specialist, providing information to bank employees about ways to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nIn exchange for his freedom, the government told Abagnale that he had to educate them about his methods in order to prevent others from defrauding authorities. Abagnale worked with the FBI for more than 30 years as one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on document fraud, check swindling, forgery and embezzlement. He also started his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which educates others on how to avoid becoming fraud victims.\n\nMovie: 'Catch Me If You Can'\n\nIn 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the aforementioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nUpon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that he regrets that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of his life behind.\n\nBooks\n\nAbagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: April 27, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Bronxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the United States and overseas for his fraudulent crimes.
