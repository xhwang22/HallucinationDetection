And learning how to read the various presentations of these instruments in the Wall Street Journal is a big help. But this book can only be an introductory step. After you read this book you will know enough to begin studying the various topics, but don't think you will know enough about them to do much more than get yourself in big trouble if you start playing around with much more than mutual funds.\n\nBut this book will help demystify the terms and processes around equities, bonds, and other instruments. For this I highly recommend it.

If this book were called a dictionary of money and investing, I would give it a five star rating. For it works well as a dictionary. In fact, it is better than a dictionary because the explanations are clearer, more detailed, and better illustrated.\n\nIn the sections on what money, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and economic indicators are, the book functions as that five star dictionary.\n\nWithin each section beginning with stocks, the \"guide\" also begins to guide you in subtle ways that can cause you harm. Let me cite a few examples. The guide seems to suggest that when the market is going up, a company's earnings are doing well, and interest rates are not rising that is a good time to buy a stock. The illustrated graph seems to show other times when it is good not to buy stocks. As such, it suggests the mentality of buying and selling stocks to catch cycles. Yet research has shown that few people can master that process, so those who try will tend to do less well than those who buy and hold.\n\nAnother example is in failing to discuss the role of management fees, expenses, portfolio turnover, and diversification on which mutual fund to pick. As John Bogle shows in Common Sense on Mutual Funds, these are very important factors to consider. Yet they are not defined or cited.\n\nThe book also teaches people a little about short selling, commodities, futures, and other exotic investments. The book fails to point out that these are well beyond the skill of the average investor, and that many people get hurt in these areas. Basically, this is like a book of definitions about poisonous snakes that fails to mention that the snakes are poisonous if they bite you.\n\nOther obvious omissions included no mention of tracking stocks, ADRs in the stock section (you find the definition in International markets, where to me it fits less well), the differences in discount brokers, electronic trading choices, and how to find information about stocks on the Internet (the only source cited in the SEC).\n\nThe focus is overly on the U.S. with only a small section on international securities. The area of interest rate futures, where Europe dominates, is barely referred to in this book.\n\nSome of the information is just plain out of date. NAIC is cited as being the National Association of Investment Clubs. I believe it dropped that name over 10 years ago although it still goes by NAIC. The guide refers to there being 37,000 investment clubs in the U.S. I think that number was exceeded many years ago.\n\nFurther, much of the information is basically about how to read economic statistics. Many people would argue technical analysis is at least as important as economic statistics, but nothing about technical analysis is included in the book.\n\nIf you want to learn about investing, you need to know investing principles more than you need to know these terms (such as the various aspects of a stock certificate's printing and engraving). You will find most of the relevant terms covered in basic investing books like Louis Engel's book, How to Buy Stocks. You would be far better off reading ChangeWave Investing, Common Sense on Mutual Funds, and Rich Dad, Poor Dad's Investment Guide than this book for getting a sense of what the basic investing issues are.\n\nOvercome your misconception that anything with The Wall Street Journal's name on it is bound to be the best resource. Certainly, that isn't true in this case.\n\nMy suggestion is that The Wall Street Journal revise this book and either cut it back into being an expanded dictionary, or expand it into an investing guide worthy of its name."}, {"url": "https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6890881M/The_Wall_Street_journal_guide_to_understanding_money_investing", "page_content": "Picture a market that is open 24 hours a day, where you can buy ownership in the largest companies in the world, lend money to the government for 30 days or 30 years, or gamble on the future price of raw materials you may never see or use.\n\nWelcome to the intriguing and often baffling world of money and investing, a world that seems remote from our daily lives yet directly affects our pocketbooks\u2014how far our dollar goes in the supermarket, how much we earn on our investments, and what it will cost to buy or refinance our homes.\n\nBuilding on the style we developed for The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Personal Finance, we've written this primer in plain, everyday English to unravel the mysteries of the financial markets\u2014the language, the players, the strategies, and above all, the risks and rewards of investments, as well as their ups and downs.\n\nThrough clear, colorful graphics we take you behind the scenes to show how the markets works, how money gains and loses value, the meaning of financial trends and indicators, and the things you need to know when making your own investments and measuring their performance.\n\nIn preparing the guide, we are deeply indebted to The Wall Street Journal, and especially Douglas Sease,for their unstinting editorial support, the use of their financial tables and charts, and the vast information resources and financial expertise made available to us.\n\nKENNETH M.

The purpose of the new offering is not to bring something better to the market, or to bring something cheaper to the market, the purpose is to gain some market share of an already existing market.\n\n\n\nThis may be the primary reason behind the publication of this new book. Kiplinger's has had a book out there for more than a decade. It covers essentially the same ground. I'm sure that there are other books in this same survey category that I am not familiar with. The point is that this book turns out, at best, to be a \"me too\" book for the Journal.\n\n\n\nBut, what if that were not the case, and this book were to be judged on its own merit? Then what? An early question could be who is the book written for? My experience tells me that once folks are retired a year or so, they are past the point of seeking retirement advice from a book. The Kiplinger's book says that its focus is on ages 50-65 and for those who are \"in or out of the workplace.\" This sounds like the audience is mostly pre-retirees. With that in mind, let's look at this new book, itself.\n\n\n\nWe're told that the book addresses \"both money and time.\" Wisely, the \"time\" section come first; otherwise, like so many other high-level books on retirement, the financials might end up with more space than they should in the overall effort. At least the \"time\" section has a chance to shine if it goes first.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the time section is not much of an \"upper.\" Instead, it is filled with warning and negatives and much of the stuff that reinforces any anxiety someone might have about retirement before reading the book. We're told that any \"assumption\" that someone is going to like retirement better than work is \"dangerous,\" especially for \"people who have enjoyed their careers.\" And we're told about a couple for which \"rest and relaxation didn't hold much appeal.\" Instead, these guys enter the wine business \"in retirement.\" We're told that it was \"nerve-wracking,\" that they end up with 15 employees and that they begin producing thousands of bottles of wine per year. We're told that this story is \"encouraging.\" But what does it have to do with \"retirement?\"\n\n\n\nThen we learn about another guy who tried retirement, but returns to the workplace, saying, \"A huge piece of my life was totally gone.\" Then, another guy who retires from IBM, only to open a \"small travel business.\" Define \"small travel business.\" Sounds not like \"retirement\" to me.\n\n\n\nBut, alas, there is one paragraph in this \"time\" section that tells those of us who might want to embrace the \"traditional\" retirement, which it equates to playing golf all the time, having drinks before dinner and not much else, that this is just fine with the authors. However, it is quite obvious in my reading that this is NOT the recommended way to go.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the next chapter is all about working in retirement, of all things. It features many of the leading myths on the subject, such as \"A number of studies have found that an overwhelming number of Baby Boomers expect to keep working in retirement.\" And we meet people for which work in retirement helps them pay their bills, or gets them medical insurance and even gets them \"out of bed\" in the morning. We're given advice on how to get and/or keep a job in retirement, including the use of life coaches and employment firms. This is about \"retirement?\"\n\n\n\nWe're well into the book by now, and it is getting painfully obvious that this is not really a book about the pleasures of retirement. No, next we'll get advice on volunteering in retirement, and relocating in retirement, the latter of which finds a way to give an early plug for long-term-care insurance, which will get a ton of coverage later. Then, we get a chapter on Health and Fitness, which takes the opportunity to tell us that the marketing folks at Fidelity Investments say that we're going to need more money than we could have possibly imagined just to cover our basic medical costs in retirement. And, we're told, \"That estimate doesn't even include long-term care...\" Bummer.\n\n\n\nAnd this is the good news, folks. Now, we come to the second half, which is on the financials of retirement. And guess what? Now, we get to be scared about money! \"The big risk, of course, is that your savings will expire before you do,\" we're told. And that in recent years financial planners have begun to say that we'll need 100 percent or more of our pre-retirement income in retirement, because we should expect expenses to increase, not decrease.\n\n\n\nWe're given an example of a couple's retirement budget that leaves them with some money for discretionary expenses, only after they have paid for, you may have guessed it, their long-term-care insurance premium.\n\n\n\nBut there is hope for retirement finances to work. The book suggests that we consider not stopping work or starting to work again in retirement and/or delaying social security benefits. This is hope? I thought this book was about retirement?\n\n\n\nNext come chapters called \"Assets and Buckets\", \"Pensions, 401(k)s and IRAs\", \"Social Security and Medicare\", and, I kid you not, \"Long-term-care Strategies,\" the latter of which begins with a horror story about a lady who, because she was quickly draining her savings, had to move into \"a nursing home that took patients on Medicaid.\" Horrors of all horrors. And now we're told that \"almost seventy percent of sixty-five-year-olds are projected to need some kind of long-term care.\" Who tells us this? \"Health care researchers.\" Translation: The long-term-care industry.\n\n\n\nBut, I know, I'm hardly being fair about all of this. I mean, after the nice discount on the price you get by buying it via [...], there is surely value in this book. And there is. Lots of it. The last 14 pages of the book, for example, give us stories of 10 retirees who have found their version of \"retirement\" to be just great. Among them are the \"ones who bought ranches out West and raised enus,\" and others who \"purchased vineyards in Virginia and raised grapes,\" and others who \"start businesses or they start teaching or they start competing in triathlons.\" There, I think that just about completes the list! I can't think of anything else. Can you?\n\n\n\nBut there I go again. Probably the biggest flaw in the book, beyond not bringing us much optimism or cheerfulness about life in retirement, is that it does not acknowledge that the majority of people do not have the luxury of planning their retirement. Life gets in the way, such as the leading causes for retirement: the job dries up and/or the health of the individual or a loved one forces the person to stop working full-time. The other major flaw is that it the authors' approach simply makes retirement sound, smell and look like work. For some that make all kinds of sense. For others it makes little or no sense. We're looking for something that does NOT sound, smell or look like work. We've been there and done that! And third, the obsession with long-term-care insurance is a real turnoff. That really has to go!\n\n\n\nTo finish, I really wish that I could give this book a better review. The authors are to be commended for the wealth of information they bring us via the Encore sections of the Wall Street Journal. But for those who want some inspiration and more hopeful advice about a future in retirement, I continue to recommend \"The Joy of Not Working\" and other books by author Ernie Zelinski."}, {"url": "https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Wall-Street-Journal-Guide-to-Business-Style-and-Us/Paul-Martin/9781439122693", "page_content": "Here at last is the indispensable resource that has helped the writers and editors of The Wall Street Journal earn a reputation for the most authoritative business writing anywhere.

They then turn around and take the very same money you deposited, combine it with deposits from other folks, and lend the money to your neighbor, charging that borrower a higher rate of interest than the bank charges you. The difference between those two interest rates\u2014the so-called spread\u2014is where banks generally make their money.\n\n\n\nBusinesses deal with commercial banks; consumers deal with retail banks, though in practice many banks service both clients. In 2005 the nation\u2019s largest bank was New York\u2013based Citigroup Inc., which provides both commercial and retail banking services and which had total assets of nearly $1.5 trillion. Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc. was the largest thrift, a consumer operation, with $308 billion in assets, three times larger than its nearest competitor.\n\n\n\nRetail banks exist to provide an assortment of products that represent some of the first and most basic personal finance tools for consumers. In the past, savers could stop by just about any local bank and sign up for services that weren\u2019t terribly different from the bank down the street. Today, the savviest consumers shop around\u2014both locally and online\u2014since all banks offer different rates and fees for the various savings, lending and credit products they offer. Not every bank peddles the same line-up of products, while others, though they might feature some particular service, aren\u2019t trying to make a big business in that arena and, thus, price the service so that it\u2019s not particularly attractive to most consumers.\n\n\n\nSavings Accounts\n\n\n\nThink back on childhood: A savings account, aside from a piggy bank, was likely your first encounter with real personal finance, and it probably came with a little passbook in which the bank teller recorded your meager deposits. Mom and Dad, maybe your grandparents, opened a savings account for you and stuck a few dollars in there, probably taking the opportunity to tell you about compounding interest, which, at that age, likely generated about as much excitement as Brussels sprouts.\n\n\n\nSavings accounts are the most basic banking accounts\u2014a place to park your cash and draw interest. Minimum account balances are typically low, sometimes just $5, and the interest rate is equally low, often the lowest among all savings products. But the accounts are FDIC insured and, therefore, \u201csafe\u201d\u2014meaning the full faith and credit of the United States government protects your account against the loss of even a single penny, up to the federal limit of $100,000.\n\n\n\nSavings accounts, in their various forms, are where you want to park money if you expect to need it relatively soon\u2014like when buying a house\u2014or when you cannot afford to risk losing any of the cash.\n\n\n\nAside from the basic passbook account\u2014yes, old-fashioned as they are they still exist at some banks\u2014other types of savings accounts include certificates of deposit and money-market accounts; more on both of these in a moment. Typically, the best interest rates are found online by searching Web sites such as www.bankrate.com.\n\n\n\nMONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS\n\n\n\nThink of these as savings accounts on mild steroids. Your money is invested in what is literally known as the \u201cmoney market\u201d\u2014a vast market of ultra-short-term, highly rated debt obligations issued by various government agencies, corporations, and financial institutions that trade among large institutional investors in very large quantities. Basically, these are IOUs that come due usually within a year, and often within a few weeks or a few months. Because these pieces of paper are highly rated by various credit-rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the debt is considered safe, meaning there is a negligible risk that the bonds will not be repaid.\n\n\n\nMoney-market accounts are FDIC protected and pay slightly higher interest rates than standard savings accounts, but the rate is still relatively low. Minimum balances, however, are often relatively high\u2014$2,500 or more. And if the monthly balance slips below that, you\u2019ll typically pay a service charge\u2014usually around $10 or so\u2014for every month the account stays below the minimum.\n\n\n\nAgain, some of the best rates are found online rather than at your local bank. A good resource is www.banx.com. You\u2019ll have to register, but it\u2019s free, and you\u2019ll gain access to a broad listing of banks offering the best rates.\n\n\n\nBut a warning: While you can deposit money into these accounts as often as you like, withdrawals are usually limited to no more than three to six per month. And because many money-market accounts come with check-writing privileges, a trait not usually associated with a savings product, it\u2019s easy to just start writing checks on this account when you need the cash. Banks will cut you some slack the first time you exceed the limit, but beyond that they\u2019ll start imposing fees for each transaction over the limit. And if the breaches are persistent, a bank can unilaterally close your account, cutting you a check for whatever balance you have minus any fees the bank might impose. First, though, they\u2019ll often send a warning letter. A better approach is to withdraw the money in person or go online and transfer the cash from your money-market account to your savings; those types of withdrawals usually don\u2019t count toward the monthly maximum.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t confuse money-market accounts with money-market mutual funds. Though related, these two are very different, but more on that later in the Investing section.\n\n\n\nCERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT\n\n\n\nCDs, as certificates of deposit are commonly called, are time deposits. That is, you deposit your money with a bank and promise not to touch the cash for a certain period of time. In return for that promise, the bank gives you what are usually the best interest rates it offers on savings products. Banks do this because they know you won\u2019t demand this money for several months to several years, which gives them a chance to lend the money and earn a bit of profit on your deposit.\n\n\n\nCDs generally span uniform periods of time: three months, six months, nine months, one year, two years, and five years. In practice, there are a variety of other contract periods as well, such as 21D2 years, three years, seven years, and ten, among others. When the period ends, a CD is said to have \u201cmatured.\u201d\n\n\n\nThree-month CDs carry the lowest rates, often only marginally better than a money-market account. That\u2019s because the bank doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to make money off your deposit and must invest it only for the short term. Five-year CDs provide far better rates, usually several percentage points higher than savings accounts, because banks have a much longer period to earn money from your cash.\n\n\n\nBut don\u2019t dive into longer term CDs just to chase a high interest rate. CDs generally impose early withdrawal penalties if you reclaim your money before the contract\u2019s stated time period expires. The penalties vary, but you typically lose a meaningful amount of interest that has already accrued in your account. So carefully evaluate your near-term cash needs before opting to lock up your money for a long period. Long-term CDs can be a fine way to boost the overall return on your money, but not if you ultimately think there is a chance you might need to break the contract before the CD matures.\n\n\n\nOne caveat: In some situations, investing in a longer term CD instead of a short-term contract can be a savvy choice even if you break the CD before it matures. The long-term rate may be high enough and the penalty small enough that the overall interest you receive exceeds what you otherwise would have earned in the shorter-term certificate. Banks aren\u2019t going to advertise that, so it\u2019s up to you to do the math. [ . page 000]\n\n\n\nCHECKING ACCOUNTS\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be out of money. I still have checks.\u201d That has been a popular bumper sticker for years, and it points to the ubiquity of checking accounts, the cornerstone of personal finance whether it\u2019s your own individual checking account or a joint account with a spouse, a partner, or even a parent.\n\n\n\nChecking accounts are known as demand-deposit accounts because account holders\u2014those who own a checkbook\u2014can write a check that gives the person you paid the right to \u201cdemand\u201d money from your account upon presenting that check to your bank. In the early days of check-writing, that is exactly what folks did; they\u2019d show up at a particular bank in town with a chit signed by a customer of that bank and demand cash in return.\n\n\n\nOf course, these days the pizza parlor owner to whom you wrote a check for $19.36 for a large thin-crust with pepperoni and pineapple doesn\u2019t need to appear physically at your bank to claim the money. The owner just deposits your check at her own bank, and dozens more like it, all drawn on different banks\u2014some local, some out of town\u2014and all the money she\u2019s due ends up in her account within days. This happens because checks carry a variety of oddly rectilinear numbers along the bottom that serve as a bread crumb trail of sorts to help each check find its way home through the national banking system.\n\n\n\nThe nine digits farthest to the left are the ABA routing numbers that specify which branch of what particular banking company this check is drawn on. The sequence of numbers farthest to the right is the account number, signifying whose account at that branch is to be debited.\n\n\n\nRegular checking accounts generally pay no interest. Checking accounts known as negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, or NOW accounts, often do pay interest. But NOW accounts frequently, though not always, require higher minimum balances or charge higher fees than a regular checking account. Some of the best rates and lowest fees on checking accounts are found at credit unions; because they are owned by the members and are nonprofit, credit unions are not consumed with generating fat profits like other banks are.\n\n\n\nWhether you bank at a savings and loan, a building society, or a credit union, you\u2019ll need to balance your checkbook occasionally\u2014a chore so wretched for many people that they just estimate what they have and then hope for the best. That is an unhealthy approach to your money. You risk being overdrawn, for which the bank will impose a charge of about $25 (roughly the national average for a bounced-check fee), an unnecessary drain on your finances. Or you may risk not knowing you have more money than you realize, leaving you feeling needlessly strapped financially.\n\n\n\nA laissez-faire approach to your most basic financial account can also lead to much larger problems with spending and debt since lackadaisical record keeping reflects poor financial management habits. If you can begin to track your checkbook accurately, you\u2019ll gain a better grasp on your spending since you\u2019ll be more aware of how the debit-card purchases, ATM transactions, and checks you write are really impacting your finances. If nothing else, balance your checkbook to save money. Banks, like humans, aren\u2019t infallible; they make mistakes, too, and you want to catch those mistakes in the event they erroneously reduce your account balance.\n\n\n\nOf course, if you just can\u2019t muster the effort, invest in an inexpensive computerized money-management program such as Microsoft Money or Intuit Quicken. With minimal effort on your part, it will keep the debits and credits in your checking account in a healthy balance. [ . page 000]\n\n\n\nATM CARDS\n\n\n\nAutomated Teller Machines revolutionized banking by allowing customers to interact with their checking and savings accounts absent a bank teller. Stick your plastic magnetized card in the machine, punch in a personal identification number, or PIN, and out comes a wad of cash. As recently as the late 1990s some residents in remote parts of Alaska refused to deal with ATMs, considering them devil machines because they couldn\u2019t understand how or why it would dispense money.\n\n\n\nBanks love ATMs because they dramatically cut demand on tellers, thereby saving money. And by charging non-bank customers a fee of between $1 and $4 per transaction to use the machine, ATMs generate lots of noninterest income. That surcharge might seem a small price for convenience, but hit an ATM not affiliated with your bank once a week for a year, and you\u2019ve spent as much as $200 just to access your own money\u2014and that doesn\u2019t count the $1 or more your own bank will levy each time you venture outside your bank\u2019s own ATM network.\n\n\n\nThus, if you\u2019re a frequent ATM user, it is best to look for a bank with lots of convenient ATM locations, including those inside nearby supermarkets, where banks are increasingly locating mini-branches. Banks typically list ATM and branch locations on their Web sites. Also, check for banks that have surcharge-free ATM machines.\n\n\n\nIf you can\u2019t find an ATM for your bank, then use a competing bank because the fee is usually lower than you\u2019ll find at independently owned machines inside gas stations, hotels, casinos, and convenience stores.\n\n\n\nBy the way, the blandly named Electronic Fund Transfer Act limits your loss to $50 if your ATM card is stolen and cash is ultimately siphoned from your account. But you must report the card lost within two days of noticing its disappearance. Wait longer and your liability rises significantly.\n\n\n\nDEBIT CARDS\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t feel like searching out an ATM or don\u2019t want to pay the fee to use one outside your bank\u2019s network? That\u2019s where debit cards come in. They look identical to credit cards (and some serve that function as well), but they act more like ATM cards (and some serve that function, too). Instead of taking on debt as you would when buying the week\u2019s groceries with a credit card, you are instead, with the swipe of your card through the electronic reader, authorizing the grocer to directly withdraw funds from your bank account, usually a checking account.\n\n\n\nThis is an immediate transfer, exactly as though you pulled the money from your account at the ATM. That means you cannot float a purchase until the credit-card bill arrives. If you don\u2019t have enough money in your account, your transaction won\u2019t go through.\n\n\n\nDebit cards are increasingly popular among consumers and retailers since the cards act like electronic cash. For the consumer there is no need to carry money or checks, yet you don\u2019t accumulate interest charges as you do when paying for purchases with a credit card. That allows for better financial management because you see immediately the effect that even a single small purchase has on your checkbook balance and your monthly spending and savings goals. With a credit card the effect of all but the largest, most memorable purchases are lost in the fog of all the random spending you do each month. And because most debit cards are accepted globally\u2014generally anywhere major credit cards are taken\u2014you don\u2019t need to pack nearly as many traveler\u2019s checks or as much cash as you ordinarily would."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.com.au/Street-Journal-Guide-Personal-Finance/dp/0061986321", "page_content": "Everything you thought you knew about saving, managing risk, and securing your financial future has changed.\n\nThe world is very different in the wake of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.
