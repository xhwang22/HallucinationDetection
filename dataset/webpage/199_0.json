C. J. Davisson, who worked in the Bell Research Laboratories, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1937 together with George P. Thomson from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, who independently also found experimental indications of electron diffraction. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, \u25ba wave-particle duality leads to particles also exhibiting wave-like properties like extension in space and interference.\n\nClinton J. Davisson (1881\u20131958) and Lester H. Germer (1896\u20131971) investigated the reflection of electron beams on the surface of nickel crystals. When the beam strikes the crystal, the nickel atoms in the crystal scatter the electrons in all directions. Their detector measured the intensity of the scattered electrons with respect to the incident electron beam. Their normal polycrystalline samples exhibited a very smooth angular distribution of scattered electrons. In early 1925, one of their samples was inadvertently recrystallized in a laboratory accident that changed its structure into nearly monocrystalline form. As a result, the angular distribution manifested sharp peaks at certain angles. As Davisson and Germer soon found out, other monocrystalline samples also exhibited such anomalous patterns, which differ with chemical constitution, angle of incidence and orientation of the sample. Only in late 1926 did they understand what was going on, when Davisson attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford. There Born spoke about de Broglie's \u25ba matter-waves and Schrodinger's \u25ba wave mechanics. Their later measurements completely confirmed the quantum mechanical predictions for electron wavelength \u03bb as a function of momentum p: \u03bb = h/p. But their initial experiments (unlike G.P Thomson's) were conducted in the context of industrial materials research on filaments for vacuum tubes, not under any specific theoretical guidance.\n\nKeywords\n\nScattered Electron\n\nNickel Atom\n\nAntecedent Condition\n\nAtomic Particle\n\nInitial Kinetic Energy\n\nThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research.

Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research. He died after a fall while climbing near Gardiner, New York."}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/19534matterwavesnavalacademyvwr", "page_content": "Made in conjunction with Bell Telephone Labs by the Physical Science Study Committee, this film \"Matter Waves\" features Alan Holden and Lester Germer. The film was made in 1961 and was directed by John R. Friedman, who later joined the staff of Bell Labs and produced many films under its auspices. This particular film was produced by Educational Services Incorporated and intended for classroom use. It gives both historical and scientific insight to the wave nature of elementary, atomic-level particles. hows the wave behavior of the electron. The film starts with an examination of the Louis de Broglie hypothesis. Alan Holden shows electron diffraction patterns on a fluorescent screen, making the patterns understandable in terms of wave behavior by presenting an optical analogue showing almost identical patterns. Mr. Holden describes the electron diffraction experiments of Sir George Thomson and presents brief evidence for the wave behavior of other particles, such as neutrons and helium atoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nLester Halbert Germer (October 10, 1896 \u2013 October 3, 1971) was an American physicist. With Clinton Davisson, he proved the wave-particle duality of matter in the Davisson\u2013Germer experiment, which was important to the development of the electron microscope. These studies supported the theoretical work of De Broglie. He also studied thermionics, erosion of metals, and contact physics. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1931.

Although the Appalachian Mountain Club was dominant in the area at the time, and strictly regulated rock climbing, Lester was never associated with the club, and found himself in conflict with the leading climber in the area Hans Kraus, who was head of the Administrative Management College\"s Safety Committee. He was once turned down for climbing certification with the comment \"Likes people too much and is too enthusiastic.\" Lester was known for being generous and friendly. He was once called \"A one man climbing school.\" In 1971, one week before his 75th birthday, Lester Germer died of a massive heart attack while lead climbing a rock climb at the Shawangunk Ridge (Eyebrow, 56).
