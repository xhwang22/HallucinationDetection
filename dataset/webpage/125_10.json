{"The Indianapolis Colts won Super Bowl XLI during Bill Tobin's tenure with the team.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270204003", "page_content": "MIAMI -- Despite having set a passel of passing records, Indianapolis Colts' quarterback\n\nPeyton Manning understood that, fairly or unfairly, Super Bowl XLI probably would define his legacy. One way or another. Then two of Manning's first four passes against the\n\nChicago Bears were very nearly intercepted -- and a third actually was, by Chris Harris.\n\nBut Manning collected himself and, four hours later, he collected the Vince Lombardi Trophy. After nine seasons, Manning finally has the one thing that matters to him most: an NFL championship.\n\nTop of the Super Bowl class\n\nManning Manning MVP Peyton Manning joined the list of quarterbacks who were drafted first overall to win the Super Bowl in their first appearance. Quarterback Drafted First SB Peyton Manning, IND 1998 XLI Troy Aikman, DAL 1989 XXVII Jim Plunkett, OAK 1971 XV Terry Bradshaw, PIT 1970 IX\n\nThe Colts prevailed over the Bears 29-17 on Sunday, but Manning would be wise to send a thank-you note to Chicago quarterback Rex Grossman. Much-maligned Grossman will be savaged even more after throwing a fourth-quarter interception to defensive back Kelvin Hayden that was returned 56 yards for the game-changing touchdown.\n\nManning, who completed 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and one touchdown and threw one interception, was named the game's MVP. Afterward, he deflected at least a half-dozen attempts to elicit a comment about the perception -- after a series of playoff losses -- that he is now a winner.\n\n\"I've never played that card,\" Manning said, wincing as though he had tasted something bitter. \"I've never bought into that.\"\n\nEach time the question was repeated, Manning's answer was the same: team.\n\n\"It was a wonderful team game,\" he said. \"Everyone did their job.\"\n\nOn the first Super Bowl visited by rain, the Colts' (vaunted) offense broke even with the Bears' (equally vaunted) defense. The Indianapolis defense, however, was far superior to Chicago's offense in a sloppy, splashy eight-turnover game.\n\nColts coach Tony Dungy, who built a championship team in Tampa Bay -- only to be fired the year before the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII -- became the first black head coach to win the Super Bowl.\n\n\"I feel good I was the first one to do it,\" Dungy said.\n\nBut then, like Manning, he slipped into the Colts' mantra.\n\n\"This may not have been our best team in five years,\" Dungy said, \"but it was the closest and the most connected -- and it showed in the way we played.\n\n\"The disappointment you have along the way, it helps you appreciate it more after you finally do achieve it.\"\n\nAfter reaching the playoffs the past four seasons under Dungy, the Colts finally ran the table in a season when they were overshadowed by the San Diego Chargers and, during the regular season, even the Bears.\n\nOdds and Ends Only three Super Bowls have had 100-yard rushers on both teams. They are: Year Player, Team, Yds Player, Team, Yds 2007 Dominic Rhodes, IND, 113 Thomas Jones, CHI, 112 1991 Ottis Anderson, NYG, 135 Thurman Thomas, BUF, 102 1969 Matt Snell, NYJ, 121 Tom Matte, BAL, 116 Only three players have scored touchdowns for two different teams in the Super Bowl. They are: Player Team, Year Team, Year Muhsin Muhammad CAR, 2004 CHI, 2007 Ricky Proehl StL, 2002 CAR, 2004 Jerry Rice S.F., 1989, '90, '95 OAK, 2003 The Bears scored the fastest in Super Bowl history. Here are the quickest scores: Time Team, Opp. Year 0:14 CHI vs. IND 2007 1:24 S.F. vs. S.D. 1995 1:57 DEN vs. WAS 1988 3:32 G.B. vs. N.E. 1997 4:02 G.B. vs. DEN 1998\n\nIndianapolis rookie running back Joseph Addai easily could have been named MVP; he caught 10 passes for 66 yards and carried 19 times for 77 yards. Or he could have split it with fellow running back Dominic Rhodes, who came off the bench with 113 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. It was his first 100-yard game since 2001 and only the sixth of his career.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Colts were burned for an 80-yard kickoff return by the Patriots'\n\nEllis Hobbs. One of the leading questions heading into Super Bowl XLI was this: Would Indianapolis kick to the Bears' scintillating rookie Devin Hester? The answer came about three seconds into the game.\n\nAdam Vinatieri kicked away, and Hester settled under the ball on his own 8-yard line near the left sideline. Showing great patience, Hester ran toward the middle of the field, then faked\n\nMarlin Jackson off his feet, feigning left and cutting right. After sprinting past falling Vinatieri, Hester was in the clear -- so much that he was able to watch the last 20 yards of his achievement on the massive electronic screen above the end zone.\n\nIt was the seventh touchdown return for Hester -- in his 19th professional game. Fourteen seconds into the game, the Bears led 7-0. Arrogance or stupidity on the part of the Colts? On their next kickoff, they squibbed it down the middle. Later, when the Bears tried to sneak Hester up into the second tier of returners, the Colts recognized it and kicked deep to Rashied Davis.\n\n\"We talked about it last night,\" Dungy said. \"'There will be some storms we might have to weather.' Well, we didn't panic.\"\n\nReturn time\n\nHester Hester Eight players have now returned kickoffs for touchdowns in Super Bowl history, but the Bears' Devin Hester is the first to do it on the opening kick. Here are the KO returns for TDs in the Super Bowl: Player, Team Opp. Yds Super Bowl Fulton Walker, MIA WAS 98 XVII Stanford Jennings, CIN S.F. 93 XXIII Andre Coleman, S.D. S.F. 98 XXIX Desmond Howard, G.B. N.E. 99 XXXI Tim Dwight, ATL DEN 94 XXXIII Ron Dixon, NYG BAL 97 XXXV Jermaine Lewis, BAL NYG 84 XXXV Devin Hester, CHI IND 92 XLI\n\nManning weathered a rugged first series but got the Colts even, well, almost. Hit by\n\nTank Johnson as he released, Manning floated a puntlike pass down the middle to Reggie Wayne, which he caught because Harris inexplicably broke the wrong way. It was good (very good) for a 53-yard touchdown, but the Colts couldn't handle the snap-hold exchange and it stayed at 7-6.\n\nAfter Bears running back Thomas Jones broke one for 52 yards -- Chicago's longest run of the season -- Grossman threaded a sweet little pass across the middle to Muhsin Muhammad, just inside cornerback Nick Harper for a 4-yard touchdown. Make that 14-6. Three touchdowns had been scored inside the game's first 11 minutes.\n\nThen the Bears' offense began to deteriorate. None of Chicago's next five possessions produced points. They ended this way: fumble, punt, punt, punt, fumble. Remarkably, the Bears escaped the first half with just a two-point deficit. The Bears' attack took a hit when Cedric Benson\n\ninjured his left knee in the first quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game. Chicago had counted on pounding the Colts with the running game.\n\nThe Colts' offense gradually found an equilibrium and scored on a 29-yard Vinatieri field goal, followed by a 1-yard run by Rhodes. Chicago's defense bent dangerously as the second half opened, but again survived by allowing only a 24-yard field goal by Vinatieri to make the score 19-14.\n\nJones then picked up a first down, the Bears' first in more than 25 minutes and had a second-and-1 at the Colts' 45-yard-line and, for some reason, Chicago decided to pass. Defensive tackle\n\nAnthony McFarland, with a spin move reminiscent of Dwight Freeney, sacked Grossman for an 11-yard loss. On the very next play, Grossman fumbled, picked up the ball, stumbled and was stopped by defensive end Robert Mathis for another 11-yard loss.\n\nThe Colts, inexorably, reeled the game in. Rhodes broke a 36-yard run, but the Bears made another stand and Vinatieri kicked another field goal. Yet, at 22-14, it was still a one-possession game.\n\nIt was still a one-possession game after Robbie Gould kicked a 24-yard field goal, but then Grossman effectively ended the game by throwing that interception to Hayden. His 56-yard, sideline-skirting return gave the Colts their first insurmountable lead.\n\n\"I was just thinking about getting into the end zone,\" Hayden said. \"We stepped up the whole postseason where we just made the plays and the defense buckled down.\"\n\nManning, who had lost six of nine playoff games coming into this season, won all four of his postseason games this time through.\n\nHe now will be remembered in the category of John Elway, who won Super Bowls in his final two seasons. He has distanced himself from Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino, who owns many important career records but never earned a Super Bowl ring.\n\n\"He did what he did all season,\" Colts president Bill Polian said. \"He overcomes adversity. Whatever people throw at him, he handles it.\"\n\nAlthough Manning repeatedly declined to discuss his legacy, Dungy was more than happy to share his thoughts.\n\n\"If people thought that [Manning's career was incomplete without a Super Bowl victory], that's just wrong,\" Dungy said. \"But now, he's done it. He's a Hall of Fame quarterback, one of the best that's ever played the game.\"\n\nGame Notes\n\nColts starting cornerback Nick Harper and right\n\ntackle Ryan Diem suffered ankle injuries in the first half. Tight end Ben Utecht also left early in the third quarter with bruised\n\nhis ribs. Bryan Fletcher came in for him. A parade to honor the Colts will be held on Monday afternoon in downtown Indianapolis."}, {"url": "https://cbs4indy.com/sports/remembering-colts-2006-season-super-bowl-xli-tony-dungy/", "page_content": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, Ind. \u2013 The bunch that inspired a frigid procession through Downtown Feb. 5, 2007 after delivering the Lombardi Trophy to the Circle City returns this weekend.\n\nIn recognition of the 10th anniversary of the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 29-17 win over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI after the 2006 season, the team will honor its world champions at halftime of Sunday\u2019s game with the Tennessee Titans at Lucas Oil Stadium. More than 40 players and coaches have RSVP\u2019d they\u2019ll attend.\n\nOne who won\u2019t is Tony Dungy, whose responsibilities as NBC analyst conflict with the celebration. Dungy will be in town four nights later when he and Marvin Harrison receive their Pro Football Hall of Fame rings during the Thanksgiving night meeting with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nIn the days leading up to the reunion, some prominent figures share memories of the organization\u2019s first world championship in three decades.\n\nTONY DUNGY: The journey\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been 10 years. Ten years is an eternity. It seems like it was just yesterday.\n\nIt was really the entire experience. It was the whole year and putting it together. The year before we had such a dominant team. We started out 13-0 and we\u2019re winning games easily. We don\u2019t really have a one-score game all the way through those 13 wins. We\u2019re playing lights out.\n\nThe next year, \u201906, we\u2019re winning. We had that nine-game winning streak, but every game was stop them on the last drive or scoring on the last drive. We\u2019re just playing with fire the whole way. In \u201905, after week 5 I\u2019m probably thinking, \u2018Boy, this could be a Super Bowl year.\u2019 In \u201906, we\u2019re winning games but you never got that feeling until we got into the playoffs.\n\nIt was fun coaching because it just wasn\u2019t on autopilot. We had some young guys, Joseph Addai, Antoine Bethea. We had the leadership, so you knew they were going to come back well (from losing to the Steelers in the \u201905 playoffs). But we didn\u2019t have Edgerrin (James), so that was going to be different, starting with a different back and breaking Joseph into the lineup. We thought Corey Simon was going to play, then he didn\u2019t. He had done such a good job for us in the run defense the year before. We traded for Booger McFarland mid-season to plug that up. Antoine had come into the lineup and we knew that he was going to be good, but you\u2019ve got a good in centerfield. How\u2019s he going to play?\n\nSo we had some concerns. We had gotten Adam (Vinatieri), so you knew your kicking was going to be in good shape. If we were in any close games, you didn\u2019t have to worry about that. The biggest worry was how those two rookies were going to play at those critical positions.\n\nWe\u2019re winning, winning, winning, and then we go to Dallas in a game we should win and we get a penalty on the interception in the end zone that\u2019s probably going to ice the game. We lose that game and we come back and think we\u2019re doing OK. We lose to Tennessee. We lose to Jacksonville. The way we lost to Jacksonville was tough (giving up 375 rushing yards). We\u2019re starting to get some injuries on defense. Bob (Sanders) played only four games that year in the regular season, which was another concern. We had to fight through that and try to get our run defense settled down. We had some challenges.\n\nBy the time we got to November and December we knew we could win close games. That was probably the payoff from the first two months. We\u2019re having to come from behind. We\u2019re having to hold leads. We felt very comfortable doing that.\n\nIn the playoffs, we ran the ball extremely well and our defense came around. That\u2019s how you win. We had two games where Peyton (Manning) really wasn\u2019t on; really two-and-a-half games. Against Kansas City, we had the turnovers and we\u2019re running the ball well, but we couldn\u2019t score. Our defense just shut \u2018em down and kept them out of the end zone and gave our offense time to go. In Baltimore, it was all field goals. You never had the feeling you were out of the woods, but defensively we just kept stopping them.\n\nThe third game (against the Patriots in the AFC Championship game) was the same boat. Our offense can\u2019t get going and we had to fight our way back. Our offense, probably other than that second half of the New England game, didn\u2019t play like it played all year. It was the running game, being fundamentally sound and the defense. That was unique.\n\nIt rained all day in South Florida, and for Super Bowl XLI.\n\nI remember telling the guys, \u2018I live in Florida and it\u2019s not going to rain all day. We\u2019ll get a little shower and that\u2019ll be it.\u2019 And it was slick and muddy and wet all day. It turned into a game of field position and running the ball. We out-fought the Bears in that type of game. They get a kickoff return and one long run that basically got them 14 points. Other than that, the defense held them to one field goal. It was great to see those guys come on in the postseason and play the way we knew they could play.\n\nIt was a year where we won in a different way. That\u2019s the thing I\u2019m really proud of about the team. It adjusted. It adapted. We dealt with a lot of injuries and a lot of different things going on with the lineup. Every week there seemed to be a new hero.\n\nYes it was Peyton and Marvin (Harrison) and Dwight (Freeney) and Bob, but it was so many guys week-in and week-out that contributed. We\u2019ve talked about Antoine and Joseph, but against New England, Ben Utecht gets hurt and Bryan Fletcher goes in and has the big catch that gets us in position. We get to the Super Bowl and Ryan Diem goes down and Charlie Johnson has to go in and play against their best defensive lineman, Adewale Ogunleye. He doesn\u2019t miss a beat. Nick Harper goes as long as he can and has to leave, and Kelvin (Hayden) goes in. It was really his first, maybe second meaningful opportunity to play and he gets the game winner.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s what speaks about that team. We did it and we did it the right way. I remember Jim Irsay\u2019s first comment at the Hall of Fame (induction) when he called me (to be the Colts coach in 2002). He said, \u2018Hey, I want to win as badly as anybody. But the bigger thing is we\u2019ve got to connect with our community. We don\u2019t have that 50-year history like the Bears or the Steelers. We\u2019ve got to do that. We\u2019ve got to have the right type of guys. We\u2019ve got to win the right way.\u2019\n\nI remember standing up there (in South Florida) and thinking we did that. We completed the journey. We won, but we did it the right way. Look at the guys we had, the way we\u2019ve done it, what we\u2019re doing in the community, how they\u2019re looked at. It was really, really a proud feeling that we had accomplished just what Jim wanted to do.\n\nThe rest of the story:\n\nDungy became the first African-American head coach to win a Super Bowl and would continue to amass personal milestones. When he retired after the \u201908 season, he was the winningest coach in Colts\u2019 history: 92-33. He set an NFL record by taking a team to the playoffs in 10 straight seasons and his Colts set another league mark by winning at least 12 games in six consecutive seasons.\n\nIn August, Dungy was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2016"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs06/series?series=indchi", "page_content": "Think you know the outcome of the biggest football game of the year?

Quarterback Payton Manning was named the game's Most Valuable Player.\n\nColts coach Tony Dungy became the first African American to coach an American football team to Super Bowl championship, now in its 41st year. He also became the third person, after Mike Ditka and Tom Flores, to win a Super Bowl as both a coach and as a player: Dungy was on the 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers team that won Super Bowl XIII.\n\nColts coach Tony Dungy\n\nIndianapolis did not look like a winning team early in the game. After Chicago won the coin toss, Devin Hester returned the opening Indianapolis kickoff for a 92 yards for a touchdown, giving Chicago the fastest lead in Super Bowl history.\n\nOn the Indianapolis first drive of the game, Peyton Manning threw an interception to Bears defensive back Chris Harris. However, Chicago could not capitalize on the turnover and punted back to Indianapolis.\n\nManning seemed to get comfortable on the next possession, and burned the Bears defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Indianapolis did not convert the touchdown, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt.\n\nThis was the first of many weather-induced errors for both teams. Indianapolis's Robert Mathis forced a turnover after Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff. But on the next play, Indianapolis gave it back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled a handoff and defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.\n\nChicago scored the next touchdown when Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving his team a 14-6 lead. After forcing a punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts lineman Dwight Freeney on the Bears 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field goal attempt.\n\nFollowing a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinateiri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14-9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive. On the next Indianapolis drive, Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last, a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16-14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.\n\nAfter another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears 36-yard line before defensive back Charles Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from receiver Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumble a snap and defensive back Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With 2 seconds left, Vinateiri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left and the score remained 16-14 at halftime.\n\nVinatieri redeemed himself in the second half, kicking two field goals in the third quarter to make the score 22-14. Chicago kicker Robbie Gould made a 44-yard field goal to cut the score to 22-17, but they were the last points Chicago would score in the game. On Chicago's next drive, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhsin Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, to make the score 29-17.\n\nThe Colts managed to tame the Bears offense for the remainder of the game. Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass on the next Chicago drive. After trading possessions, Chicago got the ball back one last time with 1:42 in regulation, but it was not enough for Grossman.\n\nRhodes finished with 113 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards. Wilkins returned 4 kickoffs for 183 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Jones was the Bears top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching 4 passes for 18 yards. Tight end Desmond Clark was the Bears top receiver with 6 receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with 2 interceptions. The Colts finished with 430 total net yards while the Bears only had 265.\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/indianapolis-colts-super-bowl-wins", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have won the Super Bowl twice in four appearances.

The Colts ended up only making the playoffs in one of their first 11 seasons in Indy.\n\nHowever, they drafted Peyton Manning with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft, and he ultimately changed their fortunes.

However, Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints ultimately beat them 31-17 in the Super Bowl.\n\nThey have been close but haven\u2019t been back in recent years\n\nRelated Darius Leonard Lived a Life Full of Tragedy Before Becoming a Star on the Colts\n\nAndrew Luck began playing for the Colts during the 2012 season, and he almost took them back to the top. Luck led the Colts to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons. Then, during the 2014 season, Luck ended up leading them to the AFC Championship Game. The Colts were pretty good that year with Luck, Wayne, and T.Y.

The Colts' franchise, dating back to their days in Baltimore, has played in four Super Bowls, however, and we're going to take a look at each one of those this week leading up to this year's Super Bowl. Some games will be good ones for the Colts, while others won't be. Today we look at one of the good ones, as the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 in Super Bowl XLI.\n\nThrough his first nine seasons in the NFL, Peyton Manning had yet to reach the Super Bowl. He had quarterbacked a 13-3 team in 1999 and a 14-2 team in 2005, but both lost at home in the divisional round of the playoffs. The 2003 Colts team made the AFC Championship game but couldn't get past the Patriots, who became a big hurdle for the Colts - winning three of four Super Bowls in the early 2000s. Manning was just two years removed from a record-breaking 2004 campaign in which he threw 49 touchdown passes and won his second NFL MVP award, but the one thing that he had yet to check off of his career accomplishments list was hoisting the Lombardi Trophy. It was about more than just Peyton Manning, though the focus was on him. Could Tony Dungy finally reach and win a Super Bowl after coming close a couple of times? Could Bill Polian really build a Super Bowl winning team after the Bills team he built lost four in a row in the early 1990s? These were the questions surrounding the Colts as they entered the 2006 season.\n\nIt started just like any other season, with the Colts starting 9-0, but then things fell apart. The Colts lost four of their next six games, including an awful defensive showing in week fourteen against the Jaguars, as Jacksonville ran all over the Colts for 375 yards. The Colts were AFC South champions and were 12-4, but nobody expected them to do much in the playoffs. With the return of Bob Sanders, the Colts' defense suddenly became dominant, however. The team beat the Chiefs at home in the Wild Card round and then beat the Ravens on the road in the Divisional round - both powered by the strong defense. Fittingly, the AFC Championship game would be against the Patriots, and it would be held in Indianapolis.\n\nWe could spend a lot more time discussing that game, but it will go down as one of, if not the, greatest game in Colts history. They fell behind 21-3 only to storm back and tie it up, getting into a shootout between the best two quarterbacks in the NFL in Manning and Tom Brady. Trailing 34-31 with just a few minutes left to play, Manning led the Colts down the field and the drive was capped off by Joseph Addai's two-yard touchdown run to put the Colts up 38-34 with a minute left to play. On the next drive, Marlin Jackson intercepted Tom Brady's pass to send the Colts to the Super Bowl.\n\nIt's important to reflect on the events leading up to the game just as much on the game itself, because so much more went into the meaningfulness of the game than just the 29-17 victory over the Chicago Bears. It was about finally getting that monkey off of Peyton Manning and the Colts' backs. It was about an incredible playoff run. And it was about the Colts, for the first time in 36 years, playing in and winning a Super Bowl - the first time they did such in Indianapolis. On February 4, 2007, in Miami, Florida, the Colts were finally playing the in Super Bowl.\n\nIt was a rough start for the Colts in the game against the Bears, as Chicago's star kick returner Devin Hester took back the opening kickoff for a touchdown. Midway through the first quarter, the Colts would get their own touchdown, as Peyton Manning found a wide open Reggie Wayne for a 53-yard touchdown pass in a steady rainstorm - the first time in Super Bowl history the game was played in rain. A touchdown pass from Bears quarterback Rex Grossman gave the Bears a 14-6 first quarter lead, but from there it was all Colts.\n\nPowered by a strong running game, Indy scored the next 16 points - three field goals from kicker Adam Vinatieri and a one-yard rushing touchdown by Dominic Rhodes. Bears kicker Robbie Gould hit a field goal shortly before the end of the third quarter to draw Chicago within one score, 22-17, entering the final period.\n\nThe Colts' win was essentially sealed when, midway through the fourth quarter, second-year cornerback Kelvin Hayden picked off Rex Grossman's pass and returned it 56-yards for the touchdown, putting the Colts up 29-17 - which would end up being the final score.\n\nThe Colts carried their head coach off the field, as Dungy finally won a Super Bowl. Peyton Manning was named the game's MVP after a 25-for-38, 247 yard, one touchdown performance (with a pick), but more so because of the meaning behind it. Bill Polian, Jim Irsay, and the other Colts finally got to hoist that Lombardi Trophy as well.\n\nWhile the most prominent player from the game ended up being Peyton Manning, the Colts were powered by a strong run game and an impressive defense. The Colts held the Bears to just 265 total yards of offense, 11 first downs, and forced five turnovers (compared to the Colts' three). The running back duo of Dominic Rhodes and Joseph Addai combined to rush 42 times for 190 yards and a touchdown - with Rhodes rushing for 113 yards and a score and the rookie Addai rushing for 77 yards, adding 10 receptions for 66 yards. Altogether (combining both rushing and receiving), the two backs combined for 264 of the Colts' 430 total yards.\n\nThe game would go down as the only Super Bowl win of the Peyton Manning era, but it was certainly a memorable event - and not just the game itself, but everything leading up to it and all of the background to the story. While it would be the franchise's only Super Bowl win during the Peyton Manning era, it wasn't the only time the Colts' reached the Super Bowl with Manning at quarterback - and we'll look at that next game tomorrow.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference page for Super Bowl XLI."}, {"url": "https://fox59.com/news/colts-to-honor-super-bowl-xli-championship-team-during-nov-20-game/", "page_content": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated.

I can assure you.\u201d\n\nRobert Mathis and Adam Vinatieri are the only two players on the roster who played on the championship team."}, {"url": "https://www.accessonline.com/articles/indianapolis-colts-win-super-bowl-xli-57965", "page_content": "MIAMI (February 4, 2007) \u2014 A wet and wild Super Bowl, the winning conditions for Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nA team built for indoors found its footing on a rain-soaked track and outplayed the Chicago Bears to win the NFL title 29-17 Sunday night. The Colts were far less sloppy, particularly their star quarterback, who proved he can indeed win the big game \u2014 the biggest game.\n\nThat\u2019s what it was for Tony Dungy, too. He became the first black coach to win the championship, beating good friend and protege Lovie Smith in a game that featured two black coaches for the first time in Super Bowl history.\n\nIt was a game of firsts: the first rainy Super Bowl and the first time an opening kickoff was run back for a touchdown when sensational Bears rookie Devin Hester sped downfield for 92 yards.\n\nAnd not since the Buffalo Bills self-destructed with nine turnovers in losing to Dallas 14 years ago had there been so much messiness. The first half was marred by six turnovers, three for each team. Even football\u2019s most clutch kicker, Adam Vinatieri, missed a chip-shot field goal, and an extra point attempt was botched, too.\n\nThe second half wasn\u2019t quite so ugly, but when much-maligned Bears quarterback Rex Grossman\u2019s wobbler was picked off and returned 56 yards for a touchdown by Kelvin Hayden with 11:44 remaining, it was over.\n\nChicago (15-4), which led the league in takeaways this season, finished with five turnovers, including two interceptions by Grossman.\n\nThe Colts (16-4) will take it. It\u2019s their first title since the 1970 season, when they played in Baltimore.\n\nManning ended up 25-for-38 for 247 yards, with one touchdown and one interception.\n\nIt was confirmation of his brilliance, even if he didn\u2019t need to be dynamic. The son of a quarterback who never got to the playoffs, Manning has been a star throughout his college career at Tennessee and his nine pro seasons with the Colts.\n\nNow he is a champion.\n\nIt also was a validation of Dungy\u2019s leadership. He helped build Tampa Bay, one of the NFL\u2019s worst franchises, into a contender before being fired after the 2001 season. The next year, the Bucs won the Super Bowl under Jon Gruden.\n\nThe Colts hoisted their coach on their shoulders and he switched his blue Colts cap for a white one that read \u201cNFL champions.\u201d Dungy was carried from the sideline, then was lowered so he could share a long embrace and a handshake with Smith.\n\nThen Dungy waded through the mob to find his quarterback, giving him a big hug.\n\nThe Colts reached the pinnacle by winning four postseason games with a defense that made a complete turnaround in the playoffs.\n\nAnd with a running game that perfectly complemented Manning, thanks to Joseph Addai and Dominic Rhodes, who combined for 190 yards \u2014 113 on 21 carries by Rhodes and 77 on 10 carries by Addai, who also had 66 yards receiving.\n\nChicago was denied its first Super Bowl title since the powerhouse 1985 team. These Bears could have used Da Coach, Sweetness and their buddies.\n\nIt rained from start to finish; there was even \u201cPurple Rain\u201d during halftime when Prince sang some of his signature songs. And though Vinatieri twice was a victim of the slop, he kicked three field goals.\n\nHester\u2019s spectacular return provided a stunning beginning \u2014 and a severe jolt to the Colts. The local product and only rookie All-Pro this season pumped his arms to excite the crowd before the kickoff, then lifted the fans from their seats with an electrifying run on which he never was touched.\n\nHe barely touched the ball again as Indy went to squibbing kickoffs.\n\nLeading 16-14 at halftime, the Colts spent half the third quarter with a march to Vinatieri\u2019s 24-yard field goal. Twice on the drive, Manning fell to the ground while throwing. But he completed them.\n\nGrossman had it even worse on Chicago\u2019s initial possession of the second half, twice in a row slipping and getting sacked. Maybe he would have done better on icy turf.\n\nThomas Jones, forced to carry the Bears\u2019 entire rushing load when Cedric Benson was hurt in the first half, was Chicago\u2019s best player. But with Grossman ineffective, even inept, all the Bears managed in the second half was Robbie Gould\u2019s 44-yard field goal late in the third period."}]}
