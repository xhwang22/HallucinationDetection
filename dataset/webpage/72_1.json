{"Thutmose III is regarded as the greatest monarch of the New Kingdom of Egypt.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thutmose-III", "page_content": "Thutmose III , (died 1426 bce), king (reigned 1479\u201326 bce) of the 18th dynasty , often regarded as the greatest of the rulers of ancient Egypt . Thutmose III was a skilled warrior who brought the Egyptian empire to the zenith of its power by conquering all of Syria, crossing the Euphrates (see Tigris-Euphrates river system ) to defeat the Mitannians , and penetrating south along the Nile River to Napata in the Sudan. He also built a great number of temples and monuments to commemorate his deeds.\n\nIn the 22nd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, a formidable coalition was formed against Egypt , led by the king of Kadesh in northern Syria and no doubt supported by the Mitanni. At this moment of crisis, Hatshepsut died, and Thutmose as sole ruler began a series of annual military campaigns aimed at Nubia and the Levantine powers.\n\nAs he grew up, Thutmose may even have been entrusted with command of the army on campaign in Nubia ; he may have also fought in Gezer in Palestine . His grandfather Thutmose I had penetrated into northern Syria; Thutmose II, though far from a weakling, had not followed this success, and Hatshepsut may have been unwilling to send an army into the field. Thus, through inaction, Egyptian influence in Syria and Palestine declined. The sons and grandsons of the Syrian princes who had surrendered to Thutmose I no longer sent tribute, and the king of Mitanni , a powerful Mesopotamian kingdom with its capital beyond the Euphrates, was able to extend his control westward to the Mediterranean .\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II ; his mother was one of the king\u2019s secondary wives or a lesser harem queen, named Isis . Since there was no prince with a better claim to the throne, the boy was crowned king on the early death of his father; he was very young at the time. Hatshepsut \u2014the daughter of Thutmose I , the wife and sister of Thutmose II, and the mother of Thutmose III\u2019s half-sister Neferure\u2014acted as regent. By the seventh year of his reign this strong-minded and ambitious woman herself assumed the attributes, dress, and insignia of a king and to all intents and purposes reigned in his stead. As one of her courtiers says, \u201cshe directed the affairs of the whole land according to her wishes.\u201d Still, Thutmose was given an education befitting his royal station. He was taught all military skills, especially archery, which he demonstrated in public display, and horsemanship, in which he showed considerable prowess . He was later to boast that none among his followers could equal him in physical strength and in marksmanship.\n\nMilitary campaigns\n\nAfter a few months\u2019 preparation the king was ready to march at the head of his army. The first campaign is recorded in some detail on the walls of the temple he built at Karnak in Thebes, which describe the march to Gaza and thence to Yahmai south of the Carmel Range, the council of war, and the king\u2019s bold decision to surprise the enemy encamped at Megiddo, northeast of Carmel and about 18 miles (29 km) southeast of the modern city of Haifa. Thutmose\u2019s approach was by the route least expected\u2014a narrow defile over the mountain. It was successful: the enemy was defeated, and Megiddo was taken after a siege of eight months. In subsequent campaigns, which are less fully described in the annals, ports on the Phoenician coast were converted into Egyptian supply bases, and Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biq\u0101\u02bf (Bekaa) valley were taken.\n\nIn the 33rd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, the time was at last ripe for his most audacious move, an attack on the kingdom of Mitanni itself, which had grown stronger since the day when Thutmose I had taken its army by surprise. Thutmose planned the campaign well; pontoon boats were transported across Syria on oxcarts for the crossing of the Euphrates River. The ensuing encounter, which must have taken place on the eastern bank, is not described by the annalist; it resulted in the precipitate flight of the Mitannian king and the capture of 30 members of his harem and some hundreds of his soldiers. Triumphantly, Thutmose set up his commemorative inscription by the river\u2019s edge, next to that of his grandfather Thutmose I. It was his farthest point of advance. On the homeward journey he hunted elephant in the land of Niy, in the Orontes valley, and on his return he celebrated a great triumph at Thebes and dedicated prisoners and booty to the temple of the state god, Amon.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Native rulers, members of local ruling dynasties, were henceforward set to govern their own territories as vassals of Egypt and were bound by solemn oath to keep the peace, render annual tribute, and obey the Egyptian representative in the region, the \u201coverseer of foreign lands.\u201d Their sons were sent as hostages to Egypt and educated at court, so that in due course they might return to rule their inheritance, Egyptianized in outlook and sympathies. Fortresses were built, and Egyptian garrisons were stationed at key points along the coast and in the highlands.\n\nTo the south, Thutmose reaffirmed the southern boundary of Egyptian domination over Nubia as far as Kurgus, and at Napata, near Mount Barkal, he built a temple to Amon. He thoroughly subdued the turbulent Nubian tribes and employed many of them in the gold mines, which from his reign on became the basis of Egyptian wealth in foreign exchange with the princes of western Asia. For the last 12 years of his reign, he was content to enjoy the fruits of his victories. The tribute of Syria and Palestine and of the Sudan poured into his treasury; the annals list huge quantities of timber and metal ores, cattle, and grain delivered by the conquered. Minoan Crete and Cyprus, Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites sent gifts. The tombs of high officials of the reign are decorated with scenes depicting the reception of foreign envoys coming from places as far away as the Aegean and the Greek mainland to lay their rich and exotic gifts at the feet of the pharaoh. The prestige of Egypt had never been so great."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/thutmose-iii", "page_content": "Thutmose III (unknown-ca 1426 B.C.) wasted no time making a name for himself, once he was out from under the shadow of the over-reaching regent-turned-pharaoh Hatshepsut. He transformed Egypt from an inward-looking kingdom into a triumphant, conquering nation. And he established a reputation as a brilliant military strategist, one whom later historians would call the \u201cNapoleon of Egypt.\u201d\n\nJust a few months after coming to power, Thutmose III marched with an army of 20,000 soldiers to Megiddo, in modern-day northern Israel\u2014a site better known by its Greek name, Armageddon. A coalition of opponents had gathered there, outside the city. Scribes traveled with Thutmose III\u2019s forces and recorded the campaign\u2019s details, an invaluable chronicle now known as the Annals of Thutmose III.\n\n5:58\n\nThe pharaoh defied his advisers and surprised his foes by surging through a treacherous mountain pass to mount a deadly direct attack on Megiddo. He rode up front during that perilous advance to show that he trusted in the gods to protect him and his troops, and indeed, all made it through the pass unscathed. Then he entered battle at Megiddo \u201con a chariot of fine gold, decked in his shining armor,\u201d dazzling and intimidating his opponents, who soon gave up the fight and retreated to their last bastion of safety within the city walls. Thutmose III laid siege to Megiddo for seven months, mercilessly starving out its remaining inhabitants until they surrendered.\n\nThutmose III flexed his military might repeatedly: in Nubia, in Phoenician ports, in the valuable trade center of Kadesh, and in the kingdom of Mitanni, in modern-day Syria and Turkey. Over the course of 17 campaigns, he secured more territory than any other pharaoh. By the end, he controlled Egypt\u2019s largest ever empire.

But he also secured human capital from his captured lands. The sons of conquered rulers were taken to Egypt and educated at court. Acclimated to Egyptian ways, those offspring returned home sympathetic to Egyptian rule.\n\nUnlike one of his later successors, Ramses II\u2014who exaggerated his military achievements\u2014Thutmose III earned the triumphs recorded on the numerous monuments he built.

And by destroying\u2014albeit incompletely\u2014references to Hatshepsut and her reign, Thutmose III fashioned a direct line to his eponymous predecessors, strengthening his claim and his legacy as the rightful and most powerful ruler of Egypt.\n\nThis text is an excerpt from the National Geographic special issue The Most Influential Figures of Ancient History."}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/thutmose-iii-0018105", "page_content": "The power that marked the rise of Ancient Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom period rested solely on the shoulders of capable pharaohs. Such a vast realm could never thrive if it weren\u2019t for leaders that were bold, confident, and eager to expand their territories. One such pharaoh was Thutmose III, widely regarded as one of Ancient Egypt's greatest rulers ever. With a lengthy reign and a relentless drive towards Egyptian expansion, Thutmose ushered his realm into a new golden age. What were some defining moments in his reign?\n\nOn the Threshold of a New Golden Age with Pharaoh Thutmose III\n\nThe official regnal dates for Thutmose III are 28th April 1479 BC to 11th March 1425 BC. This means that the pharaoh ruled Egypt for roughly 54 years. That is an incredibly lengthy reign for any monarch, especially at a time when many wanted to usurp the throne. However, we must consider that Thutmose officially became a pharaoh when he was only two years old. Historians can provide such a precise number thanks to funerary inscriptions discovered within the tomb of a military commander from the time of Thutmose. This commander was Amenemheb-Mahu, and on the walls of his tomb it is recorded that Thutmose III died in his 54th regnal year.\n\nOf course, it was impossible for Thutmose III to rule so young. His father, Thutmose II, died after a relatively short reign, and was survived by his Great Royal Wife, Hatshepsut, as well as his children. Thus, the effective power was left in the hands of Hatshepsut, who declared herself to be the regent to the boy king. Soon she declared herself Pharaoh, but never attempted to oust Thutmose III or deny his right to the throne. Still, growing up, the boy had little effective power in the realm, and Egypt was ruled by Hatshepsut for roughly 21 years. During this time, the queen began numerous new building projects, and the realm prospered steadily.\n\nBecoming an able and promising young man, Thutmose III was made the foremost leader of Ancient Egypt\u2019s armies, during Hatshepsut\u2019s effective reign. This was the start of a promising military career, and the development of Thutmose\u2019s fantastic ability as a strategist and tactician. In fact, he demonstrated such great capabilities in this role, and would later prove to be an unparalleled commander. Historians today regard Thutmose III as a pure military genius, and this has earned him the nickname of \u201cthe Napoleon of Egypt\u201d.\n\nLarge Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsut. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/ CC0)\n\nA Time for Conquest and a Time for Expansion\n\nUpon the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III effectively assumed his rightful role as the Pharaoh. He was now roughly 25 years old, and already proven as a commander. Soon enough, he began a decisive expansion of Egypt\u2019s borders. He is today considered as one of the greatest conquerors in the timeline of Ancient Egypt, and was certainly an aggressive expansionist ruler.\n\nHis first successes began almost immediately after he assumed the throne: he led a campaign deep into modern-day Israel, where he won a masterful battle at Megiddo, defeating the King of Kadesh. With a daring move, he marched his armies to the rear of the Megiddo forces, crushing them decisively.\n\nSoon after this victory, Egyptian dominance was reasserted in the region called Canaan. And that was just the beginning of Thutmose\u2019s achievements. He methodically assaulted city after city, slowly beating his enemies into submission. Over the course of his lengthy reign, it is said that he captured no less than 350 cities. He conquered most of the Near East, from the River Euphrates all the way down to Nubia in the south. And we know precisely that he conducted 17 military campaigns in his reign - an impressive number.\n\nAncient Egypt quickly marched into a new Golden Age. With reasserted dominance, with expanded borders and new victories, the realm prospered in every regard. And all this thanks to the warrior Pharaoh, Thutmose III. Barely in his 30s, he was already crowned with the laurel wreath of victory, and loved by the people. Meticulously and decisively, he transformed Ancient Egypt into a true \u201cinternational\u201d superpower, reshaping it into an empire that incorporated regions of Syria, Canaan, Nubia, and others.\n\nThutmose III Sphinx sculpture, 18th Dynasty of Egypt, 1550-1295 BC. Held at the Louvre Museum. (Louvre Museum/ CC BY-SA 2.0 FR )\n\nThe Napoleon of Ancient Egypt\n\nLuckily, we know a lot about Thutmose\u2019s military achievements because of fairly detailed records that survive. Many of his triumphs were inscribed onto the walls of the Temple of Amun in Karnak, accompanied by stunning reliefs of the king subduing his enemies. Furthermore, Thutmose had a royal scribe and a loyal commander, Thanuny, who kept meticulous records of his king\u2019s campaigns. Fragments of these scripts allowed us a greater insight into methods of ancient warfare and strategy.\n\nAnother contributing factor to Thutmose\u2019s military success is a number of innovations and new technologies that placed him one step ahead of his enemies. Roughly two centuries before his time, Ancient Egypt came under the brief rule of the Hyksos, foreign invaders who brought with them new and never before seen tools and weapons. New unique swords were quickly absorbed by the Egyptians, as well as new forging techniques, as well as powerful two-wheeled war chariots. With all these innovations, the Egyptian army was well suited for conquest.\n\nSoon after winning the key battle at Megiddo, Thutmose solidified Egypt\u2019s domination in Canaan, and began a series of conquests that would lead Egypt to its greatest ever expansion. All the greatest kings of the region - of the Hittites, Babylonians, and Assyrians - gave him tribute. He then led campaigns against the powerful Phoenician ports, and the quarrelsome Mitanni to the north. Through his victories, he expanded his realm\u2019s wealth: slaves were acquired, sheep and horses, thousands of cattle, powerful stallions, money and riches, many tons of grain, quality wood from Lebanon, and noble hostages that made obedience guaranteed.\n\nRelief in the Karnak Temple showing Thutmose III slaying Canaanite captives from the Battle of Megiddo, 15th Century BC . (Olaf Tausch/ CC BY 3.0 )\n\nA Golden King in a Golden Era\n\nOver the course of 17 campaigns, most - if not all - of his enemies were subdued, the foremost being the Mitanni. But it was not all about warfare: Thutmose III was also inclined to spur other developments within Egypt as well. New construction projects were begun, and new technologies mastered. Glass-making was refined, and a number of new lavish buildings were raised in Karnak. Several monumental obelisks from this time also survive.\n\nThutmose III died in his 56th year (54th regnal year). His remains were entombed in a unique and lavish tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and his mummy survives to this day. Succeeding him was his younger son, Amenhotep II. The latter\u2019s reign was successful, but not nearly as good as his father\u2019s. Likewise, Amenhotep conducted only a few campaigns to maintain his domination.\n\nTogether with Rameses the Great , Thutmose is widely regarded as Ancient Egypt\u2019s finest pharaoh. And considering that the history of this civilization spans several thousands of years, that achievement can be considered monumental.\n\nTop image: The statue of Pharaoh Thutmose III at the Karnak Temple Complex in Luxor, Egypt.

The Temple of Amon at Karnak in particular was enlarged and enriched by many new buildings and a number of obelisks. Two of the splendid granite obelisks that he erected there are now in Istanbul and Rome; of the two, now known as Cleopatra\u2019s Needles, with which he adorned the temple of the sun god at Heliopolis, one is in New York City\u2019s Central Park and the other on the Thames embankment in London. During Thutmose III\u2019s reign, art and craftsmanship received new impetus from his patronage. The exotic birds, beasts, and plants that he brought back from his campaigns in Asia are depicted on the walls of his Festival Hall at Karnak; among the gifts sent him from abroad were a live bear, an elephant, a giraffe, and \u201cbirds that give birth every day\u201d\u2014probably domestic hens, which were rare in the Middle East at that time.\n\nThe last decade of his reign is marked by the building of a new temple at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b, next to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple. At the same time, a systematic program was instituted by Thutmose III to erase the record of her kingship and to ascribe her monuments to her immediate predecessors, Thutmose I and Thutmose II. The motive for Hatshepsut\u2019s proscription at such a late date is not fully understood, but most of her cartouches and images vanished from public view.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Thutmose appointed his son Amenhotep II, the son of his second wife, Meryetre, as coregent. When he died, in 1426 bce, he was laid to rest in a remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. The mummy of the pharaoh was one of those discovered in 1889, in a hiding place where the priest-kings of the 21st dynasty (1075\u2013c. 950 bce) had put them for safety. Of the rich furniture that must originally have been placed in the tomb, only a few fragments were found. A memorial temple, which he built on a terrace at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b beside that of Hatshepsut, was discovered in 1962.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the western Theban mountain, the burial place of three members of his harem was found; judging by their names, they were Asiatic princesses, and though of minor rank their jewelry and equipment were extremely lavish.\n\nOf all the kings of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III is perhaps the one who, for the modern historian, most nearly comes to life. His records, though couched in the boastful and extravagant terms thought befitting a pharaoh\u2019s exploits, leave little doubt not only of his ability as a soldier and a statesman but also of his abilities as an athlete and a hunter of lion, wild cattle, and elephant. From his mummy it is known that he was a small man, not above five feet three inches (1.6 metres) in height. His statues show a youthful, smooth face with a large, high-bridged nose and pleasantly smiling mouth.\n\nHis fame lived after him. His name inscribed on countless amulets was thought to bring power and protection to the wearers. A popular hymn celebrating his triumphs became a model for later paeans of victory.

He was the son of Thutmose II by a minor wife named Iset. When Thutmose II died, his chief wife and half-sister, Hatshepsut, became Thutmose III\u2019s regent. However, she did not step down when Thutmose III came of age. Instead, she made him a joint pharaoh with her and continued to rule the country herself.\n\nDuring this time, Thutmose III was made head of Egypt\u2019s armies. In the twenty-third year of his reign (his second year as the sole pharaoh), he led a successful military expedition into Syria and Palestine. He went on to defeat the King of Mitanni in battle and pushed Egypt\u2019s southern border to the fourth cataract of the Nile.\n\nAt home, Thutmose III built many temples, including the Festival Hall and Seventh Pylon at Karnak and his own mortuary temple at Deir-el-Bahri. Though he is often blamed for the destruction of his stepmother Hatshepsut\u2019s images, others have argued that Thutmose III\u2019s son, Amenhotep III, may have destroyed them during his reign in order to delegitimize any claim to the throne by Hatshepsut\u2019s children (who, as the offspring of a pharaoh, had as much right to the throne as he did).\n\nIn addition to serving as pharaoh, Thutmose III directed the mystery school at Karnak and organized the mystery schools together as a single Order.\n\nImage: Thutmose III statue at Rosicrucian Park\n\nArmstrong, Steven. \u201cHidden Harmonies: Discovering the Egyptian Foundations of the Rosicrucian Path.\u201d Rosicrucian Digest, Volume 85, No. 1. 2007.\n\nDavid, Anthony and Rosalie.

He was the son of Thutmose II and one of his concubines named Isis. Thutmose II was married to Hatshepsut who was his sister and daughter of Thutmose I. She grew up and was educated as a prince which molded her into an ambitious and strong-minded adult. Because of Thutmose II\u2019s poor heath and lack of leadership skills, Hatshepsut assumed much of the power during his reign. Hatshepsut considered Thutmose III to be a bastard son and believed him to be unworthy of being Pharaoh because he had no royal blood in him. Since Thutmose II and Hatshepsut hadn\u2019t had any sons, Thutmose III would be the heir to the throne, so in 1504 B.C. when Thutmose II dies, the young Thutmose III is crowned. At this time Thutmose III was only around twelve years old, and Hatshepsut believed it would be better if she retained the power of the Pharaoh. [Source: Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\nJoyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: \u201cDenied a prominent role in state affairs, Thutmose spent his childhood and adolescence preparing for the future. He was educated as a scribe and priest, developing a life-long love of literature and history, and then entered the army. By the time of Hatshepsut's death, he had risen to the rank of Commander in Chief and had enjoyed a short, victorious campaign in the Levant.\u201d [Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011]\n\n\u201cAs a child, Thutmose III spent most of his time in Thebes. This is where he was educated on how to rule Egypt once he took over. During this time the Amon clergy were in charge of educating all the young to be pharaohs, and this was done at the palace of Karnak. Here he learned about everything from culture and art to military and leadership techniques. Thutmose III soon began to excel as an administrator and statesman, as well as a general and warrior. He gained military skills such as archery and horsemanship, which he displayed to the public on many occasions, and boasted that none of his followers could equal him in marksmanship or physical prowess.\u201d +\\\n\nWhy Did Hatsheput Usurp the Throne from Thutmose III?\n\nWhy did Hatsheput usurp the throne from Thutmose III? Joyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: What could have caused her to take such unprecedented action? Legally, there was no prohibition on a woman ruling Egypt. Although the ideal pharaoh was male-a handsome, athletic, brave, pious and wise male-it was recognised that occasionally a woman might need to act to preserve the dynastic line. When Sobeknofru ruled as king at the end of the troubled 12th Dynasty she was applauded as a national heroine. Mothers who deputised for their infant sons, and queens who substituted for husbands absent on the battlefield, were totally acceptable.

We must therefore deduce that something happened in year three to upset the status quo and to encourage her to take power. Unfortunately, Hatshepsut never apologises and never explains. Instead she provides endless justification of her changed status, claiming on her temple walls (falsely) that both her earthly father Thutmose and her heavenly father, the great god Amen, intended her to rule Egypt. She goes to a great deal of trouble to appear as a typical pharaoh, even changing her official appearance so that her formal images now show her with the stereotyped king's male body, down to the false beard. Hatshepsut has realised that others will eventually question her actions, and is carving her defence in stone. |::|\n\n\u201cWhat are we to make of Hatshepsut's actions? It is too simplistic to condemn her as a ruthless power-seeker. She could not have succeeded without the backing of Egypt's elite, the men who effectively ruled Egypt on behalf of the king, so they at least must have recognised some merit in her case. Her treatment of Thutmose is instructive. While the boy-king lived he was a permanent threat to her reign yet, while an 'accidental' death would have been easy to arrange, she took no steps to remove him. Indeed, seemingly oblivious to the dangers of a coup, she had him trained as a soldier. |::|\n\n\u201cIt seems that Hatshepsut did not fear Thutmose winning the trust of the army and seizing power. Presumably, she felt that he had no reason to hate her. Indeed, seen from her own point of view, her actions were entirely acceptable. She had not deposed her stepson, merely created an old fashioned co-regency, possibly in response to some national emergency. The co-regency, or joint reign, had been a feature of Middle Kingdom royal life, when an older king would associate himself with the more junior partner who would share the state rituals and learn his trade. As her intended successor, Thutmose had only to wait for his throne; no one could have foreseen that she would reign for over two decades.\u201d|::|\n\nThutmose III as Leader of Egypt\n\nAround 1480 B.C., after the sudden death of Harshepsut, Thutmose III became the leader of Egypt. Soon after he became pharaoh, he began defacing of Hatshepsut\u2019s monuments and replaced her name with Thutmose I, II, or III, in an effort to erase his stepmother\u2019s name from history. Ironically, Thutmose III inherited an economically strong Egypt from Hatshepsut, that provided the foundation for his accomplishments and the greatness of the New Kingdom achieved. With his military training and a strong, stable Egypt to stand on, Thutmose III conquered foreign lands and brought such great wealth to Egypt that he, arguably, made making it the world\u2019s first super power.\n\nMark Millmore wrote in discoveringegypt.com: His impact upon Egyptian culture was profound. He was a national hero, revered long after his time. Indeed, his name was held in awe even to the last days of ancient Egyptian history. His military achievements brought fabulous wealth and his family resided over a golden age that was never surpassed.

At the center of the system was the god Amun of Thebes and the powerful priests at his temple. \u201cHe was also a cultured man who demonstrated a curiosity about the lands he conquered; many of his building works at Karnak are covered with carvings of the plants and flowers he saw on his campaigns. He also set up a number of obelisks in Egypt.\u201d Among them are ones that now stand in London, New York, Rome and Istanbul. ^^^\n\nJoyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: \u201cThutmose took his throne in unsettled times. His eastern vassals, for so long quiet, were starting to challenge Egypt's dominance. A series of glorious campaigns, including the dramatic capture of Megiddo (Biblical Armageddon), saw Egypt restored to her position of power. Egypt now controlled an empire which stretched from beyond the third cataract in Nubian to the banks of the River Euphrates in Syria. The rewards of empire-plunder, tribute, taxes and gifts from those eager to be friends-made Thutmose the richest man in the world. [Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011 |::|]\n\n\u201cUsing his hard-won wealth, Thutmose attempted to out-build Hatshepsut. Once again the Nile Valley echoed to the sound of hammer and chisel. But now there was destruction alongside the construction. The royal masons had been charged with the task of removing all traces of the female pharaoh. By the time of his death, some thirty-three years after his solo accession, Thutmose was confident that Hatshepsut's unorthodox reign would soon be forgotten. |::|\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Military Campaigns\n\nIn his 19-year rule Thutmose III led military campaigns at a rate of almost one a year, including a victory over the Canaanites at Megiddo in present-day Israel. There are lengthy descriptions of his battles on the rock walls of Karnak. They include tales of soldiers hiding in baskets delivered to enemy cities and boats hauled 250 miles overland for a surprise attack. In the reliefs Thutmose himself is depicted as a sphinx trampling Nubians and a warrior smiting an Asiatic lion.\n\nOne of Thutmose\u2019s greatest military victory occurred in Joppa (present-day Jaffa, Israel) in 1450 B.C. According to a rare papyrus text, the Egyptians secured victory after employing Trojan-horse-like deception. After the city failed to fall during a siege, the commanding general Djehuty sent baskets to the city that were said to contain plundered goods. At night Egyptian soldiers emerged from the baskets and opened the city gates.\n\nThutmose III drive towards the Euphrates claimed new lands for Egypt and brought in tributes. Wall paintings from the period show Babylonians, Syrians, Nubians and Canaanites offering presents to the pharaoh and bowing in subservient positions. The military campaign is also blamed for triggering a series of conflicts that would ultimately would deal the Egyptians a costly defeat at the hands of the Assyrians.\n\nAccording to Minnesota State University, Mankato: \u201cTuthmosis II\u2019s and Hatshepsut\u2019s reigns were peaceful and saw very little warfare. But when Tuthmosis III took over power things were already starting to change. Unrest started to occur in many areas of Africa, Syria, and elsewhere. The first of seventeen successful campaigns happened only a few months into his reign, at the city of Megiddo. This attack from the rear gave the Egyptians an upper hand and played a big part in their victory. The battle lasted more than seven months and when it was over Tuthmosis III let the enemy leaders go so that they could tell everyone who the new leader of Egypt was. This victory not only gained Tuthmosis III the respect of the people of Egypt but also the respect of leaders and kings of other nations as the rightful pharaoh and a very skilled and intelligent general. Through the rest of his reign, Tuthmosis III engaged in sixteen more campaigns and won every one of them. Because of his undefeated record, Tuthmosis III is often referred to as \u201cThe Napoleon of Egypt\u201d. Some of his biggest victories came against the Mitannian empire. He captured and gained control of many Mitannian territories, which expanded his power over northern Palestine and Phoenicia. He erected a stele at he Euphrates River to mark the boundary of the Egyptian Empire.

This kept him away from court politics but nevertheless prepared him well for his own role as pharaoh because great ability in war was considered a desirable quality in the ancient world. Egyptian pharaohs were expected to lead their armies into foreign lands and demonstrate their bravery on the field in person. After a few victorious battles, a king might return home in triumph, loaded with plunder and a promise of annual tribute from the defeated cities. But during Hatshepsut\u2019s reign, there were no wars and Egypt\u2019s soldiers had little practice in warfare. The result was that Egypt\u2019s neighbors were gradually becoming independent and when this new, unknown pharaoh came to the throne; these other kings were inclined to test his resolve.\u201d [Source: Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com ^^^]\n\n\u201cThutmose III is often compared to Napoleon, but unlike Napoleon he never lost a battle. He conducted sixteen campaigns in Palestine, Syria and Nubia and his treatment of the conquered was always humane. He established a sort of \u201cPax Egyptica\u201d over his empire. Syria and Palestine were obliged to keep the peace and the region as a whole experienced an unprecedented degree of prosperity.\u201d ^^^\n\nTuthmosis III and the Battle of Mediggo\n\nTuthmosis III\u2019s first great military victory was at the Battle of Mediggo. According to Minnesota State University, Mankato: \u201cThis campaign, which is recorded in great detail on the walls of the temple he built in Karnak, revealed Tuthmosis III as a military genius. Tuthmosis III used the element of surprise attack when he invaded Mediggo, using the least expecting route. This route was narrow, hilly, and difficult to pass, and it took over twelve hours to reach the valley on the other side. Tuthmosis III lead his men through the hills and when he made it to the valley he waited until the last man made it through safely.

What\u2019s more, the Mesopotamians and their kinsmen living in Syria refused to pay tribute and declared themselves free of Egypt. Undaunted, Thutmose immediately set out with his army. He crossed the Sinai desert and marched to the city of Gaza which had remained loyal to Egypt. The events of the campaign are well documented because Thutmose\u2019s private secretary, Tjaneni, kept a record which was later copied and engraved onto the walls of the temple of Karnak. [Source: Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com ^^^]\n\n\u201cThis first campaign revealed Thutmose to be the military genius of his time. He understood the value of logistics and lines of supply, the necessity of rapid movement, and the sudden surprise attack. He led by example and was probably the first person in history to take full advantage of sea power to support his campaigns. Megiddo was Thutmose\u2019s first objective because it was a key point strategically. It had to be taken at all costs. When he reached Aruna, Thutmose held a council with all his generals. There were three routes to Megiddo: two long, easy, and level roads around the hills, which the enemy expected Thutmose to take, and a narrow, difficult route that cut through the hills. ^^^\n\n\u201cHis generals advised him to go the easy way, saying of the alternative, \u201cHorse must follow behind horse and man behind man also, and our vanguard will be engaged while our rearguard is at Aruna without fighting.\u201d But Thutmose\u2019s reply to this was, \u201cAs I live, as I am the beloved of Ra and praised by my father Amun, I will go on the narrow road. Let those who will, go on the roads you have mentioned; and let anyone who will, follow my Majesty.\u201d When the soldiers heard this bold speech they shouted in one voice, \u201cWe follow thy Majesty whithersoever thy Majesty goes.\u201d ^^^\n\n\u201cThutmose led his men on foot through the hills \u201chorse behind Horse and man behind man, his Majesty showing the way by his own footsteps.\u201d It took about twelve hours for the vanguard to reach the valley on the other side, and another seven hours before the last troops emerged. Thutmose, himself, waited at the head of the pass till the last man was safely through. The sudden and unexpected appearance of Egyptians at their rear forced the allies to make a hasty redeployment of their troops. There were over three hundred allied kings, each with his own army; an immense force. However, Thutmose was determined and when the allies saw him at the head of his men leading them forward, they lost heart for the fight and fled for the city of Megiddo, \u201cas if terrified by spirits: they left their horse and chariots of silver and gold.\u201d ^^^\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian army, being young and inexperienced, simply lacked the control to take the city immediately. Thutmose was angry. He said to them, \u201cIf only the troops of his Majesty had not given their hearts to spoiling the things of the enemy, they would have taken Megiddo at that moment. For the ruler of every northern country is in Megiddo and its capture is as the capture of a thousand cities.\u201d ^^^\n\n\u201cMegiddo was besieged. A moat was dug around the city walls and a strong wooden palisade erected. The king gave orders to let nobody through except those who signaled at the gate that they wished to give themselves up. Eventually the vanquished kings sent out their sons and daughters to negotiate peace. According to Thutmose, \u201cAll those things with which they had come to fight against my Majesty, now they brought them as tribute to my Majesty, while they themselves stood upon their walls giving praise to my Majesty, and begging that the Breath of Life be given to their nostrils.\u201d They received good terms for surrender. An oath of allegiance was imposed upon them: \u201cWe will not again do evil against Menkheper Ra, our good Lord, in our lifetime, for we have seen his might, and he has deigned to give us breath.\u201d ^^^\n\nArmant Stela: Asiatic Campaigns of Thutmose III\n\nThe Armant Stela from the 15th century B.C. describes the Asiatic Campaigns of Thutmose III: It reads: \u201cLive the Horus: Mighty Bull, Appearing in Thebes; the Two Goddesses: Enduring of Kingship, like Re in Heaven; the Horus of Gold: Majestic of Appearances, Mighty of Strength; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Lord of Making Offerings: Men-kheper-Re; the Son of Re, of his Body: Thut-mose Heqa-Maat, beloved of Montu, Lord of Thebes, Residing in Hermonthis, living forever.

But Thutmose\u2019s mummy is well preserved and allows comparison between the actual face of the king and his sculpted portraits. [Source: Dimitri, Laboury, University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology 2010, escholarship.org ]\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, despite a rather important evolution through different chronological types, the iconography of Thutmose III is characterized by a few absolutely constant physiognomic features, i.e., an S- shaped chin when seen in profile, a significant squared maxillary, and low, protruding cheekbones that create a horizontal depression under the eyes. These are the same features that distinguish his mummy\u2019s face, denoting an undeniable inspiration from the actual appearance of the king. However, on the other hand, other physiognomic details varied a lot, sometimes being in obvious contradiction to the mummy: for instance, at the end of his reign, during the proscription of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III decided to straighten his nose\u2014ostensibly hooked on his mummy\u2014in order to look like his father and grandfather, his true and then unique legitimating ancestors. This variability and the revival of his predecessors\u2019 iconography show that the evolution of the king\u2019s statuary cannot be explained solely by aesthetic orientations toward portrait or ideal image, or toward realism or idealization. There is a clear and conscious departure from the model\u2019s outer appearance that allows the introduction of meaning and physiognomically signifies the ideological identity of the depicted person. The same is true for private portraiture.\n\n\u201cJust like his aunt Hatshepsut, Thutmose III instigated modifications and thus evolution in his portraits because his identity, his political self-definition as the legitimate king of Egypt, changed throughout his reign. Obviously, in the eyes of the ancient Egyptians, portraiture was more than a simple artistic transposition of the physical appearances; it was a pictorial definition of an individual and recognizable identity, beyond appearances and even despite them, if needed.\n\n\u201cAmarna royal portraits at Thutmose\u2019s workshop.

The greatest addition was a huge temple, the Akhmenu Festival Hall, placed behind Karnak\u2019s east wall, built after the king\u2019s 23rd year. The structure consisted of a large pillared hall leading to a set of three shrines, a series of rooms dedicated to the god Sokar, a hall decorated with relief scenes of flora and fauna observed during the king\u2019s foreign military campaigns, a chamber with niched walls that served as the main shrine of the divine image, and an upper sun-court. The exact cultic nature of the temple remains elusive, but it may have held ceremonies for the regeneration of the king on earth. [Source: Elaine Sullivan, UCLA, UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology 2010, escholarship.org ]\n\n\u201cA new stone enclosure wall was constructed, enclosing the Akhmenu in the greater temple complex. The obelisks of Hatshepsut were incorporated into a small contra-temple along the enclosure\u2019s eastern wall. Contra-temples, usually appended to the rear wall of a temple and opening outward, provided a location for those not allowed within the temple proper (such as the public) to interact with the divinities. Often statues of the king were located at these shrines, and people would petition the images to act as intermediaries with the gods on their behalf. At the center of Karnak\u2019s contra-temple stood a large calcite naos with a dyad of Thutmose III and the god Amun-Ra (although it originally may have depicted Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, with the queen\u2019s figure later recarved).\n\n\u201cThutmose III also added a stone pylon (the seventh) and connecting walls between the queen\u2019s pylon and the temple wall along the southern processional route. In front of the pylon, he raised red granite obelisks. Along the east wall of the eighth pylon\u2019s forecourt, he placed a calcite bark-shrine surrounded by peripteral pillars. This may have replaced the earlier calcite shrine of Amenhotep I at the same location, as Thutmose III gave his shrine an identical name.\n\n\u201cA huge sacred lake was cut into the space southeast of the temple. This may have been an expansion of a pre-existing lake at the same location. To the east of the lake a large mud- brick enclosure wall with exterior bastions was constructed, traditionally assigned to Thutmose III (although it may actually be older). The wall was enlarged and renovated in at least three phases, the last of which may date to as late as the 25th Dynasty...To the north of the main precinct, the king erected a small sandstone temple to the god Ptah (possibly replacing an earlier one of mud-brick). A hall with two columns fronted the temple\u2019s triple sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWithin the central core of Karnak, Thutmose III ordered significant remodeling. Behind the fifth pylon, he had a smaller pylon erected, the sixth, creating a small pillared court in front of the Palace of Maat. He replaced the limestone chapels of Amenhotep I along the sides of this court with sandstone replicas whose decoration commemorated the earlier king. Walls were appended to the east faces of the fifth and sixth pylons and a granite gate was erected between the pylons, creating a corridor along the temple\u2019s central axis to the Palace of Maat. Although he appears to have continued the decoration of Hatshepsut\u2019s unfinished Red Chapel, the king eventually removed and dismantled the chapel, with the front and rear doors reused in an interior wall of the palace\u2019s northern suite of rooms and the new corridor behind the sixth pylon. Some of the palace\u2019s interior walls were removed, either by the king, or earlier, by Hatshepsut, to allow the emplacement of the central bark-shrine. The Red Chapel was replaced with a new granite shrine, of similar size and shape, and a new entrance portico was designed for the Palace of Maat.\n\n\u201cPossibly due to damage incurred in the wadjet hall from heavy rainstorms, Thutmose III began a total reworking of the space. A stone gateway was erected around the obelisks of Hatshepsut, completely encapsulating their lower portions. He ordered the removal of the wooden wadj- columns, intending to replace them with six sandstone columns in the north half of the hall and eight in the south. The interior walls of the court were covered with a skin of stone, obscuring the original statue recesses of Thutmose I. Before his death, it appears that the king only had time to roof the northern part of the hall with sandstone slabs, supported by his network of pillars, gateway, and court walls. Amenhotep II finished the work, raising the eight southern columns and their roof. Thutmose III raised his own pair of granite obelisks between those of Thutmose I and II in the festival court before the fourth pylon. The bases of these obelisks have been discovered bordering the east side of the third pylon.\u201d\n\nRekhmire\n\nGreg Dawson of Minnesota State University, Mankato wrote: \u201cRekhmire the Vizier, under Thutmose III and Amenhotep II, was the son of a priest of Amon, Nefer Weben, and nephew of the Vizier Woser. He became the most powerful commoner in the country during Thutmose reign. His Theban tomb contains some information about his life and shows him and his wife, Meryt, festively enjoying the afterlife. He oversaw the building of the great entrance portal at the temple in Thebes watching to make sure that the blocks used were of the right quality. Also, under his supervision was the creation of giant statues, sphinxes, furniture and implements, and vessels and precious objects. [Source: Greg Dawson, Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\n\u201cRekhmire was responsible for operation of foreign embassies, operation of law courts, collection of taxes, activities of the craftsmen of the Temple of Amun at Thebes and finally funerary banquet and musical accompaniment. Above all, it was his job to collect all tribute which came to the kingdom from the outside or surrounding areas such as tribute from the King\u2019s of Babylon, Assyria and the Hittites.The tomb also holds decrees given by the king concerning Rekhmire's role as Vizier, these decrees make the tomb of this high ranking commoner give people today a reference concerning the political, legal and social aspects of the New Kingdom of Egypt and also the empire.\u201d +\\\n\nDid Thutmose III Order the Attacks on Hatsheput\u2019s Monuments\n\nJoyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: \u201cSoon after her death in 1457 B.C., Hatshepsut's monuments were attacked, her statues dragged down and smashed and her image and titles defaced. The female king vanished from Egyptian history. She would remain lost until, almost three thousand years later, modern Egyptologists reconstructed her damaged inscriptions and restored her to her rightful dynastic place. |[Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011]\n\n\u201cThe Egyptians believed that the spirit could live beyond the grave, but only if some remembrance-a body, a statue, or even a name-of the deceased remained in the land of the living. Hatshepsut had effectively been cursed with endless death. Who could have done such a terrible thing, and why? Thutmose III, stepson and successor to Hatshepsut, seems the obvious culprit, but we should not condemn him unheard. There are two major crimes to be considered before we draw any conclusion. |::|\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that someone attacked Hatshepsut's monuments after her death. Archaeology indicates that the bulk of the vandalism occurred during Thutmose' reign. Why would he do this? At first it was imagined that this was the new king's immediate revenge against his stepmother; he was indeed cursing her with permanent death. The image of the young Thutmose seething with impotent rage as Hatshepsut ruled in his place is one which has attracted amateur psychologists for many years. However, it does not entirely fit with the known facts. |::|\n\n\u201cThutmose was to prove himself a calm and prudent general, a brave man not given to hasty or irrational actions. He did not start his solo reign with an assault on Hatshepsut's memory; indeed, he allowed her a traditional funeral, and waited until it was convenient to fit the desecration into his schedule. Some of the destruction was even carried out by his son, after his death, when most of those who remembered Hatshepsut had also died. It is a remote, rather than an immediate, attack. Furthermore the attack is not a thorough one. Enough remained of Hatshepsut to allow us to recreate her reign in some detail. Her tomb, the most obvious place to start the attack, still housed her name. Hatshepsut may have been erased from Egypt's official record, but she was never hated as Akhenaten 'The Great Criminal' would later be. |::|\n\n\u201cWhat can we conclude from this tangled tale? We should perhaps rethink our assumptions. Hatshepsut did not fear Thutmose; instead of killing him, she raised him as her successor. Thutmose may not have hated Hatshepsut. Initially he may even have been grateful to her, as she had protected his land while training him for greatness. But, as he grew older and looked back over his life, his perspective would shift. Would Egypt's most successful general, a stickler for tradition, have wished to be associated with a woman co-regent, even a woman as strong as Hatshepsut? |::|\n\n\u201cBy removing all obvious references to his co-ruler Thutmose could incorporate her reign into his own. He would then become Egypt's greatest pharaoh; the only successor to Thutmose II. Hatshepsut would become the unfortunate victim, not of a personal attack, but of an impersonal attempt at retrospective political correctness. |Thutmose set his masons to re-write history. Their labours would last well into the reign of his successor, Amenhotep II, a king who could not remember Hatshepsut, and who had no reason to respect her memory. Meanwhile, hidden in the Valley of the Kings, Hatshepsut still rested in her coffin. Thutmose I had been taken from their joint tomb and re-buried, but she had been left alone. Thutmose knew that as long as her body survived, Hatshepsut was ensured eternal life.\u201d |::|\n\nImage Sources: Wikimedia Commons\n\nText Sources: UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, escholarship.org ; Internet Ancient History Sourcebook: Egypt sourcebooks.fordham.edu ; Tour Egypt, Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com; Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com; Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Geographic, Smithsonian magazine, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Discover magazine, Times of London, Natural History magazine, Archaeology magazine, The New Yorker, BBC, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Time, Newsweek, Wikipedia, Reuters, Associated Press, The Guardian, AFP, Lonely Planet Guides, \u201cWorld Religions\u201d edited by Geoffrey Parrinder (Facts on File Publications, New York); \u201cHistory of Warfare\u201d by John Keegan (Vintage Books); \u201cHistory of Art\u201d by H.W.

Thutmose III officially became king as a child but his step-mother and co-regent, Hatshepsut soon took over as King. It is not known precisely what Thutmose was doing in the years his step-mother was running the kingdom. His later years suggest he spent most of the time with the army because he is considered one of the greatest warrior kings.\n\nHatshepsut hadn't been able to sustain Egypt's military control during her reign. As a result, Syria and Lebanon stopped paying tribute and even provincial princes of Egypt began to follow the dictates of Mitanna - a powerful kingdom in it's own right. After her death, Thutmose set about changing the temples and monuments she had had built for herself. By the second year he began a series of military campaigns to re-assert Egypt's control and to expand it's borders.\n\nAccording to the stele of Thutmose III, over 350 cities fell to the Egyptians under his rule. There is little doubt that his numerous campaigns were extremely successful. He has in fact been referred to as the \"Napolean of ancient Egypt\" because of his military expansion."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/544476", "page_content": "Resources for Research\n\nThe Met's Libraries and Research Centers provide unparalleled resources for research and welcome an international community of students and scholars.\n\nThe Met Collection API is where all makers, creators, researchers, and dreamers can connect to the most up-to-date data and public domain images for The Met collection.

The vizier was the chief administrator and the highest judge of the realm. By the mid-15th century bce the office had been divided into two, one vizier for Upper and one for Lower Egypt . During the 18th dynasty some young bureaucrats were educated in temple schools, reinforcing the integration of civil and priestly sectors. Early in the dynasty many administrative posts were inherited, but royal appointment of capable officials, often selected from military officers who had served the king on his campaigns, later became the rule. The trend was thus away from bureaucratic families and the inheritance of office.\n\nAhmose\u2019s officers and soldiers were rewarded with spoil and captives, who became personal slaves . This marked the creation of an influential military class. Like Kamose, Ahmose campaigned as far south as Buhen. For the administration of the regained territory, he created a new office, overseer of southern foreign lands, which ranked second only to the vizier. Its incumbent was accorded the honorific title of king\u2019s son, indicating that he was directly responsible to the king as deputy.\n\nAhmose\u2019s campaigns to expel the Hyksos from the Nile River delta and regain former Egyptian territory to the south probably started around his 10th regnal year. Destroying the Hyksos stronghold at Avaris , in the eastern delta, he finally drove them beyond the eastern frontier and then besieged Sharu\u1e25en (Tell el-F\u0101r\u02bfah) in southern Palestine; the full extent of his conquests may have been much greater. His penetration of the Middle East came at a time when there was no major established power in the region. This political gap facilitated the creation of an Egyptian \u201cempire.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ahmose (ruled c. 1539\u201314 bce) had been preceded by Kamose , who was either his father or his brother, Egyptian tradition regarded Ahmose as the founder of a new dynasty because he was the native ruler who reunified Egypt . Continuing a recently inaugurated practice, he married his full sister Ahmose-Nofretari. The queen was given the title of God\u2019s Wife of Amon . Like her predecessors of the 17th dynasty, Queen Ahmose-Nofretari was influential and highly honoured. A measure of her importance was her posthumous veneration at Thebes , where later pharaohs were depicted offering to her as a goddess among the gods.\n\nThe New Kingdom was a time of increased devotion to the state god Amon-Re , whose cult largely benefited as Egypt was enriched by the spoils of war. Riches were turned over to the god\u2019s treasuries, and as a sign of filial piety the king had sacred monuments constructed at Thebes. Under Amenhotep I the pyramidal form of royal tomb was abandoned in favour of a rock-cut tomb, and, except for Akhenaton , all subsequent New Kingdom rulers were buried in concealed tombs in the famous Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. Separated from the tombs, royal mortuary temples were erected at the edge of the desert. Perhaps because of this innovation , Amenhotep I later became the patron deity of the workmen who excavated and decorated the royal tombs. The location of his own tomb is unknown.\n\nAhmose\u2019s son and successor, Amenhotep I (ruled c. 1514\u20131493 bce), pushed the Egyptian frontier southward to the Third Cataract, near the capital of the Karmah (Kerma) state, while also gathering tribute from his Asiatic possessions and perhaps campaigning in Syria . The emerging kingdom of Mitanni in northern Syria, which is first mentioned on a stela of one of Amenhotep\u2019s soldiers and was also known by the name of Nahrin, may have threatened Egypt\u2019s conquests to the north.\n\nThus, in the reign of Thutmose I, Egyptian conquests in the Middle East and Africa reached their greatest extent, but they may not yet have been firmly held. His little-known successor, Thutmose II (c. 1482\u201379 bce), apparently continued his policies.\n\nLacking a surviving heir, Amenhotep I was succeeded by one of his generals, Thutmose I (ruled 1493\u2013c. 1482 bce), who married his own full sister Ahmose. In the south Thutmose destroyed the Karmah state. He inscribed a rock as a boundary marker, later confirmed by Thutmose III, near Kanisa-Kurgus, north of the Fifth Cataract. He then executed a brilliant campaign into Syria and across the Euphrates River , where he erected a victory stela near Carchemish .\n\nAt Thutmose II\u2019s death his queen and sister, Hatshepsut, had only a young daughter; but a minor wife had borne him a boy, who was apparently very young at his accession. This son, Thutmose III (ruled 1479\u201326 bce), later reconquered Egypt\u2019s Asian empire and became an outstanding ruler. During his first few regnal years, Thutmose III theoretically controlled the land, but Hatshepsut governed as regent. Sometime between Thutmose III\u2019s second and seventh regnal years, she assumed the kingship herself. According to one version of the event, the oracle of Amon proclaimed her king at Karnak, where she was crowned. A more propagandistic account, preserved in texts and reliefs of her splendid mortuary temple at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b, ignores the reign of Thutmose II and asserts that her father, Thutmose I, proclaimed her his successor. Upon becoming king, Hatshepsut became the dominant partner in a joint rule that lasted until her death in about 1458 bce; there are monuments dedicated by Hatshepsut that depict both kings. She had the support of various powerful personalities; the most notable among them was Senenmut, the steward and tutor of her daughter Neferure. In styling herself king, Hatshepsut adopted the royal titulary but avoided the epithet \u201cmighty bull,\u201d regularly employed by other kings. Although in her reliefs she was depicted as a male, pronominal references in the texts usually reflect her womanhood. Similarly, much of her statuary shows her in male form, but there are rarer examples that render her as a woman. In less formal documents she was referred to as \u201cKing\u2019s Great Wife\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cQueen\u201d\u2014while Thutmose III was \u201cKing.\u201d There is thus a certain ambiguity in the treatment of Hatshepsut as king.\n\nHer temple reliefs depict pacific enterprises, such as the transporting of obelisks for Amon\u2019s temple and a commercial expedition to Punt; her art style looked back to Middle Kingdom ideals. Some warlike scenes are depicted, however, and she may have waged a campaign in Nubia. In one inscription she blamed the Hyksos for the supposedly poor state of the land before her rule, even though they had been expelled from the region more than a generation earlier.\n\nDuring Hatshepsut\u2019s ascendancy Egypt\u2019s position in Asia may have deteriorated because of the expansion of Mitannian power in Syria. Shortly after her death, the prince of the Syrian city of Kadesh, stood with troops of 330 princes of a Syro-Palestinian coalition at Megiddo; such a force was more than merely defensive, and the intention may have been to advance against Egypt. The 330 must have represented all the places of any size in the region that were not subject to Egyptian rule and may be a schematic figure derived from a list of place-names. It is noteworthy that Mitanni itself was not directly involved.\n\nThutmose III proceeded to Gaza with his army and then to Yehem, subjugating rebellious Palestinian towns along the way. His annals relate how, at a consultation concerning the best route over the Mount Carmel ridge, the king overruled his officers and selected a shorter but more dangerous route through the \u02bfAr\u016bnah Pass and then led the troops himself. The march went smoothly, and, when the Egyptians attacked at dawn, they prevailed over the enemy troops and besieged Megiddo.\n\nThutmose III meanwhile coordinated the landing of other army divisions on the Syro-Palestinian littoral, whence they proceeded inland, so that the strategy resembled a pincer technique. The siege ended in a treaty by which Syrian princes swore an oath of submission to the king. As was normal in ancient diplomacy and in Egyptian practice, the oath was binding only upon those who swore it, not upon future generations.\n\nBy the end of the first campaign, Egyptian domination extended northward to a line linking Byblos and Damascus. Although the prince of Kadesh remained to be vanquished, Assyria sent lapis lazuli as tribute; Asian princes surrendered their weapons, including a large number of horses and chariots. Thutmose III took only a limited number of captives. He appointed Asian princes to govern the towns and took their brothers and sons to Egypt, where they were educated at the court. Most eventually returned home to serve as loyal vassals, though some remained in Egypt at court. In order to ensure the loyalty of Asian city-states, Egypt maintained garrisons that could quell insurrection and supervise the delivery of tribute. There never was an elaborate Egyptian imperial administration in Asia.\n\nThutmose III conducted numerous subsequent campaigns in Asia. The submission of Kadesh was finally achieved, but Thutmose III\u2019s ultimate aim was the defeat of Mitanni. He used the navy to transport troops to Asian coastal towns, avoiding arduous overland marches from Egypt. His great eighth campaign led him across the Euphrates; although the countryside around Carchemish was ravaged, the city was not taken, and the Mitannian prince was able to flee. The psychological gain of this campaign was perhaps greater than its military success, for Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites all sent tribute in recognition of Egyptian dominance. Although Thutmose III never subjugated Mitanni, he placed Egypt\u2019s conquests on a firm footing by constant campaigning that contrasts with the forays of his predecessors. Thutmose III\u2019s annals inscribed in the temple of Karnak are remarkably succinct and accurate, but his other texts, particularly one set in his newly founded Nubian capital of Napata, are more conventional in their rhetoric. He seems to have married three Syrian wives, which may represent diplomatic unions, marking Egypt\u2019s entry into the realm of international affairs of the ancient Middle East.\n\nThutmose III initiated a truly imperial Egyptian rule in Nubia. Much of the land became estates of institutions in Egypt, while local cultural traits disappear from the archaeological record. Sons of chiefs were educated at the Egyptian court; a few returned to Nubia to serve as administrators, and some were buried there in Egyptian fashion. Nubian fortresses lost their strategic value and became administrative centres. Open towns developed around them, and, in several temples outside their walls, the cult of the divine king was established. Lower Nubia supplied gold from the desert and hard and semiprecious stones. From farther south came tropical African woods, perfumes, oil, ivory, animal skins, and ostrich plumes. There is scarcely any trace of local population from the later New Kingdom, when many more temples were built in Nubia; by the end of the 20th dynasty, the region had almost no prosperous settled population.\n\nUnder Thutmose III the wealth of empire became apparent in Egypt. Many temples were built, and vast sums were donated to the estate of Amon-Re. There are many tombs of his high officials at Thebes. The capital had been moved to Memphis, but Thebes remained the religious centre.\n\nThe campaigns of kings such as Thutmose III required a large military establishment, including a hierarchy of officers and an expensive chariotry. The king grew up with military companions whose close connection with him enabled them to participate increasingly in government. Military officers were appointed to high civil and religious positions, and by the Ramesside period the influence of such people had come to outweigh that of the traditional bureaucracy."}]}
