{"David Kappos was born on December 28, 1958.": [{"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J. Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

He came to UC Davis with a respectable grade-point average; then, during his first quarter, he scored an A-plus \u2014 well above the rest of the class \u2014 in a chemistry course taught by Professor Dino Tinti (later emeritus).\n\nTinti subsequently wrote the young student a short note of encouragement.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You could have a future,\u2019 \u201d Kappos recalled, in a 2010 interview. \u201cThat was the first time an academic in a position of authority had said that to me, and it had a big impact.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Kappos earned a bachelor of science in electrical and computer engineering from UC Davis in 1983, then followed that with a law degree from UC Berkeley in 1990. His subsequent career in the intellectual property field led to a stint as vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM, where he managed worldwide intellectual property operations.\n\nIn August 2009, Kappos became the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property, and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n\u201cI work harder than anybody else,\u201d he confessed, during that 2010 interview. \u201cYou get the best results in any deal not because you\u2019re the smartest or the flashiest, but because you\u2019re the last one standing. I learned that at UC Davis.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Kappos visited UC Davis to discuss his view that when transferring technology from the laboratory to the marketplace, universities must champion a new method based on long-term relationships with commercial partners. The idea is to simplify negotiations and quickly introduce inventions into the community: an approach that can generate more funding than if universities rely solely on long-shot \u201cblockbuster\u201d patents to pay off.\n\nKappos also encourages \u201chumanitarian IP\u201d: innovative licensing models that make products available at low cost. One such example is the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s Gilead Sciences, which has licensed Indian companies to manufacture its anti-human immunodeficiency virus drugs for export to Africa, while charging only a modest royalty payment.\n\nWhen relaxing at home, Kappos\u2019 favorite sport is ice hockey, and he cites Sherlock Holmes as his \u201cfavorite fictional inventor.\u201d He regards Jules Verne as the world\u2019s most significant science fiction visionary, but refuses to choose between Star Trek and Star Wars. (\u201cThey\u2019re both great!\u201d)\n\nIn June 2011, Kappos gave an address to graduates of the UC Davis College of Engineering. No doubt recalling the encouragement he had received, years earlier, he was similarly inspiring to this next generation:\n\n\u201cThe power to innovate is the power to lead,\u201d he said, \u201cby creating, solving and doing.\u201d"}], "David Kappos is an American lawyer.": [{"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J.

It is uniquely set up: its lawyers receive the highest quality generalist training but develop specialisation over time, granting them the pliability to deal with any issue, along with enhanced problem-solving and creative thinking skills and deep substantive knowledge of the relevant issues. Among them are several eminent trial lawyers, including Keith Hummel , Evan Chesler , David Marriott and Sharonmoyee Goswami : Hummel is ingenious, resourceful, resolute and unflagging \u2013 there is nothing he cannot do when it comes to complex legal conflict. So, too, Chesler, who is referred to in reverent tones as \u201cgodlike in litigation\u201d. He continues to work closely with Marriott \u2013 they valiantly battled Apple on Qualcomm\u2019s behalf \u2013 and is currently representing short-form streaming start-up Quibi and consumer technology holding company WndrCo alongside him in consolidated patent infringement and trade secret litigation against Israeli technology company JBF Interlude. Marriott has proven his mettle in many high-profile IP, antitrust and securities cases. Goswami is the rising star of the practice and comes in for special praise: \u201cSharon is extremely strategic and detail-oriented and knows how to position cases to maximise chances of success. She has a sense of self and purpose about her and is highly collaborative, with a unique ability to work seamlessly across multiple teams.\u201d One of the top IP experts, not just at Cravath but in the world, corporate partner David Kappos anchors a leading transactions practice. He gets the biggest deals done before tea time but also devotes mental energy to crystal-ball gazing; he has an uncannily accurate sense of where things are heading \u2013 what the policy issues will be and where commercial opportunities will arise \u2013 making his behind-the-scenes strategic counsel utterly priceless.\n\nMr Kappos received a BS summa cum laude in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Davis in 1983 and a JD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1990.\n\nMr Kappos has received numerous accolades for his contributions to the field of intellectual property, including being named one of the Top 25 Icons of IP by Law360, one of the 50 Most Influential People in IP by Managing Intellectual Property, one of the Top 50 IP Trailblazers and Pioneers and one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America by The National Law Journal and being inducted into the IP Hall of Fame by IAM in 2012.\n\nPrior to leading the USPTO, Mr Kappos served as IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer from 2003 to 2009.

During his more than 25 years at IBM, he also served in a variety of other roles such as litigation counsel and Asia-Pacific IP counsel, where he led all aspects of IP protection, including licensing and transactions support for the region.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mr Kappos served as undersecretary of commerce and director of the USPTO. In that role, he advised the president, the secretary of commerce and the administration on IP policy matters. Mr Kappos led the agency in dramatically re-engineering its entire management and operational systems and its engagement with the global innovation community.

Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

In that role, he advised the President, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Administration on IP policy matters. He was instrumental in the passage and implementation of the Leahy Smith America Invents Act (AIA). Prior to leading the USPTO, David served in a variety of roles for more than 25 years at IBM, most recently as the company\u2019s Vice President and Assistant General Counsel for Intellectual Property.\n\nDavid has received numerous accolades for his contributions to the field of IP, serves on numerous public service and IP-related boards, and is an adjunct professor at two Ivy League law schools. We recently spoke with David \u2013 currently a Partner at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore \u2013 to discuss what drove his initial interest in IP, his experience leading the USPTO, and his thoughts on current IP issues.\n\nCan you tell us where you grew up?\n\nI grew up in a combination of places, but mostly in Orange County in Southern California.\n\nWhen you were growing up, was there anything that would have predicted an interest in IP?\n\nStarting in elementary school, I was pretty good at math and science, and I did well in writing classes. So, I was a little bit unique in that I had a combined set of skills that comes together professionally in only a few places, one of them being IP law.\n\nHow did you initially get involved in IP?\n\nInitially, I got involved in IP when I was still an engineer at IBM. I participated in a short program in which I shadowed an IP attorney to learn more about what that job was like. That was my first experience in the field as a non-lawyer technical person.\n\nIf you were at a karaoke bar, what song would you sing, and why?\n\nI think a Johnny Cash song, like, \u201cI Built It One Piece at a Time.\" And the reasons are twofold: One, because Johnny Cash songs are in a vocal range that someone like me can hit, and two, they\u2019re just kind of fun.\n\nYou may be most well-known as having worked as the Under Secretary of Commerce and Director of USPTO under President Obama from 2009 to 2013. After spending the first 25 years of your career at IBM, how difficult was it to take the position at USPTO?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t difficult at all. It was like going from one large enterprise, IBM, into another large enterprise, the U.S. government. I felt like it required the same basic skills \u2013 teamwork, clear communication, leadership, strong management, and discipline \u2013 that had been instilled at IBM, and were very readily translated to, and applied in, the government.\n\nDuring your time at the USPTO, what were the accomplishments that you feel most proud of?\n\nIn terms of major accomplishments, one that I definitely would have to point to would be the AIA. My team at the USPTO was central in facilitating the largest reform of the patent system since 1836. I think it\u2019s fair to say that because everything between 1836 and 2011 was codification of judge-made law. In 2011, the AIA was a very, very ambitious piece of work. We think of legislation as coming from Congress, but particularly highly technical legislation requires significant work in many different respects from the expert agency.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud of the work we did to implement the AIA after the legislation was passed. I\u2019ll never forget because the president signed the legislation on a Friday morning, and immediately after that, we all went to the White House to meet with the president. After that, there was a party at the White House with many people interested in the legislation and the IP community. And then I can remember going home finally at around midnight, and it suddenly occurred to me: Someone\u2019s now got to go off and implement this, and they\u2019re expecting us to do it at the USPTO. None of the people at the party were going to be there to help us. It\u2019s all on us. Implementing the AIA was a gigantic piece of work, and the fact that we did it, and that we did it on time, counts as a major accomplishment.\n\nIs there anything else particularly notable about your time at the PTO that you\u2019d like to share?\n\nSomething you\u2019re not even aware of is that every year the U.S. government conducts a survey called the Employee Value Survey (EVS) of all 2 million or so federal workers. Every agency, sub-agency, commission, and department of the government gets scored. So, you get to see how your agency stacks up against more than 300 other agencies in the federal government. The year before I took over at the USPTO, the agency was ranked in the bottom quartile. During the time I was there, we took the agency to being ranked the very top agency in the entire federal government for employee values \u2013 the measure for what employees actually think of the environment at the agency. Those who know the government well have said that was the biggest accomplishment of the USPTO because if you can change the self-image of an agency of that many people who are on such a challenging and lonely mission as examining patent and trademark applications (which really doesn\u2019t lend itself to teamwork very much), it\u2019s rather remarkable \u2013 and we did it. And, of course, once you get morale in a good place, then there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t accomplish. That\u2019s when you can implement something like the AIA, and then you can dramatically re-engineer lots of other processes.\n\nHow did you end up at Cravath Swaine & Moore after the USPTO?\n\nMost people find another job before they announce that they\u2019re leaving the government. I decided not to. I wanted to put my full energy into the USPTO until I resigned. Going this route caused Cravath to actually reach out to me. I would\u2019ve never thought to reach out in the opposite direction, because Cravath is a 200-year-old firm that is almost entirely composed of self-grown partners. There are very occasional exceptions made \u2013 just a few of them in living memory. I\u2019m one, and Christine Varney, the antitrust partner here, is the other one who comes to mind. I didn\u2019t bother talking to anybody else once I was called by Cravath, because my wife, who has a long history as a law firm lawyer, very quickly told me, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to another firm.\u201d\n\nCould you tell us a little bit about the nature of your practice at Cravath? What types of work are you doing for your clients?\n\nI\u2019ve been here now six-and-a-half years, and I\u2019m the corporate IP partner. With a team of now seven associates and two summer associates, we support the entire firm in all corporate, and even some litigation, IP-related work. An example in recent history that I can talk about is The Walt Disney Company\u2019s acquisition of the film and television assets of 20th Century Fox. That was, I think, the biggest IP deal in history. It was a $72 billion deal. And when it was all said and done, it involved the transfer of more than 100,000 IP assets: film, television shows, music, copyrights, domain names, etc. An enormous deal that was also enormously complicated. It involved many countries, many entities, and many, many, many IP issues. We also do IP policy work at Cravath. We\u2019re asked by clients to write and speak on policy issues all over the world. That\u2019s probably a byproduct of my background running a government agency.\n\nCan you share an example that is particularly interesting or meaningful of pro bono work that you\u2019ve recently performed?\n\nI teach, along with my litigation partner at Cravath, David Marriott, a course at Columbia Law School on copyright litigation. We take on pro bono cases, and actually then go out and resolve disputes on behalf of creatives. We\u2019re not representing those who take and use other people\u2019s IP without paying for it. We\u2019re trying to vindicate the rights and protect the interests of the people who actually create things, in this case, copyright-protected things. In the auspices of that program on a pro bono basis, we\u2019ve got two major lawsuits pending. In both cases, we\u2019re representing fine art photographers who\u2019ve had their work appropriated by an appropriation artist and haven\u2019t yet been able to resolve the matter amicably. So, we filed lawsuits for them. It\u2019s something that I think is great \u2013 that the firm supports us in taking on projects that are, frankly, pretty expensive in terms of the amount of energy required from us and from associates, over a sustained period of time.\n\nWe understand that you\u2019re also currently the U.S. chair of the U.S.-China IP Experts Cooperation Dialogue. What do you believe are the one or two most important changes related to IP in China over the past few years?\n\nWell, one that came about just recently, several months ago, was the introduction of a trade secret regime. China never previously had trade secret law. The closest they came was unfair competition, which only partially covers some issues related to trade secrets. But now they have a national trade secret law. That\u2019s a major positive change that has occurred. Similarly, another major change that I would put at the top of the list is the creation of IP specialty courts, which happened several years ago. Also, earlier this year, China created a new tribunal as part of the Supreme Court that hears IP cases. All of these are major moves that create more of a national structure that has the expertise needed to decide IP disputes.\n\nSwitching back to U.S. patent law, since inter partes reviews (IPRs) became available at the USPTO in 2012, many in the IP world have developed strong feelings about the strengths or weaknesses of the IPR regime. What are your general thoughts about the IPR regime during the almost seven years since the passage of the AIA?\n\nWell, I think the IPR system has been hugely successful. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been used about three times as much as we estimated it was going to be used when we were doing the government-required estimates before the AIA was passed. It\u2019s been hugely popular. I think the USPTO, and particularly the first chief judge of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), James Smith, did a superb job of hiring highly qualified administrative law judges (ALJs), and then putting in place a robust set of procedures that\u2019s enabled the PTAB to operate as effectively as it has. That being said, we knew from the beginning that there was no way we were going to be able to get it perfect. In fact, we were aiming for a 70% solution with the intention of iterating quickly. Although some of those iterations did not occur right away, you\u2019ve seen in the last year that things have settled down significantly with the PTAB, and you no longer hear all the shrill complaints that you were hearing three and four years ago. So, I think it\u2019s been very successful. You have to remember the world we were living in pre-AIA. It was a world in which there really were problems with many abusive lawsuits. And there was an arbitrage going on, because of the cost to defend patent infringement lawsuits \u2013 abusers were taking advantage of that. The AIA definitely fixed that in a very big way. And what became clear was that in our focus on the congressional requirement to get these procedures finished within 18 months, we wired the process very tightly. So tightly, in fact, that in some ways it turned out to be unfair to patentees. It\u2019s just great to see that the current administration has gone about fixing those issues.\n\nOne of the big lightning rods over the past couple of years has been this question of patent eligibility guidelines and efforts to revise them. Do you believe that the current interpretations of Alice[1] have stifled innovation or resulted in other unintended consequences?\n\nOh, definitely. I mean, just look at what\u2019s gone on with the Cleveland Clinic having important diagnostics patents invalidated, and that\u2019s just one example. The current state of Section 101 related to patent eligibility, and interpretation of that area of the law, is a complete mess. The Federal Circuit itself has repeatedly had judges call that section out regarding its interpretation. It is definitely stifling innovation because innovators and those who fund them put their efforts in places where they can gain a competitive advantage, and they don\u2019t put their efforts in areas where they won\u2019t be able to capture a competitive advantage. We\u2019ve now put our thumb on the scales in favor of a patent system that can\u2019t protect major areas of innovation, like diagnostics and aspects of computer software. It should be no surprise then that investment patterns change, and there\u2019s less investment in the areas that aren\u2019t subject to protection.\n\nWhat advice would you give Congress in its efforts to revise patent eligibility guidelines?\n\nWell, I think they have a very solid proposal in the one that Senators Thom Tillis and Chris Coons recently made. All they really need to do is take the input that they\u2019ve received from parties that have had good refined suggestions, and modify the proposal accordingly. They would then have an extremely solid bill to pass into law, and that, in one action, fixes the problem.\n\nDo you have any final thoughts that you\u2019d like to share on any particular issues that are important to you as they relate to IP, or any follow up comments on things we\u2019ve discussed?\n\nAnother issue is that significant thought needs to be given to the IP antitrust interface. I think that policymakers need to really step back, and ask what impact the heavy hand of antitrust enforcement is having on innovation through the IP system. That\u2019s a question that, in my mind, hasn\u2019t been asked nearly enough, particularly by the innovation or IP community. So that\u2019s something that needs to be dealt with, and it will probably require several years of energy and thought. Another interesting trend relates to the advent of data as an asset class and dealing with that somehow through the IP system. This is an area where we have not at all come to grips with how data should be treated under IP. There\u2019s no protection for data through the patent system, the copyright system, or the trademark system. The only protection for data is if it\u2019s kept secret through the trade secret system and nondisclosure agreements. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s the right policy paradigm because you are effectively taking an important asset class and requiring that it be kept confidential if it\u2019s going to have competitive value, but you\u2019re not encouraging or creating a situation that\u2019s apt to engender transactions, efficiency, and specialization. So, I worry about the treatment of data. It\u2019s become an incredibly important asset. People call it the new gold, and it really is. But the IP law system doesn\u2019t know how to treat it."}, {"url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2320079", "page_content": "7 Pages Posted: 4 Sep 2013\n\nDate Written: January 16, 2013\n\nAbstract\n\nUnder Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office David J. Kappos was sworn into service in August 2009 at a time of an unprecedented confluence of challenges for the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The country was in the midst of a recession and economic downturn that negatively affected the revenues of the user fee funded USPTO; Congress was signaling that passage of a broad patent reform bill was imminent; the USPTO had significant infrastructure, particularly technological, problems; uncertainty about full retention of user fees paid to the USPTO was an ongoing concern; and the user community was unhappy with the office regarding recent USPTO procedural decisions, patent quality, and the ever growing backlog of patent applications awaiting examination.\n\nIn additional to those challenges, Kappos took office during a time when political partisanship and acrimony were at an all-time high and becoming only more contentious and more divided every successive year of Kappos\u2019 tenure. This was the political environment that Kappos started in and had to traverse during his 3 years and 7 months as Under Secretary and Director.\n\nDespite all of these obstacles, sixteen pieces of intellectual property related legislation were signed into law during Director Kappos\u2019 tenure. While some commentators have dubbed the 112th Congress the 'Do Nothing Congress', clearly nothing could be further from fact in regards to patent policy and the USPTO. More legislation was introduced and passed in support of the USPTO during Kappos\u2019 term than at any other time in recent memory. Many of these new laws were major pieces of legislation that have had, and will continue to have, profound effects on the USPTO, inventors, businesses, and the national economy. These achievements include: The Foreign and Economic Espionage Penalty Enhancement Act; The Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act; The Trademark Technical and Conforming Amendment Act; The Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act; The United States Patent and Trademark Office Supplemental Appropriations Act; The America COMPETES Re-Authorization Act; The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act; and The Leahy-Smith America Invents Technical Correction Act.\n\nSuch a result was unthinkable at the August 7, 2009 confirmation of David Kappos, a business executive with no Administration or Capitol Hill experience. Yet -- with some missteps but many more successes -- Mr. Smith came to Washington and secured a brighter future for the USPTO and innovation, not just in the United States but worldwide."}, {"url": "https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/news/biography-david-kappos", "page_content": "David Kappos\u2019 high school advisors warned him not to think too ambitiously.

Kappos is widely recognized as one of the world\u2019s foremost leaders in the field of intellectual property, including intellectual property management and strategy, the development of global intellectual property norms, laws and practices as well as commercialization and enforcement of innovation\u2011based assets.

The key claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a simple mathematical formula. The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand. The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical problem. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and affirmed. The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed. The en banc court rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention was a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101\u2014i.e., whether the invention produced a \u201cuseful, concrete, and tangible result,\u201d see, e.g., State Street Bank & Trust Co v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373\u2014holding instead that a claimed process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing. Concluding that this \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not patent eligible.\n\nJustice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts II\u2013B\u20132 and II\u2013C\u20132, concluding that petitioners\u2019 claimed invention is not patent eligible. Pp. 4\u20138, 10\u201311, 12\u201316.\n\n(a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions or discoveries that are patent eligible: \u201cprocess[es],\u201d \u201cmachin[es],\u201d \u201cmanufactur[es],\u201d and \u201ccomposition[s] of matter.\u201d \u201cIn choosing such expansive terms, \u2026 Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope,\u201d Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 308, in order to ensure that \u201c \u2018ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement,\u2019 \u201d id., at 308\u2013309. This Court\u2019s precedents provide three specific exceptions to \u00a7101\u2019s broad principles: \u201claws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u201d Id., at 309. While not required by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the notion that a patentable process must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d And, in any case, the exceptions have defined the statute\u2019s reach as a matter of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174. The \u00a7101 eligibility inquiry is only a threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the four categories, it must also satisfy \u201cthe conditions and requirements of this title,\u201d \u00a7101(a), including novelty, see \u00a7102, nonobviousness, see \u00a7103, and a full and particular description, see \u00a7112. The invention at issue is claimed to be a \u201cprocess,\u201d which \u00a7100(b) defines as a \u201cprocess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\u201d Pp. 4\u20135.\n\n(b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for patent eligibility under \u00a7101. The Court\u2019s precedents establish that although that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a patent-eligible \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. In holding to the contrary, the Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation: Courts \u201c \u2018should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature has not expressed,\u2019 \u201d Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 182, and, \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, \u2018words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d that would require it to be tied to a machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Director urges the Court to read \u00a7101\u2019s other three patentable categories as confining \u201cprocess\u201d to a machine or transformation. However, the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for \u00a7100(b) already explicitly defines \u201cprocess,\u201d see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section\u2019s inclusion of those other categories suggests that a \u201cprocess\u201d must be tied to one of them. Finally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test. Recent authorities show that the test was never intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588, n. 9. Pp. 5\u20138.\n\n(c) Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term \u201cprocess\u201d that would categorically exclude business methods. The term \u201cmethod\u201d within \u00a7100(b)\u2019s \u201cprocess\u201d definition, at least as a textual matter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and this Court\u2019s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing business. The Court is unaware of any argument that the \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d Diehr, supra, at 182, of \u201cmethod\u201d excludes business methods. Nor is it clear what a business method exception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a business more efficiently. The categorical exclusion argument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method patents: Under \u00a7273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on \u201ca method in [a] patent,\u201d the alleged infringer can assert a defense of prior use. By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges that there may be business method patents. Section 273 thus clarifies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of \u201cmethod\u201d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under \u00a7101. A contrary conclusion would violate the canon against interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would render another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Finally, while \u00a7273 appears to leave open the possibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such claimed inventions. Pp. 10\u201311.\n\n(d) Even though petitioners\u2019 application is not categorically outside of \u00a7101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today, that does not mean it is a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7101. Petitioners seek to patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that concept to energy markets. Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, however, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent abstract ideas. Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and reduce that concept to a mathematical formula. This is an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook. Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent the use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well-known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the inputs into the equation. They add even less to the underlying abstract principle than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook. Pp. 12\u201315.\n\n(e) Because petitioners\u2019 patent application can be rejected under the Court\u2019s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable \u201cprocess,\u201d beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in \u00a7100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. Nothing in today\u2019s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal Circuit\u2019s past interpretations of \u00a7101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d, at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or-transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the Federal Circuit\u2019s development of other limiting criteria that further the Patent Act\u2019s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.

The office he directs protects IP through patents and trademarks, provides incentives to encourage technological advancement, and helps businesses protect their investments, promote their goods and services, and safeguard against deception in the marketplace. Kappos spoke with Tom Fox, who writes the Washington Post\u2019s Federal Coach blog and is the director of the Partnership for Public Service\u2019s Center for Government Leadership.\n\nAre there specific programs you use to foster employee innovation?\n\nThere are. One of the areas that we were hammered on earlier this year was innovation. The problem we encounter is this: Fundamentally, our job is not to be innovative at all. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. The last thing people want is a patent examiner who\u2019s taking creative liberty in how he reviews a patent application. As an agency of 8,000 or so professionals, it\u2019s part of our job and our legal responsibility to follow a very detailed set of rules.\n\nIn that context, we\u2019ve had to think long and hard about how to encourage our employees to be innovative in appropriate ways. We\u2019ve created a program to review recommendations from the employees about how to make activities at the agency more streamlined and more effective. It\u2019s garnered such an outstanding slate of suggestions that we decided to turn the program into an annual contest. Employees who provide the best suggestions are not only honored at an agency-wide awards ceremony each year, they are given the resources and funding to implement their suggestions.\n\nWhat are some of the leadership lessons you\u2019ve learned over the years?\n\nLeadership involves a lot of different behaviors and characteristics, but high on my list is adaptability. In virtually every situation, that means getting the facts and having an comprehensive understanding of what is going on. It entails tuning a response to all aspects of the situation, whether it involves inter-cultural issues, broad-based communications or a fine-grained decision on a particular issue or person, and whether it requires a coaching kind of response, a directive kind of response or no response at all.\n\nHaving a whole range of tools to use is really critical, taking a leader from being handicapped and having only one or two tools to respond to a situation with, to becoming like a Swiss Army Knife and having just the right balance, tone, style, delivery, content, timing and everything available to handle whatever the situation is.\n\nBefore this job, I was employed by IBM for 27 years and had the benefit of working with some of the greatest leaders of our time. I think it\u2019s fair to say that whatever I know about leadership and management, I learned at IBM. The company made a tremendous investment in me, ensuring that I received both formal and informal opportunities for leadership development.\n\nWhat are you doing to keep the satisfaction of your employees high?\n\nOne thing we\u2019re doing is partnering with our labor unions. We are empowering the unions and treating them not only as valued colleagues, but also as aggregators of employee interests and employee concerns. As a result, we\u2019ve transformed our ability to respond to employees\u2019 wants and needs.\n\nA second thing we\u2019re doing is involving our first-level managers, who are supervisory examiners, in management decisions. It\u2019s allowed us to improve morale dramatically, because when you get the first-line managers feeling good and informed, the magnifying impact is enormous. About 98 percent of how employees view their workplaces depends on how they view their first-line managers.\n\nA third and final thing we\u2019re doing is engaging our SES (Senior Executive Service) career executives and using them as a core team of senior professionals for the agency. If I may say so, the idea has worked brilliantly. It\u2019s given me direct, regular access to the 60 or so SES members here at USPTO.\n\nWhat event or experience has most contributed to shaping you as the leader you are today?\n\nThe most transformative experience for me was an overseas assignment I completed in Japan. At the time, I ran IBM\u2019s Asia Pacific Intellectual Property Law operation. I was thrown into a leadership role, in a different country with a different culture, and with really no support. I was 12 time zones away from anyone who could really be helpful to me and, as a result, I learned quickly how to adapt. It brought my sense of leadership to an entirely new level. Today, I am able to consider things like cultural issues in trying to lead people with broad experience of background.\n\nMore from On Leadership:\n\nHow to completely destroy an employee\u2019s work life\n\nA love note to the workaholic\n\nYour advice for a bad boss\n\nLike On Leadership?
