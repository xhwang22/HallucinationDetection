For a woman, it also represents her father, and later her husband. The Sun is one of the most important symbols in the birth chart, as much as the Ascendant, then the Moon (a bit less for a man), the ruler of the Ascendant and the fast-moving planets. It's element is fire; it is hot and dry, it governs Leo, is in exaltation in Aries and is in analogy with the heart. It represents the boss, authority, beside the father and the husband ; the age of the Sun goes from 20 years old to about 40, following the Venus age when one is aware of his seductive power. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary, passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Sun. Sun in Pisces Your deep intuition and your extreme sensitivity allow you to perceive naturally what others understand through analysis. You do not follow the norms in use, societal or educational models and you prefer to create a moral for yourself. A feeling of isolation may come from your ability to live emotions that are unknown to your entourage. This strong impressionability endows you with a sixth sense and acute feelings. In some circumstances, distance and detachment are needed in order not to get bogged down in the necessities of the moment, in useless transient struggles and in barren conflicts. Pisces work wonders. Your strength: a sharp intuition of underlying stakes, a sensitivity that turns \"the spirit of the times\" into a real compass. All activities requiring stepping back are suitable for you. Before anyone else, you pick up the dangers of an adventure, the risks of defeats or of suspension... with your clear-sightedness more than due to pessimism. Therefore, you may abandon an objective that is not yet obsolete. It is important that you protect yourself against unnecessary disenchantments. Pisces hide a perceptiveness that many claim to possess. But your low-key advices are formulated in a peculiar language. The person who can understand your dazzling intuitions is very lucky. Sun in House IV In your natal chart, the Sun is in the 4th House. Your private world and your family environment are of utmost importance to you. Your aspirations (your solar models) focus on everything in which your personality can find refuge. This also includes clans and divides, as well as integrations and separations. Your attachment to your roots goes far beyond a mere family feeling or parochialism. The clan, to which you feel you belong, is the determining factor in the choice of your objectives, your ideals, and your reasons for living. Sun Dominant If the Sun is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Solarian: you loathe pettiness and Machiavellian manoeuvre, and you are fond of natural nobleness as well as of direct and honest attitudes. You endeavour to get out of muddled or dark situations as quickly as possible. Your need for transparency may lead you to make cut-and-dried judgments such as yes or no, and black or white. However, your honesty commands your entourage's consideration. At times, you come across as authoritarian. It is true that you never want to be thought of the notable absentee, and that you manage to make people pay attention to you, as well as to your plans and your assessments. To this end, the Solarian sometimes develops a great talent for placing himself under the spotlight without missing a single opportunity to arouse interest. Some other Solarians, although more discreet, still manage to be the focus of any debate, even in situations of exclusion. It is your way of being present even though you are actually not there... More than other people, you appreciate the esteem extended to you. It is useless to cheat with you, since in all areas you consider establishing enduring relationships only with those who love you, admire you, respect you, or express some degree of affection to you. Your will to straighten out your inter-personal relationships is your strength and sometimes, your Achilles' heel. You cannot achieve anything behind the scenes. Therefore, your comportment is marked with heroism, and your stands are devoid of ambiguity, in the sense that your commitments are unfailing, and your rebuffs, final. Interpretation of the 22\u00b0 Pisces symbolic degree \"In a luxurious house, a young man stares at two daggers lain in a cross shape on the table.\" (Janduz version) Obsessive, unbalanced, and aggressive character revelling in provocations, plots, and conflicts. Wealth and great honours are often followed by fall from grace. This is caused by bad luck, rashness, or a nervous breakdown. No external help is to be expected since one has no friends. One must beware of burns and injuries made by bladed weapons. If in the natal chart, Jupiter is stronger than Mars, the danger is significantly offset. Nevertheless, one must remain cautious and avoid risky situations such as hunting or all occupations involving handling firearms and cutting devices. If natal Mercury is on this degree, one is blessed with an excellent memory. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees.

For a man, she represents his mother and later his wife, and his relationship with women in general. For a woman, the Moon is almost as important as the Sun and the Ascendant. Her element is water, she is cold and moist, she rules Cancer, is in exaltation in Taurus and is in analogy with the stomach. She symbolizes the mother, wife, the crowd, the Moon is associated with birth and childhood. Tradition also matches her with the end of life, after Saturn the old age, it is thus customary to go back to one's place of birth to die: the end of life meets the very beginning. Temperament: Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, non Active and Primary, Nervous or Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Moon. Moon in Aries On the day and at the time of your birth, the Moon was in the sign of Aries. Your imagination is lively and fantastic and brings about periods of enthusiasm during which you are driven by your sudden impulses. Your sensitivity lives on thrills that you want to experience in the instant... till exhaustion. Your spontaneity is coupled with some instability: mood swings and whimsical behaviours are the dangers to which your excitability exposes you. You often show demeanours full of contrasts, especially in your intimate life. One never gets bored with you, even on a daily basis. Isn't real rest about being touched and stimulated, over and over again? Boredom is what you dread most. Therefore, it is easy for you to adjust to precarious life rhythms and to quickly achieve balance, as temporary as it may be, should unforeseen evolution emerge. Moon in House V With the Moon is in 5th House, you never feel as good as when you are playing. Of course, adults' games are often disguised and marked by the seriousness of age. Short-lived pleasures, seduction enterprises, and dramatic postures are integral parts of your private world. You enjoy childhood and children. You feel that you can easily access their world. The vocations in which you are most likely to be successful are linked to this love for playfulness: teaching, education, theatre, etc. Moon Dominant If the Moon is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Lunarian: the driving force behind your actions is mainly the pursuit of well-being and tranquillity. Your sensitive and romantic self lives on those periods of rest during which you let your imagination wander at will. This is your way of finding inspiration and balance. Nothing is allowed to disturb your feeling of fulfilment and security within a harmonious cell, be it a family or a clan. More than other people, the Lunarian is attached to those moments during which one forgets one's worries and lets oneself cast adrift aimlessly, with no other goal than to be lulled into an ambiance, a situation, or a perfect moment. Many people do not understand such absences and their meaning, which is to regain strength. These people readily describe you with such unflattering terms as apathy and nonchalance. Never mind! Some inspirations require surrendering as well as striking a balance derived from alternate action and passivity. Your qualities are expressed to the fullest in situations which demand familiarity and privacy. Your capacities to respect and blend into your environment is at least as valuable as some other people's aggressive dispositions. However, you are well-advised to avoid indolence and renunciation out of laziness or indifference. Interpretation of the 15\u00b0 Aries symbolic degree \"A woman holds a pair of scales containing a cup of red wine in one pan and a heap of gold coins in the other.\" (Janduz version) Selfish, materialistic, and conceited character. One is only concerned in luxury, fine clothing, and all kinds of pleasures. One spends lavishly for oneself but displays utter stinginess towards other people. One is driven by self-interest and picks one's acquaintances among wealthy and influential persons. Good luck seems to smile on this degree, and with the support of powerful protectors, one achieves success in occupations involving precious stones, gold, silver, and jewellery in general. Nevertheless, unless the natal chart indicates otherwise, such intense self-centeredness and extravagant expenses bring about ruin and unhappiness. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Earth is its element, it is cold and dry, and it rules Virgo and Gemini, is in exaltation in Virgo and is in analogy with the arms, hands, nervous system. It represents tradesmen, lawyers, messengers; the age of Mercury goes from 8 or10 years old to about 15.. Temperament: Nervous Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Non-Emotive, Active and Primary, Nervous or Sanguine type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mercury. Mercury in Aquarius Mercury describes your relations, your communication skills and the way you relate to the external world. However, other astrological elements also influence these areas. The sign Mercury occupies is significant only if Mercury is part of your planetary dominantes. In your chart, Mercury is in Aquarius. Everything with a human tint catches your attention. You are sensitive to the specificities and the uniqueness of each individual and you feel you learn a lot whenever you meet with an open-minded and curious person. You do not get along well with stay-at-home and conservative people. As each relationship is constantly evolving, with time, it can, and it must, grow and offer surprises and potentials. On the human plane, you are very idealistic - sometimes even utopian - readily trusting and valuing persons who may not always be worth it. This is the drawback inherent to your highly commendable open-mindedness and your tolerance. Your ideas are original and liberal. In your communication, you display consideration and leniency and you acknowledge your interlocutor's differences. However, your understanding is not unconditional and you detach yourself from disappointing people whose values are incompatible with yours. To each, his own! Mercury in House IV Mercury is in the 4th House. You are endowed with an acute sense of relations and inter-personal connections. However, your communication capacities are expressed in a discreet way, in the delimited framework of your clan, your family or a social cell. You show your worth only after a climate of confidence is established. Your inter-personal qualities work wonders then, and your life settings (family, home, and closed friends) become the favourite area for your personal expression. N.B.: When a planet is posited near the cusp of the next astrological house (less than 2 degrees for the Ascendant or the Midheaven, and less than 1 degree for all the other houses), it is considered to be posited in the following house. This rule is used in the texts of this interactive chart and in all our astrological softwares. Mercury Dominant If Mercury is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Mercurian: the tradition points out the importance of communication. From idle but enriching chatters to observation gift, such a dominant endows you with a wide range of expression. Human beings have one thousand facets and one thousand masks they wear according to circumstances and the fortunes of the game of life. You take the role of an observer who is avid for novelties, discoveries, and surprises. Everything catches your attention and becomes an opportunity for new encounters, relationships, and learning. The world amazes you, amuses you sometimes, and stimulates your curiosity. Because the most important thing is to discover, and because you consider that each new situation is packed with potentialities, you try to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Although your open-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also enables you to carefully avoid sticking to only one immutable and rigid view. The slightest sign enables you to perceive the other side of the coin, as well as the infinite complexity of people and of situations. On the human plane, you seek the dialogue and the information without which you know that you are not able to fully grasp the nature of your interlocutor. This keen interest in the Unknown sharpens your inter-relational skills. All these qualities are traditionally associated with Mercury. Interpretation of the 25\u00b0 Aquarius symbolic degree \"A personage surrounded by a halo of light walks towards a blindfolded man who heads for an abyss.\" (Janduz version) Confused, helpless and self-righteous character. Instead of stubbornly repeating the same mistakes, one must seek the advice of more experienced friends who can help avoid dangerous traps and teach the rudiments of one's job. Clear-sightedness is a must, and when one is lost, one must remember that sitting down on the ground protects against injuries in case of fall.

For men, she also corresponds to the kind of woman he's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is more symbolized by the Moon, Venus is the lover and not the wife). Her element is the Air, she is moist, rules Taurus and Libra, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the kidneys, the venous system, the bladder, the neck. She represents the artists, tradesmen, occupations linked to beauty and charm; the age of Venus goes from 15 to about 25 years old. Temperament: Sanguine and Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Emotive, non Active and Secondary type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Venus. Venus in Taurus Venus describes your affective life. On the day of your birth, she is found in Taurus. The most important thing for you is to retain sensations and feelings. You taste them, you savour them with sensuality and often, with greed. You respond to all palpable and tangible things. Your amorous life, like your artistic sensitivity, constantly involves your demanding and selective sensuality. There can be no balance without love. Passion is wild, imperious and final. Your strongly developed sensuality is demanding. Sensual pleasure is as important, more important in some cases, than cerebral connivance. You are not content with short-lived unions... You want to take the time to enjoy your love, to savour its happiness and its spices. Your ideal is to couple the comfort of a lasting relationship with sensual fulfilment. Appetite is fine but it may tend to become bulimia! A demanding sensuality may be tyrannical. The sign of Taurus in its \"pure essence\" becomes the victim and the slave of its passions. Of course, you are not the manifestation of this \"Taurus in its pure essence\". But it is likely that you have to handle the necessities of your mighty and complex affectivity. Your memory for feelings is very strong... You never forget loyalty and similarly, you never forget your grudges. Venus in House VI Venus expresses her characteristics through the 6th House values. Affectivity is your signature. You try to define yourself, as well as to define your social role, making use of your sensitivity, your sense of aesthetics, and your affectivity. Therefore, your profession may be directly related to the Venusian world: charm, femininity, and art. In any case, finding your place and your social function is a matter of seduction, instinct, and probably natural likes and dislikes. Venus Dominant If Venus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Venusian: you are a sensual and emotional person particularly receptive to the natural likes and dislikes aroused by your contact with people. You are prone to frequent instinctive aversions and true passions which are exclusively driven by the feeling of love. The heart has its reasons which Reason knows nothing of... Your balance is based on the richness of your affective life. Without love, the Venusian is resourceless, lost, and deprived of any reason for living. You have an obvious and strong will to charm and to arouse the attachments without which you cannot properly function. Every area of your life is thus marked by your affectivity. The danger is that you may \"be taken in\" by charm. In such cases, you would prefer to keep your emotions under better control. Thus, hyper-sensitivity has its own inconveniences. Nevertheless, better than anyone else, you know how to play with feelings and attractions. Although you are sometimes caught in the traps of an over sensitive emotionalism, feelings remain your best assets in many circumstances. There is another aspect to the Venusian dominant. According to the Tradition, this planet rules the Arts, and you are endowed with some degree of artistic dispositions, ranging from good to excellent. Interpretation of the 5\u00b0 Taurus symbolic degree \"In a conference hall, a man at the height of his glory is standing on a podium with a scroll of paper in his hand and a laurel wreath on his head. Among the participants, there is a three-headed man who looks in different directions.\" (Janduz version) Intelligent, shrewd, and fickle character. The three-headed man symbolises the host of talents and abilities one is blessed with. Sharp perspicacity, scientific knowledge, and artistic skills enable to overcome many an obstacle and to achieve success and fame, probably owing to a major discovery or an outstanding invention. This degree sometimes indicates a physical flaw at birth or following an accident. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees.

For a woman, Mars corresponds to the kind of man she's attracted to (but not especially in marriage which is rather symbolized by the Sun, Mars is the lover, not the husband). Fire is its element, it is hot and dry, and it rules Aries and Scorpio (along with Pluto), is in exaltation with Capricorn and is in analogy with the muscles and the spleen. It represents the soldiers, sportsmen, warriors, surgeons, blacksmiths... ; the age of Mars goes from 42 to 50 years old. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type. It is a Choleric. For more information, see the page dedicated to Mars. Mars in Leo The planet Mars indicates how you react to life concrete stimulations. It also describes your fighting spirit, your abilities to stand for yourself and to take action. With Mars in Leo, your passionate nature and your affectivity always on the alert put your sentimental life on top of the list. You take action according to your own rules and you rely on sincerity above all. You cannot compromise and accept a course that is contrary to your desires. This configuration gives a propensity for curt, even heroic behaviours: you never draw back from obstacles and you make it a point of honour to fight to the extreme limits of your might. If your opponents do not give in, confrontations may take a Homeric turn. You can mobilize your energy as you please, and should circumstances require that you do so, you demonstrate exceptional competitiveness and fighting spirit. Mars in House IX With Mars in the 9th House, everything unknown to you constitutes a challenge. Why should you hesitate? It is best to explore the world, to travel, and to cross swords with reality in order to learn and progress. But life cannot be discovered in a catalogue. You need to live your ideas through, even though it means that you get hurt. It is only through real stories that you succeed in overcoming your limitations, and in renewing yourself. Your concepts are unshakable because they are based on your experience and on your passionate nature. Adventure is a must! Mars Dominant If Mars is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Marsian: in your hand-to-hand struggle for life, you demonstrate an acute and active sense of confrontation with the world, with other people, and with your own destiny. You need to take action and to fight for your projects and your desires. You perceive all situations with deep intensity, and you react to the here and now without bothering to step back in order to ensure that events are under your control. You take up challenges with excessive foolhardiness as a consequence of your impulsiveness. However, better than anyone else, you know how to mobilise your resources in case of crisis. You take action whenever it is necessary to do so, and you are present in a timely manner. With Mars, your attitudes are dictated by the realities of the moment, by your emotions, and by everything which proved to have worked in the past. When this dominant is not well integrated, it may bring about an aggressive or impulsive behaviour. Therefore, you must learn to control your hyper-sensitivity and your fits of temper. You are also endowed with Marsian qualities: the fighting spirit and the taste for duel without which one may find oneself overwhelmed by events. When this willpower is well channelled, its precious energy enables to cope with all sorts of contingencies. There are a thousand ways to win, and a thousand challenges to take up with the enthusiasm and the dynamism which make life so worthy. A certain idea of life which is wild, passionate, and in tune with events. Interpretation of the 19\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A waxing moon and a star shine in the night, and an arm emerging from a blossoming tree unrolls a parchment scroll.\" (Janduz version) Intuitive, imaginative, and observant character endowed with an excellent memory and great intellectual capacities. Life is most likely to be full of changes and exciting journeys. Daily work is a constant source of satisfactions. With the protection of a high-ranking figure, success and fame are achieved in natural sciences, history, astronomy, literature, or in any intellectual career in both the private and the public sectors.

It represents the governors, magistrates, professors, religious men too; the age of Jupiter goes from 50 to 55 or even 70 years old. Temperament: Sanguine Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is an extrovert Choleric. Actually the humid version of Mars, inclined to action like him. For more information, see the page dedicated to Jupiter. Jupiter in Sagittarius The planet Jupiter symbolizes expansion, broadness and generosity. Jupiter is associated with the functions of synthesis, enthusiasm and optimism. In your natal chart, his house position is more important than his sign position because, like Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Jupiter in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Jupiter in Sagittarius is very popular because he rules this sign, and, according to the Tradition, he is most potent and at his best. He endows you with all his natural qualities: enthusiasm, sense of humour, boldness, warmth, optimism, leadership, synthesizing mind, but also, propensity for travels or, symbolically, disposition for higher knowledge and matters such as spirituality, philosophy, politics or religion. Jupiter in House II Jupiter is in the 2nd House. Why does the Tradition credit Jupiter with such a fortunate influence? According to some treaties, no financial disaster can affect the lucky beneficiary of a 2nd House Jupiter. And even better, he is supposed to live in a natural affluence far from any kind of poverty. It is necessary to put these assertions into perspective. Indeed, some people are destitute although they feel rich in their head and can live in an environment full of cheap luxury! You are interested in acquisitions and possessions, and you have tremendous aptitudes for seizing any opportunity to make a capital yield profit, regardless of the source it comes from, and in spite of the reversal of fortune you might have undergone. Jupiter Dominant If Jupiter is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Jupiterian: because this planet brings about a keen interest in social and professional success, the Tradition considers it to be beneficial. Indeed, you know how to adjust to events and to jump at the chance when it arises. The members of your entourage gladly entrust you with high responsibilities because they are often impressed by your learning skills and your adaptation abilities as you deal with new structures and new languages. What is the secret of your good star? It is your self-confidence which wins public support. Now, what is the secret of your charm? Definitely, enthusiasm, euphoria, and exaltation. Exaggeration also. When this dominant is well integrated, it is a factor of affluence and optimism, and a certain degree of joviality enables you to easily fit into various spheres. It constitutes your main asset to manage your life. However, you must at times curb your desire for integration, lest your sense of opportunity turns into extreme opportunism. Here also, the key to success lies in a correct estimate of everyone's chances and possibilities. Although management is one of your forte, and you can adjust your objectives to current realities better than other people, you lack the hindsight which enables you to avoid short-term vagaries and daily fluctuations. If you strive too much to adapt, you run a risk of betraying yourself. This is the other traditional side of the coin with \"The Greater Benefic\"! Interpretation of the 27\u00b0 Sagittarius symbolic degree \"A turtle follows a man riding a camel.\" (Janduz version) Valiant, determined, and hard-working character. One is not afraid of responsibilities, no matter how gruelling the task might seem. One fulfils one's duties calmly, slowly, and steadily, and progresses smoothly under the protection of a powerful friend or boss. One enjoys the recognition of peers and achieves a decent fortune.

Saturn in Leo The planet Saturn symbolizes contraction, effort, time, limitation and concentration. Saturn eliminates anything that is not authentic, sooner or later. It is impossible to cheat him as he gives an irresistible desire to form a coherent whole with oneself, in responsible and wise ways. He is the great purifier. He represents our limitations but also our truth. In your natal chart, the house position where Saturn is posited is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Saturn in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Saturn in Leo tends to detach you from pleasure and leisure and gives you a serious and responsible nature. These are good qualities if Saturn is not badly aspected, even if your inclination for having fun is not particularly increased by this planetary configuration... Saturn in House IX In your natal chart, Saturn is in the 9th House. Between conservative rigour and intolerance, as well as between seriousness and austerity, the line is very thin. You must not cross it. Then, your honesty can work wonders. Firstly, owing to your intellectual honesty, you do not fake your knowledge, and you do not compromise with truth. Secondly, owing to your moral integrity, you feel that it is essential that your relationships be transparent, sometimes at the cost of a few sacrifices. In such a context, how is it possible to criticise you for any lack of flexibility? Saturn Dominant If Saturn is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Saturnian: you gladly leave to other people the decision to take life as it comes. As far as you are concerned, you prefer to take advantage of your experiences in order to discover, to grow, and to question yourself. Interpretation of the 16\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"Near an oasis, a wealthy man on a camel travels accompanied by his servants.\" (Janduz version) Persistent, demanding, and spiteful character. One always demonstrates gratitude but never forgives a bad deed. Faraway lands and long journeys are important elements in one's brilliant career. Sharp intellectual faculties, hard work, and excellent organisation skills, supported by good luck, enable one to earn a good reputation. It is most likely that the biggest part of life is spent abroad at the service of one's country. Should the natal chart concur, in the second part of life, one achieves happiness and extraordinary successes. In the countries where one has worked, one's name will go down in history.

Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees.

Fire is its element, it is dry, and it rules Aquarius, is in exaltation with Scorpio and is in analogy with the brain and the nerves. It represents inventors, odd characters, revolutionaries. Temperament: Nervous to the extreme Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary type; it is a Passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Uranus. Uranus in Gemini The planet Uranus symbolizes originality, independence and cerebral energy bursting suddenly. Uranus triggers the irresistible need for freedom that we have in ourselves. Uranus tends to break the constraints that have become unbearable and gives us the courage and the will to get rid of what has become a burden; when he is well aspected, he also indicates genius. In your natal chart, Uranus' house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Uranus in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Uranus in Gemini increases tenfold your nervousness and may incline you to be interested in a heap of very varied topics in deep and original ways. Uranus in House VIII With Uranus is in the 8th House, the planet of revolutions is in the sector of transformations, which predisposes to all sorts of reforms and regenerations. You feel that you are capable of radically changing the nature of your life setting, of accepted models and current norms. Reconstruction, whether of a society, a couple, or a relationship, justifies the collapse of old values. You show a keen interest in occultism and in all mysterious matters. Uranus Dominant If Uranus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Uranian: personal values are prevailing. Inner certainties fuel an inflexible will and a desire to call attention on yourself as well as to follow your beliefs through. This planet prompts you to behave with determination, to put forward your own truth, and to start your personal revolution. More than other people, you are willing to keep some degree of autonomy in all circumstances, and you often display an individualistic nature. In order to achieve your ideal of freedom and independence, you may act like a despot as you try to convince and to impose your views, whether smoothly or forcefully. Regardless of the flexibility of your comportment, some situations demand an absolute firmness as well as uncompromising, frank and straightforward attitudes. People may criticise you for your intransigence and say that you are a hardliner. Outsider's opinions don't matter! The most important thing is that you act in all conscience and reach your primary objectives. More than anyone else, you know how to use your willpower and to focus your energy on a precise aim, relentlessly, whatever the consequences might be. In the chapter of qualities, let's mention a definite sense of responsibility, an innovative mind open to techniques and modern ideas, as well as a natural self-discipline which overcomes many an obstacle. Therefore, people are well-advised not to hound you into a corner. Interpretation of the 22\u00b0 Gemini symbolic degree \"A decrepit man stooping on a stick limps off a deserted road. Behind him, is an old, storm-stricken oak.\" (Janduz version) Secretive, subtle, and courageous character. Life starts under the best aegis, but after having reached its heights, the career undergoes numerous ups and downs, and one discovers that the people one has helped, including the family members, behave with ingratitude. One must carefully distinguish between genuine friends and flatterers, if one is to prevent one's life from ending in painful poverty and loneliness. Furthermore, one must never hesitate to fight injustices instead of limiting oneself to cowardly neutrality. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Water is its element, it is moist, it rules Pisces, is in exaltation in Cancer, though some authors say it is Leo, and is in analogy with the vegetative system. It represents dreamers, mediums, magicians, merchants of illusion, drug addicts. Temperament: rather Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active, Primary or Secondary type; it is a Sentimental, or sometimes Amorphous type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Neptune. Neptune in Libra The planet Neptune symbolizes extreme receptivity, intense emotional sharpness, impressionability and inspiration; it is the planet of mediums, mystics and religious faith. In an astrological chart, it indicates dilution, vagueness, understanding one's environment through emotions and the absence of clear and determined limits and structures. In your natal chart, Neptune's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Neptune in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Neptune in Libra endows you with idealism and pacifism. You dream of a world of peace, freedom, equality and tolerance. Your exchanges with others are genuine. You are listening to, and on the lookout for, all the emotions that you find to be so deliciously nurturing. Neptune in House XI With Neptune in the 11th House, you seek the company of people who have some degree of spirituality, and who are driven by a vocation or an ideal. It is probable that you let yourself be guided by ideological, spiritual, or religious groups. This does not exclude utopia. Indeed, your projects sometimes prove unfeasible and fanciful. Nevertheless, with the help of your intuition, you discover new sources of inspiration, and once again, you feel that the members of your entourage are the bearers of unknown truths. Neptune Dominant If Neptune is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Neptunian: your intuition is highly developed. You are of a contemplative nature, and you are particularly receptive to ambiances, places, and people. You gladly cultivate the art of letting-go, and you allow the natural unfolding of events to construct your world. You follow your inspirations, for better or for worse. At times, you display an extraordinary clairvoyance gift. You seem to be able to read your subconscious like a book, and you track down subtle underlying mechanisms, flaws, or open breaches. This innate intuition might explain the strokes of good luck which the Neptunian is sometimes credited with. However, you may also be the victim of illusions and misleading intuitions. You are an idealist, and you let your deepest aspirations prevail over the realities of the moment. Then, you set off in quest of some quixotic objective, living like a Don Quixote who relentlessly pursues an impossible dream. You have a great talent for psychology and the mysteries of the human soul. Since you instinctively perceive people's intents and motivations, as you swim in the complexity of human nature, you feel in your element. The subtlety of your perceptiveness is the source of both special affections and irrevocable rejections. What is the danger of such a dominant? If it is not offset by other influences in your natal chart, you may not have an iron will. Your trump card is your instinct, which may be developed to the extent that it becomes clairvoyance. Interpretation of the 12\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"A man and a woman walk away from a half-destroyed antique column and follow opposite ways.\" (Janduz version) Taciturn, introverted, and inventive character. Although associations are the key to harmonious life, difficulties in expressing one's viewpoints and feelings damage partnerships in general, and marriage in particular. One should tap into one's creativity in order to sort out problems. This degree sometimes describes a misunderstood researcher. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees.

Its element is indefinite; burning (like lava in fusion ?), it rules Scorpio, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the sexual organs and excretion. It represents dictators, sadistic people, violent characters, is instinctive and powerful but also mysterious with hidden strengths. Temperament: rather Bilious Characterology: Emotive or non-Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is a Passionate Choleric type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Pluto. Pluto in Leo The planet Pluto symbolizes deep disruptions and upheavals, domination and sexual instincts, and the inner power we have in ourselves. Pluto destroys in order to reconstruct and he provokes painful crises that are needed in metamorphosis. Pluto is our deepest instincts' brutal force. It is the hidden and unconscious violence that can explode in us with incredible intensity before being projected in our actions; in itself, the planet is not negative: the might and the intensity of its energy are beyond the conceivable but it can be funnelled. Pluto is the only possibility we have at our disposal to overcome our inner blocks and to eliminate outgrown situations that have become inextricable. Pluto's energy is valuable because of its usefulness for the irreversible destruction of what constitutes a problem and not because of its negative side and its perversity. Pluto allows to reconstruct and to regenerate parts of our personality or whole stretches of our life, provided that we manage to funnel his wild energy and to step back. It is impossible to tame this energy, given its essence. However, it is possible to take advantage of it for a precise aim, through a temporary identification of some parts of us with this energy. In such a case, the outcome is our final evolution and even, our transformation. In your natal chart, Pluto's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Pluto is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Pluto in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality and they are not to be really taken into account, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Pluto in Leo may give you an authoritarian and, even, despotic nature. But your charisma and your radiance are intensified. Pluto in House IX With Pluto in the 9th House, the traveller becomes a spy, and the wise man turns into a sceptical philosopher. You are probably not too interested in stiff morals and commonly accepted explanations. You revel in overthrowing great ideals, and you prefer to come up with more personal concepts, even though they may be less clear at times. It is with a distant and criticising look that you analyse your explorations, your travels, and your discoveries, and you do so with a lucidity which borders on indifference. Pluto Dominant If Pluto is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Plutonian: you sometimes feel like a foreigner who does not belong to the world, to its laws, and its concerns. The rules of life in society are not necessarily yours. You are interested in what is unknown and in the subtle laws of a hidden order. So, you take malicious pleasure in ridiculing the patterns you find too simplistic or too rigid. You also revel in underlining the limits of explanations you deem too common. There is something unconventional about the way you are, the way you think, and the way you act. What is your specificity made of? Is it an extraordinary partner? A life off the beaten path? Or do you only distance yourself from conventional morals? In any case, you have the feeling, sometimes quite vague, that you come from nowhere, and that you do not belong to any definite group... In short, it means that you cannot be simplified in order to conform to existing models. The gap between you and ordinary mortals is also an element of your strength. Your deep clear-sightedness, firstly, enables you to put things into perspective and to grant them only the attention they deserve. Your other remarkable asset is your capacity to intervene from behind the scenes, to secretly organise events, and to bring about the desirable outcome without seeming to impose or to dictate anything. However, you must still overcome one of the major difficulties of this dominant, which is to get people to accept your difference and to smoothly fit into your environment. Interpretation of the 12\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A triumphant bull stands on top of a rock, in the crevices of which grow a few blades of grass.\" (Janduz version) Determined, hard-working, and independent character driven high moral standards and unshakable beliefs. Success, fame and wealth are achieved through courageous and persistent work. Occupations related to forest clearing, scientific agriculture, and animal breeding are very favoured. However, entrenched attitudes must be avoided in order not to arouse hatred. If the natal chart points to dishonesty, there is a danger of deceit and poisoning, whether one is the perpetrator or the victim. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Most astrologers consider it as a kind of \"mediator\" between Saturn and outer planets. Consequently, Chiron is of Saturn's nature and at the same time is influenced by Uranus, the first slow-moving planet. Astrologically, it symbolizes wisdom, patience and the faculty to reduce others' sufferings: it is said to be the \"great healer\" of the zodiac. Like all the secondary bodies, it must be in close conjunction with planets or angles in order to fully express its action. %TEXTES_22%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_23% Ceres, the biggest of the four minor asteroids used besides Chiron, is associated with the mythological goddess of growing plants and harvest and also symbolizes physical constitution, vitality and fertility. She's also known as Demeter, according to the astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, linked to the symbolism of the mother but in a less emotive and more physical way than the Moon. Ceres is thought to be the ruler of Virgo, in exaltation in Gemini, in exile in Pisces and in fall in Sagittarius. Keywords associated with Ceres could be order, practical sense, worry, precision, modesty, method, sobriety, motherhood, fertility, the Earth: a kind of a more cerebral Moon... %TEXTES_23%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_24% Pallas is sometimes used in modern Astrology: she represents intelligence, abstract and global thinking talents. It is usually considered to be a determining element in political strategy. %TEXTES_24%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_25% Juno is the asteroid corresponding to the adaptation to the marital partner and to the defence of individual rights; it is thus used in the field of marriage. %TEXTES_25%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_26% Vesta is rarely used and brings the ability to efficiently devote oneself to a cause. %TEXTES_26%\n\nTrue North Node 15\u00b010' \u042f Taurus, in House VII The North Node (True Node here) represents the goals that must be achieved during life, in the karmic sense according to some traditions. Its position in house indicates in what field an effort is necessary in order to evolve. The North Node is often called the Dragon's head, it is usually considered beneficial, a bit like Jupiter with the planets. The Lunar nodes are fictional points and not actual heavenly bodies: they are the intersections of the Moon with the Ecliptic (the path made by the Sun in its orbit as seen from the Earth). The axis of the Lunar nodes moves 19 degrees each year, namely a bit more than three minutes each day. The South Node is diametrically opposed to the North Node, therefore it faces it (it's not drawn here, it's the same symbol but upside down). It symbolizes what has already been achieved or acquired, in a karmic sense: it's the past from which it's advised to move on in order to progress. The South Node is rather negative, of a Saturnian nature: the experience through suffering. Interpretation of the 15\u00b0 Taurus symbolic degree \"Two white cows in the jungle do not see the tiger which is ready to pounce on them. Nearby, a woman assembles the two roses she just plucked from a rosebush, a white one and a black one.\" (Janduz version) Refined, pleasant, and thoughtful character. One is blessed with many financial profits and happiness in love in the first part of life. It is necessary to be very careful because unexpected events or unsuspected enemies may be the cause of ruin and sorrow. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nTrue Lilith 24\u00b023' Aquarius, in House III Lilith or the Dark Moon (True Lilith here) represents the uncrossable threshold, taboos, the individual's provocative and fascinating side, including on a sexual level. She symbolizes violence and \"untameability\", the radical and deep-seated refusal to submit. The keywords for Lilith can be sterility, sadism, perversity, castration, sadomasochism, eroticism, orgasm, forbidden fantasies, marginality, cruelty; redemption, illumination, rebelliousness... Lilith's opposite point is called Priapus; it is the Lunar perigee, the position where the Moon is closest to the Earth. It symbolizes man's primitive nature, the horror hidden in our deepest self; masochism, extreme sensuality, impulsiveness, irrationality and excess. Physically speaking, the Dark Moon is the focal point unoccupied by the Earth: it is not a concrete body but a mathematical point. Interpretation of the 24\u00b0 Aquarius symbolic degree \"An infuriated man brandishes a dagger. Behind him, there is an austere building with bars on the windows. A hand keeps the main door ajar.\" (Janduz version) Violent, vindictive, and passionate character. One is always ready to unleash one's brutal instincts without discriminating between right and wrong. Therefore, serious troubles are to be expected, including imprisonment or committal. The practice of violent and risky sports, or an occupation in the military if the mental state allows, can provide a helpful outlet to pent-up violence. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nFortune 15\u00b004' Libra, in House XI The Part of Fortune is an ancient concept, used by Ptolemy and other astrologers before him. Firstly, it has nothing to do with fortune! In modern astrology, it is actually used to enhance a planet or angle when in close conjunction with it: it thus amplifies the meaning associated to the point affected by its presence. It is calculated in the following way: Part of Fortune = AS + Moon - Sun (it is the Moons position when the Sun rises) The classical Part of Fortune, of which the calculus method is unchanged whether in a diurnal or nocturnal chart, is usually distinguished from the diurnal/nocturnal Part of Fortune which is calculated by the formula AS + Sun - Moon for a nocturnal chart, and AS + Moon - Sun in a diurnal chart. We currently use the latter formula for our astrological programmes. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Arabian parts. Interpretation of the 15\u00b0 Libra symbolic degree \"A man walks between two women with arms entwined.\" (Janduz version) Cheerful, caring, but frivolous character prone to self-leniency and fickleness. Romance and marriage are most likely to be the sources of setbacks and misfortunes. However, should the natal chart concur, this degree may describe a loving heart and a long-lasting happiness shared with one's soul mate. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\n\n\nAscendant Aspects\n\nVenus opposite Ascendant orb -2\u00b059'\n\nSun sesqui-quadrate Ascendant orb -1\u00b001'\n\nPluto square Ascendant orb -4\u00b038'\n\nUranus sesqui-quadrate Ascendant orb +1\u00b007' Ascendant 8\u00b018' Scorpio The First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others, and also one's health. It corresponds to the way the individual acts in the world. It is the image of the personality seen by others and the person's visible behaviour expressed outwardly. The 1st House is in analogy with Aries and thus Mars too, and then the Sun. It is an angular house, the most important one with the Midheaven, maybe even more so due to its link with the body and health. Ascendant in Scorpio Your psychological nature is bilious with aggressive impulses that spur the transformation of your being and of any situation you are involved in. You are constantly struggling to assert yourself. You cannot refrain from testing others with cutting remarks, not because you want to hurt them, but because you want to know them better through their reaction; life and the feeling of aliveness are experienced through rebellion and tension. Your aggressive attitude may equate with sly inquisition as often, you remain silent, introverted and secretive, mulling over turbulent thoughts in the depths of your mind, leaving others puzzled by your quite strange behaviour.\n\n\n\nWith this Ascendant, you come across as secretive, powerful, dominating, enduring, intuitive, assertive, charismatic, magnetic, wilful, daring, clear-sighted, passionate, creative, independent, vigorous, generous, loyal, hard-working, persevering, indomitable, possessive, shrewd, stubborn, ambitious, instinctive, tenacious, sexual, sexy, proud, intense and competitive. But you may also be aggressive, destructive, stubborn, anxious, tyrannical, perverse, sadistic, violent, self-centered, complex, critical, cruel, nasty, jealous, calculating, vulnerable and dissembling. Interpretation of the 8\u00b0 Scorpio symbolic degree \"In the middle of a forest, a child wearing rags and seated on a tree log stares at a nest and its fledglings fallen on the ground.\" (Janduz version) Compassionate, altruistic, and courageous character. Childhood is clouded by bad luck and the lack of parental affection. Lack of care during the period of body growth may result in frail health. Financial help is available from a female figure. One is not embittered by life ordeals, and in adulthood, one achieves success in non-profit associations or humanitarian work. This degree indicates the possibility to adopt a child.

The Midheaven represents our achievements and goals in the social sphere, our social position in society, and becomes more and more important as we get older. It is in analogy with Capricorn and Saturn. The Tenth House is the most important angular house along with the Ascendant. Midheaven in Leo Honours, fame, glamour, and high-ranking positions are your key-words. Your innate authority enables you to rapidly make your way through the higher spheres of power, arts, or business. If you do not achieve celebrity, you strive to rub shoulders with the upper crust and fit into high-society circles, for you believe that they must naturally acknowledge you.\n\n\n\nThe following professions are most likely to suit you very well: corporate manager, actor of outstanding renown, film director, senior civil servant, ambassador, all positions in the gambling, amusement, or art industry, as well as first-class hotelier, jeweller and all occupations related to the luxury world, fireman, tamer, policeman/woman, or rider. Interpretation of the 25\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A man swims courageously across rough seas towards the shore, on which a triangle is planted with one tip down.\" (Janduz version) Passionate, emotive, and rebellious character endowed with artistic gifts. Hidden forces of all sorts, such as clans, secret societies, or espionage are the sources of numerous torments and hurdles. This degree portends a danger of psychological or financial sinking, as well as physical drowning or asphyxiation. However, should the natal chart concur, one is driven by strong willpower and triumphs over obstacles and dangers coming from water. One steadily and slowly builds a fortune in seafaring activities.

It is in analogy with Taurus and Venus. It is a succedent house, quite important.\n\nHouse III 14\u00b006' Capricorn The Third House is the sphere of social and intellectual apprenticeship, studies, relationships with close people and surroundings, short trips, light-hearted and quick contacts, correspondences. It is in analogy with Gemini and Mercury. It's a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\nHouse IV 25\u00b048' Aquarius The Fourth House also called Immum Coeli is the sphere of inner emotions, family, the father, home and roots, but also the home one creates. It's Home Sweet Home, security and cocoon. It is in analogy with Cancer and the Moon. It's an angular and important house. Interpretation of the 25\u00b0 Aquarius symbolic degree \"A personage surrounded by a halo of light walks towards a blindfolded man who heads for an abyss.\" (Janduz version) Confused, helpless and self-righteous character. Instead of stubbornly repeating the same mistakes, one must seek the advice of more experienced friends who can help avoid dangerous traps and teach the rudiments of one's job. Clear-sightedness is a must, and when one is lost, one must remember that sitting down on the ground protects against injuries in case of fall.

It's a succedent and quite important house.\n\nHouse VI 21\u00b020' Aries The Sixth House is the sphere of apprenticeship and effort in the work environment, daily life, health on a daily basis and not operations or long-term diseases, relationships with co-workers or subordinates, desire for improvement, analysis and detail. It is in analogy with Virgo and Mercury. It is a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\nHouse VII 8\u00b018' Taurus The Seventh House also called the Descendant (in front of the Ascendant) is the sphere of partnership, marriage, contracts, relationships with others, the outer world. It is in analogy with Libra and Venus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It is an angular and important house. Interpretation of the 8\u00b0 Taurus symbolic degree \"A happy and thriving man feeds his cattle and fowls.\" (Janduz version) Quiet, benevolent, and trustworthy character. The family life occupies the first place. One has a large family composed of one's own children, or of some kind of spiritual children. One is surrounded by loving young people who benefit from one's experience and knowledge. Success can be achieved in all occupations related to agriculture and animal husbandry. Life goes through easy paths and leads to a peaceful end. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nHouse VIII 6\u00b020' Gemini The Eighth House is the sphere of emotional security, the depths of the self, secrets and paranormal, transcendence, sexuality, mysteries, upheavals, surgical operations, others' money (investments, inheritances), crises, transformation after evolution, death. It is in analogy with Scorpio and Pluto, and Mars to a lesser extent. It is a succedent and quite important house.\n\nHouse IX 14\u00b006' Cancer The Ninth House is the sphere of high studies, both physical and mental journeys (philosophy, spirituality), rebelliousness, changes of scenery, desire for dealing with the unknown. It is in analogy with Sagittarius and Jupiter. It is a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\nMidheaven 25\u00b048' Leo The Tenth House still called the Midheaven, is the highest point amidst the houses, at the top of the chart, in the South, and relates to destiny in general and career (and not daily work as meant by the Sixth House). The Midheaven represents our achievements and goals in the social sphere, our social position in society, and becomes more and more important as we get older. It is in analogy with Capricorn and Saturn. The Tenth House is the most important angular house along with the Ascendant. Interpretation of the 25\u00b0 Leo symbolic degree \"A man swims courageously across rough seas towards the shore, on which a triangle is planted with one tip down.\" (Janduz version) Passionate, emotive, and rebellious character endowed with artistic gifts. Hidden forces of all sorts, such as clans, secret societies, or espionage are the sources of numerous torments and hurdles. This degree portends a danger of psychological or financial sinking, as well as physical drowning or asphyxiation. However, should the natal chart concur, one is driven by strong willpower and triumphs over obstacles and dangers coming from water. One steadily and slowly builds a fortune in seafaring activities. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nHouse XI 28\u00b015' Virgo The Eleventh House is the sphere of friendship and protection, projects, search for social acceptance and security, collective and humanitarian actions. It is in analogy with Aquarius and Uranus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It's a succedent and quite important house.\n\nHouse XII 21\u00b020' Libra The Twelfth House is the sphere of hidden things, enemies, closed or remote places (hospital, prison, convent etc.), ordeals, secrecy, solitude, long-term illnesses but also sincere devotion and genuine compassion. It is in analogy with Pisces and Neptune.\n\nVertex 15\u00b041' Gemini, in House VIII The Vertex, sometimes called counter-Ascendant, is a fictitious point which is at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the West of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the West of the chart around the Descendant. It is the chart's fifth angle, so to speak, less important than the other angles. Its interpretation is controversial, because certain astrologers pay no attention to it. The Vertex is sometimes considered to be the second Descendant because, like the latter, it is related to communication and exchanges. It has to do with associations and fated encounters, those that are not chosen, and reveals the type of sensitivity and reactivity we have in our dealings with other people: a refined and tolerant way in Libra, straightforward and spontaneous in Aries, etc. Interpretation of the 15\u00b0 Gemini symbolic degree \"In a forest, a woman carries a bunch of wood on her back. She seems to look for something on the ground and does not notice the two-headed man who follows her.\" (Janduz version) Inventive, fickle, and restless character. One is often overwhelmed by the constant stream of ideas which, as good as they are, need be sorted out, lest they are not appreciated at their real value. This would be a pity because this degree brings good luck and promises fame, wealth and happiness. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nEast Point 0\u00b014' Sagittarius, in House I The East Point is a fictitious point at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the East of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the East of the chart, around the Ascendant. The East Point is sometimes considered to be a second Ascendant, less important, but also related to how one is seen by other people, and to how one expresses one's personality. Interpretation of the 0\u00b0 Sagittarius symbolic degree \"By the roadside, a young man reclining on a heap of stones plays with a compass.\" (Janduz version) Simple, independent and fanciful character endowed with high intellectual capacities. One should focus on one's professional pursuit, which has every chance to be successful in law, religion, or mathematics. One must not listen to friends who urge to leave the path of serious work and indulge in idleness. This would be very detrimental to one's career, and after numerous setbacks, would lead to dire poverty. This degree sometimes indicates some family secret or a birth out of wedlock. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_46% Cupido is a hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet, the existence of which is not proven.

Member of the All Party Internet Group. He is Vice Chair of the Libraries and Information Management All-Party Parliamentary Group.\n\nIssues\n\nSigned an Early Day Motion in 2002 Prevention of fraud in electronic voting systems\n\nThat this House believes that no electronic system of voting should be introduced into any British election unless it is accompanied by a verifiable paper trail for every vote cast, which if needs be can be used to address any concerns that may be raised that such electronic systems are faulty, defective or used fraudulently.\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 263 Identity Cards 06 June 2005\n\nThat this House believes that a convincing case for the introduction of compulsory biometric identity cards and a national database has not been made, that the risks involved far outweigh any discernible benefit, that the introduction of identity cards will fundamentally change the relationship between the citizen and the state, diminish personal privacy and threaten civil liberties, that the present proposals do not provide properly costed, proportionate or effective solutions to the problems they are claimed to solve; and calls upon the Government to shelve plans for their introduction.\n\nSigned an Early Day Motion Freedom of Expression and the UN Internet Governance Forum 30 October 2006\n\nThat this House notes with concern that internet repression is hampering freedom of expression across the world especially in Iran, Vietnam, the Maldives and China; urges companies in China, including Microsoft, Google and Yahoo, to reveal which words they have banned from blogs or have filtered out of web searches; requests that they make public all their agreements with the Chinese authorities and publicly call for the release of cyber-dissidents jailed for expressing peaceful opinions online; welcomes Amnesty International's irrepressible.info campaign to ensure that the internet remains a tool for political freedom, not repression; and urges the UK Government to make strong representations at the UN Internet Governance Forum in Athens in November to ensure that the internet remains a tool for the free flow of information and respect for human rights and that freedom of expression is a key component to any future agreement on internet governance.\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 446 Contactpoint 29 November 2007\n\nThat this House notes the announcement by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families of the deferral of the implementation of ContactPoint to allow for an independent assessment of its security procedures by Deloitte and to address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have suggested, but regrets that this review will not extend to the design and content of ContactPoint; expresses concern over the safety implications of such a vast database containing potentially sensitive information in the light of security breaches at HM Revenue and Customs; further expresses concerns about the projected costs of ContactPoint; notes the conclusion of the House of Lords Select Committee on Merits of Statutory Instruments that the Government has not conclusively demonstrated that a universal database is a proportionate response to the problem being addressed; and therefore calls upon the Government to reconsider its decision to proceed.\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 845 Freedom of Information 06 Febuary 2007\n\nThat this House expresses concern that the proposed new fees regulations under the Freedom of Information Act would allow authorities to refuse on cost grounds a high proportion of requests which they are currently required to answer; notes that the Government's consultation document recognises that this will have a greater impact on journalists, hon. Members, campaign groups and researchers than on private individuals; considers that such changes would undermine the Act's contribution to increased discussion of public affairs, accountability and trust in the work of public authorities; and calls on the Government not to proceed with the proposals.\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 2699 Freedom of Information 10 December 2006\n\nThat this House welcomes the finding of the Constitutional Affairs Committee (HC991) that the Freedom of Information Act has `already brought about the release of significant new information and....this information is being used in a constructive and positive way' and the committee's conclusion that it sees `no need to change' the Act's charging arrangements; views with concern reports that the Government is considering changing these arrangements to permit an application fee to be charged for all requests or to allow authorities to refuse, on cost grounds, a significant proportion of requests which they currently must answer; and considers that such changes could undermine the Act's benefits of increased openness, accountability and trust in the work of public authorities.\n\nDatabase State\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 210 Data Intrusion 21 November 2006\n\nThat this House notes with concern the increasing incidence of data intrusion or data rape, as it is increasingly becoming known, the process whereby personal and hitherto confidential data is transferred to central databases established by the Government which can then be made available to third parties, such as police and security services, without consent being required; notes that the operation of the new national medical database will require medical records, which until now have remained in the confidential custody of general practitioner practices, to be uploaded to the Spine, a computer which will collect details from doctors and hospitals; supports the British Medical Association in its demand that patients should be asked for their explicit permission before their files are transferred; further notes with concern the reports of plans to establish and expand national databases in relation to the identity card scheme, DNA and the national census; and calls on the Government to establish a legislative framework which will safeguard access to personal data which has as its foundation not only the requirement for explicit consent but the right to know which agencies have a right to, and have requested access to, personal information.\n\nAlso see NHS, Identity cards and DNA database.\n\nOpen Source Software\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 179 Software in Schools 21 November 2006\n\nThat this House congratulates the Open University and other schools, colleges and universities for utilising free and open source software to deliver cost-effective educational benefit not just for their own institutions but also the wider community; and expresses concern that Becta and the Department for Education and Skills, through the use of outdated purchasing frameworks, are effectively denying schools the option of benefiting from both free and open source software and the value and experience small and medium ICT companies could bring to the schools market.\n\nSpam\n\nSigned the Early Day Motion Spam E-Mails 16 November 2003\n\nThat this House commends the House of Commons Library Standard note on Unsolicited Electronic Mail (SN/SC/1280); notes that according to computer experts the amount of spam increased from 3.2 per cent. of total communication in 2002 to an astonishing 55 per cent. in March 2003 and that 90 per cent. of spam, most of which is p ornographic in content, can be identified as emanating from 150 sources, 40 of which are located in Florida; believes that the electronic mail system is likely to collapse if the volume of spam is not reduced; commends the EU for introducing legislative measures that should stifle the operations of bulk commercial e-mailers by the end of this year by ensuring that only those opting in would receive spam messages; regrets that this legislation will not cover spam originating from the US and other off shore distribution points; expresses its concern at the Bush Administration's plans to offer only an opt out option for those wishing to block unsolicited mail; calls on the US Administration to adopt legislation based on the EU model; and calls on the Government to make urgent representations on behalf of its 20 million citizens now on-line.\n\nComputer Games\n\nSigned Early Day Motion 61 Epilepsy and screen-based electronic games 6 November 2007\n\nThat this House recognises that photosensitive epileptic seizures can be triggered by screen-based electronic games; notes with concern that there is no legal duty on computer game publishers to test their products before publication to make sure they do not trigger a seizure; further notes with concern that there is no legal requirement for computer game publishers to offer warnings that their products could trigger a seizure; and calls upon the Government to consider making it a legal requirement for computer game publishers to test their products before publication and to remove scenes that could potentially trigger a photosensitive epileptic seizure."}]}
