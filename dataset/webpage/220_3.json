Torres talks about that in-depth for the first time in a documentary that airs on the SEC Network on Monday called \u201cOnce Upon A Comeback.\u201d\n\nAs a swimmer at the University of Florida during the \u201880s, Torres says she faced pressure from coaches, particularly Randy Reese, to lose weight. At the time, the coaches didn\u2019t know a lot about eating disorders, she says.\n\nOne coach wanted the team to look intimidating to competitors on the starting blocks and set a weight goal for the swimmers to meet, she says. If someone didn\u2019t make weight, they had to do extra workouts.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, having come from a background where I've never trained like that before in my life, to have to do extra workouts was just, that wasn't going to happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd one thing led to another. I sort of got in this habit of bingeing and purging in my freshman year, and that's kind of how it all started and just sort of snowballed from there.\u201d\n\nThe coaches weighed the girls right on the pool deck, as Torres describes in the film, and sometimes the swimmers would break down in tears if they didn't make weight. The intense pressure to make weight came from an inner desire to please her coaches, she says.\n\nThe cycle of bingeing and purging took over Torres\u2019 life and psyche \u2014 but now she views the difficult experience as a lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a very dark time in my life and I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yet I learned a lot from it and it made me the person who I am today.\u201d\n\nTorres says she tried talking to a male team doctor at the university about her struggles, but the conversation ended with him handing her information on eating disorders.\n\nAfter she graduated college, she went to get a physical and the doctor asked her if she\u2019s ever binged and purged. Torres said no, but later called the doctor back and admitted she had a problem.\n\nThe first step to recovery was opening up about her disorder, she says. Her advice to people struggling with eating disorders is to talk about it.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a lot of work to do after that but it was a huge relief to get it off my shoulders after four years of only me knowing that I had this issue,\u201d she says.\n\nTorres swam in the Olympics in Seoul in 1988, Barcelona in 1992, Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008. When the time to train for Beijing arrived, Torres was pregnant, in her 40s and swimming for exercise.\n\nShe says she received invitations to swim in a few meets, and then people started to ask, \u201cWouldn't it be great to see a middle-aged person in the Olympic Games?\u201d Since she loves a challenge, Torres decided to go for gold once again.\n\nThe swimmer ended up winning three silver medals in Beijing. As she trained, Torres kept the goal of winning a gold medal in her head.\n\n\u201cI kept that thought with me every single day for the almost two years after that I trained for the Olympic trials and Olympic Games,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really think the power of positive thinking can play a role in what you do in your life.\u201d\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how she started swimming\n\n\u201cWell, I have four older brothers, and I was very competitive the minute I was born. It's like, who could be the first one in the car? Who could be the first one done at the dinner table? Just always competing with them. Whatever they would do, I would do. So the minute they started on a swim team, my mom had me in the stands. That didn't go very well because I had a lot of energy. And I think back then they called it hyperactivity, but I'm sure I had ADD. And she put me in the pool just to get the energy out and not have it all around her and just focus it somewhere. So I started swimming and just fell in love with the sport.\u201d\n\nOn whether swimming came easy to her\n\n\u201cIt really did. I really could just get up on the starting blocks and do the start into the water and swim fast and no big deal. And I think that all changed when I started to notice changes in my body, started to become more of a woman, and realized that I actually have to work hard to be fast. It just doesn't come easy anymore. \u201c\n\nOn if she left the sport satisfied after she didn\u2019t qualify for a sixth Olympic team in 2012\n\n\u201cI really did. It's funny because when I got out of the pool after those Olympic trials and I missed the team by nine one-hundredths of a second, I looked in the stands. I saw my daughter crying and I saw my mom crying. I'm like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to go over and console them.\u2019 And, you know, my mom, obviously, she was upset because she's my mom and she wanted to see me make another Olympic team, but my daughter, I'm like, \u2018Tessa, What's wrong? Are you OK?\u2019 She's like, \u2018Now I don't get to go to London and see Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte.\u2019 I'm like, oh, my gosh, she's starting way too early, you know? So it was kind of funny. It was a little bit of a role reversal of, you know, me having to console my mom. But I was OK. I knew that the time that I did Olympic trials, my sixth Olympic trials, was the second-fastest time I've ever done at trials. But the girls are getting faster and I couldn't give it anything else. I gave it all I had.\u201d\n\nOn what she tells her daughter about body image and her experience with eating disorders\n\n\u201cI continuously tell her how beautiful she is on the inside and out and not to base everything off of food. And just to make sure that when you want to eat stuff that, you know, you're maybe not supposed to have, eat it in smaller portions and you'll be fine.\u201d\n\nAlex Ashlock produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Todd Mundt.

As of 2014, she is also the most decorated Jewish Olympian in history.\n\nTorres (born April 15, 1967) was born in Beverly Hills, California and she grew up in Los Angeles as with five siblings. Her father, Edward Torres, was Jewish, and Torres herself converted to Judaism before marrying her second husband. At age 7, Torres started following her brothers to swim practice at the local YMCA and later joined the Culver City swim team. She later attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School) swimming under coach Darlene Bible, where she set CIF records that still remain to this day.\n\nStill in high school, Torres won a spot in her first Olympics - the 1984 Los Angeles Games - where she was a member of the winning U.S. women's 4x100-meter relay team, earning a gold medal for swimming in the first-round qualifying heat as well the event final.\n\nTwo years later, she accepted a scholarship to attend the University of Florida. Torres would swim for the Gators for four years, winning three NCAA individual national championships (50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly), was a member of six NCAA championship relay teams, and received 28 All-American honors.\n\nShe would continue to swim in the Olympics for Team USA, competing and medaling in events at the 1988 Seoul Games and the 1992 Barcelona Games. In 2000, Torres made her first comeback to the US Team, at 33 years old she was the eldest member of the swim team, and won five medals - two gold and two silver - at the Sydney Games. Torres is featured in the book Gold in the Water by P.H. Mullen, which describes her comeback for the 2000 Olympics under coaches Richard Quick and Dick Jochums.\n\nIn 2005, Torres was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOn August 1, 2007, at the age of 40 (just 15 months after giving birth to her first child), she won gold in the 100 meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis, her 14th win at the event. She then followed that up on August 4 by twice breaking her own American record in the 50 m freestyle, 26 years after she first set the American record at just 15 years old.\n\nAt age 41, Dara Torres returned to the pool to obtain a spot in her fifth Olympic games - the 2008 Beijing Games - an unprecedented accomplishment for an American female swimmer. Qualifying for the Games, Torres became the oldest swimmer in American Olympic history and also the first female in history to swim in the Olympics past age 40. Torres won a silver medal in Beijing as the anchor swimmer of the U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay. This was the fifth time in five tries she has earned an Olympic medal in that event.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Shalom Life; International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame; Jewish Journal"}, {"url": "https://www.jou.ufl.edu/2018/09/06/alumni-dara-torres-still-at-the-top-of-her-game/", "page_content": "By Lenore Devore, B.S. Journalism 1984\n\nClad in stylishly torn white jeans, a yellow T-shirt and blue flip flops, Dara Torres, B.S. Telecommunication 1990, runs onto the football field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and promptly does eight pushups, then quiets the crowd. Putting down the orange-and-blue 2-Bits sign, the 12-time Olympic swimming medalist uses her toned arms to point to one side of the massive crowd, then the other, as the honorary Ms. Two Bits for the October 2017 Texas A&M game.\n\nIt was one of her favorite moments at the University of Florida, Torres says. \u201cI got to show my family UF, reminisce and get all nostalgic.\u201d\n\nTorres\u2019 swimming career was nothing short of incredible. While at UF, she earned 28 NCAA All-American swimming awards, the most possible, and was named NCAA Swimmer of the Year and Southeastern Conference\u2019s Athlete of the Year (both in 1988). As an Olympian, Torres won twelve Olympic medals (four gold, four silver, four bronze), tying two other swimmers for the most Olympic women\u2019s swimming medals, and is a former world record-holder in three events. She is the first swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008) and one of a handful of Olympians who won a medal at five games. And, at age 41, she was the oldest swimmer to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team.\n\nTorres recalled back in 1986 how crazy it all seemed during her first Saturday morning swimming practice on the day of a home football game.\n\n\u201cI grew up in California, Los Angeles, and you just aren\u2019t fazed by the colleges there \u2014 there are so many,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget \u2026 after one of my first morning workouts about 5:30, I couldn\u2019t believe it when I walked out \u2026 I was blown away that by the time we got out at 8, I was bombarded by people in orange and blue, with their faces painted. What are these crazy people doing? It was my first eye-opening experience.\u201d\n\nSo weird, she says she thought at the time. \u201cIt was a great atmosphere to be in. The whole entire town was cheering on the Gators. It took me a little while to go to a game, but I did after three or four games. Then I thought: This is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nNow 51, the married mother of 12-year-old Tessa Grace says majoring in telecommunication at the College of Journalism and Communications (UFCJC) prepared her for a job in television and beyond.\n\nShe chose to study at UF because other colleges didn\u2019t have the hands-on program that UFCJC did, she says. \u201cIt was one of the reasons I chose UF. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of being able to direct and produce and do other kind of fun stuff, behind the scenes. It wasn\u2019t just get out a book. We did really cool stuff. To work at the TV station and get that experience that you need was critical because once that little red light goes on, it\u2019s a much different story.\n\n\u201cIt prepared me for life after college.\u201d\n\nTorres says she\u2019s \u201chad so many great gigs,\u201d including her work on a hockey show, a golf show for the Resort Sports Network and more. But don\u2019t label her a color commentator \u2014 something she admits to not being very good at. \u201cI branched out and have done lots of other things. I will say that I enjoyed the whole experience of doing what I loved to do. I was very blessed and honored.\u201d\n\nBeyond TV, Torres has been a model and businesswoman, raised money for cancer research and written two best-selling books: \u201cAge is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life,\u201d a memoir published in April 2009, and \u201cGold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program,\u201d published a year later.\n\nL ooking young and acting young \u2014 through exercise \u2014 are big parts of her life. \u201cI\u2019ve always stayed in shape. I love working out, the way it makes you feel, the way it makes you look,\u201d she says. Even though she just moved back to Parkland, Florida, from Massachusetts, she\u2019ll travel to her Barre Studio up North every four to six weeks to keep her certification as a barre instructor.\n\nShe\u2019s also a spokeswoman for a couple of companies; co-hosts an all-female sports talk show on CBS Sports, \u201cWe Need to Talk\u201d; and does guest appearances as a motivational speaker on topics such as women\u2019s empowerment, never giving up on your dreams and being an Olympian.\n\nToday, she would tell CJC students to take advantage of every opportunity they can to get experience.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to get a job in NBC sports and in the CNN PR department, and then it was a non-paying job,\u201d Torres said. \u201cBut if you get an opportunity to do something, to get the experience, take it. That experience may never come up again. I started as a runner, an intern. There\u2019s a lot of grunt work you have to do, then work your way up.\u201d\n\nShe also feels fortunate to have spent time at UF when Bill Arnsparger was athletic director. \u201cHe was awesome,\u201d she says of the former Miami Dolphins\u2019 defensive coordinator who died in 2015. \u201cHe and his wife sort of became my family away from home. He was very humble. So humble. They were just very sweet.\u201d\n\nHer status as an Olympian is \u201cvery hard to describe,\u201d she says, searching for words. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know what you go through to be the best you can be. Sometimes when they broadcast the Olympics they show something about going to morning practices, the up-close-and personal. What people don\u2019t understand is it\u2019s a lot of hard work. You spent your whole life training for this. For me, it was 24 seconds. The biggest event in the world that happens every four years, and the best athletes in the world go to it. You will never be in a competition at a higher level than the Olympic games. It\u2019s an indescribably amazing experience. You have to take it all in. Before you know it, it\u2019s all gone. It takes you forever and then it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nWill we see her on TV at the 2020 summer Olympic games? She won\u2019t do color commentary, but she wouldn\u2019t mind putting her UF degree to work interviewing swimmers.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s back to UF. It \u201cis an amazing school, amazing campus, amazing community. It\u2019s a big school, but it ends up being a small community once you are there.\u201d\n\nPosted: September 6, 2018\n\nCategory: Alumni Profiles, Profiles, Sports\n\nTagged as: Dara Torres, olympics"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/China/story?id=5601905&page=1", "page_content": "BEIJING, Aug. 18, 2008 \u2014 -- Dara Torres, who at 41 is the oldest American swimmer to ever compete in the Olympics, snagged three silver medals in Beijing.\n\nBut Torres, who began swimming when she was 7 years old, admits it was tough missing out on getting her first individual gold medal. In one race, the 50 meter freestyle, she came in second by a mere one hundredth of a second.\n\n\"I spoke to my coach Michael on the phone, and I said, I don't know I did wrong, why I lost by a hundredth of a second,\" Torres said in a one-on-one interview with ABC News' David Muir.\n\n\"He said, 'Dear, I watched the race over and over again.

She is the only American swimmer to have competed in five Olympics (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008). When she competed in her first Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984, the thought of swimming in an Olympics 24 years later was beyond her imagination.\n\n\"I didn't even think I'd be in the next Olympics ... in 1988,\" Torres told ABC News.\n\nTwelve Olympic medals later at the age of 41, Torres returned to the pool to win a spot in her fifth Olympic Games, unprecedented for an American female swimmer, especially since she did not compete in the 1996 and 2004 Olympic Games.\n\nDara Torres: Olympic Success and Mother\n\nIn Beijing, Torres has defied expectations with her success. But for Torres, her record-breaking combination of age and athleticism is nothing new. The Beijing Olympic Games are not the first time she has been the oldest American swimmer. In the 2000 Sydney Games, Torres was the oldest member of the U.S. swim team at 33. But that didn't stop her from bringing home five medals, including two golds.\n\nEven members of her own family are surprised by her long-lasting athletic prowess. When Torres first began making her comeback, her mother couldn't believe she was back in the pool.\n\n\"I am sure she can't believe she had another Olympic Games again,\" Torres said. But it was her mother, after all, who brought her to the pool at age 7 to learn how to swim.\n\nLike Mother, Like Daughter?\n\nWhen Torres returns home to California, she'll resume the same role her mother played more than three decades ago. Torres is taking her daughter to school -- and to the pool.\n\nDara hopes one day her Olympic experience -- and her passion for the pool -- will make her daughter proud. \"You don't put an age on the dreams.

It was at that point that Torres decided to retire.\n\nFor the next seven years, Torres found employment and popularity as a TV presenter and also tried her hand at modelling. The urge to compete returned, however, with the swimmer coming out of retirement at the age of 33, her eyes set firmly on Sydney 2000.\n\nIn August that year she made a triumphant comeback at the US trials in Indianapolis, earning selection for the Games in the 50m and 100m freestyle events, the 100m butterfly and the 4x100m freestyle and medley relay teams. Not even Torres, however, could have imagined how well her trip Down Under would go.\n\nWorld records and medals galore\n\nHer first event at Sydney 2000 was the 4x100m freestyle, held on the very first day of the swimming competition.\n\nTaking over from Amy Van Dyken on the second leg, Torres swam an ultra-fast 53.51, with team-mates Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson maintaining the pace as the USA quartet stopped the clock in a world-record time of 3:36.61, a full 1.3 seconds faster than the previous best set by China in 1994. The Netherlands finished 3.22 seconds off the pace to win silver with a new European record.\n\nThe following day, Torres won her first ever individual Olympic medal, claiming bronze in the 100m butterfly final behind Dutch star 58.20 Inge de Bruijn, whose winning time of 56.61, was a new world record. Four days later, De Bruijn again touched home first in the 100m freestyle, with Torres on the podium below her, this time sharing the third step with her compatriot Thompson, who matched her time of 54.63.\n\nThe best was yet to come for the returning Torres, who enjoyed a final day to remember in the Olympic pool. She kicked off by posting a new American record of 24.63 in the 50m freestyle, a time good enough for yet another bronze behind the all-conquering De Bruijn.\n\nTorres was back in the water a few moments later for the 4x100m medley final, swimming the final freestyle leg after Barbara Bedford (backstroke), Megan Quann (breaststroke) and Thompson (butterfly) had given her a comfortable lead. She held on to it in style with a time of 53.37, as the US four shaved more than three seconds off the existing world record to win gold in 3:58.30, ahead of Australia and Japan.\n\nIn completing a haul of two gold medals and three bronzes, After departing Sydney 2000 as the Games\u2019 oldest and most prolific female medal winner in the swimming competitions, Torres decided to retire once more.\n\n\u00a9Getty Images\n\nSo near yet so far\n\nTorres resumed her media career before giving birth to a daughter in 2006 and then going back into training again.

In her four years as a Gator swimmer, Torres won nine Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships and nine NCAA championships, including the 400-meter freestyle relay in 1986; the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter medley relay, 400-meter medley relay and 400-meter freestyle relay in 1988; and the 200-meter medley relay and 400-meter medley relay in 1989. At Florida, she was named the SEC Athlete of the Year in 1988, and earned twenty-eight All-American swimming honors\u2014the maximum number possible during a college career.\n\nTorres graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1990, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 1999.\n\nOlympic career\n\n1984 Summer Olympics\n\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, Torres was a member of the winning U.S. women's 4x100-meter relay team, earning a gold medal for swimming in the first-round qualifying heat as well the event final. Her winning teammates in the final event included Nancy Hogshead, Jenna Johnson and Carrie Steinseifer; Jill Sterkel and Mary Wayte also swam in the event's second-round qualifying heat.\n\n1988 Summer Olympics\n\nFor the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, Torres qualified for the U.S. women's team in one individual event and two relay events. Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women's team in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay final together with Mitzi Kremer, Laura Walker and Mary Wayte; and won a silver medal for swimming the freestyle leg of the 4x100-meter medley relay in the third heat of the qualifying round for the second-place U.S. team. Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.\n\n1992 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She swam the second leg of the 4x100-meter freestyle relay for the winning U.S. team that included Nicole Haislett, Angel Martino and Jenny Thompson, and earned a gold medal for her efforts in the final event and first-round qualifying heat. Ashley Tappin and Chrissy Ahmann also swam for the team in the qualifying heats of the event.\n\n2000 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but, as usual, saved her best for two of the major relay events of the U.S. Olympic women's team. She swam the second leg for the winning U.S. women's team in final of the 4x100-meter freestyle team that included Amy Van Dyken, Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson, with Erin Phenix and Ashley Tappin also swimming in the qualifying rounds. Torres won a second gold medal for anchoring the winning U.S. team in the 4x100-meter medley relay, together with teammates B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann and Jenny Thompson in the final, and Courtney Shealy, Staciana Stitts, Ashley Tappin and Amy Van Dyken in the qualifying rounds. Torres also earned three individual bronze medals in each of the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle\u2014tying teammate Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event. At 33 years old, Torres was already the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (5) than any other team member.\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\n\nAt age 41, Torres returned to the pool to obtain a spot in her fifth Olympic Games, unprecedented for an American female swimmer, especially given the fact that she sat out the 1996 and 2004 Olympic games. In fact, she is the first woman in history to swim in the Olympics past the age of 40. Her Olympic career spans twenty-four years.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, she qualified for the finals in the 50-meter freestyle that were held on July 6. In that semi-final, she broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds. On July 6, in the finals she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the 50-meter freestyle. On July 7, Torres confirmed that she would be pulling out of 100-meter freestyle swim for her time at the Beijing Olympics to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle. Lacey Nymeyer took over the position from Torres. On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, together with Amanda Beard and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.\n\nIn order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for an enhanced drug-testing program. According to her, when people ask if she is on performance-enhancing drugs, she takes it as a compliment. Torres uses resistance stretching with trainers Anne Tierney and Steve Sierra from Innovative Body Solutions and refers to this training as her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.\n\nTorres won silver on August 10, 2008, at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing as the anchor swimmer of the U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay. This was the fifth time in five tries she has earned an Olympic medal in that event.\n\nOn August 17, 2008, at the age of 41 years and 125 days, she won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07, 0.01 of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. About thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal as part of the U.S. 4x100-meter medley relay team. Torres' split on the 4x100 medley relay (52.27) is the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time a full second faster\u2014fast even for a relay split.\n\nTorres' twelve Olympic medals tie the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer with fellow American Jenny Thompson. Eight of Thompson's medals were gold, compared with Torres' four. However, Torres has won twice as many individual medals (4) as Thompson (2), Thompson having won ten medals in relay team events.\n\n2009 National and World Championships\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle and placed in the 50-met butterfly to qualify to swim at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Italy. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.\n\n2012 Summer Olympics\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, Torres stated in September 2010 that she had begun training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTorres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks such as NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN and Fox News Channel. She now hosts the golf show The Clubhouse, on the Resort Sports Network. She is also an occasional model, having appeared in the Sports Illustrated 1994 Swimsuit Issue. In 2005, she was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen. Her second marriage was also brief from June 2003 to December 2004, to Israeli-born surgeon Itzhak Shasha. Prior to marrying Shasha, Torres officially converted to Judaism (her late father was Jewish) to formalise her status under Halacha.\n\nTorres is no longer dating her reproductive endocrinologist, David Hoffman, but the two remain close friends. Hoffman was the fertility doctor who treated Torres. When Torres and Shasha separated, Torres and Hoffman began dating. Torres and Hoffman are the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in April 2006.\n\nBP Products North America engaged Torres in 2009 to be part of its \"Team Invigorate\" advertising campaign to inspire others to live \"younger for longer.\" She is the author of the inspirational memoir, Age is Just a Number, published in April 2009, and Gold Medal Fitness, published in May 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, The New York Times reported that a sports medicine doctor, Anthony Galea, with whom Torres had previously consulted, was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly distributing human growth hormone and the drug Actovegin to professional athletes. Torres said that Dr. Galea's work was limited to draining fluid from her knee and diagnosing a muscle tear.\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research, in which she has participated for several years.\n\nSee also\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nList of notable Jewish swimmers\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n\nList of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n\nList of United States records in swimming\n\nList of University of Florida alumni\n\nList of University of Florida Olympians\n\nWorld record progression 50 metres freestyle\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nTorres, Dara, & Elizabeth Weil, Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life , Broadway Books, New York, New York (2009).

At the age of seven, she followed her brothers to swim practice at the local YMCA. During her junior year of high school, Torres moved to Mission Viejo, CA, to train with Hall of Fame Coach Mark Schubert, and in 1983 she broke the world record in the 50-meter freestyle. The next year, while not yet a senior in high school, she won her first Olympic gold medal as a member of the USA\u2019s 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay team.\n\nSwimming for Randy Reece at the University of Florida, Torres earned 28 NCAA All-American swimming awards and at the 1988 Olympic Games, she won two silver medals swimming on relays. She finished her collegiate athletic career playing volleyball and took two years off before returning to win her second Olympic relay gold medal in Barcelona, Spain during the summer of 1992.\n\nAfter 1992, Torres lived what appeared to be a glamorous life. She moved to New York City, worked in television, and as a Wilhelmina model she became the first athlete model in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Then in the spring of 1999, despite not having trained in a pool for seven years, she decided to give the Olympics one more try.\n\nTraining with coach Richard Quick in Palo Alto and Santa Clara, Dara made the Olympic team for the fourth time, at the age of 33. She returned home with five medals, more than any other member of the team, including three in individual events, and retired.\n\nIn 2005, while pregnant with her first child, Dara began swimming three or four times a week at the Coral Springs Aquatic Complex, to keep fit. After giving birth to her daughter, Tessa Grace, in April 2006, she entered two Masters meets and posted times that emboldened her to try another comeback. She asked Coral Springs coach Michael Lohberg if he would coach her, and a little over a year later, she won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis. Three days later, she broke the American record in the 50-meter freestyle for the tenth time \u2013 an amazing 24 years after setting it for the very first time. In 2008, Dara qualified for her fifth Olympic team and at the 2008 Beijing Games, she became the oldest swimmer to compete in the Olympics. Dara returned home with three silver medals, including the heartbreaking 50-meter freestyle race where she missed the gold by 1/100th of a second.\n\nIn 2009, Dara won the ESPY award for \u201cBest Comeback,\u201d was named one of the \u201cTop Female Athletes of the Decade\u201d by Sports Illustrated magazine and became a best selling author with the release of her inspirational memoir, Age is Just a Number.\n\nDara continued swimming after recovering from reconstructive knee surgery and with the encouragement of coach Lohberg, she set her sights on making a record sixth U.S. Olympic swim team. When she just missed making the London Olympics by nine-hundredths of a second in the 50-meter freestyle at the 2012 US Swimming Olympic Trials, she announced her retirement with a smile on her face and her six-year old daughter Tessa in her arms.\n\nOlympian, television personality, fitness guru, Queen of the Comeback, best-selling author and mother.

The seemingly bionic 45-year-old mother who won an individual silver medal at the 2008 Summer Games put up an incredible performance here for the past two days, but it wasn\u2019t quite incredible enough.\n\nAs a \u201creally, really middle-aged woman\u201d \u2014 to use her words \u2014 Torres fell barely short of what would have been an incomprehensible achievement. Having won a total of 12 medals in the 1984, \u201988, \u201992, 2000 and 2008 Summer Games, Torres will watch the London Games from a distance. And she won\u2019t be back for another attempt.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d she said with a smile later, \u201cis really over.\u201d\n\nTorres finished fourth in the 50-meter freestyle final in 24.82 seconds as Jessica Hardy, the 100 freestyle champion, finished first in 24.50 and Kara Lynn Joyce claimed second in 24.73. Christine Magnuson also topped Torres with her finish in 24.78.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but . . . there\u2019s nothing else I could have done,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI think I learned more about mental toughness than I had at any other time in my life. . . . I was prepared either way. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nThe race came on the last night of this eight-day U.S. Olympic team trials in swimming , closing the career of one of the sport\u2019s most influential and inspirational stars during a meet that surely cast off a few new ones.\n\nDuring these trials, Missy Franklin, 17, won four individual events and ensured herself spots on three relay teams, giving her a chance to equal the medal output in London of Michael Phelps \u2014 who announced through his coach Monday he would swim seven, not eight, events in London.\n\nRyan Lochte will seek as many as six gold medals, as other lesser-known standouts such as Hardy pursue their own impressive collection. Four years after being sent home in disgrace from the 2008 Summer Games, Hardy reveled in yet another layer of the redemption and vindication.\n\nWith her victory Monday, Hardy secured a chance to win as many as four medals in London.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy and grateful this meet went as it did,\u201d she said.\n\nHardy, who got banished from the 2008 U.S. Olympic team after testing positive for a substance in a contaminated dietary supplement, started off here with disappointment, finishing third in the 100 breaststroke, her best event and one in which she holds the world record.\n\nTo her surprise, she came back and won the 100 and 50 freestyle, two events in which she has performed well but not excelled internationally. And she won Monday against one of the sport\u2019s largest legends.\n\n\u201cI love racing Dara,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI wish her the best. I wish she could have made it this year. . . . Swimming with her the last couple of years has been a really awesome treat.\u201d\n\nTorres drew roars when she was announced for Monday\u2019s 50 free final. She acknowledged the crowd, then walked to the side of the pool to splash herself with water before taking the blocks.\n\nShe tied for having the slowest reaction time in the field of swimmers, all of whom were at least 19 years younger than she. She surfaced relatively quickly because she can\u2019t do the powerful underwater dolphin kick that most other swimmers rely on because of a surgically repaired knee.\n\nYet she was in the thick of it throughout, getting outpaced over the final meters.\n\nShe confessed it took a couple of seconds to digest the result, because she had to squint to read the scoreboard hanging above the pool. She smiled and hugged Joyce and Hardy, then climbed out of the pool and into the stands. She grabbed her young daughter Tessa, who buried her head in her mother\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cThis time around is going to be the most special to me,\u201d Torres said. \u201cMentally, it\u2019s been so tough the last couple of years. . . . It\u2019s really special and really rewarding to have gone through that. I learned a great deal about myself.\u201d\n\nShe held Tessa during all of her post-race interviews. She admitted breaking down before the race when thinking about her late coach, Michael Lohberg, who died last year at 60 from a rare blood disorder.\n\nBut she shed no tears after the race. This wasn\u2019t the desired ending, but it was one she was ready to accept.\n\n\u201cGetting fourth at the Olympic trials against girls less than half my age, that\u2019s okay,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good for a 45-year-old.\u201d"}], "Dara Grace Torres won four gold medals in her Olympic career.": [{"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/dara-torres", "page_content": "Biography\n\nDara Torres had the longest successful career of any Olympic swimmer, one which saw her win 12 Olympic medals and four gold medals. Torres began her career in 1984, winning a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay. She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4\u00d7100 free relay in 1992. Tall and strikingly attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue. She also achieved notice as a commercial spokeswoman on an infomercial for a fitness training method. But in late 1998, she elected to return to competitive swimming. With little time to prepare, she returned to the Olympic pool at Sydney, and won five medals, including two golds in relays. She won three individual bronze medals at Sydney \u2013 in the 50 free, the 100 free, and the 100 fly.\n\nAgain retiring after the 2000 Olympics, Torres did not compete in Athina.

It was at that point that Torres decided to retire.\n\nFor the next seven years, Torres found employment and popularity as a TV presenter and also tried her hand at modelling. The urge to compete returned, however, with the swimmer coming out of retirement at the age of 33, her eyes set firmly on Sydney 2000.\n\nIn August that year she made a triumphant comeback at the US trials in Indianapolis, earning selection for the Games in the 50m and 100m freestyle events, the 100m butterfly and the 4x100m freestyle and medley relay teams. Not even Torres, however, could have imagined how well her trip Down Under would go.\n\nWorld records and medals galore\n\nHer first event at Sydney 2000 was the 4x100m freestyle, held on the very first day of the swimming competition.\n\nTaking over from Amy Van Dyken on the second leg, Torres swam an ultra-fast 53.51, with team-mates Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson maintaining the pace as the USA quartet stopped the clock in a world-record time of 3:36.61, a full 1.3 seconds faster than the previous best set by China in 1994. The Netherlands finished 3.22 seconds off the pace to win silver with a new European record.\n\nThe following day, Torres won her first ever individual Olympic medal, claiming bronze in the 100m butterfly final behind Dutch star 58.20 Inge de Bruijn, whose winning time of 56.61, was a new world record. Four days later, De Bruijn again touched home first in the 100m freestyle, with Torres on the podium below her, this time sharing the third step with her compatriot Thompson, who matched her time of 54.63.\n\nThe best was yet to come for the returning Torres, who enjoyed a final day to remember in the Olympic pool. She kicked off by posting a new American record of 24.63 in the 50m freestyle, a time good enough for yet another bronze behind the all-conquering De Bruijn.\n\nTorres was back in the water a few moments later for the 4x100m medley final, swimming the final freestyle leg after Barbara Bedford (backstroke), Megan Quann (breaststroke) and Thompson (butterfly) had given her a comfortable lead. She held on to it in style with a time of 53.37, as the US four shaved more than three seconds off the existing world record to win gold in 3:58.30, ahead of Australia and Japan.\n\nIn completing a haul of two gold medals and three bronzes, After departing Sydney 2000 as the Games\u2019 oldest and most prolific female medal winner in the swimming competitions, Torres decided to retire once more.\n\n\u00a9Getty Images\n\nSo near yet so far\n\nTorres resumed her media career before giving birth to a daughter in 2006 and then going back into training again.

American swimmer Dara Torres won 12 career Olympic medals, 4 of which were gold. Her 12 medals tied a record for the most won by a female Olympian from the United States. Celebrated for her longevity in swimming, Torres was the first American swimmer to compete at five Olympic Games. In 2008, at the age of 41, she became the oldest swimming medalist in Olympic history.\n\nTorres was born on April 15, 1967, in Beverly Hills, California. She was Cuban American. When she was growing up, her older brothers swam at their local YMCA, and at age seven she followed them into the sport. A prodigy in the pool, she began setting national age-group records when she was 12 years old. At age 14 she claimed her first senior national title, winning the 50-yard freestyle race at the Senior Short Course Nationals. In 1983 she twice set world records in the long-course 50-meter freestyle event. The following year she lowered the world record once more, to 25.61 seconds, and qualified for her first Olympics. At the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, California, she helped the U.S. 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay team win the gold medal and establish a new American record with a time of 3 minutes, 43.43 seconds.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1985, Torres attended the University of Florida. As a collegiate swimmer she garnered 28 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American honors. She was named the NCAA Swimmer of the Year in 1988. That year she competed at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where she earned a silver medal in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay and a bronze medal in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay. She returned to the Olympics four years later. At the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, she captured gold again in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay. This time Torres and her teammates set a world record in the event, finishing in 3 minutes, 39.46 seconds.\n\nFollowing the Barcelona Games, Torres took a long break from competitive swimming. She worked in television broadcasting for a number of years. In 1999, however, she resumed training, with an eye toward qualifying for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. At the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials she proved that she remained a force, winning the 50-meter freestyle and finishing second behind Jenny Thompson in both the 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. At the Sydney Games, the following month, Torres enjoyed her most successful Olympics, securing five medals. She won gold in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay and the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay. In individual competition she took home the bronze in the 50-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. She also tied Thompson for the bronze in the 100-meter freestyle.\n\nTorres again stepped away from competition after the Sydney Games. She resumed her broadcasting career, and in 2006 she gave birth to a daughter, Tessa. Following her pregnancy she took part in a couple of masters swimming events (for older competitive swimmers). Her impressive performances at those meets convinced her to make a bid for her fifth Olympic Games. At the 2008 Olympic Trials she won the 50-meter freestyle, thus becoming the oldest swimmer ever to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. Torres went on to win three silver medals at the 2008 Games in Beijing, China (50-meter freestyle, 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay, 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay). In addition to becoming the oldest swimmer to medal at an Olympics, Torres moved into a tie with Thompson as the most decorated female American Olympian (their record of 12 career Olympic medals was later equaled by American swimmer Natalie Coughlin).\n\nIn 2012 Torres placed fourth in the 50-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic Trials, coming up short in her attempt to make her sixth Olympic team. She announced her retirement from swimming after the trials.

Torres began her career in 1984, winning a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay. She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4\u00d7100 free relay in 1992. Tall and strikingly attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue. She also achieved notice as a commercial spokeswoman on an infomercial for a fitness training method. But in late 1998, she elected to return to competitive swimming. With little time to prepare, she returned to the Olympic pool at Sydney, and won five medals, including two golds in relays. She won three individual bronze medals at Sydney \u2013 in the 50 free, the 100 free, and the 100 fly.\n\nAgain retiring after the 2000 Olympics, Torres did not compete in Athina. But in 2006 she began training to make another Olympic team and made the US team for Beijing, winning the Olympic Trials in both the 50 and 100 metre freestyle. But she elected to compete in Beijing only in the 50 and the 4\u00d7100 freestyle and medley relays. Aged 41, the oldest ever female Olympic swimmer, Torres won a silver medal in the 50 free, defeated by only 1/100th of a second. She added silver medals in both relays. Torres finished her Olympic career lacking only an individual gold medal. She swam through 2012, but just missed out making the US Olympic team for the London Olympics. Torres won four Olympic medals of each color, one of only three Olympians to have won four or more medals of each type (Takashi Ono of Japan, and Larisa Latynina in gymnastics are the others)."}, {"url": "https://www.ishof.org/honoree/honoree-dara-torres/", "page_content": "Dara Torres (USA) Honor Swimmer (2016)\n\nThe information on this page was written the year of their induction.\n\nFOR THE RECORD: 1984 OLYMPIC GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 1988 OLYMPIC GAMES: silver (4\u00d7100 m medley), bronze (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 1992 OLYMPIC GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 2000 OLYMPIC GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m medley), bronze (50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, 100 m butterfly); 2008 OLYMPIC GAMES: silver (50 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m medley); 1986WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS (LC): silver (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 1987 PAN PACIFIC CHAMPIONSHIPS: gold (100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m medley); 1983 PAN AMERICAN GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); SIX WORLD RECORDS: three individual (50m free), three relays (4x100m free, 4x100m medley)\n\nDara Grace Torres grew up in Beverly Hills, California, where she learned to swim in her family\u2019s backyard pool.

Torres talks about that in-depth for the first time in a documentary that airs on the SEC Network on Monday called \u201cOnce Upon A Comeback.\u201d\n\nAs a swimmer at the University of Florida during the \u201880s, Torres says she faced pressure from coaches, particularly Randy Reese, to lose weight. At the time, the coaches didn\u2019t know a lot about eating disorders, she says.\n\nOne coach wanted the team to look intimidating to competitors on the starting blocks and set a weight goal for the swimmers to meet, she says. If someone didn\u2019t make weight, they had to do extra workouts.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, having come from a background where I've never trained like that before in my life, to have to do extra workouts was just, that wasn't going to happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd one thing led to another. I sort of got in this habit of bingeing and purging in my freshman year, and that's kind of how it all started and just sort of snowballed from there.\u201d\n\nThe coaches weighed the girls right on the pool deck, as Torres describes in the film, and sometimes the swimmers would break down in tears if they didn't make weight. The intense pressure to make weight came from an inner desire to please her coaches, she says.\n\nThe cycle of bingeing and purging took over Torres\u2019 life and psyche \u2014 but now she views the difficult experience as a lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a very dark time in my life and I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yet I learned a lot from it and it made me the person who I am today.\u201d\n\nTorres says she tried talking to a male team doctor at the university about her struggles, but the conversation ended with him handing her information on eating disorders.\n\nAfter she graduated college, she went to get a physical and the doctor asked her if she\u2019s ever binged and purged. Torres said no, but later called the doctor back and admitted she had a problem.\n\nThe first step to recovery was opening up about her disorder, she says. Her advice to people struggling with eating disorders is to talk about it.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a lot of work to do after that but it was a huge relief to get it off my shoulders after four years of only me knowing that I had this issue,\u201d she says.\n\nTorres swam in the Olympics in Seoul in 1988, Barcelona in 1992, Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008. When the time to train for Beijing arrived, Torres was pregnant, in her 40s and swimming for exercise.\n\nShe says she received invitations to swim in a few meets, and then people started to ask, \u201cWouldn't it be great to see a middle-aged person in the Olympic Games?\u201d Since she loves a challenge, Torres decided to go for gold once again.\n\nThe swimmer ended up winning three silver medals in Beijing. As she trained, Torres kept the goal of winning a gold medal in her head.\n\n\u201cI kept that thought with me every single day for the almost two years after that I trained for the Olympic trials and Olympic Games,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really think the power of positive thinking can play a role in what you do in your life.\u201d\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how she started swimming\n\n\u201cWell, I have four older brothers, and I was very competitive the minute I was born. It's like, who could be the first one in the car? Who could be the first one done at the dinner table? Just always competing with them. Whatever they would do, I would do. So the minute they started on a swim team, my mom had me in the stands. That didn't go very well because I had a lot of energy. And I think back then they called it hyperactivity, but I'm sure I had ADD. And she put me in the pool just to get the energy out and not have it all around her and just focus it somewhere. So I started swimming and just fell in love with the sport.\u201d\n\nOn whether swimming came easy to her\n\n\u201cIt really did. I really could just get up on the starting blocks and do the start into the water and swim fast and no big deal. And I think that all changed when I started to notice changes in my body, started to become more of a woman, and realized that I actually have to work hard to be fast. It just doesn't come easy anymore. \u201c\n\nOn if she left the sport satisfied after she didn\u2019t qualify for a sixth Olympic team in 2012\n\n\u201cI really did. It's funny because when I got out of the pool after those Olympic trials and I missed the team by nine one-hundredths of a second, I looked in the stands. I saw my daughter crying and I saw my mom crying. I'm like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to go over and console them.\u2019 And, you know, my mom, obviously, she was upset because she's my mom and she wanted to see me make another Olympic team, but my daughter, I'm like, \u2018Tessa, What's wrong? Are you OK?\u2019 She's like, \u2018Now I don't get to go to London and see Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte.\u2019 I'm like, oh, my gosh, she's starting way too early, you know? So it was kind of funny. It was a little bit of a role reversal of, you know, me having to console my mom. But I was OK. I knew that the time that I did Olympic trials, my sixth Olympic trials, was the second-fastest time I've ever done at trials. But the girls are getting faster and I couldn't give it anything else. I gave it all I had.\u201d\n\nOn what she tells her daughter about body image and her experience with eating disorders\n\n\u201cI continuously tell her how beautiful she is on the inside and out and not to base everything off of food. And just to make sure that when you want to eat stuff that, you know, you're maybe not supposed to have, eat it in smaller portions and you'll be fine.\u201d\n\nAlex Ashlock produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Todd Mundt.

Torres was the first swimmer from the United States to compete in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008), and, at age 41, the oldest swimmer ever to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, she competed in the 50-meter freestyle, 4x100-meter medley relay, and 4x100-meter freestyle relay, and won silver medals in all three events.\n\nTorres has won twelve Olympic medals (four gold, four silver, four bronze), five of which she won in the 2000 Summer Olympics, when at age 33, she was the oldest member of the 2000 U.S. Olympic Swim Team. She has also won at least one medal in each of the five Olympics in which she has competed, making her one of only a handful of Olympians to earn medals in five different Games.\n\nOn August 1, 2007, at age 40 (just 15 months after giving birth to her first child), she won gold in the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis, her 14th national championship. On August 4, she broke her own American record in the 50-meter freestyle, 26 years after she first set the American record at just 15 years old.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nTorres was born in Beverly Hills, California, the daughter of Edward Torres and Marylu Kauder. She grew up in Los Angeles, California, the fifth of six children and the older of two girls. At age 7, Torres started following her brothers to swim practice at the local Y.M.C.A. and later joined the Culver City swim team.\n\nShe attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School), and swam for the Westlake swim team under coach Darlene Bible, where she set California Interscholastic Federation records that remain to this day. As a teenager in the 1980s, she swam for the Mission Viejo Nadadores, in Mission Viejo, California, under coach Mark Schubert, the 2008 Olympic swimming coach.\n\nTorres received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition under coach Randy Reese from 1985 to 1989. In her four years as a Gator swimmer, Torres won nine Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships and nine NCAA championships, including the 400-meter freestyle relay in 1986; the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter medley relay, 400-meter medley relay and 400-meter freestyle relay in 1988; and the 200-meter medley relay and 400-meter medley relay in 1989. At Florida, she was named the SEC Athlete of the Year in 1988, and earned twenty-eight All-American swimming honors\u2014the maximum number possible during a college career.\n\nTorres graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1990, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 1999.\n\nOlympic career\n\n1984 Summer Olympics\n\nAt the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, Torres was a member of the winning U.S. women's 4x100-meter relay team, earning a gold medal for swimming in the first-round qualifying heat as well the event final. Her winning teammates in the final event included Nancy Hogshead, Jenna Johnson and Carrie Steinseifer; Jill Sterkel and Mary Wayte also swam in the event's second-round qualifying heat.\n\n1988 Summer Olympics\n\nFor the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, Torres qualified for the U.S. women's team in one individual event and two relay events. Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women's team in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay final together with Mitzi Kremer, Laura Walker and Mary Wayte; and won a silver medal for swimming the freestyle leg of the 4x100-meter medley relay in the third heat of the qualifying round for the second-place U.S. team. Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.\n\n1992 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She swam the second leg of the 4x100-meter freestyle relay for the winning U.S. team that included Nicole Haislett, Angel Martino and Jenny Thompson, and earned a gold medal for her efforts in the final event and first-round qualifying heat. Ashley Tappin and Chrissy Ahmann also swam for the team in the qualifying heats of the event.\n\n2000 Summer Olympics\n\nTorres won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but, as usual, saved her best for two of the major relay events of the U.S. Olympic women's team. She swam the second leg for the winning U.S. women's team in final of the 4x100-meter freestyle team that included Amy Van Dyken, Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson, with Erin Phenix and Ashley Tappin also swimming in the qualifying rounds. Torres won a second gold medal for anchoring the winning U.S. team in the 4x100-meter medley relay, together with teammates B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann and Jenny Thompson in the final, and Courtney Shealy, Staciana Stitts, Ashley Tappin and Amy Van Dyken in the qualifying rounds. Torres also earned three individual bronze medals in each of the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle\u2014tying teammate Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event. At 33 years old, Torres was already the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (5) than any other team member.\n\n2008 Summer Olympics\n\nAt age 41, Torres returned to the pool to obtain a spot in her fifth Olympic Games, unprecedented for an American female swimmer, especially given the fact that she sat out the 1996 and 2004 Olympic games. In fact, she is the first woman in history to swim in the Olympics past the age of 40. Her Olympic career spans twenty-four years.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, she qualified for the finals in the 50-meter freestyle that were held on July 6. In that semi-final, she broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds. On July 6, in the finals she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the 50-meter freestyle. On July 7, Torres confirmed that she would be pulling out of 100-meter freestyle swim for her time at the Beijing Olympics to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle. Lacey Nymeyer took over the position from Torres. On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, together with Amanda Beard and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.\n\nIn order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for an enhanced drug-testing program. According to her, when people ask if she is on performance-enhancing drugs, she takes it as a compliment. Torres uses resistance stretching with trainers Anne Tierney and Steve Sierra from Innovative Body Solutions and refers to this training as her \"secret weapon\" for continued success.\n\nTorres won silver on August 10, 2008, at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing as the anchor swimmer of the U.S. 4x100-meter freestyle relay. This was the fifth time in five tries she has earned an Olympic medal in that event.\n\nOn August 17, 2008, at the age of 41 years and 125 days, she won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter freestyle, finishing in a new American record time of 24.07, 0.01 of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen. About thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal as part of the U.S. 4x100-meter medley relay team. Torres' split on the 4x100 medley relay (52.27) is the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history. The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time a full second faster\u2014fast even for a relay split.\n\nTorres' twelve Olympic medals tie the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer with fellow American Jenny Thompson. Eight of Thompson's medals were gold, compared with Torres' four. However, Torres has won twice as many individual medals (4) as Thompson (2), Thompson having won ten medals in relay team events.\n\n2009 National and World Championships\n\nAt the U.S. National Championships, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle and placed in the 50-met butterfly to qualify to swim at the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Italy. This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly.\n\n2012 Summer Olympics\n\nFollowing reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, Torres stated in September 2010 that she had begun training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTorres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks such as NBC, ESPN, TNT, OLN and Fox News Channel. She now hosts the golf show The Clubhouse, on the Resort Sports Network. She is also an occasional model, having appeared in the Sports Illustrated 1994 Swimsuit Issue. In 2005, she was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen. Her second marriage was also brief from June 2003 to December 2004, to Israeli-born surgeon Itzhak Shasha. Prior to marrying Shasha, Torres officially converted to Judaism (her late father was Jewish) to formalise her status under Halacha.\n\nTorres is no longer dating her reproductive endocrinologist, David Hoffman, but the two remain close friends. Hoffman was the fertility doctor who treated Torres. When Torres and Shasha separated, Torres and Hoffman began dating. Torres and Hoffman are the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in April 2006.\n\nBP Products North America engaged Torres in 2009 to be part of its \"Team Invigorate\" advertising campaign to inspire others to live \"younger for longer.\" She is the author of the inspirational memoir, Age is Just a Number, published in April 2009, and Gold Medal Fitness, published in May 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, The New York Times reported that a sports medicine doctor, Anthony Galea, with whom Torres had previously consulted, was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly distributing human growth hormone and the drug Actovegin to professional athletes. Torres said that Dr. Galea's work was limited to draining fluid from her knee and diagnosing a muscle tear.\n\nTorres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research, in which she has participated for several years.\n\nSee also\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nList of notable Jewish swimmers\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n\nList of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n\nList of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n\nList of United States records in swimming\n\nList of University of Florida alumni\n\nList of University of Florida Olympians\n\nWorld record progression 50 metres freestyle\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nTorres, Dara, & Elizabeth Weil, Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life , Broadway Books, New York, New York (2009).

She now hopes to earn a ticket to August's Beijing games, during the Olympic trials from June 29 to July 1.\n\nWhat makes her quest even more remarkable is that, at 41 years old, Torres is long past the age of the majority of competitive swimmers.\n\n\"I'd like people to say, 'This is fantastic that a middle-aged woman can be doing this -- who's a mom,'\" Torres said.\n\nShe is poised to reach her goal and is swimming the best laps of her life. Last year, at age 40 she broke the American record in the 50m freestyle. It was the record she set during the 2000 Sydney Olympics and served as her 15th career national title -- 25 years after her first one came in 1982.\n\nIf she makes it to Beijing, it will mark 24 years since Torres competed in her first games -- it was 1984 when Torres got the opportunity to perform in front of her hometown of Los Angeles.\n\nWhile, at the time, many of her current competitors were in diapers or not yet born, Torres was busy grabbing her first medal -- a gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay. It was her only event during the games.\n\nHer success continued throughout the decade. She nabbed a silver and bronze medal in Seoul, Korea, in 1988 before she opted to retire in 1989.\n\nBut she wouldn't stay out of the competitive pool for long. Fueled by her seventh place finish in the 100m freestyle, the swimmer eagerly trained for the 1992 Barcelona games in Spain. She netted yet another gold in the 4x100m free relay and then bowed out of competitive swimming for the second time.\n\nSeven years later, a friend of Torres suggested the then-32-year-old swimmer consider returning to the sport. She initially balked at the idea before deciding to give it another go.\n\nSince she maintained her physical fitness, Torres easily staged a second comeback at the 2000 Sydney, Australia, games.\n\n\"In 2000 we had sort of a running joke that I'd call her mom because I was 15 and she was -- what? Almost 30,\" said gold medalist Michael Phelps, who was born in 1985.\n\nAge turned out to be nothing but a number as Sydney was Torres' most successful games. The swimmer added two gold relay medals to her collection and earned her first individual Olympic medals: three bronze medals in the 50m free, 100m free and 100m butterfly.\n\nAfter the 2000 Sydney games, Torres retired -- the third time she had done so in her career.\n\nSix years later, she was pregnant and was looking for a way to stay in shape. She discovered a local pool where one of Florida's top swimming clubs trained.\n\n\"I started swimming on the masters' team, and really strictly, again, just for exercise. But I found myself racing these middle-aged men who, even though I had this pregnant belly, [and] wanted to race me,\" Torres said. \"I couldn't help myself. It's like the competitive juices started to flow.\"\n\nAfter her daughter's April 2006 birth, Torres began training for her fifth Olympic competition.\n\nBut things were different. Now, Torres juggles 2-year-old Tessa along with her Olympic dreams.\n\nBetween the mommy-and-me swim classes she attends with Tessa, Torres finds time to train.\n\nIn Coral Springs, Fla., she works with strength and conditioning coach Andy O'Brien to help her prepare.\n\n\"She's absolutely exceptional. I mean, for a 41-year-old athlete, you would expect Dara to be slightly behind, if not quite behind. But she is way ahead,\" O'Brien said. \"The average athlete would take anywhere from three to six weeks to really adapt to something that Dara takes about one week to adapt to.\"\n\nStill, there are times when Torres said she feels the effects of getting older in such a young sport.\n\n\"It's all about recovery for me at my age,\" she said. \"These kids can go and do their workouts, and come back that afternoon and bounce back and be fine, and not be hurting or sore, or feel heavy in the water. It's much different for me.\"\n\nToday, Torres has 15 pounds less muscle than she did when she competed in Sydney, though she's just as strong. Her regimen relies less on weight lifting and more on medicine balls and pulleys.\n\nIt's all to secure her place as the world's oldest swimming champion, though she doesn't see it that way."}], "Dara Grace Torres became the oldest swimmer to win an Olympic medal at age 41.": [{"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/dara-torres", "page_content": "Biography\n\nDara Torres had the longest successful career of any Olympic swimmer, one which saw her win 12 Olympic medals and four gold medals. Torres began her career in 1984, winning a gold medal in the 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay. She added a silver and bronze in relays in 1988, and seemingly ended her swimming career with another gold in the 4\u00d7100 free relay in 1992. Tall and strikingly attractive, Torres then began a career as a model, becoming the first athlete to appear in Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue. She also achieved notice as a commercial spokeswoman on an infomercial for a fitness training method. But in late 1998, she elected to return to competitive swimming. With little time to prepare, she returned to the Olympic pool at Sydney, and won five medals, including two golds in relays. She won three individual bronze medals at Sydney \u2013 in the 50 free, the 100 free, and the 100 fly.\n\nAgain retiring after the 2000 Olympics, Torres did not compete in Athina. But in 2006 she began training to make another Olympic team and made the US team for Beijing, winning the Olympic Trials in both the 50 and 100 metre freestyle. But she elected to compete in Beijing only in the 50 and the 4\u00d7100 freestyle and medley relays. Aged 41, the oldest ever female Olympic swimmer, Torres won a silver medal in the 50 free, defeated by only 1/100th of a second. She added silver medals in both relays. Torres finished her Olympic career lacking only an individual gold medal. She swam through 2012, but just missed out making the US Olympic team for the London Olympics. Torres won four Olympic medals of each color, one of only three Olympians to have won four or more medals of each type (Takashi Ono of Japan, and Larisa Latynina in gymnastics are the others)."}, {"url": "https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-olympic-swimming-medallist-", "page_content": "On 9 August 2008, 41-year-old Dara Torres defied the years to earn a silver medal for the Americans in the pool at the Beijing Olympics, swimming the anchor leg in the 4 x 100 m freestyle relay.

But the five-time Olympian is more impressed with her fellow class of 2019 hall of fame inductees than with her own accolades.\n\n\u201cAll these athletes are so respected in their sports and what they\u2019ve done in their careers,\u201d she said by phone from her home in Florida. \u201cTo be in the company of the likes of the Paralympians and the other Olympians who have had so much success in their careers, it\u2019s an honor to be included in this class.\u201d\n\nOf the 154 people and teams who have been inducted into the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Hall of Fame since 1983, 21 are swimmers. Torres joins the likes of Mark Spitz, Shirley Babashoff and Duke Kahanamoku, also known for being the father of modern surfing.\n\nTorres never set out to swim competitively for over a quarter century. She won her first Olympic medal at the Olympic Games Los Angeles 1984 and her final three at the Beijing 2008 Games as a 41-year-old mother.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, you think about your parents in their 40s, and as a kid, you think, \u2018Oh my god, that is so old,\u2019\u201d she replied with a laugh when asked if she ever thought her competitive swimming career would last that long.\n\nTorres just liked to swim and was good at it. She has quick reflexes and a high percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers \u2014 70 percent, according to a 1984 story in Sports Illustrated, 20 percentage points more than the average swimmer.\n\nAt age 14, in 1982, Torres won her first national title in the 50-yard freestyle, beating Jill Sterkel, an Olympic and world medalist. The next year, she broke Sterkel\u2019s world record in the 50-meter freestyle. She would lower it again twice before the 1984 Games, where at age 17, Torres helped the Americans win an Olympic gold medal in the 4x100 freestyle. (Her best event, the 50 freestyle, would not make its Olympic debut until 1988.)\n\nIt was the first of 12 Olympic medals for Torres, tying her with Jenny Thompson and Natalie Coughlin for the most Olympic medals won by women in swimming and the most by U.S. women in any sport. Only Michael Phelps has more with 28 (Ryan Lochte has also won 12). In each of her five Olympic Games \u2014 1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008 \u2014 Torres won at least one medal.\n\nBut it\u2019s not her vast medal collection for which Torres is best known. She inspired her fans by defying age limitations. In two of her five Olympic appearances, Torres was the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. And at the 2000 Games in Sydney, she won more Olympic medals than any other American swimmer, including her first medals in individual events (bronzes in the 50 free, 100 free and 100 butterfly).\n\nHer coach at the time, Richard Quick, said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think you\u2019ve reached your full potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d thought Torres. \u201cI\u2019m 33.\u201d\n\nDownload the Team USA app today to keep up with swimming and all your favorite sports, plus access to videos, Olympic and Paralympic team bios, and more.\n\n\u201cAt that point, in the early 2000s, people were still considering athletes in their 30s as old,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still wasn\u2019t a common thing.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2000 Games, Torres was ready to move on and start a family. It was pregnancy that got her back in the pool. The nausea from pregnancy made working out tough. Then a lightbulb went off.\n\n\u201cI can swim,\u201d Torres thought. \u201cIf I get morning sickness, I can get sick in the gutter and keep going. It\u2019s not a big deal, I don\u2019t have to clean anything up.\u201d\n\nPlus, being in the water felt good on her pregnant body. The baby moved around and did not push on her ribs.\n\nBut she had no intention of returning to Olympic competition.\n\n\u201cI was going to have a baby at 39,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would I be swimming for an Olympics?\u201d\n\nAs her due date neared, the swim club\u2019s coach asked if she would compete in the masters nationals. He hoped Torres\u2019 name would bring more spectators to the pool.\n\nThe day Tessa was delivered in April 2006, Torres asked her doctor if she could compete in the meet. It was three weeks away. No way, he said, nothing aerobic for six weeks. But then Torres ran into him at the gym a week-and-a-half later. This time he agreed, as long as she was careful.\n\n\u201cSo I went back to the house and put on a swimsuit \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a great sight,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter that meet, her daughter\u2019s father, also a swimmer, convinced her to join him at masters world championships. There, she qualified for the 2008 Olympic trials.\n\n\u201cWhen that happened, all these people came up to me and said you should go to the Olympics, you can represent us 40-year-olds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d been thinking about it for years. It was just the peer pressure of these masters athletes that wanted to see someone their age competing in the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWhile the rest of the world wondered how a middle-aged mom would do in a sport known for its teenage phenoms, Torres knew that age was just a number. The word \u2018old\u2019 meant little to her.\n\n\u201cAt my third Olympics in 1992, I was 25, and they called me Grandma because I was the oldest woman on the team,\u201d Torres said. \u201cSo at 33 [at the 2000 Games], god knows what they called me. But at 41, they probably wondered, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you be in your grave?\u2019\u201d\n\nMost definitely not. At the 2008 Games, Torres won three silver medals \u2014 missing gold in the 50 free by 0.01 seconds. She became the oldest swimmer ever to win an Olympic medal, surpassing William Robinson, a 38-year-old Brit who in 1908 won a silver medal in the 200 breaststroke. She also broke the American record in the 50 free. She might have won four medals, but she dropped out of the 100 free to focus on the 50.\n\n\u201cShe has gotten rid of the mythology in swimming that has been there for so long (that mothers should stop competing),\u201d Natalie Coughlin told the press during the Beijing Games. \u201cWe are all very proud to be on the team with Dara.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Torres published her first book, \u201cAge Is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life.\u201d Then in 2010, her second book, \u201cGold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program,\u201d hit the shelves.\n\nTorres competed at the 2009 world championships, but a bad knee had kept her from training much and she finished eighth in the 50 free. After knee surgery, she competed in the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials but missed her sixth Olympic team by 0.09 seconds.\n\nSince then, Torres has worked as a TV commentator and host, motivational speaker, vice president for the U.S. branch of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation, which focuses on drowning prevention, and as a wellness ambassador for CaniBrands, educating people on the benefits of CBD products.\n\nAnd, of course, Torres is a mom. Tessa is now 13 and is an avid lacrosse player.\n\nAs for her legacy, that is a word Torres does not like to use.\n\n\u201cI like to say hopefully I inspired people who thought maybe they were too old to do what they dreamt of doing, or I inspired some parents that maybe thought, \u2018I can\u2019t do this because I\u2019m a mom or a dad and I can\u2019t balance it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou can find a balance that works best for you and your kids and follow your dreams.\u201d\n\nAn award-winning freelance writer based in Vermont, Peggy Shinn has covered five Olympic Games.

American swimmer Dara Torres won 12 career Olympic medals, 4 of which were gold. Her 12 medals tied a record for the most won by a female Olympian from the United States. Celebrated for her longevity in swimming, Torres was the first American swimmer to compete at five Olympic Games. In 2008, at the age of 41, she became the oldest swimming medalist in Olympic history.\n\nTorres was born on April 15, 1967, in Beverly Hills, California. She was Cuban American. When she was growing up, her older brothers swam at their local YMCA, and at age seven she followed them into the sport. A prodigy in the pool, she began setting national age-group records when she was 12 years old. At age 14 she claimed her first senior national title, winning the 50-yard freestyle race at the Senior Short Course Nationals. In 1983 she twice set world records in the long-course 50-meter freestyle event. The following year she lowered the world record once more, to 25.61 seconds, and qualified for her first Olympics. At the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, California, she helped the U.S. 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay team win the gold medal and establish a new American record with a time of 3 minutes, 43.43 seconds.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1985, Torres attended the University of Florida. As a collegiate swimmer she garnered 28 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American honors. She was named the NCAA Swimmer of the Year in 1988. That year she competed at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where she earned a silver medal in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay and a bronze medal in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay. She returned to the Olympics four years later. At the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, she captured gold again in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay. This time Torres and her teammates set a world record in the event, finishing in 3 minutes, 39.46 seconds.\n\nFollowing the Barcelona Games, Torres took a long break from competitive swimming. She worked in television broadcasting for a number of years. In 1999, however, she resumed training, with an eye toward qualifying for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. At the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials she proved that she remained a force, winning the 50-meter freestyle and finishing second behind Jenny Thompson in both the 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. At the Sydney Games, the following month, Torres enjoyed her most successful Olympics, securing five medals. She won gold in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay and the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay. In individual competition she took home the bronze in the 50-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. She also tied Thompson for the bronze in the 100-meter freestyle.\n\nTorres again stepped away from competition after the Sydney Games. She resumed her broadcasting career, and in 2006 she gave birth to a daughter, Tessa. Following her pregnancy she took part in a couple of masters swimming events (for older competitive swimmers). Her impressive performances at those meets convinced her to make a bid for her fifth Olympic Games. At the 2008 Olympic Trials she won the 50-meter freestyle, thus becoming the oldest swimmer ever to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. Torres went on to win three silver medals at the 2008 Games in Beijing, China (50-meter freestyle, 4 \u00d7 100-meter freestyle relay, 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay). In addition to becoming the oldest swimmer to medal at an Olympics, Torres moved into a tie with Thompson as the most decorated female American Olympian (their record of 12 career Olympic medals was later equaled by American swimmer Natalie Coughlin).\n\nIn 2012 Torres placed fourth in the 50-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic Trials, coming up short in her attempt to make her sixth Olympic team. She announced her retirement from swimming after the trials. Torres was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2016 and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee Hall of Fame in 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/sports/olympics/17pool.html", "page_content": "BEIJING \u0097 Dara Torres had just become the oldest swimmer to win an Olympic silver medal, but her body language was still apologetic as she climbed out of the pool Sunday alongside rivals young enough to be her daughters.\n\n\u201cOne hundredth,\u201d Torres said, shrugging her broad shoulders as she smiled at a group of supporters in the stands at the Water Cube. She later cried in a news conference.\n\nIt was testimony to how driven Torres was in her unlikely and ultimately successful quest to return to the Olympics. At 41, she did not just believe in her chances to take part in the Games, she believed in her chances to win.\n\nShe had concentrated the bulk of her energy on this 50-meter freestyle, withdrawing from the 100 freestyle before the Games to focus on what she perceived as her best chance.

Now, in \u201cAge Is Just a Number,\u201d the 41-year-old mom describes the hurdles she overcame on the road to Beijing, including failed marriages, infertility and her father\u2019s terminal illness. An excerpt.\n\nI\u2019ve been old before. I was old when I was 27 and I got divorced. I was old when I was 35 and I couldn\u2019t get pregnant. I was really old when I was 39 and my father died. But when I was 41 and I woke up in a dorm in the Olympic Village in Beijing, I didn\u2019t feel old. I felt merely \u2014 and, yes, happily \u2014 middle-aged. \u201cThe water doesn\u2019t know how old you are,\u201d I\u2019d been telling anyone who would listen for the prior two years. Though sometimes, I have to admit, I would think to myself, Good thing it can\u2019t see my wrinkles.\n\nOn the morning of the 50-meter freestyle Olympic finals, I set my alarm for six o\u2019clock. I\u2019m a type A person, or as some of my friends call me, type A++. Basically, I\u2019m one of those people who has to do everything I do to the fullest extent of my ability, as fast as I can. When I recently moved houses I didn\u2019t sleep until all the boxes were unpacked and all the pictures hung on the walls. I don\u2019t like to do anything halfway, and I\u2019d set this crazy goal for myself: to make my fifth Olympic team as a 41-year-old mother. And the truth was I didn\u2019t just want to make the team, either. I wanted a medal. I wanted to win. Along the way, I also wanted to prove to the world that you don\u2019t have to put an age limit on your dreams, that the real reason most of us fear middle age is that middle age is when we give up on ourselves.\n\nIt was a pretty crazy thing to be doing, especially under the circumstances. If you\u2019ve ever had a toddler or watched a parent you adore die, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. Young children and dying parents are truly exhausting, and I had one of each as I made my comeback. But I knew in my heart I could succeed \u2014 as long as I left no stone unturned.\n\nThe race started at 10 a.m., so I\u2019d worked out my schedule lead\u00ading up to the race. I needed to drink my Living Fuel breakfast shake at 6:15 a.m. so I\u2019d have time to pack my roller bag \u2014 two practice suits, two racing suits, two pairs of goggles, two racing caps, two towels, and my dress sweats, in case I got a medal \u2014 before I caught the 6:45 a.m. bus over to the Water Cube. I\u2019d then do my whole routine \u2014 wake-up swim, shower, get mashed (a massage technique done with the feet), do my warm-up swim, get stretched, and put on my racing suit \u2014 all before I headed to the ready room, where all the swimmers wait before a race. My teammates, I have to tell you, thought that roller bag was the funniest thing in the world.They were all 15 to 25 years younger than me, the ages I was at my first, second, and third Olympics. (I was already beyond their ages by my fourth.) Their bodies were like noodles, and they all carried their gear in backpacks. But I\u2019d noticed that backpack straps made my trapezoid muscles tense up. Swimming fast, for me, is all about staying loose. So I had a roller bag. If I looked like a nutty old lady \u2014 fine.\n\nThe Beijing morning was humid and dark when I left the Olympic Village. All the other swimmers were probably still asleep. I think that the only other person awake in the Village was Mark Schubert, the National team coach of the USA Olympic swim\u00adming team. Mark had also been my coach at my first Olympics, 24 years ago. And he\u2019d been my coach at Mission Viejo, where I\u2019d gone to high school to train at age 16. I love Mark. He\u2019s like my fairy godfather, constantly dropping into my life at just the right time, giving me what I need, and then disappearing again. That morning he\u2019d woken up in the Beijing predawn to help me pre\u00adpare for my race. We\u2019d come a long way together. Though he wasn\u2019t my coach in the months leading up to the Olympics, he\u2019d taught me the discipline and the commitment to detail I now so prized. We were now going \u2014 literally \u2014 one more lap.\n\nI rolled my bag out to the sidewalk as quietly as possible. I didn\u2019t want to wake anybody \u2014 partly because, as a mother, I knew the value of sleep. But selfishly, I also wanted my competitors to stay in their beds.The longer they slept, I told myself, the greater my advantage and the more time I had, relative to them, to prepare. Since my daughter had been born I\u2019d been saying that waking up with a kid in the middle of the night was going to give me an edge at some point. I hoped this was it.\n\nOver at the Water Cube the competition pool was empty, so I yelled \u201cGood morning!\u201d to Bob Costas, who was broadcasting up in the rafters, found my lane, and dove in. I don\u2019t usually do a wake-up swim in the competition pool, but the 50-meter free\u00adstyle is a really strategic race. Time can contract or stretch out. It\u2019s only one length of the pool \u2014 just 24 or 25 seconds \u2014 but it\u2019s also easy to get lost. If I\u2019ve learned one thing from all my races and all my years, it\u2019s that the Olympics can be disorienting, and the middle of things is where we tend to lose the plot. Part of my plan for the morning was to learn exactly where I was going to be in the water at every stroke of the race. So as I swam I memorized all the land\u00admarks, the intake jets, where all the cameras were on the bottom of the pool.That way I\u2019d have markers in addition to the lines 15 meters from the start and 15 meters from the end. I\u2019d know when to keep a little energy in reserve, and when to take my last breath and gun for the wall.\n\nMore was riding on this race than on any other race I\u2019d swum. Back in Florida I had a child, Tessa, who\u2019d one day study this race to find out who her mother was. I had a coach, Michael Lohberg, who\u2019d believed in me before anyone else, who now lay in a hos\u00adpital bed with a rare blood disorder, fighting for his life. I\u2019d had a father, Edward, whom I\u2019d lost to cancer just as I\u2019d started this come\u00adback,and who\u2019d wanted so much for me to realize my dreams,and who I felt was with me every day.\n\nAnd most unexpectedly, at least for me, I had a lot of fans.\n\nI\u2019m not being coy when I say the fans were unexpected. I\u2019m saying they were unexpected because I didn\u2019t yet understand how overcoming perceived odds works \u2014 how even just attempting that can inspire people, and how the energy from those people can boomerang back to you, giving you the strength and energy you need to reach your goals. So I was surprised \u2014 deeply surprised, and also grateful \u2014 that my dream was contagious. I\u2019ve always\n\nbeen good in a relay, but I\u2019ve never been quite as strong in my indi\u00advidual events. I\u2019ve just never been at my best when I\u2019m swimming in front of the whole world just for myself. But now I had the support of everyone nearing or over 40, everyone who\u2019d ever felt they were too old or too out of shape to do something but still wanted to give it a try. I had everyone who didn\u2019t want to give up. I just couldn\u2019t let all those people down. I felt they were depend\u00ading on me almost in the same way my relay teammates did. We were in this together. I couldn\u2019t entice so many women and men into dreaming a little longer and aiming a little higher, and then not win.\n\nOf course, as anyone who knows me will tell you, I wanted to win anyway. I\u2019m pathologically competitive. I hate to lose. That\u2019s just what I\u2019m like. If you and I were in a sack race at a field day, trying to jump across the grass with our legs stuck in bags, making total fools of ourselves, I\u2019d still want to cross that finish line first. I\u2019d give it everything I had. But now I wanted to win this race not just for myself. I wanted to win it for everyone who believed \u2014 everyone who needed to believe \u2014 that a 40-plus mom could still compete.\n\nAt 7:25 a.m. I got out of the pool and walked to the locker room to take a hot shower. The wake-up swim and the shower were both part of an effort to get my core temperature up. Everybody\u2019s core temperature drops during sleep, and that temperature needs to rise if you want to swim really fast. My plan for the remaining two hours before my race was to have my stretchers, Anne and Steve, mash \u2014 or massage \u2014 me with their feet, then swim again, then have Anne and Steve stretch me, and then put on the bottom half of my racing suit, with plenty of time remaining to lie on a massage table in the team area and listen to a bunch of rockers half my age sing a song called \u201cKick Some Ass.\u201d The mashing and the stretching were critical to my performance. All the other kids in the Olympics might have thought they could do their best by just swimming a little warm-up, pinwheeling their arms a few times and diving in. But not me. I was the same age as a lot of those athletes\u2019 mothers. Michael Phelps had started calling me \u201cMom\u201d eight years earlier. I needed every advantage.\n\nPhysically, I have to say I didn\u2019t feel great \u2014 stiff, still not fully recovered from the prior day\u2019s semifinals. (Okay, let me pause right here and say it: I\u2019m totally fine with aging except for the recovery time. Is it really necessary to take 48 hours to recover from a 24-second sprint?) I also felt sick to my stomach with anxiety. I\u2019m like that, even after all these years: On the day of a big race, I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up. I know it\u2019s part of the adrenaline surge I need in order to psych up and win. But my relationship to that surge is like an addiction. I run toward it, crave it, can\u2019t live too long without it, and then it makes me feel terrible. That prerace nausea gets me every time. I suppose when I stop feeling it I\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to call it quits and hang up my Speedo for good.\n\nThat day at the Water Cube, as my mother came over to wish me luck, and then came back to wish me luck again, I took a few swigs of Accelerade to try to calm my nerves. Breathe, Dara, breathe, I told myself. It\u2019ll be over in 24 seconds. Of course, Mark Spitz once said the really great thing about being a competitive swimmer is that your career ends quickly. He said the reward for all the long hours in the pool is that you get to retire at 23 years old. Oh, well. I was not following Spitz\u2019s schedule (though he, too, attempted a comeback at age 41). So I tried to focus instead on what I\u2019d learned at the Olympic Trials, where I\u2019d felt so bad just before my first heat that I was crying in the hall but swam really well anyway: You don\u2019t have to feel good to swim fast. I must have said it to myself a hundred times: Don\u2019t freak out, Dara. Remember Trials. You don\u2019t have to feel good to swim fast.\n\nFinally, I went down to the team area and lay on a massage table for a while, listening to my iPod and watching the muscles in my quads tighten up. Then one of the coaches told me it was time to go to the ready room, which was a good thing. Because despite all my supposed maturity, for the last 20 minutes I\u2019d been acting like an annoying kid. Every 30 seconds I\u2019d ask: How much longer? Is it time yet? I couldn\u2019t stand the wait. I\u2019d been working toward this moment for two years, or 24 years, or 41 years ... Let\u2019s just say it had been a long time. I\u2019d done everything I possibly could. I\u2019d as\u00adsembled the best team. I\u2019d worked hard and smart. Now the only thing that was happening was that my muscles were tightening up.\n\nThe ready room is where they put all the athletes just before a race. I hate the place. In the ready room it\u2019s just you and the seven other girls you\u2019re swimming against, and it\u2019s either hear-a-pin\u00addrop tense or filled with forced conviviality. When I was younger I\u2019d sit in the ready room with my Walkman (remember those?), and then my Discman (remember those, too?), staring at my fin\u00adgernails, always keeping an eye on the trash can so I\u2019d know where to run to vomit. That day, on purpose, I left my iPod in my roller bag. But as I ducked my head in to give the official my credentials, I could see everybody else sitting already, messing with their fingernails, or with their caps and goggles, looking sick and miserable. And the room was hot and stuffy.\n\nFor my entire career I\u2019d been just like them \u2014 enjoying my Olympics by putting massive amounts of pressure on myself. Which is to say not enjoying the Olympics at all. But this time I felt totally blessed. I was at the Olympics. How cool is that? I\u2019d sat with LeBron James and watched Michael Phelps swim. And guess what that\u2019s like? FUN. In just five minutes the eight of us girls were all about to do something incredible: swim in an Olympic final. By pretty much any sane person\u2019s standards, we\u2019d already ac\u00adcomplished something. We were the eight fastest female swimmers in the world. We\u2019d already won. I wanted to enjoy the experience. I wanted them to enjoy the experience. I knew we were all going out there to try to beat each other, and believe me, I wanted to win. But I felt the occasion called for a joke.\n\n\u201cAnybody else hot? Or is it just me?\u201d I called out to the girls. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in menopause.\u201d\n\nI saw a smile creep across the lips of Cate Campbell, the freckly Australian redhead who up until that moment looked like she was about to meet a firing squad. I knew how she felt: like her whole future depended on the next five minutes. I now was old enough to know that there\u2019s a lot of life that happens outside of the pool. That she was going to lose loved ones and yearn for things that were outside her control. Swimming is not like real life. You can determine for yourself how hard and how well you train. You can control how you dive, how you turn, how you position your shoulders for your touch. But I knew what Cate was going through. Swimming fast can feel like the most important thing \u2014 the only important thing \u2014 in the whole world. I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve felt that. She was 16.\n\nMaybe it was this perspective that caused me to ham it up just before 24 of the most important seconds in my life. Maybe it was nerves. Whatever the reason, I did. With just a few minutes to go before the race, all of us zipped up like sardines in our tight new racing suits, officials walked us down the hall to the rows of chairs under the bleachers. My mantra for the past two years had been to do everything all the other swimmers weren\u2019t doing \u2014 that extra vertical kick in practice, those long hours of active recovery \u2014 so I\u2019d have something over them. But now the mom in me came out. I wanted to take care of everybody. I wanted all these girls\n\nto enjoy the event. I wanted them to relax. I knew that Libby Trickett, Cate\u2019s teammate, a really spunky Australian who\u2019d gone into the Games ranked first in the 50 free, had just gotten married. So I asked her if she was going to have kids, and before I knew it, as 17,000 fans sat waiting for us to come out and compete, I was telling them what it\u2019s like to give birth to a child. And not just telling them. I had my feet up, as if they were in stirrups, yelling like I was in labor, just as I might have if I was sitting around my house yukking it up with my closest friends.\n\nThen it came time to walk out to the blocks for that long, fast lap. When I got to my lane, I dried off my block with a towel, lest I slip. Then I took off my sneakers and my two T-shirts, and walked to the edge of the pool to splash my body and face. Back at the blocks, I roughed up the skin on my forearms and hands on the block\u2019s surface so I\u2019d have a better feel for the water. Each time, just before a race, the officials blow a series of whistles \u2014 first a bunch of short bursts to warn you to get all your clothes off ex\u00adcept your suit, cap, and goggles. Then a long whistle meaning it\u2019s time to get on your block in ready position. After that, the starting signal begins the race.\n\nWhen I heard the long whistle I took my mark, with my right leg back, my left toes curled over the cool metal edge, staring down my long blue lane. I had just one word in my head, tone, reminding me to keep my body tight, in a toned position to knife into the water on my start. I knew everybody who dreamed my dream with me was on that block, too. But I also knew, at the starting signal, that I\u2019d be diving into the water alone."}, {"url": "https://www.ishof.org/honoree/honoree-dara-torres/", "page_content": "Dara Torres (USA) Honor Swimmer (2016)\n\nThe information on this page was written the year of their induction.\n\nFOR THE RECORD: 1984 OLYMPIC GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 1988 OLYMPIC GAMES: silver (4\u00d7100 m medley), bronze (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 1992 OLYMPIC GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 2000 OLYMPIC GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m medley), bronze (50 m freestyle, 100 m freestyle, 100 m butterfly); 2008 OLYMPIC GAMES: silver (50 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m medley); 1986WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS (LC): silver (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); 1987 PAN PACIFIC CHAMPIONSHIPS: gold (100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m freestyle, 4\u00d7100 m medley); 1983 PAN AMERICAN GAMES: gold (4\u00d7100 m freestyle); SIX WORLD RECORDS: three individual (50m free), three relays (4x100m free, 4x100m medley)\n\nDara Grace Torres grew up in Beverly Hills, California, where she learned to swim in her family\u2019s backyard pool. At the age of seven, she followed her brothers to swim practice at the local YMCA. During her junior year of high school, Torres moved to Mission Viejo, CA, to train with Hall of Fame Coach Mark Schubert, and in 1983 she broke the world record in the 50-meter freestyle. The next year, while not yet a senior in high school, she won her first Olympic gold medal as a member of the USA\u2019s 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay team.\n\nSwimming for Randy Reece at the University of Florida, Torres earned 28 NCAA All-American swimming awards and at the 1988 Olympic Games, she won two silver medals swimming on relays. She finished her collegiate athletic career playing volleyball and took two years off before returning to win her second Olympic relay gold medal in Barcelona, Spain during the summer of 1992.\n\nAfter 1992, Torres lived what appeared to be a glamorous life. She moved to New York City, worked in television, and as a Wilhelmina model she became the first athlete model in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Then in the spring of 1999, despite not having trained in a pool for seven years, she decided to give the Olympics one more try.\n\nTraining with coach Richard Quick in Palo Alto and Santa Clara, Dara made the Olympic team for the fourth time, at the age of 33. She returned home with five medals, more than any other member of the team, including three in individual events, and retired.\n\nIn 2005, while pregnant with her first child, Dara began swimming three or four times a week at the Coral Springs Aquatic Complex, to keep fit. After giving birth to her daughter, Tessa Grace, in April 2006, she entered two Masters meets and posted times that emboldened her to try another comeback. She asked Coral Springs coach Michael Lohberg if he would coach her, and a little over a year later, she won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis. Three days later, she broke the American record in the 50-meter freestyle for the tenth time \u2013 an amazing 24 years after setting it for the very first time. In 2008, Dara qualified for her fifth Olympic team and at the 2008 Beijing Games, she became the oldest swimmer to compete in the Olympics. Dara returned home with three silver medals, including the heartbreaking 50-meter freestyle race where she missed the gold by 1/100th of a second.\n\nIn 2009, Dara won the ESPY award for \u201cBest Comeback,\u201d was named one of the \u201cTop Female Athletes of the Decade\u201d by Sports Illustrated magazine and became a best selling author with the release of her inspirational memoir, Age is Just a Number.\n\nDara continued swimming after recovering from reconstructive knee surgery and with the encouragement of coach Lohberg, she set her sights on making a record sixth U.S. Olympic swim team. When she just missed making the London Olympics by nine-hundredths of a second in the 50-meter freestyle at the 2012 US Swimming Olympic Trials, she announced her retirement with a smile on her face and her six-year old daughter Tessa in her arms.\n\nOlympian, television personality, fitness guru, Queen of the Comeback, best-selling author and mother.

Torres talks about that in-depth for the first time in a documentary that airs on the SEC Network on Monday called \u201cOnce Upon A Comeback.\u201d\n\nAs a swimmer at the University of Florida during the \u201880s, Torres says she faced pressure from coaches, particularly Randy Reese, to lose weight. At the time, the coaches didn\u2019t know a lot about eating disorders, she says.\n\nOne coach wanted the team to look intimidating to competitors on the starting blocks and set a weight goal for the swimmers to meet, she says. If someone didn\u2019t make weight, they had to do extra workouts.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, having come from a background where I've never trained like that before in my life, to have to do extra workouts was just, that wasn't going to happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd one thing led to another. I sort of got in this habit of bingeing and purging in my freshman year, and that's kind of how it all started and just sort of snowballed from there.\u201d\n\nThe coaches weighed the girls right on the pool deck, as Torres describes in the film, and sometimes the swimmers would break down in tears if they didn't make weight. The intense pressure to make weight came from an inner desire to please her coaches, she says.\n\nThe cycle of bingeing and purging took over Torres\u2019 life and psyche \u2014 but now she views the difficult experience as a lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a very dark time in my life and I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut yet I learned a lot from it and it made me the person who I am today.\u201d\n\nTorres says she tried talking to a male team doctor at the university about her struggles, but the conversation ended with him handing her information on eating disorders.\n\nAfter she graduated college, she went to get a physical and the doctor asked her if she\u2019s ever binged and purged. Torres said no, but later called the doctor back and admitted she had a problem.\n\nThe first step to recovery was opening up about her disorder, she says. Her advice to people struggling with eating disorders is to talk about it.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a lot of work to do after that but it was a huge relief to get it off my shoulders after four years of only me knowing that I had this issue,\u201d she says.\n\nTorres swam in the Olympics in Seoul in 1988, Barcelona in 1992, Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008. When the time to train for Beijing arrived, Torres was pregnant, in her 40s and swimming for exercise.\n\nShe says she received invitations to swim in a few meets, and then people started to ask, \u201cWouldn't it be great to see a middle-aged person in the Olympic Games?\u201d Since she loves a challenge, Torres decided to go for gold once again.\n\nThe swimmer ended up winning three silver medals in Beijing. As she trained, Torres kept the goal of winning a gold medal in her head.\n\n\u201cI kept that thought with me every single day for the almost two years after that I trained for the Olympic trials and Olympic Games,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really think the power of positive thinking can play a role in what you do in your life.\u201d\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how she started swimming\n\n\u201cWell, I have four older brothers, and I was very competitive the minute I was born. It's like, who could be the first one in the car? Who could be the first one done at the dinner table? Just always competing with them. Whatever they would do, I would do. So the minute they started on a swim team, my mom had me in the stands. That didn't go very well because I had a lot of energy. And I think back then they called it hyperactivity, but I'm sure I had ADD. And she put me in the pool just to get the energy out and not have it all around her and just focus it somewhere. So I started swimming and just fell in love with the sport.\u201d\n\nOn whether swimming came easy to her\n\n\u201cIt really did. I really could just get up on the starting blocks and do the start into the water and swim fast and no big deal. And I think that all changed when I started to notice changes in my body, started to become more of a woman, and realized that I actually have to work hard to be fast. It just doesn't come easy anymore. \u201c\n\nOn if she left the sport satisfied after she didn\u2019t qualify for a sixth Olympic team in 2012\n\n\u201cI really did. It's funny because when I got out of the pool after those Olympic trials and I missed the team by nine one-hundredths of a second, I looked in the stands. I saw my daughter crying and I saw my mom crying. I'm like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to go over and console them.\u2019 And, you know, my mom, obviously, she was upset because she's my mom and she wanted to see me make another Olympic team, but my daughter, I'm like, \u2018Tessa, What's wrong? Are you OK?\u2019 She's like, \u2018Now I don't get to go to London and see Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte.\u2019 I'm like, oh, my gosh, she's starting way too early, you know? So it was kind of funny. It was a little bit of a role reversal of, you know, me having to console my mom. But I was OK. I knew that the time that I did Olympic trials, my sixth Olympic trials, was the second-fastest time I've ever done at trials. But the girls are getting faster and I couldn't give it anything else. I gave it all I had.\u201d\n\nOn what she tells her daughter about body image and her experience with eating disorders\n\n\u201cI continuously tell her how beautiful she is on the inside and out and not to base everything off of food. And just to make sure that when you want to eat stuff that, you know, you're maybe not supposed to have, eat it in smaller portions and you'll be fine.\u201d\n\nAlex Ashlock produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Todd Mundt.
