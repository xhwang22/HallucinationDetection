Hepburn was, in short, the polar opposite of the fiery femme fatale Tisci has attracted to his Givenchy, since arriving at the LVMH label in 2005. \u201cMe, I like clothes very painted on the body\u2014really to the millimeter,\u201d the designer told Vogue in 2012.\n\nTicsi\u2019s flame has attracted such glittering divas as Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, drawn, one imagines, not just to the obvious sex appeal of Tisci\u2019s reveal/conceal dresses, but to their exquisite craftsmanship. Tisci, who designs ready-to-wear and couture, is known for taking traditional feminine and fragile furbelows, like fringe and beads and lace, and using them to express strength. His Catholic upbringing, on the other hand, might explain his tendency to the Gothic and his finely tuned sense of transgression.\n\nGirl power is a subject that Tisci is intimately acquainted with, having been raised, after his father\u2019s early death, by his mother and eight sisters. He has carried this knowledge, and his (Italian) love of family over into his work. Tisci\u2019s posse is creative, diverse, and inclusive\u2014and not just on paper. The designer cast his friend Lea T, who is transgender, in his shows and campaigns. This is but one example of Tisci\u2019s gift for keeping things \u201creal.\u201d He\u2019s a designer who forges genuine connections, to his friends and his clientele, as well as to the street.

Madonna sported his designs on red carpets (she wore a design with no derri\u00e8re to the Met Gala), at her concerts (Tisci created pieces for her 2008 \u201cSticky & Sweet\u201d tour) as well as at the Super Bowl (he outfitted her for her 2012 performance, above center).

Tisci came to Givenchy as an almost unknown \u2013 LVMH appointed him to the storied house with only one show of his own to his name (after a few years designing at Ruffo Research). Now, it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine fashion without him, so central has he become to the dialogue around the intersections between fashion, celebrity, and subculture.\n\nTisci\u2019s Givenchy has seen several incarnations. When he first arrived at the house, his aesthetic was pure goth, as epitomised by long term muse and friend, the model Mariacarla Boscono. Tisci\u2019s first collection saw her in black, floor length, witch-y gowns, while other girls got to wear latex headpieces, intricately crafted leather jackets, and many layered tulle skirts. The designer\u2019s preferred look, a strange and sexed up romanticism, was established from his very first outing. From there, he\u2019s been able to play many variations on the theme, from drowned sailor goths, to tribal goths, to Catholic goths, to urban goths, to well, goth goths. It\u2019s not like he invented the colour but, thanks in no small part to Tisci, we\u2019ve spent another good decade in black.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like he invented the colour but, thanks in no small part to Tisci, we\u2019ve spent another good decade in black\u201d\n\nIn his menswear, Tisci established just as strong an aesthetic. Leggings under shorts? That was him, whether they be elaborately laced or in ruched leather. Otherwordly facial piercings were another of his trademarks, alongside the now ubiquitous printed t-shirt. Tisci\u2019s preoccupation with streetwear first appeared in his menswear, where he riffed on a sort of slender, high fashion hip hop look, with shorts and oversized t-shirts (that occasionally just happened to be in pink lace). What was once cutting edge now seems commonplace. Slowly this aesthetic seeped into his womenswear, with what looked like luxurious New Era caps, and sweaters that appeared each season in various guises, whether it be the instantly recognizable spliced Bambi graphic, or the snarling rottweilers and panthers. The culmination was in fact his collaboration with Nike, which sold out pretty instantly. Tisci\u2019s men and women were always \u2018fierce\u2019, to use an outdated turn of phrase that once sounded marvelously apt."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is the creative director of Givenchy, one of the world's most respected French fashion houses.

Tisci was also quick to align himself with celebrities of an ilk that many at the time wouldn\u2019t dream of associating with, creating moments that would guarantee his place in the firmament of fashion and culture.\n\nAnd while his high-profile collaborations \u2013 Nike, Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Kanye West and Jay Z \u2013 garnered the Italian designer a great deal of popular acclaim, his many endeavours into other, more quiet creative realms suggested Tisci was interested in much more than high wattage moments.\n\nBelow, revisit five of Riccardo Tisci\u2019s most memorable artistic collaborations over the course of his time at Givenchy.\n\nMarina Abramovic\n\nOn occasion of his tenth year at Givenchy in 2015, Tisci decamped to New York\u2019s Pier 26 to present his women\u2019s spring/summer 2016 collection on the anniversary of 9/11 in the shadow of the Freedom Tower.\n\nTisci\u2019s black-and-white show was art directed by the controversial performance artist Marina Abramovic, who stationed silent performers throughout the show, which for the first time was also open to the public. Their austere performances and Tisci\u2019s universally praised collection of couture-worthy looks proved to be a fitting tribute to the city and an industry that had so warmly embraced him over the course of the last decade.\n\nTisci and Abramobic\u2019s relationship was also the focus of a great deal many more memorable moments during his time at Givenchy. The designer enlisted the artist to feature in his guest-edited \u2018Religion\u2019 edition of Visionaire in 2011, which featured a Piet\u00e0 style image of Ambramovic and Tisci \u2013 the designer posing as if breastfeeding from the artist.\n\nIn a much more subdued image, Abramovic also starred in the brand\u2019s Spring/Summer 2013 advertising campaign, shot by Tisci\u2019s good friends, Mert & Marcus.\n\n\n\nPerformers overlook the runway at the Givenchy Spring Summer 2016 fashion show during New York Fashion Week on September 11, 2015\n\nCredit: Catwalking/Getty Images\n\nKehinde Wiley\n\nFor An Economy of Grace, Kehinde Wiley\u2019s first body of work dedicated to all female subjects, the artist asked Tisci to create custom-made couture gowns for each of his street cast models.\n\nPosed in a manner that replicated the historical portraits of society women seen by the artist at the Louvre by artists like Jacques-Louis David, Thomas Gainsborough and John Singer Sargent, among others, the women ranged from Rikers Island prison guards to teen mothers.

It was at the time that he showed his Spring 2015 Menswear collection that they reached a fever pitch, the intimation being that he was Gucci-bound (Frida Giannini presented what would be her final menswear collection for Gucci the week prior).\n\nIt was in Paris that week, however, that Tisci would issue something of a statement to the contrary.\n\nIn a vast hanger, Tisci\u2019s models circled a deconstructed Cessna that had been \u201cexploded\u201d by the Dutch artist Paul Veroude, whose work celebrates the power of machinery through the process of deconstruction.

The news came as a genuine shock to those who've admired his forward-thinking work during his 12-year tenure at the house, and also to those who appreciated his influence when it came to marrying high fashion and pop culture.\n\nIn recent years Tisci's sculptural designs could be seen on pretty much any major red carpet, thanks to A-listers like Rooney Mara and Meryl Streep. Having a close relationship with Beyonc\u00e9, the designer has created the megastar's dresses for the annual Met Gala every year since 2012, as well as several tour costumes. And let's not forget about the Kardashians\u2014for a while, Tisci was the only high-end designer who would dress Kim when she first started dating Kanye West (mostly as a result of Tisci's friendship with West). Fashion insiders might have rolled their at eyes at first, but\u2014as we well know\u2014they quickly followed suit, and the relationship between the reality star and the designer solidified Tisci's status in the pop culture stratum and led him to design one of the most talked-about dresses in decades: Kim's bridal gown for her wedding to West in 2014.\n\nAnd it's not just gowns he's known for, either: The 42-year-old pioneered the notion that streetwear and couture could coexist harmoniously, even within the same look. Tisci started working closely with West when the rapper's image shifted from retired notions of hip-hop dressing to elevated loungewear, arguably kicking off style movements we now know as athleisure and normcore. In 2011 West wore an oversize Givenchy T-shirt emblazoned with a Rottweiler (one of Tisci's signatures) that caused a tabloid frenzy. Almost instantaneously that tee could be seen on any celebrity, street-style star, and fashion-loving human imaginable. The price point was high, but not nearly as high as owning an off-the-runway Givenchy piece, which meant it wasn't impossible to get your hands on Tisci's luxurious streetwear if you were willing to shell out; it could be argued that the designer was a pioneer of democratizing high fashion, creating deceptively affordable It Items we all wanted.\n\nIt also should be said that West first paired his Rottweiler tee with a pleated leather skirt, causing the Internet to basically implode. Now, six years later, we're in a cultural moment when gender norms are being challenged left and right, fashion is more inclusive than ever, and Givenchy is still at the top of the pack while other steeped-in-history French labels are struggling to maintain relevance. Was Tisci on to something? You be the judge.\n\nHere we've rounded up some of the most iconic Givenchy looks that Tisci has been responsible for.

It isn't what most expect from a fashion show but Riccardo Tisci, the creative director of the French house, has become known for his ability to create a fashion week \"moment\". This was a set that suggested such a moment had arrived.\n\nThe show began with a bang \u2013 literally. It was soundtracked by Senegalese percussion troupe Sing Sing Rhythms, who played traditional Saba drums live.

The show notes suggested an attitude of \"sensuality and strength\". Taking the car pile-up as a metaphor, it felt as if the Givenchy girl's urban dream had crashed to a halt. In its place was something simpler, almost nomadic.\n\nModels close the Givenchy spring/summer 2014 show.

Elements of traditional dress from across the globe, from Indian saris to Japanese kimonos, Masai jewellery to the wraps of Northern Africa, filled the collection. The casting, as always at Givenchy, was equally diverse; the Puerto-Rican supermodel Joan Smalls, a favourite of the brand, led the way for a number of newer faces.\n\nA model wears a glitter mask during the Givenchy show.

Modern draping held the collection together, particularly in the slouchy kneelength silk dresses in an earthy palette that were designed to reveal bandeau bra tops beneath.
