Johnson was the physicist and mathematician whose calculations were critical to NASA missions sending astronauts into orbit and to the moon and whose story is chronicled in Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s Hidden Figures.\n\nIn October 1964, Johnson attended a symposium on American Women in Science and Engineering sponsored by the the MIT Association of Women Students. The informational 2-day outreach event for high school girls from 150 schools addressed students\u2019 questions about the field.\n\nWhen asked to name her greatest contribution to space exploration, Katherine Johnson talks about the calculations that helped synch Project Apollo\u2019s Lunar Lander with the moon-orbiting Command and Service Module. She also worked on the Space Shuttle and the Earth Resources Satellite, and authored or coauthored 26 research reports. She retired in 1986, after thirty-three years at Langley. \u201cI loved going to work every single day,\u201d she says. In 2015, at age 97, Katherine Johnson added another extraordinary achievement to her long list: President Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America\u2019s highest civilian honor.

Using her mathematics skills, she helped NASA send astronauts to the moon and return them safely home. She also overcame racial and gender hurdles that helped make giant leaps for humankind.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nJohnson was born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, on August 26, 1918. Math came easy to her, but she worked hard to master geometry and algebra. She started high school when she was just 10 years old (most kids are in fourth or fifth grade when they\u2019re 10!) and college when she was 15. After she graduated with honors at 18, Johnson taught Black students math. She later enrolled in graduate school at West Virginia University to study math but left early to raise a family and return to teaching.\n\nIn 1952, when she was 34 years old, she learned about jobs for Black women with mathematics and computing skills at the Langley laboratory at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which would later become NASA. She and the other women worked as \u201chuman computers,\u201d figuring out the difficult calculations needed for spaceflight. During her time there, she broke racial barriers, like using the bathroom that was supposed to be for white women only.\n\nOne of her biggest accomplishments at NASA was helping calculate the trajectory, or path, of the country\u2019s first human spaceflight in 1961, making sure astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., had a safe trip. A year later she helped figure out John Glenn\u2019s orbit of the planet, another American first. In 1969, she calculated the trajectories of Neil Armstrong\u2019s historic mission to the moon on Apollo 11.\n\nYet unlike the white male astronauts she helped launch into space, no one knew of the groundbreaking work Johnson and dozens of other Black women did for NASA and space exploration. It wasn\u2019t until the 2016 release of the movie Hidden Figures that these women received widespread recognition.\n\nJohnson died on February 24, 2020, at the age of 101. In her honor, NASA had dedicated the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility at the Langley Research Center to commemorate the hard work she did to help take them to the stars."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Katherine-Johnson-mathematician", "page_content": "Katherine Johnson\u2019s maiden name was Coleman. From 1939 to 1956 she was Katherine Goble, having married James Goble. Three years after his death, she married James Johnson.\n\nIn 1939 Johnson was selected to be one of the first three African American students to enroll in a graduate program at West Virginia University. Later she was a member of a group of NASA employees called \"computers,\" made up of African American women who excelled in mathematics and problem-solving.\n\nKatherine Johnson, n\u00e9e Katherine Coleman, also known as (1939\u201356) Katherine Goble, (born August 26, 1918, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, U.S.\u2014died February 24, 2020, Newport News, Virginia), American mathematician who calculated and analyzed the flight paths of many spacecraft during her more than three decades with the U.S. space program. Her work helped send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nColeman\u2019s intelligence and skill with numbers became apparent when she was a child; by the time she was 10 years old, she had started attending high school. In 1937, at age 18, Coleman graduated with highest honours from West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University), earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and French. She subsequently moved to Virginia to take a teaching job. In 1939, however, she was selected to be one of the first three African American students to enroll in a graduate program at West Virginia University. She studied math there but soon left after marrying James Goble and deciding to start a family. He died in 1956, and three years later she married James Johnson.\n\nBritannica Quiz Numbers and Mathematics\n\nIn 1953 she began working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)\u2019s West Area Computing unit, a group of African American women who manually performed complex mathematical calculations for the program\u2019s engineers. The women, known as the West Computers, analyzed test data and provided mathematical computations that were essential to the success of the early U.S. space program. During this time, NACA was segregated, and the West Computers had to use separate bathrooms and dining facilities. That changed in 1958 when NACA was incorporated into the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which banned segregation.\n\nAt NASA Johnson was a member of the Space Task Group. In 1960 she coauthored a paper with one of the group\u2019s engineers about calculations for placing a spacecraft into orbit. It was the first time a woman in her division received credit as an author of a research report. Johnson authored or coauthored 26 research reports during her career.\n\nJohnson also played an important role in NASA\u2019s Mercury program (1961\u201363) of crewed spaceflights. In 1961 she calculated the path for Freedom 7, the spacecraft that put the first U.S astronaut in space, Alan B. Shepard, Jr. The following year, at the request of John Glenn, Johnson verified that the electronic computer had planned his flight correctly. Glenn subsequently made history aboard Friendship 7, becoming the first U.S. astronaut to orbit Earth. Johnson was also part of the team that calculated where and when to launch the rocket for the Apollo 11 mission of 1969, which sent the first three men to the Moon. Johnson later worked on the space shuttle program. She retired from NASA in 1986.\n\nJohnson received numerous awards and honours for her work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2015). In 2016 NASA named a building, the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility, after her. That year Margot Lee Shetterly published Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, about the West Computers, including Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. A film based on the book was also released in 2016. Johnson\u2019s memoir, My Remarkable Journey (2021; written with Joylette Hylick and Katherine Moore), was published posthumously."}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/catherine-johnson-person_sguugg", "page_content": "Catherine Johnson\n\nBritish playwright \u2013 Catherine Johnson was born in Suffolk (county of England) on October 14th, 1957 and is 65 years old today.\n\nLouisa Catherine Johnson Adams Foto: Charles Robert Leslie / Public Domain Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams, first lady of the USA Foto: Charles Robert Leslie / Public Domain Gilbert Stuart - Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams (Mrs. John Quincy Adams) - Google Art Project Foto: Gilbert Stuart / Public Domain\n\nAge How old is Catherine Johnson? 65 Catherine Johnson is 65 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nCatherine Johnson\n\nBirthday When was Catherine Johnson born?
