He inspired his colleagues with his talent, his work ethic, his personality and his devotion to his daughters. (14:52)\n\nStuart Scott, a longtime anchor at ESPN, died Sunday morning at the age of 49.\n\nAmong the features of the new ESPN studio in Bristol is a wall of catchphrases made famous by on-air talent over the years. An amazing nine of them belong to one man -- from his signature \"Boo-Yah!\" to \"As cool as the other side of the pillow\" to \"He must be the bus driver cuz he was takin' him to school.\"\n\nThat man is Stuart Scott, and his contributions to the sports lexicon are writ large. But they are only one aspect of his legacy. When he passed away, he left behind so much more. He inspired his colleagues with his sheer talent, his work ethic and his devotion to his daughters, Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15. He defied convention and criticism to help bring this network into a new century. He spoke to the very athletes he was talking about with a flair and a style that ESPN president John Skipper says, \"changed everything.\"\n\n\"He didn't just push the envelope,\" says sports radio host and former ESPN anchor Dan Patrick. \"He bulldozed the envelope.\"\n\nScott was remembered through an outpouring of tributes by athletes, colleagues and fans on Twitter and statements from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina, which said that \"his legacy will live on in many ways -- as a friend, a son, a father, a professional and forever, a Tar Heel,\" and President Barack Obama.\n\n\"I will miss Stuart Scott. Twenty years ago, Stu helped usher in a new way to talk about our favorite teams and the day's best plays. For much of those twenty years, public service and campaigns have kept me from my family -- but wherever I went, I could flip on the TV and Stu and his colleagues on SportsCenter were there. Over the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us -- with courage and love. Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his family, friends, and colleagues,\" the president said.\n\nMoments of silence were held at sporting events around the United States on Sunday, including the NFL wild-card games between the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Indianapolis Colts and Detroit Lions vs. Dallas Cowboys; the Mavericks-Cavaliers NBA game in Cleveland and at several college basketball games.\n\nScott saved his best for his last year on the air. At the ESPYS on July 16, shortly before his 49th birthday and following another round of cancer surgery, Stuart accepted the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance with strength, humor, grace and these eloquent words: \"When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\"\n\nStuart Scott made famous the catchphrases \"Boo-Yah!\" and \"As cool as the other side of the pillow.\" Rich Arden/ESPN Images\n\nSo while the grief is deep at ESPN over the death of Stuart Scott, so is our gratitude. He was as popular on campus as he was in the airports he passed through and on the sidelines he worked over the last 22 years. He brought so much to the party, and he will continue to do so, through the people he inspired, and the language that he liberated, and the audience that will remember him.\n\nSteve Levy, who came to ESPN shortly before Stuart in August 1993 and served as his co-host for the first \"SportsCenter\" from the new studio last June, put it this way: \"I think the audience recognized that when Stuart was on, there was going to be something special. And to his credit, he brought something special every night he was on.\"\n\n\"SportsCenter\" anchor Jay Harris, who grew up watching -- and hoping to be -- Stuart, says, \"Think about that phrase, 'As cool as the other side of the pillow.' It's a hot, stifling night. You're having trouble sleeping. But then you think to turn the pillow over, and, wow, it's cool, and it feels so good.\n\n\"Well, that's who Stuart is. He is 'the other side of pillow,' the man who made sportscasting cool. God bless whoever it was who thought to rearrange the bedding at ESPN.\"\n\nStuart was born in Chicago, but he, along with two sisters and a brother, spent his formative years in North Carolina, where their father was a postal inspector who always had time to play after work. Stuart went to R.J. Reynolds High in Winston-Salem and then the University of North Carolina, where he played wide receiver and defensive back on the club football team, joined Alpha Phi Alpha and worked at the student radio station, WXYC. After graduating in 1987 with a degree in speech communication, Stuart was hired by WPDE-TV in Florence, South Carolina. He says that's where he first came up with the pillow metaphor. \"People say I stole it from a movie,\" he told an interviewer in 1998, \"but I first thought of that and said it on my first job ... I just liked it.\"\n\nStuart Scott was diagnosed with cancer in November 2007 and dealt with recurring bouts of the disease. Courtesy ESPN\n\nHis career path took him from Florence to Raleigh, North Carolina, to Orlando, Florida, and in his pre-ESPN clips, you can feel his energy, hear his music and sense his on-camera charisma. At WESH, the NBC affiliate in Orlando, he first met ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, who was beginning his own career. Says Ramsey, \"You knew the second he walked in the door that it was a pit stop, and that he was gonna be this big star somewhere someday. He went out and did a piece on the rodeo, and he nailed it just like he would nail the NBA Finals for ESPN.\"\n\nHe first met ESPN anchor Chris Berman in Tampa, Florida. \"He stuck out his hand and said, 'One day I look forward to working with you,'\" Berman said. \"And I said, 'Well, I tell you what, we'll save you a seat.' And I'm really thrilled that he was right on. [Later] I said, 'Stu, maybe you were the Swami.'\"\n\nThe person most responsible for bringing Stuart to Bristol was Al Jaffe, ESPN's vice president for talent, who was looking for sportscasters who might appeal to a younger audience for ESPN2. \"One of the producers on a story we were doing on the Orlando Magic told me about this young guy he really liked. I followed up and found out that Stuart's contract was up soon. He sent me a tape, and even then, he had an amazing presence -- I felt the viewer would sit up and take notice when he was on the air.\"\n\nHis first real ESPN assignments were for \"SportsSmash,\" a short sportscast twice an hour on ESPN2's \"SportsNight\" program. When Keith Olbermann graduated from \"SportsNight\" to ESPN's \"SportsCenter,\" Stuart took his place in the anchor chair. \"He was like a ball of fire walking in the door,\" says ESPN senior vice president Mark Gross, a coordinating producer at the time. \"I had never met anybody like Stuart Scott.\""}, {"url": "https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/2015/01/05/Media/Stuart-Scott.aspx", "page_content": "Longtime ESPN anchor Stuart Scott died yesterday at the age of 49 after battling cancer since '07. ESPN President John Skipper in a statement said, \"ESPN and everyone in the sports world have lost a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure in Stuart Scott. ... His energetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced\" (Mult., 1/4). In N.Y., Richard Sandomir writes Scott was \"known for infusing his reports with a blend of pop culture references, slang and exuberant phrases that made him something of a pop culture figure in his own right.\" His signature phrase \"Booyah!\" spread \"well beyond sports and into mainstream culture.\" Scott was the \"most prominent black sportscaster at ESPN,\" which hired him in '93 \"for the beginning of its first spinoff network, ESPN2.\" However, he soon began hosting \"SportsCenter\" and became \"defined as much for his energy, wit and stylish wardrobe as for his arsenal of catchphrases.\" He first learned he had cancer in '07 \"while on assignment in Pittsburgh for 'Monday Night Football,'\" having had an emergency appendectomy. The cancer \"recurred several times, requiring him to miss stretches of time in the studio and assignments\" (N.Y. TIMES, 1/5). Also in N.Y., Bob Raissman notes Scott's decision \"to continue to work\" while going through cancer treatment made his \"tenuous plight even more public.\" When he \"disappeared from the scene (he was absent from his on-site anchor role for 'MNF' this season), speculation mounted concerning his condition.\" Raissman: \"The absence of a lesser known member of the interchangeable cast of ESPN anchors would hardly be noticed\" (N.Y. DAILY NEWS, 1/5).\n\nONE OF ESPN'S SIGNATURE ANCHORS: USA TODAY's Chris Strauss notes Scott quickly became \"one of the network's main 'SportsCenter' anchors thanks to his rapid-fire delivery and unique phrasing to describe highlights.\" By '08, Scott was \"ubiquitous among the network's programming.\" In addition to anchoring \"SportsCenter,\" he hosted \"Monday Night Countdown,\" was the \"lead host for NBA on ESPN and ABC and interviewed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign\" (USA TODAY, 1/5). THE ATLANTIC's Matt Schiavenza wrote Scott over the years \"emerged as one of the network's most familiar faces, graduating from SportsCenter duties into a wider range of roles.\" He covered events like the the World Series, NBA Finals, the Super Bowl, and \"interviewed Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan.\" He also \"played a videotaped basketball game with President Obama.\" Schiavenza: \"Once a novelty at ESPN, Scott eventually became an institution\" (THEATLANTIC.com, 1/4). In Hartford, Paul Doyle notes Scott \"became a signature face on ESPN's signature show and is the name viewers of a certain generation associate\" with \"SportsCenter.\" His catchphrases \"were mimicked by kids during backyard games all over the country and his cultural references seemed to open the door for an entirely new audience\" (HARTFORD COURANT, 1/5). In Boston, Chad Finn notes Scott \"made his name in the '90s\" on \"SportsCenter\" by \"coining such lasting catchphrases as 'cool as the other side of the pillow' and 'booyah!'\" (BOSTON GLOBE, 1/5). ROLLING STONE's Daniel Kreps noted Scott \"formed a much-watch duo\" with both Steve Levy and Rich Eisen, who gave a moving tribute to Scott during yesterday's edition of \"NFL GameDay Morning\" on NFL Network. Scott \"displayed a masterful talent for weaving hip-hop lyrics and references into sports highlights on an almost-nightly basis.\" He appeared in music videos for LL Cool J and Luke and \"was frequently referenced in rap lyrics\" (ROLLINGSTONE.com, 1/4).\n\n\n\nSTAYING TRUE TO HIMSELF: In Orlando, David Whitley writes under the header, \"Stuart Scott Succeeded By Doing It His Way.\" Most ESPN anchors \"had their shtick, but the great ones broke molds,\" and \"nobody was more unique than Scott.\" Whitley: \"His hip-hop stylings appealed to an audience that had never been spoken to. Athletes got it. So did the young urban demographic the media and advertisers covet.\" The way Scott \"voiced things did not appeal to everybody,\" and he was often \"blasted as a contrived, catchphrase-stealing jock sniffer.\" Fox Sports' Charles Davis, a close friend of Scott, said, \"He took the barrage but never wavered. A lot of us would have wavered\" (ORLANDO SENTINEL, 1/5). MLB Network's Brian Kenny, who worked with Scott at ESPN, wrote Scott's \"freewheeling style seems like the norm now, but at the time he came up against enormous resistance.\" Kenny: \"He never let the tinge of hate or veiled racism get to him\" (SPORTSONEARTH.com, 1/4). NBC's Lester Holt noted Scott was known for his \"great energy and sharp wit,\" and he \"helped reinvent the language of sports\" (\"Nightly News,\" NBC, 1/4). ESPN's Jason Whitlock wrote Scott \"didn't want to sound like everyone else on television.\" Whitlock: \"He didn't want to appeal to the same audience. He wanted to be unique, a voice for a generation marching to its own beat. Mission accomplished\" (ESPN.com, 1/4). MLB.com's Richard Justice: \"He was the guy city kids knew. He spoke for them and to them. He represented diversity and so much more\" (MLB.com, 1/4). Dan Patrick dedicated the first eight minutes of his radio show today to Scott and said, \"There were times when I anchored with him, I didn't know what he was saying. But I knew there were people that did understand what he was saying. To have the guts and the courage, that's what's remarkable.\" Patrick added, \"In this cookie cutter world that we call sportscasting \u2026 Stuart went in and wasn't afraid to have a voice\u201d (\u201cThe Dan Patrick Show,\u201d 1/5).\n\nScott first learned he had cancer in '07 while on\n\nassignment in Pittsburgh for \"MNF\" THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE: ESPN's Cris Carter said Scott \"talked on \u2018SportsCenter\u2019 like me and my friends talked.\" Carter: \"He was a role model for me and hundreds of other African-American journalists/athletes now who wanted to be legitimate and want people to take what we say seriously, just like him.\" ESPN's Keyshawn Johnson: \"Looking at him and knowing that he was able to bring the hip-hop culture, that urban feel to television sports broadcasting ... gave me the hope that I didn't have to be some corporate guy\" (\"Postseason NFL Countdown,\" ESPN, 1/4). Fox\u2019 Michael Strahan said Scott \u201cfor my generation transformed TV.\" He \"made it cool to say some things that you would say with your friends and didn\u2019t necessarily see someone say it on TV\u201d (\u201cFox Sports Live,\u201d FS1, 1/4). ESPN's Mike Greenberg said Scott \"changed the vernacular of sports.\" Greenberg: \"He changed the way sports are discussed in this country\" (\"Mike & Mike,\" ESPN Radio, 1/5). ESPN's J.A. Adande wrote while Scott \"was known for bringing hip-hop vernacular to ESPN, he took pride in packing more information than anyone else into each highlight\" (ESPN.com, 1/4). MSNBC's Joe Scarborough said Scott \u201cbroke down the barrier between athletes in a way that many did not, and there are so many catchphrases that we now take for granted that he brought into the lexicon.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Willie Geist said \"SportsCenter\" anchors Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann \"deserve their place in the pantheon,\" as they \"changed the whole thing.\" Geist: \"But after that, Stuart Scott changed it again because he spoke the language that we spoke\" (\"Morning Joe,\" MSNBC, 1/5).\n\n\n\nA LASTING LEGACY: THE MMQB's Peter King writes Scott likely \"influenced as many young broadcasters today as anyone in the field.\" King: \"I bet he opened doors to scores of aspiring African-American broadcasters who thought, watching Scott, that they could do what he did, That is one great legacy to leave\" (MMQB.SI.com, 1/5). SI.com's Richard Deitsch wrote the \"biggest legacy\" Scott leaves at ESPN could be the fact his presence \"moved the company forward in terms of diversity on the air.\" ESPN's Jemele Hill said there is \"no doubt Stuart influenced a generation of journalists, especially African Americans, who were inspired by Stuart's passion and loved that he infused his own style, despite being in an industry that was unaccustomed to seeing a brash black man smoothly intertwine slang and pop culture while doing highlights\" (SI.com, 1/4). Redskins S Ryan Clark, who has contributed to ESPN, posed an entry on THE MMQB under the header, \"Stuart Scott Was My Idol.\" Clark: \"There had been black anchors and contributors on TV ... but they never referenced anything that was a part of my life. This guy wasn't just the best; he was speaking to us, and he didn't seem to care about the consequences of being himself\" (MMQB.SI.com, 1/5). Boston Herald Radio's Brad Johnson writes, \"I always worry about teetering on the edge of sounding too hood or too street when describing a spectacular play, but Stuart Scott made it possible, even necessary, to translate the playground vernacular to America's airwaves\" (BOSTON HERALD, 1/5).\n\nA TAR HEEL BORN, A TAR HEEL BRED: In Raleigh, Joe Giglio notes Scott, an alum of the Univ. of North Carolina, \"had a love for all things UNC, especially the Tar Heels basketball team.\" He \"regularly came back to Chapel Hill to host 'Late Night with Roy Williams.'\" The school \"had a moment of silence for Scott\" before yesterday's women's basketball game against N.C. State (Raleigh NEWS & OBSERVER, 1/5). Williams in a statement said, \"The fun side of just listening to him on the TV. 'Vince Carter -- Tar Heel. Antawn Jamison -- Tar Heel.' I loved that part of it. He was probably the first broadcaster in any form that could show that and it didn't bother people.\" Scott also gave the commencement speech in '01 at UNC's spring graduation (THE DAILY).\n\nTWITTER REAX: Twitter was overrun with thoughts and condolences for Scott yesterday once news of his death was announced. SI's Tim Layden wrote, \"Stuart Scott created a voice and a style. So few have done that. A rare and remarkable thing.\" CNBC's Brian Sullivan wrote, \"Stuart Scott changed broadcasting. He spoke to us, not at us.\" CNN's Brian Stelter: \"Stuart Scott was the sports broadcaster an entire generation of aspiring broadcasters wanted to be.\" Boston.com's Gary Dzen: \"For a generation that grew up alongside ESPN, Stuart Scott WAS sports television.\" MSNBC's Jamil Smith: \"I knew of many black journalists growing up. Stuart Scott was one of the few I could actually see every night.\" Yahoo Sports' Kevin Kaduk: \"A lot of broadcasters have tried to be Stuart Scott because he was so good at it. But, of course, there was only one.\" Toronto-based Sportsnet 590's Greg Brady: \"Many sports anchors bring little in terms of innovation & overdo it on the smarm & phony charm -- Scott can't be accused of any of that.\" CSN New England's Trenni Kusnierek: \"Stu Scott was so much more than catchphrases. Only the kind, special ones connect w the audience.\" ESPN Radio West Palm Beach's Ken LaVicka: \"Many, including me, did fair share of poking fun at Stu Scott. But no denying how large a figure he was to young sports fan me.\" NFL Network's Andrew Siciliano: \"When I was a kid broadcaster, we tried to imitate Marv Albert. Easier said than done. Today, every kid wants to be Stu Scott. Good luck.\"\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2015/01/05/stuart_scott_booyah_espn_sportscaster_will_be_remembered_for_exuberantly.html", "page_content": "Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images for Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational\n\nThe obituaries for ESPN sportscaster Stuart Scott have inevitably focused on one word as an emblem of his exuberantly slangy style: Booyah!\n\nScott peppered his SportsCenter highlight rundowns with many signature catchphrases, from the admiring \"cool as the other side of the pillow\" to the preacherly \"Can I get a witness from the congregation?\" But within a few years of debuting on ESPN in 1993, \"Booyah!\" had become Scott\u2019s calling card, his joyful punctuation mark for a particularly dramatic slam-dunk, homer, or touchdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEventually it was also ripe for parody. Consider the March 1999 Saturday Night Live sketch in which Tim Meadows plays Scott welcoming an excitable new anchor, played by Ray Romano, to the SportsCenter desk. After Meadows-as-Scott drops numerous booyahs, Romano\u2019s character gamely inserts his own catchphrase attempts, like \"Sweet sassy molassy!\"\n\nAs Stephen A. Crockett Jr. pointed out on The Root\u2014as did Jeremy Stahl right here in his Sports Nut piece\u2014\"Booyah!\" was indicative of the way that Scott injected the language of hip-hop into ESPN\u2019s typically whitebread sportscasts. Before Scott brought it into the mainstream, \"Booyah!\" had been chiefly associated with the West Coast rap scene, an onomatopoetic imitation of gunfire that got extended into a signal of surprise, aggressive strength, or delight.\n\nThe earliest examples of booyah (also spelled boo-yah, boo-ya, boo-yaa, boo-yeah, etc.) are all clustered in Los Angeles. (It\u2019s not to be confused with another booyah, a kind of stew popular in the Upper Midwest, or with the Navy SEAL battle cry, \"Hooyah!\") When UCLA undergrads in the late \u201980s were asked to define the word by linguistics professor Pamela Munro, they came up with \"wham, bang, crack,\" as in, \"The car hit us and booyah, my head flew into the windshield.\"\n\nIn 1989, Tone Loc, who had forsaken L.A.\u2019s gang life for a rap career, slipped the word into a song on his hit album Loc-ed After Dark. \"My rhyme is like booyah but it\u2019s not dope / And I\u2019m the type of MC to make all lose hope,\" he rapped in \"Don\u2019t Get Close.\" Oxford University Press language technologist Matt Kohl, who runs the website The Right Rhymes, suggests that he was playing off two secondary meanings of booyah: \"(something) excellent\" and \"marijuana.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe word first showed up in print in a January 1989 Los Angeles Times article about gang members getting charged with intimidation under California\u2019s Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act. One had allegedly threatened a sheriff\u2019s deputy by flashing a gang sign and saying, \"It\u2019s the last thing you\u2019ll see in the back window of your car before you hear \u2018booya, booya.\u2019 \" \" \u2018Booya\u2019 is gang slang for gunfire,\" the newspaper explained.\n\nCalifornia gangsta rappers soon solidified this as the primary meaning. Leading the way was a group that had the word in its very name: Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., six Samoan brothers from Carson, in L.A.\u2019s South Bay. One brother, Gawtti, would later explain that booyah was neighborhood slang for the sound of a shotgun, \"so we used the term to describe the impact of us on stage, blowing people away.\"\n\nOn their 1990 debut album, New Funky Nation, the T.R.I.B.E. exulted in all manner of booyahs. The first track, \"Six Bad Brothers,\" uses the word metaphorically: \"I don\u2019t need an application for this rhyme creation / A booyah to ya with the rhyme reputation.\" The second track, \"Rated R,\" is more literal: \"Booyah! It means a cry from a shotgun.\"\n\nOther L.A.-area rappers continued popularizing booyah in the early \u201990s, especially the group Cypress Hill. In 1991, they worked it into four different songs on their self-titled debut, including the single \"Hand on the Pump\": \"Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' booyah.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAthletes started getting in the booyah game, too. In 1992, when the Orange County Register asked defensive tackle Doug Reed if he was bitter about getting cut by the Los Angeles Rams, he compared himself to a boxer. \"Even if I was mad, I wouldn\u2019t telegraph it,\" Reed said. \"I\u2019d have my hand behind me like this, and then when I saw an opening\u2014booyah. That\u2019s when I\u2019d strike.\"\n\nAnd a few years later, a fictional football player memorably used the word: Rod Tidwell, Cuba Gooding Jr.\u2019s character in Jerry Maguire, yells, \"Booyah! Touchdown! I make miracles happen!\"\n\nBut by that time, booyah had already become firmly linked to Scott and his spirited play calls. Tony Kornheiser (long before he became a regular face on ESPN) tipped his hat to the word in a 1996 Washington Post column: \"As they say on SportsCenter: Boo-yah!\"\n\nWhen students at Michigan\u2019s Hope College compiled their \"Dictionary of New Terms\" in the late \u201990s, Scott\u2019s impact was undeniable. They defined booyah as an interjection used \"to express a feeling of domination by an individual who has just done something significantly good, while competing against another individual, especially in sports or video games.\""}, {"url": "https://kidadl.com/quotes/stuart-scott-quotes-from-the-beloved-sportscaster", "page_content": "\"Every day, I fight\" as Stuart Scott quotes, it was, in fact, the basis of his existence.\n\nHe was a man who believed in not surrendering to the situation; instead in fighting them.
