Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nPolish composer and educator\n\nTadeusz Szeligowski (13 September 1896 - 10 January 1963) was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer. His works include the operas The Rise of the Scholars, Krakatuk and Theodor Gentlemen, the ballets The Peacock and the Girl and Mazepa ballets, two violin concertos, chamber and choral works.[1]\n\nAs a music teacher, Szeligowski was very well established in Vilnius, Lublin, Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw. He was also a respected music writer who frequently wrote for journals and magazines specialized in music such as the Kurier Wile\u0144ski, Tygodnik Wile\u0144ski, Muzyka and the Kurier Pozna\u0144ski. His achievements include the creation of the Poznan\u00b4 Philharmonic, where he served as its first director between the years 1947-1949, and the founding of the Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring, one of the most important festivals of contemporary music at the time.\n\nLife and work\n\nMusical education\n\nTadeusz Szeligowski was born on 13 September 1896 in Lemberg, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia and now in western Ukraine. Szeligowski\u2019s first music and piano teacher was his mother. Later he began studying music at the Conservatory of Music of the Polish Society in L'vov in the years 1910-1914, where he studied piano under the direction of Vilem Kurz,[2] and then from 1918-1923 in Krak\u00f3w, where he studied piano with H. Peters, and composition with Boles\u0142aw Wallek-Walewski.[3] Szeligowski's further education included musicology with Zdzis\u0142aw Jachimecki and law at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, where he received his doctorate in 1922. There he found work as repetiteur at the Krak\u00f3w Opera House, allowing him to become well acquainted with the opera repertoire.[2]\n\nHe complemented his studies in music in the years 1929-1931 in Paris, where he met many composers of his time such as Sergei Prokofiev, George Enesco and Arthur Honegger. There he studied composition with Nadia Boulanger and orchestration with Paul Dukas.[4] There he attended many concerts and intensely experienced the latest compositions by Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, ballet productions of many famous companies, as well as highly acclaimed performances by Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.[2]\n\nMusical career\n\nIn 1923 Szeligowski worked in Vilnius, Lithuania (then part of the Second Polish Republic), as lawyer and lecturer at the Conservatory of Music. There he met Karol Szymanowski and became a great admirer of his music. He also worked with a dramatic theatre called Reduta, composing music for many of its productions.[2] Shortly after his return to Poland in 1931,[2][5] he began teaching music in Pozna\u0144 until 1939, and then moved to Lublin for a little while after World War II.[2] From 1947-1962 he worked for The State Higher School Of Music (Pa\u0144stwowa Wyzsza Szko\u0142a Muzyczna) in Pozna\u0144,[1] and from 1947-1950 he became director of the National Opera Academy, when on his own initiative the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic was created.[6] In addition, he was the initiator of the festival of contemporary music, the \"Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring\", where modern music was then presented in all its glory,[4] and one of the organizers of the H. Wieniawski International Violin Competition.[2] From 1951-1962 Szeligowski worked in Warsaw, first for the faculty of the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw, and later as director of the Polish Society of Composers.[2]\n\nA large group of his graduates on composition include: Zbigniew Bargielski, Augustyn Bloch, Joanna Bruzdowicz, Wojciech Lukaszewski, Tadeusz Wojciech Maklakiewicz, Boleslaw Ocias, Witold Rudzinski, Marek Sart, Janina Skowronska, Aleksander Szeligowski and Antoni Szuniewicz. See: List of music students by teacher: R to S#Tadeusz Szeligowski.\n\nAs a music writer\n\nLvov\u2019s musical scene at that time included a city opera, a symphonic orchestra, a music society and also a conservatory of music, and there Szeligowski was very active as a social organizer. Musicians such as Felix Weingartner and Oscar Nedbal usually visited the city and frequently performed works by Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. From 1951-1954 he served as chairman of the Polish Composers Union, and from 1953 he worked for the Board of Polish Music Publishers and the Central Pedagogical Office for Arts Education (COPSA).[7] Tadeusz Szeligowski died in Pozna\u0144 on 10 January 1963 and since 1965 he has been buried in the Pozna\u0144 Skalka crypt of Merit.[7]\n\nAwards\n\nJ\u00f3zef Kopczy\u0144ski's 1966 commemorative plaque for Polish composer Tadeusz Szeligowski.\n\nSzeligowski received numerous awards, among them:\n\n( ) : [8] Third prize at the Second Chopin Composition Competition for his Piano Sonata in D minor 1949\n\n( ) : The Prince and the girl [8] Second prize at the Polish Radio Competition for the song 1949\n\n( ) : The peacock and the girl , Arion , and the Lublin Wedding [4] State prize of the second degree for, and the 1950\n\n( ) : Rise of the scholars [4] State prize of the first degree for the opera stage 1951\n\n( ) : [7] Prize Prime Minister of Poland for his music for children and youth 1963\n\n( ) : Zwiazek Kompozytorow Polskich) for lifetime achievement (posthumous)[9] Music Award of the PCU, awarded every 17 January by the Polish Composers Union (ZKP \u2014) for lifetime achievement (posthumous) 1963\n\nAlso, he received numerous prizes and awards, including:\n\nCompositions\n\nInstrumental\n\nOrchestral works\n\nThe Peasant King -
