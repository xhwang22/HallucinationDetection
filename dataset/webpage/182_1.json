Through his rich, ornate prose and meticulous attention to detail, Wolfe evokes the peculiarities of small-town life and the pain and upheaval of leaving home. Heavily autobiographical, Look Homeward, Angel is Wolfe's most turbulent and passionate work, and a brilliant novel of lasting impact.\n\n\n\nThomas Wolfe's classic coming-of-age novel, first published in 1929, is a work of epic grandeur, evoking a time and place with extraordinary lyricism and precision. Set in Altamont, North Carolina, this semi-autobiographical novel tells the story of a restless young man who longs to escape his tumultuous family and his small town existence. (From the publisher.)\n\n\n\nMore\n\nThe novel follows the trajectory of Eugene Gant, a brilliant and restless young man whose wanderlust and passion shape his adolescent years in rural North Carolina. Wolfe said that Look Homeward, Angel is \"a book made out of my life,\" and his largely autobiographical story about the quest for a greater intellectual life has resonated with and influenced generations of readers, including some of today's most important novelists. Rich with lyrical prose and vivid characterizations, this twentieth-century American classic will capture the hearts and imaginations of every reader.

He wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He was famous during his own lifetime.\n\n\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). The Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, Wolfe's 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\n\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\n\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today. Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, \"The Return of Buck Gavin,\" was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled \"The Crisis in Industry.\" Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\n\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\n\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play, Welcome to Our City, in May 1923.\n\n\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\n\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\n\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\n\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\n\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\n\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\n\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\n\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in the New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\n\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, \"Writing and Living,\" then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\n\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\n\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\nI shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\n\n\nThe next day, the New York Times wrote:\n\nHis was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\n\nTime magazine wrote: The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\n\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in the New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\n\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\n\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both the New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\n\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although the New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\n\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\n\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.

He was educated privately and in 1916 entered the University of North Carolina, where he wrote and acted in several one-act plays. In 1920 he enrolled in George Pierce Baker\u2019s 47 Workshop at Harvard University, intending to become a playwright. Several of his plays were produced at Harvard, including Welcome to Our City (1923), in which the town of Altamont (Asheville) first appeared.\n\nIn 1923 Wolfe left Harvard for New York City, where he resided for the rest of his life. Still intending to be a playwright, he taught at Washington Square College of New York University. In 1926, while abroad, he began work on what eventually became Look Homeward, Angel, in which he recounted the growth of an autobiographical protagonist, Eugene Gant, in the mountain town of Altamont. The book was a success, though its publication caused a great furor in Asheville.\n\nDuring the late 1920s Wolfe entered into a relationship with the theatrical designer Aline Bernstein, who appeared as Esther Jack in his last two novels and who wrote of their friendship in the novel The Journey Down (1938). After the publication of Look Homeward, Angel, Wolfe quit teaching to write full-time. His second novel, Of Time and the River (1935), takes up the story of Eugene Gant from his leaving home to attend Harvard until his meeting with Esther Jack. Wolfe\u2019s memoir of his life in the 1930s, The Story of a Novel (1936), describes his close working relationship with the editor Maxwell Perkins (q.v.), who helped him reduce the enormous manuscripts of his first two works down to manageable novelistic proportions.\n\nWolfe did not publish another novel during his lifetime, though at his death he left a prodigious quantity of manuscript, from which the editor Edward Aswell extracted two more novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again (1940). These books depict the struggles of a young writer to become established in New York City and his first experiences with literary fame. A collection of Wolfe\u2019s shorter pieces and chapters of an uncompleted novel, The Hills Beyond (1941), and his Letters to His Mother (1943) were also published, as well as his Selected Letters (1956).\n\nWolfe was gifted with the faculty of almost total recall, and his fiction is characterized by an intense consciousness of scene and place, together with what is often an extraordinary lyric power. In Look Homeward, Angel and Of Time and the River, Wolfe was able to imbue his life story and the figures of his parents with a lofty romantic quality that has epic and mythopoeic overtones. Powerful emotional evocation and literal reporting are combined in his fiction, and he often alternates between dramatically effective episodes of recollection and highly charged passages of rhetoric. Though The Web and the Rock and You Can\u2019t Go Home Again contain episodes of great vividness, they are too often uncontrolled in their form and fail to sustain the epic tone of Look Homeward, Angel, which has become an American classic."}, {"url": "https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe", "page_content": "You have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become uninterested in money, compliments, or publicity.\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was a major American novelist of the early twentieth century.

If so, that will be because the world of the future will have forgotten what it was like to live in 1929. Book II, Ch. 14: Zero Hour\n\n\n\nHe who lets himself be whored by fashion will be whored by time. Book II, Ch. 21: Love is Not Enough\n\n\n\nNow they saw it \u2014 its newness, its raw crudeness, and its strength \u2014 and turned their shuddering eyes away. \"Give us back our well-worn husk,\" they said, \"where we were so snug and comfortable.\" And then they tried word magic. \"Conditions are fundamentally sound,\" they said \u2014 by which they meant to reassure themselves that nothing now was really changed, that things were as they always had been, and as they always would be, forever and ever, amen. But they were wrong. They did not know that you can't go home again. America had come to the end of something and to the beginning of something else. But no one knew what that something else would be and out of the change and uncertainly and the wrongness of the leaders grew fear and desperation and before long hunger stalked the streets. Through it all there was still only one certainty, though no one saw it yet. America was still America, and whatever new thing came of it would be American. Book III: An End and a Beginning\n\n\n\nHis enemy was time. Or perhaps it was his friend. One never knows for sure. Book III, Ch. 26: The Wounded Faun\n\n\n\nGo, seeker, if you will, throughout the land and you will find us burning in the night. Book IV, Ch. 31: The Promise of America\n\n\n\nSo, then, to every man his chance\u2014to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining, golden opportunity\u2014to every man the right to live, to work, to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make him \u2014 this, seeker, is the promise of America. Book IV, Ch. 31: The Promise of America\n\n\n\nYou can't go back home to your family, back home to your childhood, \u2026 back home to a young man's dreams of glory and of fame \u2026 back home to places in the country, back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time -- back home to the escapes of Time and Memory. Book VI, Ch. 44: The Way of No Return\n\n\n\nTo believe that new monsters will arise as vicious as the old, to believe that the great Pandora's Box of human frailty, once opened, will never show a diminution of its ugly swarm, is to help, by just that much, to make it so forever. Book VII, Ch. 47: Ecclesiasticus\n\n\n\nI believe that we are lost here in America, but I believe we shall be found. And this belief, which mounts now to the catharsis of knowledge and conviction, is for me \u2014 and I think for all of us \u2014 not only our own hope, but America's everlasting, living dream. I think the life which we have fashioned in America, and which has fashioned us \u2014 the forms we made, the cells that grew, the honeycomb that was created \u2014 was self-destructive in its nature, and must be destroyed. I think these forms are dying, and must die, just as I know that America and the people in it are deathless, undiscovered, and immortal, and must live. Book VII, Ch. 48: Credo\n\n\n\nI think the true discovery of America is before us. I think the true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come. I think the true discovery of our own democracy is still before us. And I think that all these things are certain as the morning, as inevitable as noon. I think I speak for most men living when I say that our America is Here, is Now, and beckons on before us, and that this glorious assurance is not only our living hope, but our dream to be accomplished. Book VII, Ch. 48: Credo\n\n\n\nI think the enemy is here before us, too. But I think we know the forms and faces of the enemy, and in the knowledge that we know him, and shall meet him, and eventually must conquer him is also our living hope. I think the enemy is here before us with a thousand faces, but I think we know that all his faces wear one mask. I think the enemy is single selfishness and compulsive greed. I think the enemy is blind, but has the brutal power of his blind grab. I do not think the enemy was born yesterday, or that he grew to manhood forty years ago, or that he suffered sickness and collapse in 1929, or that we began without the enemy, and that our vision faltered, that we lost the way, and suddenly were in his camp. I think the enemy is old as Time, and evil as Hell, and that he has been here with us from the beginning. I think he stole our earth from us, destroyed our wealth, and ravaged and despoiled our land. I think he took our people and enslaved them, that he polluted the fountains of our life, took unto himself the rarest treasures of our own possession, took our bread and left us with a crust, and, not content, for the nature of the enemy is insatiate--tried finally to take from us the crust. Book VII, Ch. 48: Credo\n\n\n\nThe Anatomy of Loneliness (1941) [ edit ]\n\n\"The Anatomy of Loneliness\", in The American Mercury (October 1941), p. 467\n\nThe whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, peculiar to myself and to a few other solitary men, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.\n\nWhen we examine the moments, acts, and statements of all kinds of people- not only the grief and ecstasy of the greatest poets, but also the huge unhappiness of the average soul, as evidenced by the innumerable strident words of abuse, hatred, contempt, mistrust, and scorn that forever grate upon our ears as the manswarm passes us in the streets -- we find, I think, that they are all suffering from the same thing. The final cause of their complaint is loneliness.\n\nThe surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\n\nAnd the eternal paradox of it is that if a man is to know the triumphant labor of creation, he must for long periods resign himself to loneliness, and suffer loneliness to rob him of the health, the confidence, the belief and joy which are essential to creative work.\n\nWhat Christ is saying always, what he never swerves from saying, what he says a thousand times and in a thousand different ways, but always with a central unity of belief, is this: \"I am my Father\u2019s son, and you are my brothers.\" And the unity that binds us all together, that makes this earth a family, and all men brothers and the sons of God, is love.\n\nAnd Christ himself, who preached the life of love, was yet as lonely as any man that ever lived. Yet I could not say that he was mistaken because he preached the life of love and fellowship, and lived and died in loneliness; nor would I dare assert his way was wrong because a billion men have since professed his way and never followed it.\n\nQuotes about Thomas Wolfe [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/854663.The_Autobiography_of_an_American_Novelist", "page_content": "First off, this is not the autobiography of Thomas Wolfe or anybody else. The book is two essays repurposed from two lectures. The first, titled \u201cThe Story of a Novel,\u201d was given at the University of Colorado in 1935, and describes the gestation of Wolfe\u2019s mammoth Of Time and the River. The second essay, \u201cWriting and Living,\u201d was delivered at Purdue University in 1938 during Wolfe\u2019s last public appearance before his death from tuberculosis later that year.\n\n\n\nThe essays\u2014especially the first\u2014are classic Wolfe: poetic, exuberant, luxuriant, and ridiculously loquacious. Wolfe detractors might call this style logorrhea. Wolfe himself admits that in the three years of preparing Of Time and the River, he wrote two million words and then worked the manuscript down, in \u201cskeletonized form\u201d to a million words\u2014twelve times the length of an average novel and twice as long as War and Peace (71). Fortunately, Wolfe had as his editor at Scribner\u2019s the patient and tenacious Max Perkins (1884-1947), who kept cutting as Wolfe kept writing (and whose name Wolfe never mentions in either essay).\n\n\n\nWolfe\u2019s second essay is more approachable than the first. One imagines that by 1938, Wolfe felt more comfortable in his own skin, that he had learned to reign in his grandiose tendencies and could even comfortably indulge in some humor.\n\n\n\nThough Wolfe is clear that in these lectures he had no intention of providing practical advice for young writers, I think there really is sound practical advice here. It just doesn\u2019t come with bullet points. For instance, Wolfe quotes Horace: \u201cYou can change your skies but not your soul\u201d and then follows with this explication:\n\n\n\n\u201cI saw suddenly that what many of us had been doing for years had been to change our skies constantly in the hope that by such change some magic transformation would be wrought in our own spirit; that what we had really been doing all this time when we had been going to Paris, Spain, and Italy to work was really to seek an escape, to fly from the stern necessity of conflict and of labor, somehow to get away from the indolence, the lack of substance, power, courage, or talent in our own spirits. I learned instantly and forever that this mythical, this magical, this wonder-working, miraculous, and mysterious place to work was everywhere, was all around us, was whatever we happened to be so long as the power, the will, the overwhelming and inexorable necessity to work was in ourselves.\u201d (28)\n\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s one way to put it; but I\u2019ll take Horace."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Thomas-Wolfe", "page_content": "Thomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was an American novelist of the early twentieth century.\n\nWolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the mores of that period, filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, contemporary author William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have been the greatest talent of their generation for aiming higher than any other writer. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of beat generation writer Jack Kerouac, and of authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains an important writer in modern American literature, as one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction, and is considered North Carolina's most famous writer. Ernest Hemingway, whose succinct writing style and manly voice were in many ways the opposite of Wolfe's lumbering and ruminating style, dismissed Wolfe derisively as \"the over bloated Li'l Abner of American letters.\"\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886), Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950), Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956), Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958), Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904), Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918), and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906 Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old. A member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, he predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today. Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nWolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of his play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC, while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nWolfe was unable to sell any of his plays after three years because of their great length. The Theatre Guild came close to producing Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, and Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland.\n\nOn his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. Eighteen years his senior, she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children. In October 1925, she and Wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing.\n\nWolfe returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of an autobiographical novel titled O Lost. The narrative, which evolved into Look Homeward, Angel, fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, and chronicled family, friends, and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family's surname became Gant, and Wolfe called himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza. The original manuscript of O Lost was over 1100 pages (333,000 words) long, and considerably more experimental in style than the final version of Look Homeward, Angel. It was submitted to Scribner's, where the editing was done by Maxwell Perkins, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe. Wolfe initially expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing, but he had misgivings later. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, and that Perkins, who had five daughters, found in Wolfe a sort of foster son.\n\nThe novel, which had been dedicated to Bernstein, was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929. Soon afterward, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Mrs. Bernstein. The novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume. Titled Of Time and the River, it was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In an ironic twist, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time because they hadn't been included. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe was persuaded by Edward Aswell to leave Scribner's and sign with Harper & Brothers. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work is what prompted him to leave. Others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936 he witnessed incidents of discrimination against Jews, which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. He returned to America and published a story based on his observations (\"I Have a Thing to Tell You\") in The New Republic. Following its publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government, and he was prohibited from traveling there.\n\nIn 1937, Chickamauga, his short story set during the US Civil War battle of the same name, was published. Wolfe returned to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after submitting over one million words of manuscript to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, \"Writing and Living,\" and then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boarding house in Washington, D.C. and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found among his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\nI shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\n\nThomas Wolfe is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\"\n\nPosthumous works\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, there being much unpublished material remaining after his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper & Brothers. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels ever written\" (nearly 700 pages each). In these novels, Wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important American writers, comparable to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, or William Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing\". He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W. J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner later decided that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-coochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Li'l Abner of literature.\"\n\nLegacy\n\nSoutherner and Harvard historian David Herbert Donald's biography of Wolfe, Look Homeward, won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1988.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was influenced by Wolfe, and included him as a character in his books. Earl Hamner, Jr., who went on to create the popular television series The Waltons, idolized Wolfe in his youth.\n\nHunter S. Thompson credits Wolfe for his famous phrase \"Fear and Loathing\" (on page 62 of The Web and the Rock).\n\nIn the film Genius\u2014a biographical drama about Max Perkins released in the summer of 2016\u2014Wolfe is portrayed by Academy Award\u2013nominated actor Jude Law.\n\nArchives\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nTributes\n\nReturn of an Angel, a play by Sandra Mason, explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of Look Homeward, Angel. The play was staged several times near the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in the month of October, to commemorate his birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son\". The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nHistoric landmarks\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. Wolfe called it \"Dixieland\" in Look homeward, Angel. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed by a fire set by an arsonist during the Bele Chere street festival. The perpetrator remains unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003.\n\nA cabin built by Wolfe's friend Max Whitson in 1924 near Azalea Road was designated as a historic landmark by the Asheville City Council in 1982. Thomas Wolfe Cabin, as it is called, was where Wolfe spent the summer of 1937 in his last visit to the city. In a letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Wolfe said, \"I am going into the woods. I am going to try to do the best, the most important piece of work I have ever done,\" referring to October Fair, which became The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again. He also wrote \"The Party at Jack's\" while at the cabin in the Oteen community. The city bought the property, including a larger house, from John Moyer in 2001. As of 2017, renovation is being considered and work has been done on the cabin.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote the appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe that were visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and St. Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year.

He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, reflect vividly on American culture and mores of the period, albeit filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated and hyper-analytical perspective. He became very famous during his own lifetime.\n\nAfter Wolfe's death, his chief contemporary William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have had the best talent of their generation. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of famous Beat writer Jack Kerouac, authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains one of the most important writers in modern American literature, as he was one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction. He is considered North Carolina's most famous writer.\n\nEarly life\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885\u20131886); Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887\u20131950); Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888\u20131956); Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890\u20131958); Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892\u20131904); Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892\u20131918); and Frederick William Wolfe (1894\u20131980). Six of the children lived to adulthood.\n\nThe Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. His mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis, for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever.\n\nIn 1906, Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \"Old Kentucky Home\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and later sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator.\n\nWolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old; he was a member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.[6] Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly-formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society.\n\nHe graduated from UNC with a B.A. degree in June 1920. In September of that year, he entered the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of Wolfe's play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, Wolfe received his Master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing. Wolfe continued to study for another year with Baker in the 47 Workshop, which produced his ten-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923.\n\nWolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.\n\nCareer\n\nUnable to sell any of his plays after three years due to their excessive length, including a time when the Theatre Guild came close to producing his play Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. 18 years his senior, Bernstein was married to a successful stock broker with whom she had two children.\n\nIn October 1925, Wolfe and Bernstein became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. He returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of a novel, O Lost, which eventually evolved into Look Homeward, Angel. An autobiographical novel that fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, the narrative chronicled family, friends and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \"Dixieland.\" His family was fictionalized under the name Gant, with Wolfe calling himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza.\n\nThe original manuscript of O Lost was over 100 pages and 66,000 words longer and considerably more experimental in character than the final edited version of Look Homeward, Angel. The editing was done by Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, Wolfe expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, who had five daughters and found in Wolfe a sort of foster son relationship. Perkins cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe himself.\n\nWhen the novel was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929, Wolfe dedicated it to Bernstein. Soon after the book's publication, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The publication of the novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters. Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years due to the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were also upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions.\n\nAfter four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it down significantly and create a single, bestseller-sized volume, which would be titled Of Time and the River. This novel was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In a twist from the publication of his previous novel, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time if they hadn't been included than if they had. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent.\n\nWolfe left Scribner's and signed with Harper Bros. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work prompted him to leave the Scribner imprint. Other accounts describe Wolfe's growing resentment that some attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners.\"\n\nWolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936, he witnessed discriminatory incidents towards Jewish people that upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. Wolfe returned to America and published a short story chronicling the incidents called \"I Have a Thing to Tell You\" in The New Republic. Following that publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government and he was prohibited from traveling there. Wolfe did return to Asheville in the summer of 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1938, after turning in a large body of manuscript materials, over one million words, to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the West. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, Writing and Living, then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited before. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boardinghouse in Washington, DC and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis of the brain.\n\nOn September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment under the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an attempt at a life-saving operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found in his belongings hours after his death.\n\nDespite his disagreements with Perkins and Scribner's, on his deathbed Wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to Perkins, whom he considered to be his closest friend. He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote:\n\n\"I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below.\"\n\nThomas Wolfe is interred in Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents, W.O. and Julia Wolfe, and his siblings.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times wrote: \"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\" Time wrote: \"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\" Due to his early death, Wolfe spent the shortest amount of time writing of any major novelist during that time, with a career less than half as long as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Faulkner.\n\nAfterward\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, due to the amount of the material he left at his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two further Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper and Row. The novels were \"two of the longest one-volume novels (some 700 pages apiece) ever written.\" In these novels, Wolfe switched his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber.\n\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\n\nCritical reception and legacy\n\nUpon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.\" An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since.\n\nWhen published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe.\" Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\"\n\nUpon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well-received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \"the literary event of 1935\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing.\" Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky.\" Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \"several fine novels might be written.\" He went on to say: \"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review.\n\nWhile acclaimed when alive as one of the most important American writers of equal quality to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \"all but destroyed\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \"upswing.\" He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W.J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner subsequently concluded that his novels were \"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-cooochie.\" Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \"the over-bloated Lil Abner of literature.\"\n\nTwo universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. UNC-Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture each October at the time of Wolfe's birthday to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy.\n\nThe \"Old Kentucky Home\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed in an act of arson during the Bele Chere street festival, the perpetrators still unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. Return of an Angel, by Sandra Mason, is a play that explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of his novel, Look Homeward, Angel. It was produced for several years in October, next door to the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in celebration of Wolfe's birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \"honors Asheville's favorite son.\" The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000.\n\nWolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was both influenced by and included Wolfe as a character in his books.\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society\n\nThe Thomas Wolfe Society was established in the late 1970s to promote appreciation and study of the works of this famous American author. The Society meets annually in May at locations in the U.S. or Europe visited by Wolfe. Recent conferences have been held in Greenville, South Carolina, Paris, France, and Saint Louis, Missouri. The Society issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, as well as its signature journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review, featuring scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe.\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \"Woman of the Year\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version.\n\nWolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.\n\nWorks and Essays\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolfe#Works\n\nExerpt from Wikitree Wolfe-2120:\n\nThomas Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest child of William Oliver Wolfe and Julia Elizabeth Westall His siblings were sister Leslie E.

Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?\n\nO waste of loss, in the hot mazes, lost, among bright stars on this most weary unbright cinder, lost! Remembering speechlessly we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone, a leaf, an unfound door. Where? When?\n\nO lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nA destiny that leads the English to the Dutch is strange enough; but one that leads from Epsom into Pennsylvania, and thence into the hills that shut in Altamont over the proud coral cry of the cock, and the soft stone smile of an angel, is touched by that dark miracle of chance which makes new magic in a dusty world.\n\nEach of us is all the sums he has not counted: subtract us into nakedness and night again, and you shall see begin in Crete four thousand years ago the love that ended yesterday in Texas.\n\nThe seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock, and our lives are haunted by a Georgia slattern, because a London cut-purse went unhung. Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years. The minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death, and every moment is a window on all time.\n\nThis is a moment:\n\nAn Englishman named Gilbert Gaunt, which he later changed to Gant (a concession probably to Yankee phonetics), having come to Baltimore from Bristol in 1837 on a sailing vessel, soon let the profits of a public house which he had purchased roll down his improvident gullet. He wandered westward into Pennsylvania, eking out a dangerous living by matching fighting cocks against the champions of country barnyards, and often escaping after a night spent in a village jail, with his champion dead on the field of battle, without the clink of a coin in his pocket, and sometimes with the print of a farmer\u2019s big knuckles on his reckless face. But he always escaped, and coming at length among the Dutch at harvest time he was so touched by the plenty of their land that he cast out his anchors there. Within a year he married a rugged young widow with a tidy farm who like all the other Dutch had been charmed by his air of travel, and his grandiose speech, particularly when he did Hamlet in the manner of the great Edmund Kean. Every one said he should have been an actor.\n\nThe Englishman begot children \u2014 a daughter and four sons \u2014 lived easily and carelessly, and bore patiently the weight of his wife\u2019s harsh but honest tongue. The years passed, his bright somewhat staring eyes grew dull and bagged, the tall Englishman walked with a gouty shuffle: one morning when she came to nag him out of sleep she found him dead of an apoplexy. He left five children, a mortgage and \u2014 in his strange dark eyes which now stared bright and open \u2014 something that had not died: a passionate and obscure hunger for voyages.\n\nSo, with this legacy, we leave this Englishman and are concerned hereafter with the heir to whom he bequeathed it, his second son, a boy named Oliver. How this boy stood by the roadside near his mother\u2019s farm, and saw the dusty Rebels march past on their way to Gettysburg, how his cold eyes darkened when he heard the great name of Virginia, and how the year the war had ended, when he was still fifteen, he had walked along a street in Baltimore, and seen within a little shop smooth granite slabs of death, carved lambs and cherubim, and an angel poised upon cold phthisic feet, with a smile of soft stone idiocy \u2014 this is a longer tale. But I know that his cold and shallow eyes had darkened with the obscure and passionate hunger that had lived in a dead man\u2019s eyes, and that had led from Fenchurch Street past Philadelphia. As the boy looked at the big angel with the carved stipe of lilystalk, a cold and nameless excitement possessed him. The long fingers of his big hands closed. He felt that he wanted, more than anything in the world, to carve delicately with a chisel. He wanted to wreak something dark and unspeakable in him into cold stone. He wanted to carve an angel\u2019s head.\n\nOliver entered the shop and asked a big bearded man with a wooden mallet for a job. He became the stone cutter\u2019s apprentice. He worked in that dusty yard five years. He became a stone cutter. When his apprenticeship was over he had become a man.\n\nHe never found it. He never learned to carve an angel\u2019s head. The dove, the lamb, the smooth joined marble hands of death, and letters fair and fine \u2014 but not the angel. And of all the years of waste and loss \u2014 the riotous years in Baltimore, of work and savage drunkenness, and the theatre of Booth and Salvini, which had a disastrous effect upon the stone cutter, who memorized each accent of the noble rant, and strode muttering through the streets, with rapid gestures of the enormous talking hands \u2014 these are blind steps and gropings of our exile, the painting of our hunger as, remembering speechlessly, we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone, a leaf, a door. Where? When?\n\nHe never found it, and he reeled down across the continent into the Reconstruction South \u2014 a strange wild form of six feet four with cold uneasy eyes, a great blade of nose, and a rolling tide of rhetoric, a preposterous and comic invective, as formalized as classical epithet, which he used seriously, but with a faint uneasy grin around the corners of his thin wailing mouth.\n\nHe set up business in Sydney, the little capital city of one of the middle Southern states, lived soberly and industriously under the attentive eye of a folk still raw with defeat and hostility, and finally, his good name founded and admission won, he married a gaunt tubercular spinstress, ten years his elder, but with a nest egg and an unshakable will to matrimony. Within eighteen months he was a howling maniac again, his little business went smash while his foot stayed on the polished rail, and Cynthia, his wife \u2014 whose life, the natives said, he had not helped to prolong \u2014 died suddenly one night after a hemorrhage.\n\nSo, all was gone again \u2014 Cynthia, the shop, the hard-bought praise of soberness, the angel\u2019s head \u2014 he walked through the streets at dark, yelling his pentameter curse at Rebel ways, and all their indolence; but sick with fear and loss and penitence, he wilted under the town\u2019s reproving stare, becoming convinced, as the flesh wasted on his own gaunt frame, that Cynthia\u2019s scourge was doing vengeance now on him.\n\nHe was only past thirty, but he looked much older. His face was yellow and sunken; the waxen blade of his nose looked like a beak. He had long brown mustaches that hung straight down mournfully.\n\nHis tremendous bouts of drinking had wrecked his health. He was thin as a rail and had a cough. He thought of Cynthia now, in the lonely and hostile town, and he became afraid. He thought he had tuberculosis and that he was going to die.\n\nSo, alone and lost again, having found neither order nor establishment in the world, and with the earth cut away from his feet, Oliver resumed his aimless drift along the continent. He turned westward toward the great fortress of the hills, knowing that behind them his evil fame would not be known, and hoping that he might find in them isolation, a new life, and recovered health.\n\nThe eyes of the gaunt spectre darkened again, as they had in his youth.\n\nAll day, under a wet gray sky of October, Oliver rode westward across the mighty state. As he stared mournfully out the window at the great raw land so sparsely tilled by the futile and occasional little farms, which seemed to have made only little grubbing patches in the wilderness, his heart went cold and leaden in him. He thought of the great barns of Pennsylvania, the ripe bending of golden grain, the plenty, the order, the clean thrift of the people. And he thought of how he had set out to get order and position for himself, and of the rioting confusion of his life, the blot and blur of years, and the red waste of his youth.\n\nBy God! he thought. I\u2019m getting old! Why here?\n\nThe grisly parade of the spectre years trooped through his brain. Suddenly, he saw that his life had been channelled by a series of accidents: a mad Rebel singing of Armageddon, the sound of a bugle on the road, the mule-hoofs of the army, the silly white face of an angel in a dusty shop, a slut\u2019s pert wiggle of her hams as she passed by. He had reeled out of warmth and plenty into this barren land: as he stared out the window and saw the fallow unworked earth, the great raw lift of the Piedmont, the muddy red clay roads, and the slattern people gaping at the stations \u2014 a lean farmer gangling above his reins, a dawdling negro, a gap-toothed yokel, a hard sallow woman with a grimy baby \u2014 the strangeness of destiny stabbed him with fear. How came he here from the clean Dutch thrift of his youth into this vast lost earth of rickets?\n\nThe train rattled on over the reeking earth. Rain fell steadily. A brakeman came draftily into the dirty plush coach and emptied a scuttle of coal into the big stove at the end. High empty laughter shook a group of yokels sprawled on two turned seats. The bell tolled mournfully above the clacking wheels. There was a droning interminable wait at a junction-town near the foot-hills. Then the train moved on again across the vast rolling earth.\n\nDusk came. The huge bulk of the hills was foggily emergent. Small smoky lights went up in the hillside shacks. The train crawled dizzily across high trestles spanning ghostly hawsers of water. Far up, far down, plumed with wisps of smoke, toy cabins stuck to bank and gulch and hillside. The train toiled sinuously up among gouged red cuts with slow labor. As darkness came, Oliver descended at the little town of Old Stockade where the rails ended. The last great wall of the hills lay stark above him. As he left the dreary little station and stared into the greasy lamplight of a country store, Oliver felt that he was crawling, like a great beast, into the circle of those enormous hills to die.\n\nThe next morning he resumed his journey by coach. His destination was the little town of Altamont, twenty-four miles away beyond the rim of the great outer wall of the hills. As the horses strained slowly up the mountain road Oliver\u2019s spirit lifted a little. It was a gray-golden day in late October, bright and windy. There was a sharp bite and sparkle in the mountain air: the range soared above him, close, immense, clean, and barren. The trees rose gaunt and stark: they were almost leafless. The sky was full of windy white rags of cloud; a thick blade of mist washed slowly around the rampart of a mountain.\n\nBelow him a mountain stream foamed down its rocky bed, and he could see little dots of men laying the track that would coil across the hill toward Altamont. Then the sweating team lipped the gulch of the mountain, and, among soaring and lordly ranges that melted away in purple mist, they began the slow descent toward the high plateau on which the town of Altamont was built.\n\nIn the haunting eternity of these mountains, rimmed in their enormous cup, he found sprawled out on its hundred hills and hollows a town of four thousand people.\n\nThere were new lands. His heart lifted.\n\nThis town of Altamont had been settled soon after the Revolutionary War. It had been a convenient stopping-off place for cattledrovers and farmers in their swing eastward from Tennessee into South Carolina. And, for several decades before the Civil War, it had enjoyed the summer patronage of fashionable people from Charleston and the plantations of the hot South. When Oliver first came to it it had begun to get some reputation not only as a summer resort, but as a sanitarium for tuberculars. Several rich men from the North had established hunting lodges in the hills, and one of them had bought huge areas of mountain land and, with an army of imported architects, carpenters and masons, was planning the greatest country estate in America \u2014 something in limestone, with pitched slate roofs, and one hundred and eighty-three rooms. It was modelled on the chateau at Blois. There was also a vast new hotel, a sumptuous wooden barn, rambling comfortably upon the summit of a commanding hill.\n\nBut most of the population was still n..."}, {"url": "https://allaboutheaven.org/sources/wolfe-thomas-clayton/190", "page_content": "Wolfe, Thomas Clayton\n\nCategory: Writer\n\nThomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 \u2013 September 15, 1938) was an American novelist. Despite dying at only 38, Wolfe wrote four lengthy novels, plus many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas.\n\nWikipedia\n\nHe is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the mores of that period, filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective.\n\nWhy is he on the site? J B Priestley was only slightly acquainted with Wolfe but shared many common friends. When Priestley was researching for Man and Time he came to realise that Wolfe was one of a small number of writers that had premonitions and one of the premonitions strongest in Wolfe\u2019s mind was the date of his death.\n\nMan and Time \u2013 J B Priestley\n\nIt is something that a few of us writers have noticed, especially when we have been considering other writers, who offer us the best examples because we know more about them than we do about most other men. It is that some men seem to be aware in a mysterious way how much or how little time they have at their disposal; as if deep within their being there was a clock set to tick their years away or a whispering warning calendar\n\nPremonitions of a short life\n\nWolfe was convinced he was not going to enjoy a long life \u2013 and it was no morbid premonition, but simply a \u2018knowing\u2019 which affected his whole work rate, output and social life.\n\nThe New York Times obituary:\n\nHis was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression \u2026..\n\nIt also affected his approach to relationships, as his affairs were as fast paced as his work rate. In 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1882\u20131955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. Eighteen years his senior, she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children. In October 1925, she and Wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative.\n\nWolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851\u20131922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860\u20131945).\n\nThere are many logical reasons why Wolfe should have been preoccupied with death. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business and while the family was in St. Louis, his 12-year-old brother Grover died of typhoid fever. Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. On the other hand six of the children lived to adulthood and his mother was a dynamo of energy buying first a boarding house, then buying and selling many other properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year, an event that would strongly influence his writing, but only in the sense it somehow spurred him on even more.\n\nAline Bernstein\n\nWolfe did not confine his prophetic ability to his own death. He began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old. A member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, he predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today.\n\nWe have not provided an observation as we have no specific statement from Wolfe himself, but Priestley\u2019s words ring true\n\nMan and Time \u2013 J B Priestley\n\nThomas Wolfe was a giant of a man, he died at the age of 38; and in his work and in his whole way of life he seemed to be wrestling with and raging against a profound conviction that too little time had been allotted to him. Gigantically and frenziedly he worked, filling huge ledgers with millions of words; and he played, talking and eating and drinking and making love enormously, all as if he knew he had, so to speak, to beat the clock.\n\nThe prolific work rate of Thomas Wolfe\n\nWolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, there being much unpublished material remaining after his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were \"two of the longest one-volume novels ever written\" (nearly 700 pages each).\n\nThe Return of Buck Gavin - Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course.

In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years.

Look Homeward, Angel (1929) - Wolfe returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of an autobiographical novel titled O Lost.

The original manuscript of O Lost was over 1100 pages (333,000 words) long.
