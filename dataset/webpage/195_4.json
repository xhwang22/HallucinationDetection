And thank you for joining us. I\u2019m Kathleen McInnis. I\u2019m the director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and I\u2019m a senior fellow in the International Security Program. On behalf of CSIS, I am delighted to welcome the Honorable Anita Anand, the Canadian minister of national defence, for what I know will be a phenomenal conversation on Canada\u2019s defense priorities, and some of the critical issues with which it\u2019s grappling today.\n\nFirst, though, I want to thank Citi for having the vision to partner CSIS in establishing this critically important platform to talk to incredible leaders like Minister Anand. And Minister Anand is truly incredible. Minister Anand was elected \u2013 or, has been in the role of minister of national defence since December 2021, and was elected to parliament in 2019. Prior to that, Minister Anand worked as a scholar, a lawyer, and a researcher. So she brings and enormous breadth of experience and expertise to her current position. She was also responsible for buying Canada\u2019s COVID vaccine, as minister for procurement. So she\u2019s had quite a lot on her plate for the past couple of years.\n\nSo, Minister Anand, I am so grateful that you\u2019ve come to speak with us today. So let\u2019s dive in. First, I\u2019d love to get into a little bit about your background. What inspired you to public service? Was there a specific moment that you knew that you needed to run for parliament?\n\nMinster Anita Anand: Well, thanks for having me, Kathleen. It\u2019s great to be here in Washington. I can\u2019t say that there was one specific moment. I, as you mentioned, had been a scholar and researcher and professor for about 25 years. I loved that job, as one does. You know, it was a very fulfilling life to write in the area of corporate and securities law and to be able to teach hundreds of students every year. I found myself, however, continually involved in policy issues. So I started writing reports for the federal and provincial government in the area of financial market regulation. I was writing op-eds on issues relating to corporate governance. And those op-eds were quite topical, given the importance of corporate governance, especially after the fall of Enron and especially during the financial market crash of 2008.\n\nDr. McInnis: Sure.\n\nMin. Anand: And so I was approached to run for office and initially said no, and said no again \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 a few times, and over the course of a number of months got myself around to the idea that maybe I could make a difference \u2013\n\nDr. McInnis: Sure. Sure.\n\nMin. Anand: \u2013 if I were elected. And so I tried.\n\nDr. McInnis: Yeah. Fantastic.\n\nSo I imagine that being selected to be the minister of national defence is life-transforming moment. How did you find out that you were being selected or called to perform this role?\n\nMin. Anand: Well, I was called to a meeting with the prime minister just after the election in 2021, and I didn\u2019t know what he was going to say or ask. But when he asked me, I said I would be honored to take on this role. And he continued to tell me how important a moment this is in the history and life of the Canadian Armed Forces and how he entrusted me with this role. And so, I continue to feel privileged every day to be able to lead the Canadian Armed Forces, together with the chief of defence staff, and my whole team in Ottawa.\n\nDr. McInnis: Amazing.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve been in the hot seat for a few months, how do you view your role? What do you \u2013 what priorities do you have now as minister of national defence?\n\nMin. Anand: When I was meeting with the prime minister, I had in my back pocket a list of issues that I thought were important because I had heard \u2013 there were some conversation in media that I may be appointed to this role, so I had given it some thought and had a to-do list of my own. And on that to-do list, in case I was asked, was cultural change in the Canadian military \u2013 ensuring that everyone has a place where they feel respected, and protected, and dignified in a way that they would be able to serve our country.\n\nSecondly on that list was the importance of ensuring that our military has what it needs from a resources perspective, from a support perspective, from an equipment perspective. And then, thirdly, ensuring that our multilateral relationships like NORAD, like NATO are very well fulfilled from a Canadian perspective. And those continue to be the three main priorities.\n\nOf course, February 24th is etched in our minds collectively as allies, and the war in Ukraine \u2013 Russia\u2019s illegal invasion and occupation of that country creates another layer of concern, and really determined action by the Canadian government in the area of defense and the provision of lethal aid and military aid writ large to that country.\n\nDr. McInnis: Right. Right.\n\nSo, switching gears a little bit, the Canadian Armed Forces appear to be undergoing a pretty profound moment of introspection and reform, as is reflected by the recently released advisory panel on systemic racism and discrimination report.\n\nI want to quote from the report here \u2013 apologies it\u2019s a bit lengthy \u2013 but I wanted to quote the report here because it really gets to the heart of issue in my view. And the quote is: \u201cThere is a common thread to many of the heart-wrenching stories the Advisory Panel heard. At their core are the lost \u2013 but potentially powerful \u2013 contributions of the defense team who leave the organization because the price they would have to pay to persevere in the organization would be unbearable.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if we don\u2019t get things squared away on the personnel front, we are going to keep losing talent and have a hard time recruiting it. These are issues that I think a variety of national security establishments are grappling with right now in different ways. So, I wanted to ask you about your strategic approach to dealing with this organizational cultural challenge.\n\nSo, I guess my first question is, what organizational cultural characteristics do you want to see in the Canadian Armed Forces and Ministry of National Defence? And how do you plan on getting there if you\u2019re not already there?\n\nMin. Anand: It\u2019s such an important question, and really, as I said in my last response, at the top of my list as minister of national defence.\n\nAnd what we need to continue to build is an institution where every single person regardless of background, regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of any other personal characteristic, can come to work, can put on a uniform, and can serve the country that they signed up to serve free of discrimination, free of harassment, free of sexual misconduct. And that is the type of institution we need to continue to build.\n\nAnd the report that you mentioned is very, very important, because it underlines the importance of us continuing with the effort that our \u2013 that is already underway. In budget 2021, we committed $236 million towards cultural change in the military; budget 2022, $100 million to ensure that we are continuing to address the issues that you raised in your question.\n\nAnd as a racialized woman myself, with a professional background and experience in another large institution, in private practice before that, I am fully aware of the importance of attacking this issue, and continuing to eradicate, root out discrimination in all its form in the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\nDr. McInnis: When it comes to building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce, obviously, representation is critical. Yet, there\u2019s some who would argue that we as a community spend a little bit too much time focusing on the inputs, and \u2013 to the workforce, and instead, ought to focus on outcomes, like military effectiveness and diversity of thought. How do you think about that balance? Or is there even a tension?\n\nMin. Anand: Well, I think we have to go back to what morally is right. What morally is right is that we have an institution where equity and diversity and inclusiveness are fundamental principles that are universally held. And at the current time, I would say, from my conversations with the Canadian Armed Forces, from my conversations with the chief of defence staff, we are pushing on open doors, and in fact, that is what one of the panel members said verbatim on Monday, after we released that report. And I would underscore that point, given my conversations across the country, at military bases, people agree that there is this moment \u2013\n\nDr. McInnis: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nMin. Anand: \u2013 before us, to effect change. And so I believe we have momentum, and we are going to continue to see this moral underpinning of the Canadian Armed Forces continuing to take shape.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s also the question of longevity of the forces. We need to attract talent. We need to retain talent. And how do you do that? You ensure that your institution is built on principles that are durable, and that will endure for the long term. And certainly, non-discrimination is one such principle.\n\nAnd then I would say the third point is that this principle is important for the defense of our country, for the security of our country. If we can\u2019t have an institution where everybody feels safe, and protected, and respected, our ability to defend our country and to engage in operations, domestically and internationally, is undermined. And that can\u2019t happen.\n\nDr. McInnis: Absolutely.\n\nMin. Anand: So there\u2019s a holistic approach here. And I just laid it out for you \u2013\n\nDr. McInnis: (Laughs.)\n\nMin. Anand: \u2013 in terms of what I\u2019m thinking about every day.\n\nDr. McInnis: Yeah, thank you. I happen to agree with you. I think that the national security workforce and ensuring that our people are sufficiently empowered to bring their best selves to the decision-making table is, hands down, the most important mission that we face as a community.\n\nMin. Anand: One of the AP panel members was Sandra Perron. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve read her book, \u201cOutstanding in the Field.\u201d She was a trailblazer in the Canadian Armed Forces, and a chief milestone after milestone, in terms of women holding significant positions in the forces. And her story is very much a story of having to push against closed doors. And my hope is that those doors, as I said, will continue to open, and we will see greater equity and equality and diversity in the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\nDr. McInnis: Fantastic.\n\nChanging gears a little bit to the Canadian defense strategy, it was recently announced that there\u2019s going to be another strategic review. Given that the lines between domestic and international issues gets blurrier by the day, how do you see the roles and missions of the Canadian armed forces evolving?\n\nMin. Anand: So the defense review that you just mentioned was set forth in budget 2022 announced at the beginning of April \u2013\n\nDr. McInnis: Right. Right.\n\nMin. Anand: \u2013 and at the same time our government committed an additional $8 billion in defense spending on top of the 70 percent increase in defense spending, which began in 2017 over a nine-year period. The defense policy currently in place is called Strong, Secure, Engaged, and that defense policy still remains in place and is the underpinning of many of the things we are doing right now in defense.\n\nOur procurements, for example, we have six offshore \u2013 Arctic offshore patrol ships, three of which have been delivered to \u2013 three have \u2013 are in the water. Two have been delivered. All that to say that we have a defense policy \u2013 Strong, Secure, Engaged.\n\nOn top of that, we will do an update to that policy so that we can take into account new and emerging threats such as the increasing importance of cybersecurity and surveillance, which we are currently very much engaged with Ukraine on, offering them support in that area under Operation Unifier.\n\nThose are the types of things we need to build into our defense policy and our update will reflect that.\n\nDr. McInnis: OK. So it\u2019s an update to the current policy foundation that \u2013\n\nMin. Anand: The current policy will remain in place and we will continue to look at this emerging threat environment \u2013 what do we need to continue to do from a defense perspective in light of changing global circumstances.\n\nDr. McInnis: So we read recently Hugh Segal, who\u2019s a former Canadian chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the argument that the end strength \u2013 how many troops/sailors that are in the Canadian armed forces is not sufficient to meet Canada\u2019s strategic level of ambition, especially given the blurring of the lines between domestic and international security issues.\n\nHow do you think about these questions of end strength and resources? Militaries always want more. (Laughs.)\n\nMin. Anand: So I know Hugh well. I don\u2019t agree with him on this issue.\n\nDr. McInnis: OK.\n\nMin. Anand: Let me tell you what I hear when I am visiting countries and speaking with our Canadian armed forces and other stakeholders. Other countries are continually asking for more Canada. The Canadian armed forces bring something to the table that is not represented across the board in other armed forces.\n\nFor example, we have been in Ukraine since 2015 training the Ukrainian armed forces. We\u2019ve trained 33,000 members of the Ukrainian armed forces, 2,000 members of the Ukrainian national guard. That was a decision strategically that we made after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea to say what contribution can we bring as the Canadian armed forces. We are leading an enhanced forward presence battle group in Latvia. We are one of four countries to do that.\n\nWe recently doubled our commitment in the air, on land, and at sea. We have the Halifax frigate that has just arrived there. In other words, again, people say more, more Canada \u2013 what else can you do. We have outstanding requests, actually, for more Canada on NATO\u2019s eastern seaboard.\n\nSo I will say that we have to look at the tangible footprint that Canada puts on the ground, and from this vantage point at the ministerial level I see that every day. We also have 3,400 members of the Canadian armed forces on standby ready to be called up if NATO chooses to do so. That\u2019s the type of contribution Canada will continue to make. We are there for our allies.\n\nDr. McInnis: Mmm hmm. Burden sharing is a perennial issue here in Washington \u2013 (laughs) \u2013 and burden sharing as measured by a percentage of GDP, and you just mentioned that Canada has decided to increase its defense budget by $8 billion over the coming years.\n\nCan you envision any scenarios whereby Canadian defense expenditure might further increase?\n\nMin. Anand: Well, what I will say is that with our $8 billion commitment we are just under 1.5 percent, and so the trajectory is upward for Canada at the current time. And we are committing this $8 billion on top of the 70 percent increase in defense spending over a seven-year period which began in 2017. And we are seeing tangible results from those increases. For example, I recently announced the procurement \u2013 being in the final phases of the procurement for 88 new future fighter jets, the F-35s. That is such an important procurement for our continental relationship, for our relationship in NORAD, for our potential NATO contributions as well, and that is a $19 billion commitment in Strong, Secure, Engaged, our defense policy. All that to say that the focus on 2 percent excludes some of the tangible contributions that Canada is making and, in any case, our trajectory in defense spending is on an incline. I will be coming forward with a robust package to modernize NORAD and continental defense, for example, and this afternoon I\u2019m meeting with the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, to discuss this and other issues, including Arctic security as well as the war in Ukraine.\n\nDr. McInnis: That\u2019s actually \u2013 you\u2019re sort of preempting my next question \u2013\n\nMin. Anand: (Laughs.)\n\nDr. McInnis: \u2013 which was on NORAD and how you see that command \u2013 so last year the U.S. and Canada had an agreement on NORAD modernization. How do you see that agreement being implemented? And again, how do you see the role of NORAD evolving as the security environment becomes \u2013\n\nMin. Anand: So last year \u2013 it wasn\u2019t so much an agreement, it was a statement of principles that both Canada and the United States agree to be important in the modernization of NORAD, so research in technology, working on surveillance systems such as over-the-horizon radar systems. It was more a statement of intent and we committed millions of dollars in our last year\u2019s budget to carry forward that thinking into the modernization of NORAD and continental defense more generally, which is ever so important in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in the face of climate change issues, in the face of the need for greater interoperability between our technological systems in the two countries. So we believe this to be extremely important, but we are not sitting by the sidelines and doing nothing on this at the same time as modernizing NORAD and our continental defense systems. We are also maintaining the current surveillance system. So recently our government put forward a $600 million contract with a corporation that is Inuit-run, Nasittuq Corporation, and that $600 million contract is an archetype, in fact, of the type of contract we will continue to look to as a way of engaging indigenous communities in the modernization of continental defense and NORAD.\n\nDr. McInnis: Oh, that\u2019s fascinating. How interesting.\n\nMin. Anand: It\u2019s so important, right? Like, the economic benefits of NORAD modernization must be shared, and the indigenous population in our north is extremely important to our country and to our government. And as the premier of the Northwest Territory has recently said, nothing about us without us, and that is a principle that I take to heart and our government feels is very important.\n\nDr. McInnis: Fascinating. Now we\u2019re sort of in the High North Arctic. How is climate change opening of northern sea routes or sea lanes impacting your thinking on Canadian naval presence and capabilities and capacities, especially as the Arctic becomes more passable and approachable by adversaries?\n\nMin. Anand: It\u2019s a great question. So obviously, across ministerial portfolios, we must think about how we address the climate crisis, from a climate emissions standpoint, from a melting polar ice cap standpoint, from a migration of fish standpoint, and all of that comes together in terms of what is happening in the northern climes, in the Arctic region, when, as you say, we are seeing ice flows change rapidly. And the need for our defense policy to be responsive to climate change and to see climate change as an actual security threat is extremely important and at the top of my agenda.\n\nOne of the ways we need to address this is to understand that Arctic sovereignty, writ large, becomes more important because with melting ice and greater ability to traverse the northwest passage, we are going to have other countries \u2013 Russia, China \u2013 undertake so-called research efforts in those waters. And we need to be able to respond to that. In addition, we need to understand how the seabed is mapped. We need to understand the migration of fish; how melting ice and polar ice caps is going to really affect fish migration, fish proteins, which are so important economically to the Canadian economy.\n\nSo these are the types of issues that climate change raises. And as I said, across the board \u2013 from the Canadian armed forces perspective \u2013 we need to be thinking about that, not just in terms of the Arctic. Our troops have been on the ground in forest fires, in floods. And climate change is exacting a toll on our country. And we need to address it head-on, not just from an ex-ante, proactive standpoint in terms of reducing carbon emissions by 2030, by 2050, in terms of our targets, but also in terms of addressing the here and now. What can our forces do? How are they going to respond?\n\nDr. McInnis: Right. Shifting gears to one of the biggest \u2013 well, the crisis that we\u2019re facing now \u2013 Ukraine. Canada, as you\u2019ve mentioned, has committed considerable resources to help Ukraine fight against Russia\u2019s invasion, and has been doing so since 2015, with the training mission. Is it your sense that Canada will do even more? Is the trajectory upwards in terms of \u2013\n\nMin. Anand: Yes.\n\nDr. McInnis: OK.\n\nMin. Anand: Hard yes.\n\nDr. McInnis: OK. (Laughs.)\n\nMin. Anand: We prior to the budget had committed $117 million in military aid to Ukraine. Carl Gustaf anti-tank weapons system, fragmentation vests, rocket launchers, hand grenades, and the list goes on. And in fact, we had shipments of military aid on the ground before February 24th. We were very well prepared for the potential for the invasion by Russia. Then in budget 2022, we committed $500 million to further military aid for Ukraine. And in that regard, we have procured armored vehicles that we are sending to Ukraine. I announced that this week. And we will continue to support Ukraine. For example, with our allies, sending heavy weaponry and 777 howitzers to Ukraine for the purposes of supporting this important effort.\n\nIt's not just Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and security that is at stake. It is the fundamental integrity of the rules-based international order. And my counterpart, Lloyd Austin, and I are very much aligned in terms of the urgency and importance of this situation. And we\u2019ll discuss that this afternoon.\n\nDr. McInnis: Great to hear that. Finally, to bring this fascinating conversation to a close, this is Smart Women, Smart Power. So I wanted to ask you what aspects of your job do you think are more influenced by your experience as a woman? Or do you think that being a woman in this role is influencing the way you approach the job? And if so, why? If not, why?\n\nMin. Anand: I would say that I believe fundamentally in the importance of having women at the decision-making table in many capacities, in every institution. And one the reasons I ran for office was because I believe that the demographic composition of our population should be reflected in our institutions \u2013 whether it\u2019s government, whether it\u2019s hospitals, whether it\u2019s universities \u2013 and the list goes on. And so that\u2019s the general frame that I carry with me all day every day.\n\nBut in terms of actual decisions per se, I\u2019m bringing a skillset to the table that is reflective of my background and experience and professional education and experience. And that showed itself to be the case in procurement of vaccines, in terms of having expertise in contract analysis and negotiation, and now in terms of being the minister of national defence especially in terms of governance of large institutions. And indeed, that was an area that I specialized in before becoming the minister. So it is really bringing your experiences and your knowledge to the table all the time regardless of who you are that I think is important.\n\nDr. McInnis: Fantastic.\n\nWell, the moment is extraordinary and you \u2013 and you\u2019re an extraordinary woman to be leading the Canadian Ministry of National Defence.

There is no specific procedure for his election or appointment. Article 74(1) states that there shall be a Council of Ministers with a Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President. Thus, the Indian Constitution itself recognizes a Council of Ministers. The topic, \u2018Prime Minister & Council of Ministers\u2019 is important for IAS Exam and its three stages \u2013 Prelims, Mains and Interview.\n\nThis article will mention in detail about Prime Minister and Council of Ministers who form an important part of the Union Executive.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nPrime Minister & Council of Ministers \u2013 Indian Polity Notes:- Download PDF Here\n\nIs Prime Minister of India elected or appointed?\n\nPresident of India appoints a person as the Prime Minister who is either the leader of the party which holds a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha or is a person who is able to win the confidence of the Lok Sabha by gaining the support of other political parties. All other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nNote: President can also appoint Prime Minister on his own discretion but only when no party has a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. To get the list of Prime Ministers of India, candidates can check the linked article.\n\nPower and Function of Prime Minister\n\nPrime Minister of India serves the country by following various functions.

Read more about the Chief Minister & Council of Ministers in the linked article\n\nWho is eligible to be a Prime Minister?\n\nTo become an Indian prime minister one has to be\n\nA citizen of India.\n\nA member of either Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha\n\nHe should have completed his 30 years if he is a member of the Rajya Sabha or can be 25 years of age if he is a member of the Lok Sabha\n\nPosition of the Prime Minister\n\nRight from the days of the first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister is treated at a much higher pedestal. His preeminence rests on his commanding position in the Cabinet, coupled with fact that he is the leader of the majority party.\n\nAll these positions of power when combined in one person make him rank much above an ordinary Minister. The death or resignation of the Prime Minister automatically brings about the dissolution of the Council of Ministers. It generates a vacuum. The demise, resignation or dismissal of a Minister creates only a vacancy which the Prime Minister may or may not like to fill. The Government cannot function without a Prime Minister but the absence of a Minister can be easily compensated.\n\nRelationship between the Prime Minister and the President of India\n\nThere are a few articles in the Indian Constitution that deal with the relationship both Prime Minister and the President share with each other. The articles are:\n\nArticle 74\n\nArticle 75\n\nArticle 78\n\nArticles Relationship between Prime Minister and the President 74 Mentions how the Prime Minister and President are both connected with the council of ministers. The Council with PM as head advise President on various issues. 75 Mentions three things: President appoints PM and other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the PM.\n\nMinisters hold their office during the pleasure of the President.\n\nCouncil of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. 78 PM communicates all decisions made by the council of members to the President. President can also refer issues for the consideration of the council of members.\n\nTo read more on the important articles of the Indian Constitution, aspirants may check the linked article.\n\nFacts about Indian Prime Ministers for UPSC\n\nAspirants may like to read a few facts about Prime Ministers which can come useful in UPSC 2023 while writing answers in UPSC Mains. The facts are given in the table below:\n\nLongest-Serving Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru (1947 \u2013 1964) Second Longest-Serving Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi Acting Prime Minister Twice Gulzari Lal Nanda The first woman Prime Minister to receive the Bharat Ratna Indira Gandhi First Non-Congress Prime Minister of India Morarji Desai Indian Prime Minister received Pakistan\u2019s highest civilian award Morarji Desai Youngest Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi First Prime Minister from South India P.V. Narasimha Rao First Prime Minister of India who was a member of the Rajya Sabha Indira Gandhi\n\nCouncil of Ministers\n\nWhich articles in the Constitution deal with the Council of Ministers?\n\nTwo articles \u2013 Article 74 and Article 75 of the Indian Constitution deal with the Council of Ministers. Where article 74 mentions that the council will be headed by the Prime Minister of India and will aid and advise the President, article 75 mentions the following things:\n\nThey are appointed by the President on the advice of Prime Minister\n\nThey along with the Prime Minister of India form 15% of the total strength of the lower house i.e. Lok Sabha. (The number cannot exceed 15%)\n\n91st Amendment Act provided for the disqualification of the minister when he stands disqualified as a member of Parliament. (Difference between Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha can be referred to in the linked article.)\n\nA Minister ceased to exist as one if he is not a member of either house of Parliament for six consecutive months.\n\nParliament decides the salary and allowances of the council of ministers.\n\nIs the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers\u2019 binding on the President?\n\nYes, the advice is binding on the President and this provision was introduced by the 42nd Amendment Act 1976 and 44th Amendment Act 1978. The acts also mentioned that the advice given by the council cannot be inquired into by any court. Read about the 42nd Amendment Act and the 44th Amendment Act in the linked articles given below:\n\nCollective Responsibility of the Council of Ministers\n\nIn England, the Cabinet system is based on conventions. The framers of our Constitution considered it fit to incorporate the system in the Constitution. The principle of collective responsibility finds a place in Art. 75(3) where it is stated that the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. In other words, this provision means that a Ministry which loses confidence in the Lok Sabha is obliged to resign. The loss of confidence is expressed by rejecting a Money Bill or Finance Bill or any other important policy measure or by passing a motion of no-confidence or rejecting a motion expressing confidence in the Ministry. When a Ministry loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha the whole of the Ministry has to resign including those Ministers who are from the Rajya Sabha. The Ministers fall and stand together. In certain cases, the Ministry may advise the President to dissolve Lok Sabha and call for fresh elections.\n\nTypes of Ministers\n\nThe Indian Constitution does not categorize ministers into ranks, however, in practice seen in India, ministers are of four types:\n\nCabinet Ministers\u2014He is present and he participates in every meeting of the Cabinet. Minister of State with independent charge\u2014He is a Minister of State who does not work under a Cabinet Minister. When any matter concerning his Department is on the agenda of the Cabinet, he is invited to attend the meeting. Minister of State\u2014He is a Minister who does not have independent charge of any Department and works under a Cabinet Minister. The work to such Minister is allotted by his Cabinet Minister. Deputy Minister\u2014He is a Minister who works under a Cabinet Minister or a Minister of State with independent charge. His work is allotted by the Minister under whom he is working.\n\nThe Prime Ministers is also an important static GK topic.

However, while a board may have a diverse, skilled board, the board may occasionally need some advice or guidance from a professional who has a different area of expertise than that of all of the board members. This is a prime example of how it can be helpful to have an advisory council member who can fill in that gap in expertise.\n\nSome boards decide to start a special project and need manpower with specialized expertise to get the project off the ground and see it through to completion. This is another example of how advisory boards can fill the void of time and expertise that a board of directors has difficulty filling on its own.\n\nAn advisory council may also be referred to as a committee or board. Regardless of its title, advisory councils can serve various purposes to help further an organization\u2019s mission and provide valuable benefits to boards of directors.\n\nThe Purpose of an Advisory Council\n\nBefore forming an advisory council, it\u2019s crucial for boards to decide what the advisory board\u2019s purpose will be. Common purposes for forming advisory councils are:\n\nProviding technical expertise or advice in specific areas such as technology, science, health, policy, law, marketing, public relations, etc.\n\nHelping spearhead a special project from planning to completion\n\nFundraising for a specific project\n\nProviding an independent sounding board for the board of directors\n\nServing as an advocate for the organization\n\nFulfilling several roles for a nonprofit program where the organization serves as the fiscal agent\n\nServing in an honorary role\n\nOffering services as a spokesperson for the organization\n\nWhile the purpose of an advisory council varies based on the organization\u2019s needs, all advisory councils should have a clear understanding of their purpose, guidelines and limitations.\n\nBasics of Advisory Councils\n\nAdvisory councils are a group of individuals that effectively supplement the board\u2019s skills and abilities to help guide the organization toward its stated mission.\n\nAdvisory councils don\u2019t typically have any authority. In most cases, the board of directors retains the ultimate governing authority. The primary role of an advisory board is to provide the board with key information and to make recommendations to them on certain matters.\n\nAs a collective body that\u2019s likely to have strong opinions, it\u2019s important for boards of directors to provide some type of structure for their advisory councils so that their meetings are useful and productive. It\u2019s helpful for advisory councils to have policies of their own, just as boards of directors have policies to help govern themselves. Boards may form policies for advisory board duties, meeting attendance, conflict of interest, ethics, decision-making or any other need that the advisory council has.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for advisory councils to have a governing charter. A committee charter is a useful tool for providing a written description of the council\u2019s role and purpose. The charter provides guidelines on the council\u2019s membership, meetings and how they\u2019re expected to communicate with the board. Boards should state whether the advisory council is a standing group or an ad hoc group that will only meet for a specified period of time. Certain circumstances may require specialized attention from an advisory council, so it\u2019s often helpful when an advisory council charter specifies that the council can form subcommittees as needed to address certain short-term purposes.\n\nLength of Service\n\nBoards may form advisory councils as standing bodies that the board can rely on for regular guidance and advice. Depending on the advisory council\u2019s purpose, the board may elect to make it an ad hoc council that works toward achieving a specific goal.\n\nAdvisory council members may have term limits, or they may serve indefinitely. The board generally appoints and removes members of the advisory council. The board of directors may also appoint a board chair. If they don\u2019t, an advisory council may appoint their own chairperson or rotate the chair among the council members. It\u2019s also common for at least one board director to serve on an advisory council.\n\nBenefits of an Advisory Council\n\nBoards that work closely with their council members eventually develop a deep level of trust and confidence in their guidance over time, which is a strong asset to the board.\n\nAdvisory councils can also help to create greater efficiency on the board. Organizations that are growing quickly may become too large to be effective for complex or highly specialized projects. Smaller groups, such as an advisory council, often facilitate an environment that\u2019s more conducive to productive communication and decision-making.\n\nAnother benefit of advisory councils is that they provide a forum for incoming or outgoing board directors. As terms for board directors expire, they may desire to continue serving the organization in some capacity. Boards may decide to transition board directors with expired terms from the board to the advisory council to retain the benefit of their knowledge base and expertise.\n\nIt can also be helpful for boards to consider moving advisory council members to the board as vacancies become available. Placing prospective board director candidates on the advisory council first gives boards time to develop a relationship with them and to assess their skills, commitment and capabilities before giving them a formal offer of a board seat.\n\nDo Advisory Council Members Receive Compensation?\n\nNonprofit organizations typically lack the funds to offer compensation to their advisory council members. Advisory council members of nonprofits nearly always serve on a volunteer basis, just as nonprofit board directors do.\n\nOn the other hand, corporate boards often benefit by paying their advisory council members with the goal of keeping them actively engaged and invested in the company. Paid advisory council members may be paid with a retainer or on a per-meeting basis. The average advisory council meets about four times a year.\n\nAccording to Susan Stautberg, head of a New York advisory board service, advisory board payments range from $1,000 per meeting to about $25,000 per year for big banks, plus meeting and travel expenses. Advisory council members may also receive stock options as part of their compensation.\n\nAdvisory councils are bound by the same rules for confidentiality as board directors, so it makes sense that they should use a highly secure board portal and a secure electronic communications platform to conduct their work. Since advisory boards don\u2019t meet as often as regular boards, governance software will also help them work as efficiently as possible."}, {"url": "https://www.psa.gov.in/pm-stiac", "page_content": "Introduction\n\nAn overarching council that facilitates the PSA\u2019s Office to assess the status in specific science and technology domains, comprehend challenges, formulate interventions, develop a futuristic roadmap and advise the Prime Minister accordingly.\n\nThe Office of PSA supported by the project management team at Invest India, is facilitating the delivery and progress of all Nine national missions under PM-STIAC.
