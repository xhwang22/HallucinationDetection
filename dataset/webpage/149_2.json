Brown was born in Providence in 1847. His family moved to Dover three years later, his father to work on the calico patterns at the Cocheco Print Works. It appears that the Browns were of modest means, for Elisha never attended college, but at a relatively early age he began working as a \"clerk\" at Trickey & Bickford, a local dry goods store. At age 20 he was hired as a teller at the Strafford National Bank, and from there, as they say, he never looked back.\n\nYet part of his distant Rhode Island forebears on his father's side were important figures, including the Brown brothers, merchants and sometimes slave traders, who were largely responsible for the growth of Providence and the university which eventually adopted the family name. His mother's family traced her ancestry to Roger Williams, the founder of the Rhode Island Colony. All of this allowed Brown in later life to claim membership in several prestigious historical societies, but back here in Dover, Elisha had to make it on his own, and he did do that.\n\nIn 1876, he was elected cashier of the National Bank. In the same year he was an incorporator of the Strafford Savings Bank, became vice president, and in 1891, at age 44, was chosen president. Back on the National side, he was named director in 1886, four years later vice president, and in 1897 president of that bank as well. Presumably, bankers in those days were paid well, and it appears that Brown invested wisely, but a review of his life, his associations, and his involvement in the community makes it clear that he became a man of some considerable wealth. In the meantime, his father had also moved on to greater things: during the Civil War he served on the Commissary Department of the Union Army, and was then appointed Superintendent of the Government Grounds in Washington, DC, a post he held until 1898. Elisha, however, remained in Dover.\n\nThe family home was at 50 Silver St. where, according to one observer, \"everything is arranged for comfort\". There were a number of children. The eldest, Alphonso Bickford Brown, a graduate of Yale and the Harvard Medical School, opened a medical practice in Newburyport. Harold Winthrop Brown who, after receiving his degree from Harvard, returned home and joined his father at the bank. There were twins: Raymond G. and Philip C., both also Harvard grads, the latter married Marguerite, daughter of Frank B. Williams, and thereafter \"engaged in business with his father-in-law\" at I.B. Williams, the mid-town industrial belt factory.\n\nElisha served as President of the Trustees of Franklin Academy, a private school in existence since 1818, set back some distance from Central Ave, between what is now Orchard and Waldron Streets. The school closed in 1896 and the property, which included the academy building \u2014 one of the earliest brick structures constructed in Dover \u2014 was purchased by I.B. Williams, then under the management of Frank (in the later 20th century it became the site of United Tanners). The proceeds of the sale were held by the Trustees and later used for the purchase of land from the Estate of William Hale, the land then donated to the City as the location for a new high school (now the McConnell Center) and a library. The story of the library is a good example of how things got done in town and the degree of Elisha Brown's influence and participation.\n\nThere may have been a private \"library\" as far back as when Jeremy Belknap served as Minister at the First Paris Church. It's likely this involved mostly religious tracts, but with donations from parishioners and others the collection grew and as it did the location moved several times to larger quarters. At one time it was to be found in space provided by the Cocheco Mfg. Co., and eventually housed in a portion of the Odd Fellows building on Washington Street. It's probably no coincidence that Elisha Brown was, for a time at least, President of the Library Society and an Odd Fellow. Then, as noted, Brown was the head Trustee of the Franklin Academy fund that was used to buy the land that became the location, in 1906, of the new Carnegie Library on Locust Street, and one of the Trustees was of the new library was none other than Elisha Brown. Once the public library opened Brown made a substantial donation of books from his own personal library at 50 Silver St. which, according to one report, exceeded 8000 volumes. (Another of the first Library Trustees was Thomas Garland, who served as librarian briefly, but gave way to his daughter, Caroline, who remained Librarian for the next 50 years.)\n\nWhat else did Elisha do?, you may ask. So in no particular order, here is a partial list of his accomplishments:\n\nA member of the First Parish Church at least as of 1873, chosen as a deacon in 1885, a position he retained until 1911. A Director of the Cocheco Manufacturing Co. at the time the business was sold to the Pacific Mills. Director of several railroads, including but not limited to the Portsmouth & Dover, the Dover & Winnipisaugee, Concord & Portsmouth, and the Maine Central.\n\nOne of the original Trustees of Pine Hill Cemetery, together with Charles H. Sawyer, and Henry Law, and with B. Frank Neally serving as Treasurer. A Trustee of the Wentworth Home (also with Henry Law), and following the construction of the new building on Locust St. he served on the Board of the Dover Children's Home.\n\nOne of the founders of the Dover Historical Society, Vice-President of the NH Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a member of the Auduborn Society, the National Geographic Society, and by virtue of his and his wife's ancestral heritage, the New England Geneological Society.\n\nA member of several of the local Masonic Lodges., and the Bellamy Club, the exclusive men's gathering place which was on the top floor of Elisha's bank (as President of the bank he would have been the landlord\u2026).\n\nFinally, as befits a man of his station, according to my list of 1912 auto registrations, Elisha was the owner of a 32.4 h.p. Cadillac, a long way from an 18-year-old clerk at Trickey & Bickford.\n\nTony McManus is a Dover native. He is a former trustee of the Woodman Institute and an amateur student of Dover\u2019s past.

Every Tagged as Cheese\n\nFood & Drink Have we missed something?\n\nThey can be found in the supermarket, they are often a common appearance during the holidays, and if you\u2019re like many people, you may be wondering precisely what purpose they serve?! That\u2019s right, this is all about that mysterious, delicious party food called the Cheeseball!\n\nFor those who are considering just how many occasions really call for a bit of cheddar cheese rolled in roasted almond slices, the people who support National Cheeseball Day believe that the answer is ALL of them!\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that cheeseballs can also be those little, round, shockingly orange corn puffs that are covered with powdered cheese! Definitely a younger person\u2019s idea of what a cheese ball is, this is still a legitimate snack to appreciate.\n\nWhichever style is chosen or preferred, National Cheeseball Day celebrates these odd little culinary mainstays and encourages everyone to explore the history behind them and how they came to be what they are today.\n\nWho knows? National Cheeseball Day may even find a lot of unlikely people creating their own cheeseballs and adding them to their regular fare!\n\nHistory of National Cheeseball Day\n\nThe background of National Cheeseball Day starts at an unusual point in history\u2013when the first cheese ball appeared at, perhaps one of the most unexpected of places, the White House.\n\nIn the early 1800s, there was a farmer by the name of Elisha Brown, Jr. who was seeking to present an unusual gift to then President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. So it was this desire that allowed an unbelievably massive ball of cheese to wind up on the White House lawn.\n\nHow massive? 1,235 pounds to be exact! Now that is a huge ball of cheese. It\u2019s a little wonder that it eventually became known as \u201cThe Mammoth Cheese\u201d.\n\nFrom that point, the cheese ball seemed to have disappeared into culinary history for nearly 150 years. It then had the good fortune to resurface in 1944 in a book by Virginia Safford called Food of My Friends. In this book, a recipe was included for the Cheese Ball, and it wasn\u2019t long after that it found itself a staple of cuisine.\n\nCan it truly be considered a cuisine, though? Well, that description does seem to require that there is more than one variation, doesn\u2019t it? And the experience of most people, is that they have probably only seen the variety that\u2019s rolled in toasted almonds. Believe it or not, though, there are hundreds of varieties of cheese balls available for every imaginable occasion!\n\nCheeseballs can be made of almost any kind of cheese, and then rolled in almost anything that can be imagined! Perhaps there isn\u2019t even an \u201calmost\u201d to be said here. Some people have made cheese balls rolled in crushed Oreos, sparkly confetti topping, diced onions, peppers and garlic.\n\nAnything that goes well with cheese (and perhaps a few things, like Oreos, that wouldn\u2019t normally be thought of as \u2018good with cheese\u2019?) can be repurposed into the coating for a cheese ball.\n\nGetting creative and exploring new tastes, while also offering a nod to the classics, is what Cheese Ball Day is all about!\n\nHow to Celebrate National Cheeseball Day\n\nCelebrating National Cheeseball Day means not only eating cheeseballs, but also enjoying other \u2018cheesy\u2019 things as well! Try out these ideas:\n\nEnjoy Eating a Cheese Ball\n\nThe best way to celebrate National Cheeseball Day is simply to indulge in the delicious treat that is the cheeseball. Get your favorite dipping implement, whether that\u2019s crackers, bread, or even bits of meat, and go to town with a cheese ball.\n\nOther delectable items that can be dipped into a cheeseball include:\n\nSlices of apple or pear\n\nPretzel sticks or pretzel twists\n\nToasted mini bagel chips\n\nPita triangles\n\nFresh vegetables (carrot sticks, celery sticks, cauliflower)\n\nGraham Crackers (for the sweeter cheese balls)\n\nMake a Cheese Ball at Home\n\nDo a little bit of research and create a unique, culinary cheeseball creation at home to share it with friends, family, neighbors or coworkers. Remember, little events like this are always popular at the office, and imagine how many types of cheese balls can be discovered then! (Or\u2026 maybe there will just be a lot of almond covered ones.)\n\nA traditional cheese ball appetizer includes ingredients such as cream cheese, cheddar cheese, brie, sour cream, garlic powder and other spices. Some people like to create a spicy version that uses hot pepper sauce. Other people like to include a splash of Worcester sauce. Add Thai Sweet Chili sauce and serve with wontons!\n\nThrow a Cheeseball Party\n\nFor those people who have a collection of friends who enjoy a \u2018fortified blog of cream cheese\u2019, the only option is to grab a friend and host a fun and exciting cheese ball party!\n\nOf course the main food that is served must be cheeseballs, but that doesn\u2019t\u2019 have to be boring. There can be cheeseballs made in the normal way, but other options include an Asian theme, Pepper Jack, Hawaiian theme (with pineapple, of course), Cranberry Pecan and even dessert cheeseballs made with Oreo cookies!\n\nAt this party, feel free to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 film, which features an excellent scene where Alvin converts the song \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d into an entire montage about being a Cheese Ball Man!\n\nSince the theme of the party is everything cheese, have guests wear their \u2018cheesiest\u2019 clothes, and don\u2019t forget to play \u2018cheesy\u2019 music!

They eventually embraced Quakerism, and Mary repeatedly returned to Boston to preach the new doctrine in defiance of the Puritan magistrates. Such persistence earned her martyrdom.\n\nAmong the Dyers other famous ancestors was a prior Elisha (1772-1854), a textile manufacturer who founded and operated the Dyerville Mill in North Providence.\n\nThe first governor Dyer, despite being an invalid for the thirty-five years preceding his death in 1890, excelled in many walks of life\u2013businessman, musician, world traveler, banker, railroad magnate, philanthropist, and a civic leader who was involved with innumerable boards and commissions, as well as with the temperance movement. He served as state adjutant general for the Law and Order government during the Dorr Rebellion and was elected Republican governor of Rhode Island in 1857 and 1858, declining reelection in 1859. When he left office the Providence Post, a leading Democratic paper, admitted that \u201cWe have from the first looked upon him as an honorable, high-minded opponent and a straightforward conscientious man; and candor compels us to say that he has never failed to reach the standard set up for him.\u201d\n\nDyer, Elisha, 1839-1909\n\nThe second Governor Elisha Dyer (1839-1906) carved out a career that paralleled that of his father.

Nonetheless, he maintained his interest and involvement with the military, eventually serving as Rhode Island adjutant general from 1882 to 1895 and later compiling a valuable reference book on The War With Spain.\n\nA prominent Republican, Dyer was elected governor in 1897 and won reelection in 1898 and 1899. At various times during his amazingly successful career he won election as Providence school committeeman, alderman, state representative, and state senator. In 1905, a year before his death, he was chosen Mayor of Providence, thereby rounding out a political career unequaled in the annals of his native city.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss313.htm", "page_content": "Historical note:\n\nHistorical Note:\n\nMoses Brown (1738-1836) was an influential opponent of slavery; patron of education, religion and agriculture; and prominent Quaker. He also was a central figure in the birth of the Industrial Revolution, founding what was generally considered to be the first factory in America. In a busy life that spanned 98 years, he was prominent in virtually every aspect of life in his home town of Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nMoses Brown was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the youngest son of James and Hope (Power) Brown. He was the grandson of Baptist minister James Brown (1666-1732), and his father was a prosperous merchant. His father died in 1739, and Moses was raised in the family of his uncle Obadiah Brown (1712-1762). From age 13 to 22, he was an apprentice in his uncle\u2019s firm, Obadiah Brown & Co. In 1760, he became a full partner, and was primarily responsible for running the firm\u2019s spermaceti works. The firm was also active in distilling rum, owned an iron furnace, and took part in a wide variety of merchant activities including at least one slave voyage in 1759. Obadiah Brown died in 1762, and Moses Brown served as executor of his estate. Shares in the company were divided between Moses Brown and his three brothers, Nicholas, John and Joseph; it was renamed as Nicholas Brown & Co. This new firm quickly began involved with the slave trade, with Moses as an active partner. Their ship Sally left for Africa in 1764, and on the return trip most of the slaves died at sea from disease or were killed during unsuccessful revolts. After this one disastrous voyage, the firm does not seem to have had any direct involvement in the slave trade.\n\nMoses Brown married his cousin Anna Brown (daughter of his uncle Obadiah) in 1764. They had two surviving children: Sarah (1764-1794, married William Almy) and Obadiah (1771-1822), as well as a daughter who died young. Moses also served as a deputy to the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1764 to 1771, and served on a committee to oppose the Stamp Act in 1765. In 1769, he was active in efforts to move Rhode Island College to Providence from the town of Warren. The four Brown brothers donated family land for the new campus. Much later, after a generous donation from Nicholas Brown Jr., the school was renamed Brown University.\n\nBrown\u2019s wife Anna died in 1773. He gradually retired from the family business and began attending Quaker meetings. The following year he formally became a member of the Society of Friends. As a Quaker, he began a lifelong crusade against slavery, and soon became the leading opponent of the slave trade in Rhode Island. He freed his own slaves in 1773. As his brother John Brown was one of the state\u2019s leading slave traders, this caused some interesting tensions in the family. During the Revolution, Brown was active in New England Yearly Meeting\u2019s efforts to provide financial assistance to war refugees. He also led the efforts to start a Yearly Meeting School for Friends\u2019 children; it operated from 1777 to 1779, and then in Portsmouth, R.I. from 1784 to 1788, but lack of funds closed it both times.\n\nIn 1779, Brown married his second wife, Mary Olney, a fellow Quaker. They were married for 18 years, and had no children.\n\nAt the close of the war, Brown renewed his efforts against the slave trade. He unsuccessfully petitioned the General Assembly in 1783, wrote frequently in the local press, and helped distribute antislavery pamphlets throughout New England. He was instrumental in the 1787 passage of a law banning the participation of Rhode Islanders in the slave trade. In 1789, he helped found the Providence Society for Abolishing the Slave Trade with both Quaker and non-Quaker associates to help enforce this new law. He later helped to get a law passed in the U.S. Congress to forbid foreign slave ships from being equipped in American ports. He also became known for his willingness to help slaves and free blacks on an individual basis, through financial and legal assistance.\n\nIn 1788, Brown returned briefly to the business world, embarking on a textile venture in partnership with his cousin Smith Brown and his future son-in-law William Almy. Moses Brown became interested in the recent British attempts to use water power in their textile mills, and hired English emigrant Samuel Slater to help build a similar mill in what is now Pawtucket. In 1790, this became the first water-powered spinning mill in America, an event generally considered the birth of our Industrial Revolution. Moses\u2019 son Obadiah Brown soon replaced Smith Brown as a partner, and Samuel Slater was taken in as well, forming the new firm of Almy, Brown & Slater. Moses Brown soon withdrew from active involvement in the firm, but remained a partner.\n\nAfter getting Almy, Brown & Slater off the ground, Moses Brown moved on to a variety of new activities. He played a role in Rhode Island\u2019s ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1790. He also became interested in agricultural experiments on his Providence farm, and helped found the Rhode Island Agricultural Society in 1800. He served on the first board of directors of the Providence Bank, and was treasurer of the Central Bridge Company. He also was, with his son Obadiah, a founder of the Rhode Island Bible Society. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, he was a strong advocate of sanitary measures, and later introduced smallpox vaccination to Rhode Island.\n\nBrown\u2019s second wife Mary died in 1798, and he married his third and final wife, the widow Phebe (Waterman) Lockwood, in 1799. She had several grown children of her own: Sarah (1773-1832, married E. Bates Harris), Avis (1774-1831, never married), Benoni (1777-1852) and Phebe (1778-1800). After the death of his third wife in 1809, Moses remained unmarried for the last 27 years of his life.\n\nBrown was inspired by the War of 1812 to work on behalf of peace, and was instrumental in the founding of the Rhode Island Peace Society in 1818. Another interest was local history. He played an important role in collecting the documents relating to colonial Rhode Island, many of them inherited through his own family. He was a founding member of the Rhode Island Historical Society, served as its chairman, and had most of his papers left there after his death.\n\nBrown\u2019s last great contribution to Rhode Island life was his role in the revival of the New England Yearly Meeting School. It had existed intermittently in the 1770s and 1780s, but died out through lack of interest. In 1814, Brown presented the Yearly Meeting with 43 acres of land in Providence, and worked diligently toward the creation of a school on this land. He rendered important financial assistance, and also donated his impressive book collection to the school library. His son Obadiah was a major supporter of this effort until his untimely death in 1822. Moses Brown served as the school\u2019s treasurer until shortly before his own death in 1836, at the age of 98. The school was later renamed in his honor as the Moses Brown School, and remains the leading preparatory school in the state.\n\nMoses Brown left few family members, having outlived three wives, all three of his children, and three of his four step-children. At his death, his only descendants were his granddaughter Sarah (Almy) Jenkins (1790-1849) and her children. He also left much of his estate to the children of his stepdaughter Sarah (Lockwood) Harris (1773-1832), and to the Society of Friends. His son Obadiah had married, but had not left any children.\n\nWhile Moses Brown was an important historical figure for many reasons, his anti-slavery activities are probably best remembered. It is easy to defend those who profited from slavery as products of their time. Moses Brown stands as a shining example of a man who refused to profit from the horrors of slavery, long before such stands became fashionable. Through his efforts none of his peers could claim ignorance of the moral dimensions of the slave trade. Though in many ways he was a generation or two ahead of his time, he was more than a voice in the wilderness; he helped pass important legislation and was an influence on the next generation of abolitionists.\n\nBibliography:\n\nBulkley, Abby Isabel (Brown).

Providence: Rhode Island Historical Society, 1987.\n\nScope and Content:\n\nThis collection is arranged into five series:\n\nSeries 1: Correspondence. Chronologically Arranged, 1753-1836\n\nSeries 2: Subject Files. Alphabetically arranged, 1707-1867\n\nSeries 3: Genealogical and Historical Collection, 1636-1836\n\nSubseries 1: Indexed in the 1887\n\nSubseries 2: Not indexed in 1887\n\nSeries 4: Bound Volumes, 1750-1836\n\nSeries 5: Indices\n\nThe largest and most important is the correspondence series, which includes thousands of letters to and from Moses Brown from 1753 to 1836. Dozens are with his brother John Brown, and often discuss the slave trade. One particularly interesting letter from John dated November 27, 1786 attempts a lengthy moral justification for the trade. Many of the other letters in this series refer to the slave trade, especially after 1796. Other important topics include the Brown family spermaceti works; cotton manufacturing (especially circa 1790); the Society of Friends (Quakers); and state and local politics. There are also many letters to Brown asking for advice, legal assistance or financial support.\n\nThe subject files are arranged thematically, and cover everything from property records to research notes on yellow fever. Four folders titled \"Anti-slavery\" are of particular interest. The historical series, consisting of documents collected by Brown to satisfy his historical curiosity, is very miscellaneous in nature, but is an important source on early colonial Providence. The fourth series contains bound volumes: account books, diaries and school books. Series 5 includes the early indices compiled for the collection as a whole.\n\nProvenance:\n\nThe bulk of this collection arrived in 1851 from the heirs of Moses Brown; this accession probably comprised the full 18 scrapbook volumes of the Moses Brown Papers that had been compiled by 1889. A gift of business account books came from the Moses Brown School in 1914. \u201cA large quantity\u201d of Moses Brown papers was donated in 1919 by Mrs. Austin Fox, Brown\u2019s great-great-granddaughter, in 1919; this included several plats. Numerous other gifts dating from 1839 onward have been integrated into the collection. For a more detailed discussion of the provenance of this collection, see the note in the collection file at the repository.\n\nProcessing Note:\n\nCirca 1880, most of this collection was mounted in 18 scrapbooks. A calendar and index were compiled in 1887. There were 14 volumes of correspondence, three volumes titled \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d, and one for the genealogical and historical material. Each item in the scrapbooks was stamped \u201cRhode Island Historical Society\u201d in red, and a number assigned. Many old citations are made using these numbers, so a listing of the original arrangement might be useful.\n\nOld volume I. Correspondence, 1735-1770 #1 - #273\n\nOld volume II.

Genealogical and historical collection.\n\nAround 1950, the collection was removed from these scrapbooks, and a wide variety of other material was integrated into the collection. Item numbers were written in pencil on the items from the historical collection. The whole collection was reorganized circa 1980, and assumed roughly its present form. A rough finding aid was compiled in 1993. Beginning in 1995, the John Nicholas Brown Center for the Study of American Civilization at Brown University, in partnership with the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University and the Rhode Island Historical Society, conducted a two year collaborative project to arrange, describe and catalog records relating to the Brown family of Providence, Rhode Island. The Brown Family Papers Project was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This collection was processed as part of that grant.\n\nA separate collection of Moses Brown papers is in the possession of the Archives of the New England Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends (the Quakers); it is referred to as the Austin Collection of Moses Brown Papers. This collection is only one linear foot in volume, but contains important material. It relates largely, but not exclusively, to Moses Brown\u2019s involvement in the Society of Friends. A separate inventory and item index is available.\n\nInventory:\n\nSeries 1: Correspondence.\n\nThis correspondence is indexed through a card catalog at the repository.

He was the son of James and Mary (Harris) Brown, and the great grandson of early Rhode Island settler and Baptist minister Chad Brown. Brown was a member of the General Assembly, and possessed a large property, which was lost during the financial difficulties of the mid-18th century. During the Ward-Hopkins controversy, he sided with Samuel Ward, and during Ward's term as governor from 1765 to 1767, Brown was selected as his deputy governor.\n\nLater in life, Brown moved to Wenscutt, located in North Providence, Rhode Island, and became a member of the Society of Friends. He had first married Martha, the daughter of John and Deborah (Angell) Smith, and a great granddaughter of both colonial president Gregory Dexter as well as Roger Williams' associate Thomas Angell. Following her death, he married Hannah Cushing, the widow of Elijah Cushing, and the daughter of James Barker.\n\nHe was the uncle of wealthy businessman John Brown and anti-slavery activist Moses Brown.\n\nAncestry [ edit ]\n\nMost of Brown's known ancestry is found in Austin's Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island.\n\nAncestors of Elisha Brown 8.
