That may seem like a drastic stance given the debate over censorship and free speech that has accompanied these types of purges. But it\u2019s one that signifies just how notorious the book has become, and how much real-world damage it\u2019s arguably caused.\n\nWritten and self-published by a racist man who founded a dangerous white supremacist organization, The Turner Diaries has long been viewed as a fundamental manual of extremism. While other more well-known cultural artifacts like The Catcher in the Rye (a favorite of presidential and other assassins) or The Anarchist Cookbook (a well-known \u201cmurder manual\u201d for terrorists, mass shooters, and other extremists) have captured the public consciousness as bait for potentially violent, disaffected loners, The Turner Diaries has been little-known for decades outside of extremist circles. But within those extremist circles, it became well-established as a core text due to its use as, essentially, a training manual for America\u2019s largest neo-Nazi organization \u2014 and then the internet made it more accessible than ever.\n\nAlthough The Turner Diaries is fiction, its narrative mirrors recent real-world events, probably because many modern-day extremists have been so influenced by it. We can see that influence in the most direct and chilling way \u2014 because, among other things, The Turner Diaries ends with a violent terrorist coup against the US government, not unlike the January 6 Capitol insurrection. But while The Turner Diaries is foundational to modern white supremacy\u2019s terrorist tactics, it may have shaped the ideology even more \u2014 and that\u2019s an influence that will be harder to remove than the book itself.\n\nThe Turner Diaries was written by an avowed neo-Nazi\n\nThe Turner Diaries was first published in its entirety in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The real author was William Luther Pierce \u2014 a racist man the hate-watch group Southern Poverty Law Center dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important Nazi\u201d of the 20th century. It would be hard to overstate Pierce\u2019s galling contributions to the cause of US white supremacy \u2014 and that\u2019s without considering The Turner Diaries.\n\nBorn in Atlanta in 1933 and raised in Virginia and Alabama, Pierce reportedly claimed to be descended from a Civil War governor, and attended a military high school in Texas before going on to attain a doctorate in physics. According to an offensively obsequious 2001 biography of Pierce \u2014 in which author Robert Griffin extensively quotes Pierce spouting unchallenged white supremacist propaganda \u2014 Pierce was raised for part of his childhood by a relative who had a Black person who\u2019d been convicted of a crime working for him who \u201cin effect was his slave.\u201d Racism was a consistent part of Pierce\u2019s upbringing and his political pursuits, and he eventually left a career as a rocket scientist in 1966 to invest more deeply in American Naziism.\n\nHe first joined the American Nazi Party, then gradually latched onto a different group created in support of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace and his 1968 presidential election campaign. Pierce evolved that organization into what ultimately became, in 1974, a group called the National Alliance. The group grew rapidly and gained influence at home and abroad, as Pierce preached dire warnings about how a rise in diversity and the societal changes of the civil rights movement would bring about \u201cthe end of white America.\u201d\n\nThrough the National Alliance, Pierce ran his own underground media empire, including a newspaper, a book press, a radio station, and an extremist record distributor \u2014 all to broadcast his message of violent white nationalism. His efforts worked. In a report published in 1998, the Anti-Defamation League noted, \u201cWith 16 active cells from coast to coast, an estimated membership of 1,000 and several thousand additional Americans listening to its radio broadcasts and browsing its Internet site, the National Alliance is the largest and most active neo-Nazi organization in the nation.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s goals, the ADL reported, were to establish \u201ca racially clean area of the earth\u201d and to \u201cdo whatever is necessary to achieve this White living space and to keep it White.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s biography reveals Pierce to be a man isolated by his own heinous ideas. Late in his life, he was estranged from both of his sons and was living in rural West Virginia with a lonely young wife with whom it seemed he could barely communicate. She was the latest in a string of Eastern European wives, all of whom he\u2019d chosen based on his belief that Eastern European women were more subservient to men than American women. At the time of his death in 2001, he was reportedly living alone.\n\nBut Pierce\u2019s impact on the national political landscape was far more lasting than his personal relationships.\n\nThe Turner Diaries became exactly what it was intended to be \u2014 a manual for violence\n\nThe Turner Diaries began as a fictional adventure series that Pierce published in the National Alliance newspaper, Attack, starting in 1975. A dystopian novel set in a future version of America, it follows the journal entries of a man named Earl Turner as he turns to increasing violence in his resistance to the US government as part of a group called the Organization.\n\nIn Pierce\u2019s scenario, Turner is fighting an orgiastic ultraconservative fantasy of an unchecked liberal future: The government confiscates all guns from private citizens and pursues resistors using a force called \u201cthe Equality Police.\u201d The media and Hollywood operate as untrustworthy left-wing propaganda, while racial and ethnic minorities gain power and enact anti-white laws. The back cover of the book asks readers, \u201cWhat will you do when they come to take your guns?\u201d\n\nThe book contains lurid, graphic violence carried out against liberals, government officials, members of the media, and Black and Jewish citizens. It gleefully urges white militias to rise up and engage in guerrilla warfare against the oppressive government \u2014 think the \u201980s action movie Red Dawn, in which Russia invades the US and small-town civilians fight back with renegade tactics, but with more racism and bloodlust. Among other things, the book features car bombings, suicide missions, and one scene in which white supremacist terrorists hang politicians en masse \u2014 a scene that some experts felt had echoes in the Capitol insurrection, during which a gallows was erected amid calls to hang certain elected officials.\n\nThe book chillingly culminates in Turner planning to fly a plane into the Pentagon in a suicide bombing mission \u2014 an act the narrative tells us ushered in a \u201cNew Era\u201d of white supremacist rule and made Turner a national folk hero to the subsequent Aryan civilization.\n\nBy all accounts, Pierce intended the book to be influential, more than just a work of fiction, and it was. In many chapters of the National Alliance, the book was required reading and was essentially presented to new members as an instruction manual. Pierce also intended it to glorify violence against nonwhites and progressives. The ADL report quoted a 1997 radio broadcast in which Pierce said:\n\nIn 1975, when I began writing The Turner Diaries ... I wanted to take all of the feminist agitators and propagandists and all of the race-mixing fanatics and all of the media bosses and all of the bureaucrats and politicians who were collaborating with them, and I wanted to put them up against a wall, in batches of a thousand or so at a time, and machine-gun them. And I still want to do that.\n\nAfter its serial publication, Pierce published The Turner Diaries in novel form in 1978 through his own independent press, after which it circulated underground for over a decade, known mainly only to white nationalists, extremists, and the people who kept a close watch on them. By the late 1980s, an advertisement for the book had appeared in the extremist survivalist magazine Soldier of Fortune, making it available via mail order. That\u2019s how it ended up in the hands of an Army recruit named Timothy McVeigh.\n\nLater, at McVeigh\u2019s trial for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing \u2014 the worst terrorist attack on US soil prior to 9/11 \u2014 McVeigh\u2019s fellow soldiers would testify that he was obsessed with the book and pored over it constantly. He sold copies of the book at gun shows, and mailed others to friends and family urging them to read it.\n\nOne of them did read it, and later recognized McVeigh\u2019s attack on the Oklahoma City federal building as drawing straight from The Turner Diaries\u2019 terrorist template. When authorities arrested McVeigh, they found excerpts from the book in his car.\n\nMcVeigh\u2019s terrorism is the most famous, but it\u2019s far from the only Turner Diaries-influenced act of extremism or racist violence. These range from lone individual hate crimes to at least one mass assault to numerous crime rings.\n\nOne group of domestic terrorists operating in the \u201980s called itself \u201cthe Order\u201d after one of the fictional militias in the book, which they referred to as a bible. Their ringleaders were former members of Pierce\u2019s National Alliance, and they allegedly hoped their acts of violence might help usher in the dystopian uprising fictionalized in The Turner Diaries.\n\nIn 1998, another group of National Alliance members planned to detonate 14 bombs across the city of Orlando, including one at the entrance to Walt Disney World; they failed when one of the would-be bombers accidentally set off one of the bombs as he was building it. The Southern Poverty Law Center cites at least 14 terrorist acts linked to the National Alliance between 1983 and 2005.\n\nMuch of this activity, crucially, took place before the internet, which of course made it possible for The Turner Diaries to spread and gain more influence \u2014 even beyond the scope of terrorist acts it influenced.\n\nThe novel\u2019s biggest impact on far-right politics may have been philosophical\n\nExtremist expert J.M. Berger has argued that even beyond its practical instruction in violent tactics, The Turner Diaries was directly responsible for a profound shift in extremist right-wing ideas \u2014 particularly regarding the way Pierce\u2019s National Alliance, and later the neo-Nazi movement more generally, recruited new members. Through his organization and then through the book, Pierce broadened neo-Nazi messaging by emphasizing emotional rhetoric rather than drilling down into specific, potentially alienating philosophical debates.\n\nBerger wrote in the Atlantic in 2016 that through Pierce\u2019s influence, \u201cprominent white nationalists began to take a more carefully generic approach, playing on racial fear and resentment as they existed, rather than attempting to manufacture doctrinaire justifications.\u201d\n\nIn many respects, Berger argued, The Turner Diaries presaged the amorphous, slippery character of the modern alt-right, with its various loosely allied groups all united under one general commitment to the theme of white nationalism. \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdemonstrated how to successfully leverage racial fears and resentments in the service of violence, without a call to a specific ideology.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but The Turner Diaries\u2019 rhetorical emphasis, the constant drumbeat of its themes \u2014 they\u2019re coming to take your guns; they\u2019re coming for you; the media can\u2019t be trusted; violent reaction is all but inevitable \u2014 seems not only to form the backbone of far-right propaganda but to contain significant parallels to today\u2019s mainstream conservative ideology. As a text, it offers the kind of heady heroic narrative that appeals to would-be rebels, patriots, and martyrs for a cause. It teaches its adherents not just to adopt the mentality that they are at war with progressives, but that a real-life war is inevitable. As the New York Times observed after the Capitol insurrection, a Telegram user watching the melee wrote, \u201cThe turner diaries mentioned this. Keep reading.\u201d\n\nStill, Berger told Vox that while prohibiting access to The Turner Diaries is an important part of dismantling white supremacy, it\u2019s not as crucial as many in the media have made it seem. \u201cThe Turner Diaries is a landmark text in white nationalism, and it\u2019s worth talking about,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut I think its relevance to the Capitol Siege has been overplayed somewhat.\u201d\n\nBerger pointed out that while the book\u2019s removal from Amazon is a step forward, it\u2019s not the only such work out there that white supremacists have drawn inspiration from.\n\n\u201cThe book is already notorious and widely available online for free, so while it\u2019s probably a net positive that it\u2019s been removed from Amazon, it\u2019s not exactly a game-changer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the significance has more to do with Amazon waking up to the problem of extremist content on its platform, which can be seen in some of its other recent moves as well,\u201d he added. He noted that in recent weeks, Amazon has removed products promoting the QAnon conspiracy and banned white nationalist groups from its charity program, after previously removing merchandise related to other white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations. \u201cSeveral of these removals are more pragmatically important because they deny revenue streams to current extremist leaders and groups,\u201d Berger explained.\n\nIn other words, it takes dismantling a white supremacist village to fully attack the ugliness that leads to real-world violence. Removing The Turner Diaries and these other elements from Amazon, along with deplatforming extremists from other parts of the mainstream internet, won\u2019t totally remove their ability to access harmful material that helps fuel their hate. Still, these actions may crucially make such material harder for potential recruits to find. As Berger concluded, Amazon and tech companies like it \u201cstill have some way to go, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/guru-white-hate-william-pierce-timothy-mcveigh-831091/", "page_content": "Up here on his West Virginia Mountain, Dr. William Pierce \u2014 novelist, provocateur, perhaps the world\u2019s most influential white supremacist \u2014 likes to look out and imagine the end of America as we know it. First, the economy will sour. There will be riots in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Detroit. Men and women will be dragged from their cars; there will be atrocities. Whites and blacks will savagely battle each other in the streets. Forced to protect itself, the white middle class will at long last become radicalized around its Aryan heritage and rebel against the Jewish-controlled central government. Led by patriots who have studied Pierce\u2019s works, whites will establish their own temporary homelands, perhaps in Southern California or the Pacific Northwest. From there, they will mount the final campaign. Enemy collaborators will swing from lampposts and telephone poles.\n\nIn a last spasm of power, the Jews and their minions will launch nuclear weapons against the whites. The whites will retaliate with their own. Goodbye, Washington. So long, Tel Aviv. Pierce and his men will be underground, perhaps on this very mountain, down into the limestone caverns below. When they come back up, they will seize control of the smoking ruins and build a new country for whites only.\n\nIn the first few decades of the new America, the land will be racially cleansed. Aryan values will prevail. Young men and women will gather to revel with polkas or waltzes, reels or jigs. They will listen to popular music minus Barry Manilow, stroll through art galleries minus Marc Chagall. There will be no blacks in America \u2014 those who survive the racial holy war will be returned to Africa. Mexicans will be sent back to Mexico, Asians to Asia, and as for the Jews, they will be exterminated, this time for good. People will come to understand that regardless of how many died during the World War II, it was not enough.\n\n\u201cOy vey!\u201d Pierce cries, raising his hands heavenward. \u201cYou can\u2019t even look at these guys crossways and they start smelling the gas!\u201d He is ranging around his office inside a prefab corrugated-steel building on the side of the mountain. Disdainfully, Pierce is dangling an article from the Forward, a weekly Jewish paper, attacking Pat Buchanan for having complimented Hitler on his \u201cextraordinary gifts.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cThis is where the Jews really let their hair down,\u201d he says. He subscribes to nearly all the leading Jewish publications; they take up space on shelves next to copies of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, within sight of a painting inscribed to Pierce by Arno Breker, the Fuhrer\u2019s favorite artist. In nearby rooms, a handful of his followers \u2014 a few of whom also live on the property \u2014 are busily stuffing envelopes with literature and pecking away on computers.\n\nDespite his rant, Pierce gives off an amiable, rumpled impression. A gaunt and gangly six feet four, wearing wire-rim glasses and the same denim jacket, green pants and white socks that he\u2019s had on the last three days, the former physicist looks as if he were up all night scribbling equations on the magnetic effects of solid-state physics, his former specialty.\n\nOn his desk sits the shiny red membership handbook of the National Alliance, the white-supremacist group that Pierce founded in 1974 with the intent of reversing the \u201cthe racially devolutionary course of the last few millennia.\u201d The manual vows, \u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to achieve this White living space and to keep it White. We will not be deterred by the difficulty or temporary unpleasantness involved, because we realize that it is absolutely necessary for our racial survival.\u201d The National Alliance has an estimated 1,500 members in thirty-five chapters \u2014 cells, in the lingo \u2014 from coast to coast, and according to Pierce, it has grown almost fifty percent in the last year. Although the Alliance is small, the Anti-Defamation League calls it \u201cthe single most dangerous organized hate group in the United States today,\u201d largely because of the savvy of its founder.\n\nAt sixty-six, William Pierce is the courtly elder statesman and undisputed intellectual godfather of the white-supremacist movement. He is admired equally by teenage skinheads and such veteran rabble-rousers as David Duke. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant writer, a true political dissident,\u201d Duke says. \u201cWe take turns being named the most dangerous man in America by the Anti-Defamation League.\u201d\n\nPierce is so venerated and feared in part because he is tireless in promoting his vision of white supremacy. To do this, he says, it has been necessary to circumvent \u201cJewish control of the media.\u201d He is methodically establishing beachheads for his racist agenda through independent channels \u2014 on the Internet at natvan.com and nattall.com, over the radio with a weekly half-hour broadcast called American Dissident Voices that reaches more than 100,000 listeners and through his National Vanguard Books.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Alliance\u2019s publishing arm produces a number of its own works and also markets more than 600 other titles, including audiotapes and videocassettes. It sells the expected canon \u2014 Mein Kampf, for instance \u2014 but in an effort to educate its readers in the ways of the enemy, it also distributes Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Bonfire of the Vanities (\u201cA masterful depiction of life in the Great Satan,\u201d reads the catalog blurb. \u201cSure enjoyment\u201d), James B. Stewart\u2019s Den of Thieves (\u201cThe purse-carrying [Ivan] Boesky is the epitome of the Jew\u201d) and Edgar Rice Burrough\u2019s Tarzan of the Apes (\u201cAn Aryan baby is raised by an ape in the jungles of Blackest Africa\u201d), among other well-known books.\n\nBut Pierce says he also wants to reach an audience that \u201cdoesn\u2019t read that much.\u201d To that end, he recently acquired Resistance Records, the premier white-power rock-music label in the world, for $250,000. While Pierce can\u2019t abide rock (\u201cI detest it,\u201d he says, grimacing. \u201cGive me Beethoven or Strauss or Mozart\u201d), he regards whitepower music as the best way to recruit young racists: \u201cI\u2019m going to give skinheads a rationale for their anger.\u201d With the recent purchase of Nordland, a racist Swedish label, Pierce is able to offer customers 250 titles, including records by such popular hatecore bands as Skrewdriver, No Remorse, Bound for Glory, Max Resist, and the Blue Eyed Devils. He\u2019s also become publisher of Resistance, a glossy magazine devoted to white-power music. Resistance Records grossed $300,000 in 1998, Pierce says, and close to $1 million last year. He estimates that the label will rake in $3 million annually within a couple of years.\n\nPierce\u2019s expanding mail-order empire has prompted the Washington Post to describe him as running an \u201cAmazon.com of hate.\u201d But for all his multimedia ambitions, Pierce\u2019s most substantial and abiding legacy will likely be as the author of The Turner Diaries, a novel he self-published in 1978 that gleefully describes the bloody overthrow of the U.S. government by white revolutionaries, the subsequent resettlement of blacks, and the final extermination of Jews and \u201crace traitors.\u201d\n\nAmong the readers who have found inspiration in its apocalyptic vision is Timothy McVeigh, who was known to sleep with a copy under his pillow, pushed the book on friends and sold it at gun shows. Eventually, he emulated the book\u2019s protagonist by exploding a massive truck bomb outside a federal building, killing 168 of people. When police stopped him 75 miles north of Oklahoma City on April 19th, 1995, an envelope in the car contained photocopied passages from the novel. McVeigh had underlined this one: \u201cThe real value of all our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties.\u201d The passage continues, \u201cFor one thing, our efforts against the System gained immeasurably in credibility. More important, though, is what we taught the politicians and the bureaucrats. They learned today that not one of them is beyond our reach.\u201d\n\nInvestigators determined that several days before the bombing, McVeigh phoned the National Alliance hot line seven times. He apparently reached a four-minute recorded message about the Alliance and an answering service. \u201cWhy anyone would call more than once, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cI never had any contact with him.\u201d Federal prosecutors contend that The Turner Diaries was a virtual blueprint for the Oklahoma City bombing, the single most destructive terrorist incident ever on American soil.\n\n\u201cInnocent people get killed in a war,\u201d Pierce says, sighing. \u201cJust think about the Allied carpet-bombing of German cities during World War II. That doesn\u2019t change the strategic or tactical planning behind it. Oklahoma City was sort of inevitable. You can expect more of these things as the population becomes more alienated.\u201d\n\nBut does he feel any responsibility for the bombing? \u201cMcVeigh was upset about Waco,\u201d he parries. \u201cI can\u2019t say what effect my book had on him. Anyway, the Bible has probably gotten people to do more things than The Turner Diaries.\u201d\n\nTo date, The Turner Diaries has sold more than 350,000 copies, according to the Washington Post, primarily through mail order and at gun shows, and, to a very small extent, through bookstores. On a recent day on Amazon.com, the novel held the sales rank of 3,146 out of 2-5 million books, with an average customer evaluation of three and an half stars out of five.\n\nThe book raises an unsettling question: Can a novel be responsible for murder? The Turner Diaries is a true underground classic, graphically reminding readers that before the \u201cunderground\u201d was the spawning place for next season\u2019s fashions and musical tastes, it was the hideout of hardened revolutionaries. As Mao\u2019s Little Red Book inspired the Red Guards to rampage during the Cultural Revolution, as Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin aroused the abolitionists against slavery, so has Pierce\u2019s fiction sparked the white-supremacy, anti-government movement to a firestorm of political violence over the last two decades.\n\nIn its literally incendiary effect, The Turner Diaries presents a curious twist on the notion that novelist Don DeLillo presented in Mao II: that the terrorist is the supreme novelist of the 20th century for having captured the popular mind more completely than any writer. With William Pierce, we may have the more intriguing twenty-first-century case of the novelist as terrorist.\n\n\u201cWilliam Pierce doesn\u2019t build bombs,\u201d says Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group. \u201cHe builds bombers.\u201d\n\nBesides the Oklahoma City bombing, the list of crimes to which the book or the Alliance has been linked is striking, as if some readers decided that the best way to praise the novel they loved was to live it:\n\n1984-1985 In the Pacific Northwest, a group calling itself the Order and the Silent Brotherhood, intent on emulating The Turner Diaries almost chapter by chapter, goes on a two-year crime spree that includes murder, bombings and robberies.\n\n1994-1995 A Midwestern gang known as the Aryan Republican Army commits twenty-two bank robberies across the Midwest. Its members are urged to read The Turner Diaries.\n\nAPRIL 1996 In Jackson, Mississippi, Larry Wayne Shoemake, a devotee of The Turner Diaries, breaks into an abandoned PoFolks Restaurant and goes on a sniping spree, killing one black and injuring seven others before taking his own life. An ex-wife told police that Shoemake wasn\u2019t the same after reading the novel.\n\nAPRIL, 1997 When a bomb being constructed by National Alliance member Todd Vanbiber accidentally explodes in his face, he is arrested in Orlando, Florida. He is sentenced to six and a half years in prison for building and possessing explosives. He once purchased $700 worth of National Alliance literature.\n\nMAY 1998 National Alliance member Brian Pickett and others are arrested in Tampa, Florida, for allegedly planning to explode pipe bombs throughout the state\u2019s central region as a diversion for bank robberies.\n\nThat Pierce might in some way have inspired so much destruction doesn\u2019t exactly sadden him. He won\u2019t debate the nature of his influence so much as quibble legalistically with the details. This afternoon, for instance, he takes exception to the notion that The Turner Diaries is an exact blueprint for the Oklahoma City bombing. \u201cMcVeigh used a bomb in which the two essential ingredients were nitromethane and ammonium nitrate set off by a detonating cord,\u201d he says. \u201cMy bomb was ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, set off with a dynamite initiator.\u201d He detailed these differences to Stephen Jones, McVeigh\u2019s defense attorney, who employed them, to little effect, in the trial.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you couldn\u2019t use Pierce\u2019s novel as a bomb-making manual.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d he readily admits. \u201cYou really could build a bomb from reading the book. Just not the one Timothy McVeigh built.\u201d\n\nPierce says he admires McVeigh as a \u201ctrue patriot and a good soldier.\u201d His sole objection to the Oklahoma City bombing is tactical. \u201cI probably would have gone to Washington, gotten myself a job,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cMaybe made myself a silencer pistol. And then I would have stalked congressmen. I\u2019d have picked them off, maybe two or three of them, before it got too hot.\u201d\n\nThat sounds a lot like the plot of Pierce\u2019s second novel, Hunter, published in 1989, in which a serial killer attempts to rid America of its \u201csickness\u201d by executing interracial couples, Jews and elected officials. Pierce has compared his protagonist to Joseph Paul Franklin, now on death row in Missouri for murder, who is suspected of having shot seventeen other people between 1977 and 1980 in an attempt to start a race war.\n\nGiven the boyish enthusiasm with which Pierce delivers his murderous fantasies, there\u2019s something openly Walter Mitty-ish about him. He seems to view himself as the prince in a fairy tale that might have been written by Joseph Goebbels. And yet, every so often, the real world intrudes. Not long ago, Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center won an $85,000 judgment against Pierce and the National Alliance in a suit tied to the murder of a black man in Florida. The killer had belonged to a racist group that transferred real estate to Pierce in an attempt to avoid losing it in a civil action. Pierce had hoped to live out his old age on the proceeds from the property.\n\n\u201cI try not to be obsessed with how much I dislike Morris Dees,\u201d he says, \u201cand what I would like to do to him if I could ever get him alone.\u201d\n\nDees and Pierce enjoy a perversely symbiotic relationship. Dees raises money for the Southern Poverty Law Center by demonizing Pierce; this in turn confers upon Pierce added credibility among his potential donors. \u201c\u2018This is the most dangerous man in America!\u2019 That\u2019s what Morris Dees says about me,\u201d crows Pierce. \u201cHe says, \u2018I\u2019m gonna put him out of business, if you will help me.\u2019 He raised $10 million on me! And yes, it is flattering to me. I love it!\u201d\n\nThe bad publicity \u2014 and there\u2019s really no such thing for Pierce \u2014 helps attract new recruits to the National Alliance. At least twice a year, Pierce hosts a conference of potential leaders he has selected from among the rank and file of the National Alliance membership, gatherings that the proprietor of a local business refers to as \u201cDr. Pierce\u2019s proms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese fellows show up wearing golf shirts that have the National Alliance symbol on them,\u201d says Pocahontas County Sheriff Jerry Dale, who is Pierce\u2019s official hometown nemesis, and has shadowed him for fifteen years. \u201cLast year they ended up at a local establishment called Huckleberry\u2019s, partying a little. And whenever one of them would run across a hal with blond hair, they\u2019d ask her if she\u2019d like to have an Aryan baby.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance is often described as a neo-Nazi organization, but Pierce, knowing the reflexive connotations of the word Nazi, prefers to use the expression \u201cNational Socialist.\u201d He actually disdains those \u201chobbyists\u201d who dress up in storm-trooper regalia, flex biceps tattooed with swastikas and march around screaming \u201cnigger\u201d this, \u201cJew\u201d that. He wants an Alliance composed of successful professionals, the kind of folks who might otherwise head Boy Scout troops in their spare time \u2014 hence the golf shirts.\n\n\u201cThe general image of racists,\u201d he says, \u201care these 400-pound women and guys who are missing teeth at a Klan rally. The National Alliance has never tried to appeal to those people. We can\u2019t have a howling mob outside the city gates. We need people inside to open the gates! We want CPAs, high school teachers, engineers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time for Pierce to drive down the mountain to the post office to pick up the mail and his wife, Sevdalina, who\u2019s just returned via bus from the mall in Lewisburg, an hour away. As Pierce shuts off the computer, his cat, Hadley, a bluepoint Siamese, picks his way across the desk, growling as he goes and starting a landslide of insurrectionary documents. The animal, whose portrait graces the wall in a mini-gallery of cat shots, is the fourth incarnation of a Siamese named Harold, who kept Pierce company during the lonely days when he lived and worked in a cramped apartment, eating supermarket pizzas and writing The Turner Diaries. \u201cI have almost a spiritual communion with cats,\u201d says Pierce, who in 1990 was fined for trying to smuggle a mountain lion from Florida onto his property. \u201cThey\u2019re graceful, they\u2019re beautiful, and they forgive me for everything.\u201d\n\nHe reaches down to stroke Hadley, who arches his back. \u201cGoodbye, son,\u201d Pierce tells the cat. \u201cDaddy\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nWith one hand on the wheel, Pierce casually steers his white Chevy Blazer through the hairpin turns of West Virginia State Highway 219. He seems preoccupied. He\u2019s been married five times. The last three wives have been from Eastern Europe. He sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t really live alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI really do need to have a woman. I mean, I get depressed, I get antsy if I don\u2019t have a woman. But what causes my marriages to break up? It\u2019s because of my work. I\u2019ve never been able to find a true soul mate.\u201d\n\nHe expected the women from Eastern Europe, raised in hardship, to be different. But it turns out they like shopping as much as their American predecessors. \u201cSevdi would like to go out to dinner,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cShe would like to stay in motels. She would like to go to Washington, to the White House. I don\u2019t want to go to the White House \u2014 the god-damned Secret Service would stop me at the front door!\u201d He laughs, his spirits lifting at the thought.\n\nIn the lobby of the tiny post office in Hillsboro, Sevdi is waiting, flipping through a clothing catalog. She\u2019s a pretty woman from Bulgaria who looks decades younger than Pierce. They met via a National Alliance supporter who runs a mail-order-bride business. Most of their two-year marriage has been spent on the side of the mountain, where they live in a trailer that embarrassed Pierce\u2019s previous wife Susan \u2014 who, though Hungarian, knew what mobile homes represent in the eyes of most Americans.\n\n\u201cI had to wait 45 minutes!\u201d Sevdi scolds her husband. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me it was not a quarter to call. It is now thirty-five cents!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have used the postmistress\u2019s phone,\u201d Pierce says, riffling through two boxes of mail. There\u2019s a copy of the Jerusalem Post, a Manila packet from a sympathizer in Zagreb, Croatia, and several stacks of letters, ten or fifteen to a bundle. \u201cIt\u2019s the highlight of my day, seeing the membership applications arrive,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI kept putting the quarter in eight times to try to call, and it wasn\u2019t the possibility,\u201d Sevdi says.\n\nPierce doesn\u2019t seem to hear. While he does a little business with the postmistress, Sevdi reveals the precise distance between her hometown in Bulgaria and her new home. \u201cIt\u2019s 11,000 kilometers exactly, that\u2019s what Bill says.\u201d And then, in a confidential tone, she whispers, \u201cI paint landscapes. I would like to do an exhibition, but my husband does not agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis wives just hang around until they get a green card, and then they\u2019re out of there,\u201d says Jerry Dale. \u201cWomen are just a step above \u2018mud people\u2019 \u2014 blacks, Hispanics and Jews. They\u2019re there to wait on him hand and foot, and call him \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018Dr. Pierce.'\u201d Dale arrested Pierce in 1990 for beating up his volunteer bookkeeper. Charges were later dropped because the woman left the state and did not return to testify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true I was arrested, but I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cWhen this woman talked to the police, she accused me of holding her as a sex slave, beating her up, stealing her purse, threatening her life. She had worked for me only four days. One day we had a big blow-up. I grabbed her purse and just hung it on the doorknob so she would leave. The magistrate didn\u2019t seem very excited about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nThe men of the National Alliance \u201ccannot find women,\u201d says Kirsten Kaiser, the ex-wife of Pierce\u2019s one-time lieutenant, Kevin Alfred Strom. \u201cThey can\u2019t get an American wife. These women come over from Europe, and think they\u2019re going to New York. The guys marry them right away, and then they\u2019re enslaved \u2014 no English, no Social Security card, no driver\u2019s license. These people drove me barking mad, and I\u2019m an American.\u201d She begins to weep over the phone. \u201cThey get you to agree that Hitler was the greatest man who ever lived. I had to name my darling daughter Klara, after Hitler\u2019s mother. Kevin wanted her to grow up and bear an Aryan superman.\u201d Kaiser\u2019s ex-husband calls these allegations \u201cfictional.\u201d\n\nOn the drive back to the mountain, the Pocahontas County landscape spins by. This rural region astride the Allegheny Mountains in southeastern West Virginia is sparsely populated, with just 9,000 residents \u2014 of whom only sixty- eight are minorities, mainly blacks. Pierce moved here in 1985 from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the changing demographics. I decided I had to get out of there or I was going to do something that would get me locked up \u2014 you know, a Benjamin Smith or a Buford Furrow,\u201d he says, chuckling, referring to two white supremacists who went on shooting sprees this past summer. Pierce searched for cheap land up and down the East Coast and finally found the kind of property he was looking for here, outside of Mill Point. West Virginia, for $150 an acre.\n\nHe turns back onto the rutted drive leading up the side of his mountain, Sevdi becoming silent as they near home. At the Alliance headquarters, husband and wife go their separate ways, Sevdi trudging up to the trailer, Pierce shambling back to work, hunched over a carton of mail.\n\nWhen he began writing The Turner Diaries in 1975, William Pierce was a 42-year-old former physicist who had just exiled himself from academia and the aerospace industry. He did so in order to be the self-appointed head of a new racist organization called the National Alliance and the solitary staffer of a neo-Nazi journal called Attack!\n\nHe set up shop in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Crystal City, Virginia, living on fifty dollars a month in his office above a real estate agency. The telephone hardly ever rang. By day, he scrawled his jeremiads. At night, he shared the bed with his epileptic cat, Harold. When not working, Pierce was a soul adrift, wandering through embassy parties at the invitation of a friend who worked in government, blending into the crowd at demonstrations, reading politics and sociology in the Library of Congress. He\u2019d pore over racialist tracts published in the Twenties and Thirties, notice how they\u2019d been checked out once every two decades, and think, \u201cMy God \u2014 is this what I\u2019m going to give up my career for?\u201d He was invisible, unanchored by domestic responsibilities, a spy with subversive ambitions at loose in the grand mansion of history.\n\nAfter almost twenty years of marriage, he was estranged from his first wife, Pat Holmes. She and their two sons were living fifty miles to the south in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where she taught math at Mary Washington College. Pierce\u2019s Nazi activities were becoming embarrassing for Pat, he says. \u201cShe was concerned about things like, \u2018Do we have $400 to buy a new sofa?\u2019 I was concerned about things like, \u2018How can I do what I plan to do this weekend without getting arrested?'\u201d\n\nNot necessarily the sort of question by which Pierce had expected to be troubled. He had grown up in \u2014 as he puts it \u2014 an \u201call-white world\u201d throughout the South: Georgia, Virginia, Alabama and finally Texas. His father, a former merchant marine, sold insurance. He died in a car crash when Pierce was eight. His mother prided herself on being a direct descendant of Thomas Henry Watts, who served in the Confederacy under Jefferson Davis. Watts\u2019 stern face stared down at the Pierce household from a framed twenty-dollar Confederate bill.\n\nIn those years, Pierce revealed no signs of the vitriolic racist he would become. His older brother Sanders remembers him as a \u201cgentle\u201d child: \u201cWhen he was eight and another kid knocked his glasses off, Bill just got up and put them back on.\u201d Pierce disliked it when his fellow cadets at Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas, went \u201ccoon conking\u201d \u2013driving past black pedestrians and knocking them down with a pole.\n\nWhen he arrived at Rice University in 1951, he studied physics and chemistry, a scholarship student among oil-rich frat boys. What he really wanted, however, was to be an astronaut. Growing up in the Thirties and Forties, he had become enamored of space travel even before it was a realistic possibility. He longed to see himself as a storybook hero, an outsider accomplishing great deeds against long odds \u2014 and incidentally winning the girl. As the first step in becoming an astronaut, he inquired about joining the Air Force but was told that his poor vision would prevent him from being a pilot.\n\nSo instead of outer space, the would-be adventurer took off for graduate school \u2014 first to Cal Tech, then to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he often slept in the lab on a folding cot next to the electromagnet. By the time he acquired his Ph.D. in physics in 1962, Pierce could look forward to a solid, even brilliant career as a physicist. He was hired as a junior faculty member by Oregon State that same year. \u201cHe came and gave a collegial talk at the department and bowled us over,\u201d says David Burch, a former colleague.\n\nIn the early Sixties, Corvallis, Oregon, was not an especially diverse place. But in Pierce\u2019s view, he might as well have fallen from a cloud into a smoky Harlem den of jazz and miscegenation. One of his colleagues in the physics department was a young professor named Cliff Fairchild. Having been hired the same year, \u201che and I were naturally thrown together,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cWe invited each other over to our houses. We drank together and so on.\u201d To Pierce, there was only one exceedingly odd fact about Fairchild: He was married to a black woman.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why a white guy would pick a nonwhite woman, because to me they weren\u2019t attractive. Still, my idea at the time was that marriage was a strictly private matter. But then they began having kids, and these kids were horrible-looking things. I said, \u2018Jesus. Why should anybody deliberately have kids like that?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t have told you why I didn\u2019t like this. Some people, they look at a piece of art and they say, \u2018God, that\u2019s ugly.\u2019 But they don\u2019t have a theory to fit the art into.\u201d\n\nHis sense of aesthetics violated, Pierce became intolerant of the Fairchilds\u2019 marriage. \u201cI just slowly withdrew from them,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough self-confidence to say to him, \u2018What are you doing married to a nonwhite woman?'\u201d\n\nNow, thirty-eight years after he joined the faculty with Pierce, Cliff Fairchild is shocked to hear of this virulent reaction to his marriage. \u201cNeither my wife nor I felt any animosity,\u201d he says. \u201cBill Pierce never told a racist joke, and we\u2019ve heard a few in Corvallis. We played bridge together, went camping with our families. There\u2019s a photograph of us on top of a mountain in eastern Oregon with the Pierces, with me carrying my son in a backpack.\u201d Pained by Pierce\u2019s description of his now thirty-seven-year-old child as ugly, Fairchild pauses and then adds, \u201cYou know, our son is very handsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what started it,\u201d Pat Holmes says of her exhusband\u2019s disdain for the Fairchilds\u2019 interracial marriage. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t that way when we married. It happened so suddenly.\u201d\n\nOne night in the mid-Sixties, Pierce watched a speech on television by George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. \u201cAll these Jews and liberal activists in the audience were throwing tomatoes and pop bottles and trying to drown him out,\u201d Pierce says. He was impressed by Rockwell\u2019s cool as he dodged the debris and continued to speak: \u201cHe was facing an early example of political correctness.\u201d He began a correspondence with Rockwell that led to friendship. \u201cRockwell was a very sane guy,\u201d Pierce says. \u201cNo ego problems. Intelligent. An artist.\u201d\n\nPierce was taken as much by Rockwell\u2019s ideas about white power as he was by his manner. It occurred to him that he, too, might like to try his hand at writing about race. He left Oregon State in 1965 after three years on the faculty and moved his wife and sons to the East Coast, accepting a job in North Haven, Connecticut, as senior research scientist for the Pratt and Whitney aerospace laboratory.\n\nIt was an entirely mercenary move. His new, more lucrative position would allow him to set aside enough money so that he could someday write full time. He was staking everything on his conviction that history was with him, that he would become a brave pamphleteer in the footsteps of Thomas Paine prior to the first American Revolution. Eventually, Pierce decided that he would publish a journal of ideas. Rockwell said he had been thinking the same thing. He suggested that Pierce become the editor of such a journal \u2014 The National Socialist World. The position would be unpaid.\n\n\u201cOh, boy, that was a big jump,\u201d Pierce says, \u201cgiving up a paycheck for a leap into the unknown.\u201d He uprooted his family once again, settling in Virginia. When Rockwell was assassinated by one of his own storm troopers in 1967, Pierce asked himself, \u201cWhat am I to do with my life now?\u201d He decided, he says, to devote himself \u201cto the service of the life force, as George Bernard Shaw would have said. Or, as Nietzsche would have said, to help prepare the way for the coming of the Superman.\u201d\n\nBut by the mid-Seventies, Pierce was convinced that the polemics he was publishing in a new journal, Attack!, were having no effect. \u201cI thought what I was saying was profound, earthshaking,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cMy God \u2014 it didn\u2019t even make a ripple.\u201d His dreams of inciting a white uprising seemed about as realistic as his old fantasy of going into space as an astronaut.\n\nHis friend Revilo Oliver, then a classics professor at the University of Illinois \u2014 and a longtime racist \u2014 suggested that he try disseminating his views through fiction, as was done in didactic novels such as Jack London\u2019s The Iron Heel, an account of a working-class revolt against the wealthy.\n\nAnd so, writing in longhand, Pierce began composing the fictional diary of Earl Turner. The novel opens portentously, with an odd echo of vintage leftist rhetoric: \u201cSeptember 16, 1991: Today it finally began! After all these years of talking \u2014 and nothing but talking \u2014 we have finally taken our first action. We are at war with the System, and it is no longer a war of words.\u201d\n\nThe writing came easily. Pierce had finally tapped into perhaps his greatest capacity: his ability to daydream. But the fantasies were vicious. \u201cI wanted to take all the feminist agitators and propagandists and all of the race-mixing fanatics and all of the media bosses and all of the bureaucrats and politicians who were collaborating with them,\u201d Pierce says, \u201cand I wanted to put them up against a wall, in batches of a thousand at a time, and machine-gun them.\u201d\n\nHe portrays the protagonist, Earl Turner, as a soldier in an underground white army called the Organization that is fomenting a race war to bring down the Jewish-controlled federal government. Turner steals gasoline, conducts hit-and-run raids, teaches bomb making, helps establish a white homeland in Southern California and eventually, heroically, sacrifices himself by flying a crop-duster armed with a nuclear warhead into the Pentagon. For his kamikaze attack, Turner is enshrined in the Record of Martyrs, his name memorized by grateful white schoolchildren and his diaries made available to the general public in a special edition issued 100 years after the Great Revolution.\n\nThere\u2019s a pulpy, Hollywood-disaster-movie feel to the novel that Pierce has tagged a \u201chandbook for white victory.\u201d Imagine Armageddon as engineered by middle-management white guys in short sleeves who just can\u2019t take it anymore. From 1975 to 1978, he serialized the narrative in Attack! and its successor, the National Vanguard, both of which he often sold himself for twenty-five cents while walking around suburban shopping centers and the streets of Washington, D.C. Embarrassed by the fact that he wrote nearly everything in the Vanguard, Pierce ran The Turner Diaries under a pseudonym, Andrew Macdonald. \u201cI didn\u2019t want readers to think I was a one-man band,\u201d he says.\n\nTheir response astounded him: \u201cI mean, people would call up the office, desperate. They\u2019d say, \u2018I missed the last issue \u2014 you know, installment fourteen. I gotta have it. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Sorry \u2014 sold out.\u2019 And the guy would be ready to kill himself.\u201d Here\u2019s the sort of thing readers were craving:\n\n\u201cAugust 1, 1993: Today has been the Day of the Rope \u2014 a grim and bloody day, but an unavoidable one. Tonight, for the first time in weeks, it is quiet and totally peaceful throughout all of Southern California. But the night is filled with silent horrors; from tens of thousands of lampposts, power poles and trees throughout this vast metropolitan area, the grisly forms hang. \u2026 The first thing I saw in the moonlight was the placard with its legend in large, block letters: I DEFILED MY RACE. Above the placard leered the horribly bloated, purplish face of a young woman, her eyes wide open and bulging, her mouth agape. \u2026 There are many thousands of hanging female corpses like that in this city tonight, all wearing identical placards around their necks. They are the White women who were married or living with Blacks, with Jews or with other nonWhite males.\u201d\n\nPublished as a 320-page paperback book by the National Alliance in May 1978, The Turner Diaries went out into the world like a ghost telegram from Adolf Hitler, summoning all the disgruntled loners who were watching their lily-white America disappear. The novel thrilled its partisans with an utter disdain for the ethos of tolerance. It offered the sacrilegious spectacle of blacks, Jews, feminists, liberals and the entire country of China being ground under the hobnailed boots of rampaging white guys.\n\nOne of The Turner Diaries\u2019 earliest and most passionate readers was Robert Mathews, a tax resister and discontented zinc miner from Metaline Falls, Washington. As it would other anxious whites, the novel convinced Mathews that a small band of determined fighters could spark an uprising among the white middle class that would result in the overthrow of ZOG, the Zionist Occupation Government. The novel catalyzed his desire to become \u201cthe Robin Hood of the radical right,\u201d as Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt put it in The Silent Brotherhood, a thoroughly reported account of Mathews\u2019 saga. As boyishly romantic as his hero Pierce but far more impetuous, he wanted to turn the Pacific Northwest into a \u201cWhite American Bastion.\u201d Mathews formed an \u201caction group\u201d modeled after the Order, the secret inner sanctum of revolutionaries in The Turner Diaries. At meetings, he discussed the plot of the novel and pushed copies on anyone who hadn\u2019t read it. He even had black robes made for members like those worn during induction ceremonies in the book.\n\nMathews became a favorite of Pierce\u2019s; Pierce still speaks of him with bemused affection. \u201cBob Mathews basically was a real decent guy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe main thing about him, he was serious. Doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t laugh. But he took his responsibilities seriously \u2014 his responsibilities as a member of his race, to his ancestors and to his descendants. If he said to you, \u2018SOB, I\u2019m gonna get you,\u2019 you better make out your will. He was the kinda person I wanted to have in the Alliance.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, at Pierce\u2019s invitation, Mathews delivered a fiery anti-Semitic address at a National Alliance convention in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cMy brothers, my sisters,\u201d Mathews began. \u201cFrom the mist-shrouded, forested valleys and mountains of the Pacific Northwest, I bring you a message of solidarity, a call to action, and a demand for adherence to duty as members of the vanguard of an Aryan resurgence and, ultimately, total Aryan victory.\u201d It ended, \u201cWe have broken the chains of Jewish thought. \u2026 Stand up like men and reclaim our soil! Kinsmen, arise! Look toward the stars, and proclaim our destiny! In Metaline Falls, we have a saying: Defeat, never! Victory, forever!\u201d\n\nAfterward, Pierce \u2014 ever the tactician \u2014 buttonholed Mathews. \u201cI said, \u2018Bob, people were really affected by your talk. But I guess I must disagree with you about the time for revolution being ripe, because I think most people are not ready to respond to a call to arms.\u2019 But Bob disagreed with me. And then shortly after that, he dropped out of the Alliance and began doing his thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing his thing\u201d meant attempting to live out the plot of The Turner Diaries. Mathews obviously did not anticipate ending his days in a rest home. On April 1st, 1984, he attempted to purchase a $50,000 life-insurance policy, naming as beneficiaries William Pierce and John Ireland, another National Alliance official. The policy was rejected by the insurance company.\n\nBy 1984, the Order was a loose confederation of two dozen men devoted to robbery, counterfeiting and murder, all in the interest of inciting and financing a race war. They started small, robbing a porno shop in Spokane, Washington, humiliated by their grand take of $369.10. But Mathews and his band soon graduated to Brinks armored trucks, stealing $3.8 million in cash from one during a daylight robbery on a mountain highway near Ukiah, California, in July 1984. A month before, Mathews and a few others had murdered Denver radio talkshow host Alan Berg, whom they considered a Jewish agitator. The killing inspired Talk Radio, the Eric Bogosian play that was made into a movie by Oliver Stone.\n\n\u201cThe Turner Diaries was their textbook,\u201d says Ron Howen, the state attorney general of Idaho who prosecuted the Order. \u201cThey went chapter by chapter, in an attempt to create a nationwide revolution. Everyone had to read it. In fact, all the FBI agents we had on the case had to read it.\u201d\n\nMathews chose Pierce as one of his pet charities, according to several sources, including a government informant within the Order, and supposedly traveled to Virginia to deliver a bag of cash to his idol in August 1984. Pierce confirms the meeting but denies that any money changed hands. Mathews\u2019 donation, if indeed it took place, would have been one of his last acts of rebellion. In December 1984, he was incinerated alive in his hideout on Whidbey Island, Washington, during a shootout with FBI agents, who mockingly wore baseball caps with ZOG emblazoned on them.\n\nSince his death, Mathews has become a martyr to the racist cause here and in Europe. He is commemorated in songs such as \u201cTrue Heroes,\u201d by the popular hatecore band Nordic Thunder (\u201cHe fought off ZOG, the best he could/For he was the Aryan Robin Hood\u201d).\n\nSoon after his meeting with Mathews in Arlington, Virginia, Pierce purchased 346 acres of property outside Hillsboro, West Virginia, for $95,000 in cash. He claims the money came from an unnamed benefactor. He took up residence there in August 1985.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Pierce says of the charge that the money came from Mathews. \u201cIt seems to me that if the government believed that story, they would have tried to find some evidence that it was true, and I would have been in trouble.\u201d Asked if he ever received money from Mathews, Pierce jokes, \u201cHe paid his dues before be dropped out of the Alliance.\u201d\n\nIn fact, federal prosecutors say that they do believe Mathews gave Pierce the money but that they can\u2019t prove it. Thomas Martinez, an Order member who became a government informant, says he heard Mathews say that he\u2019d given money to Pierce, but this was hearsay testimony and thus inadmissible in a trial. Certainly, the timing of Pierce\u2019s purchase was consistent with that of Mathews\u2019 putative donation.\n\n\u201cThey joked among themselves that the money came from Bob Mathews,\u201d says Kirsten Kaiser. \u201cWho has $95,000 in cash?\u201d\n\nPierce decides to close up shop for the day and ride up to the top of his mountain. It takes a few minutes, the four-wheel drive bucking over the rugged road as dusk comes on. He passes the trailer where Sevdi is waiting with his supper. She called his office not long before. \u201cYes, Sevdi, seven o\u2019clock, as always,\u201d Pierce answered.\n\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t like to live here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like malls, shopping.\u201d\n\nSheriff Dale believes that Pierce selected this property because it is honeycombed with limestone caverns. \u201cMy personal opinion is that the caves were one of his most important criteria,\u201d says Dale. \u201cIt all fits into his philosophy of a race war, and nuclear weapons, and the atmosphere being contaminated. And he and his survivalists, who have been trained, will go underground and live until the atmosphere clears up.\u201d\n\nPierce acknowledges that there are a couple of caves below his land but is evasive about the question of bomb shelters. \u201cIt\u2019s a misallocation of resources,\u201d he says, \u201cto have people out here digging foxholes. You can\u2019t beat the military now. They could come in here with just one of their high-tech jets, drop a bunch of bombs and wipe us out in ten minutes.\u201d\n\nBy the time Pierce reaches the mountaintop, it\u2019s twilight, the air crisp and still. The countryside spreads out below, as homey as a Grandma Moses landscape. A few farmhouse lights gleam in the distance. A roadway winds its blue way across the valley. \u201cYou didn\u2019t used to see lights when I first moved here,\u201d Pierce says.\n\nHe stares out into the valley, sighs. \u201cPeople cannot imagine what it\u2019s gonna be like twenty-five years from now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t imagine how bad it\u2019s gonna be \u2014 groups of five, all armed with machine guns, to get from here to the corner grocery store, where they\u2019ll have to open up a slot to see whether they\u2019ll let you in.\u201d He speaks now like a boy with sci-fi dreams. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something, we\u2019re gonna be gone as a race.\u201d\n\nIn the time he has left, he says, he hopes to \u201cbuild a strong organization of fully committed lifelong revolutionaries.\u201d But he concedes that most whites today have no interest in his cause \u2014 despite the fact that he\u2019s doing it just for them. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly yuppies, couch potatoes,\u201d he says. \u201cJust interested in how much shiny stuff they can buy at the mall.\u201d\n\nHe wants to write a couple of more books. One, he says, will be \u201ca practical guide on how to change the course of history.\u201d\n\nDoes he believe he has changed the course of history?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he admits. \u201cWell, I mean, every sparrow that falls, every blade of grass changes history, but \u2026\u201d He pauses. It\u2019s as if he suddenly sees himself, at this moment, not as a world-historical figure but as an old man atop a mountain, his wife down below in a trailer, waiting for him to come home for supper.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m that Roman soldier who stayed at his post while Mount Vesuvius was erupting,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody came to relieve him, so he just stayed there.\u201d\n\nThen he turns to head back down the mountain."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/william-luther-pierce-white-supremacist-son-kelvin-pierce", "page_content": "From an exposed bluff in Mill Point, West Virginia, Kelvin Pierce surveyed the remote place where his father chose to live and die. In a sense, he knew why. Kelvin is an avid outdoorsman, and even on a stark February day, with snow blanketing the earth and bitter wind whistling through the trees, he was moved by Appalachia\u2019s subtle splendor. He understood why a man might settle there.\n\n\u201cI love West Virginia,\u201d Kelvin had said earlier, on the four-and-a-half-hour drive from his home just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my favorite place on the planet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also full of sorrow.\n\nWhen Pierce\u2019s father bought 346 acres in Mill Point, and relocated there permanently in 1985, he left his family behind. He started building a compound where a new kind of family \u2013 men and women of like mind \u2013 could live off the land and be free of outside influences. He moved into a rambling trailer home, where he lived with a series of wives who weren\u2019t Pierce\u2019s mother. He had divorced her, declaring the split \u201cnecessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\u201d.\n\nNothing was more important to Kelvin\u2019s father than white supremacy. The abandonment and the hate \u2013 the abandonment for hate \u2013 is what Kelvin has spent the better part of his life struggling to understand.\n\nTo family and friends, his dad was Bill. To everyone else, he was William Luther Pierce III, one of America\u2019s most prominent white nationalists.\n\nA physics professor turned neo-Nazi, William Pierce led a hate group called the National Alliance and a business empire that, at the time of his death from cancer in 2002, raked in $1m a year. He published books and magazines, hosted a radio program, and owned a music label, all of which promoted white supremacy. His work galvanized violent gangs, such as the Order and the Aryan Republican Army. Most infamously, it inspired the architect of the Oklahoma City bombing \u2013 Timothy McVeigh designed the attack based in part on Pierce\u2019s 1978 novel The Turner Diaries.\n\nReportedly called \u201cthe bible of the racist right\u201d by the FBI, The Turner Diaries is a fantasy about white militants overthrowing the US government as part of a bloody race war. A 2016 report found that the book had been tied to at least 200 murders, committed in 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes. This year, during the 6 January coup attempt, there were echoes of the novel\u2019s core ideas in insurrectionists\u2019 calls to kill members of Congress, and in a gallows erected near the Capitol.\n\nWilliam Pierce raised Kelvin to hate Jews, Black people, immigrants \u2013 anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Now 60, Kelvin has long rejected his father\u2019s ideology, but only recently has he reached the point where he\u2019s ready to talk about his upbringing, and how his story illuminates the toxic currents roiling America. \u201cIf I can help one other person that felt the way I used to feel, to feel better and to make different choices, then that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cAnd I think I can help more than one person.\u201d\n\nWhen he was little, Kelvin would sneak into his dad\u2019s home office in northern Virginia to look at the bust of Adolf Hitler and the glass paperweight in the shape of a swastika that sat on the desk. Kelvin didn\u2019t know what the items meant, and William Pierce wasn\u2019t interested in explaining. He rarely spent time with Kelvin and his twin brother, Erik, preferring to fraternize with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi party, or to lock himself away writing articles decrying Jewish power and interracial marriage.\n\nKelvin\u2019s strongest memories of his dad involve abuse. Any disobedience or perception of bad behavior led to beatings with whatever was at hand: a belt, a wire hanger, a two-by-four. The violence left Kelvin with bruises and a deep well of self-loathing.\n\nHis mom, Patty, didn\u2019t approve of the cruelty, but she didn\u2019t do much to intervene. She took a similar approach to her husband\u2019s extremism, which he\u2019d nurtured since at least the early 1960s. A math professor and the family breadwinner, because her husband had given up his own academic career to become an ideologue of hate, Patty did all of William Pierce\u2019s accounting and typing. Kelvin said his mom was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d when her husband started a firearms business \u2013 not because he advertised his stock as \u201cNegro control equipment\u201d necessary for \u201cthe coming race war\u201d, but because it prompted newspapers to publish articles about him. Patty worried that someone might come to the house and hurt her family.\n\nFamily photos from the archive of Kelvin Pierce. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWhen her sons told her that neighborhood kids made fun of them by calling them Nazis, she lamented that \u201cit\u2019s a terrible world\u201d and \u201cpeople are awful\u201d. She didn\u2019t answer when Kelvin asked her what a Nazi was, and she didn\u2019t tell her boys that their father was to blame for what was happening to them.\n\nAs a teenager, Kelvin was a bigot because he didn\u2019t know any other way to be. He also hoped it would impress his dad. In high school, he gave a presentation on Hitler\u2019s virtues and used the N-word to talk about Black classmates. By the time he went to college, he was \u201ca mobile advertisement\u201d for his father\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel superior to be part of the white race,\u201d Kelvin later wrote. \u201cYet deep, deep down, something didn\u2019t quite feel right about it either.\u201d\n\nHe began to change when he transferred from a small Christian college to Virginia Tech. He roomed with a young man from South America who was \u201cthoughtful, caring and very intelligent\u201d \u2013 all things that Kelvin\u2019s father insisted people who weren\u2019t white couldn\u2019t be. He took classes with students who saw the world very differently than he did. When Ronald Reagan was elected president and many of his liberal peers were visibly upset \u2013 including his roommate, who drew a dagger and drops of blood on a photo of Reagan \u2013 he wanted to understand why. He started paying attention to politics and watching the evening news, which his dad had always said was worthless because Jews controlled the media. Kelvin wondered if everything he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nHe met a fellow student named Susan when they were both engineering interns with the navy one summer. Kelvin thought she was beautiful, but while his racism was rapidly dissipating, his shame \u2013 the feeling that his dad had abused him for a reason, that he deserved it \u2013 was not. He couldn\u2019t imagine making the first move, but Susan could. \u201cYou know, if you were to ask me out, I would say yes,\u201d she announced one day.\n\nThey were married in 1986. William Pierce came to the wedding. His gift to the bride and groom was a box of 9mm ammunition. \u201cTo keep the wolves away from your door!\u201d his note read. Kelvin didn\u2019t even own a gun.\n\nBy then, William Pierce had divorced Patty, decamped to Mill Point, and curtailed contact with his sons. Kelvin only confronted his dad once, asking why he\u2019d chosen white supremacy over everything else in his life. \u201cIt was the only responsible thing I could do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nFor her part, Susan didn\u2019t think that William Pierce\u2019s worldview mattered. \u201cThank goodness that\u2019s a dying thought process,\u201d she recalled thinking \u2013 an assumption she now sees as optimistic, or perhaps naive. It was also hard for her to fathom the extent of the abuse Kelvin suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, he hit me every day,\u201d he told her once.\n\n\u201cEvery day?\u201d she replied, incredulous.\n\nSusan had grown up in a home where, as she put it, \u201cWe were always hugging each other, and we always said, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Kelvin had kids only because they agreed to adopt them. \u201cI was just terrified of furthering my genes,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cI was so messed up and so damaged as a human being that I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of trying to make another human being.\u201d Their daughters, Mariame and Marieka, are from the country of Georgia. Kelvin vowed to love them like he\u2019d never been loved. He coached their softball teams and took them on camping trips.\n\nKelvin with his daughter Marieka. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWilliam Pierce never met his granddaughters. For seven years prior to his death, he didn\u2019t reply to the letters and photos documenting their childhood that Kelvin sent him. Despite everything, Kelvin kept reaching out. His anger at how he\u2019d been raised collided with yearning for paternal approval. When he first heard of the connection between The Turner Diaries and the Oklahoma City bombing, his kneejerk reaction was a perverse kind of pride that his dad was in the news. He was ashamed his mind went there, but at a loss for how to stop it.\n\nKelvin was battling his demons without armor or weapons. He was also doing it alone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mystery to me,\u201d Susan would tell him sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d\n\nIn July 2002, his uncle called to tell him that his father was dead. Kelvin hadn\u2019t even known he was sick. He surprised himself by crying, then realized what he was really mourning: he had to let go of the futile hope that his father might one day love him. He went to West Virginia for the memorial service, where neo-Nazis offered their condolences and said Kelvin must have admired his father very much.\n\nHow little they know, he thought.\n\nHe looked like his dad \u2013 tall and lanky, with mournful eyes, a long, square jaw, and prominent ears. He shared William Pierce\u2019s introspection and his dislike of being told what to do. But the similarities ended there.\n\nAfter the service, he began to feel something new: he was sad for his father and the life he\u2019d led. It could have been different. But again and again, William Pierce had made the wrong choices, leaving heartache and hate in his wake.\n\nKelvin wanted to start making better choices of his own.\n\nTo Mariame Pierce, her dad\u2019s bookshelf told the story. When she was little, it held volumes about Kelvin\u2019s hobbies \u2013 mountain climbing, for instance. Over time, new titles appeared, ones about self-discovery and philosophy, written by Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra. While she was growing up, her dad was changing too. \u201cHe became more present and thoughtful, more conscious and intentional,\u201d said Mariame, now 25.\n\nKelvin had embarked on a \u201chealing\u201d journey, as he describes it. He read, reflected and prayed. He worked with a counselor to process his childhood trauma, including his father\u2019s belief system. He and Susan, who already ran a successful construction business together, started a charitable foundation to support orphanages in Georgia. When he posted pictures from visits to his daughters\u2019 native country, friends remarked that he looked uncharacteristically happy. \u201cTo make a child feel like at least somebody in the world loves them, it\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nHe told his life story publicly for the first time at his local Rotary Club. He described how, in his youth, he\u2019d fantasized about traveling to Washington with a gun and opening fire on Black people. His teenage dreams now repulsed him. Afterward, audience members came up to thank him. Some of them were crying.\n\nThe more he talked about his experiences, the more people told Kelvin he should write a book. It took a seismic national event for him to decide they were right.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Watching the events unfold, \u201cI was immediately transported back to my childhood,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cThe hatefulness of their energy and what they were saying, the way they were saying it, especially \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 it was just like being an eight- or nine-year-old kid, when my dad took me to an American Nazi party picnic.\u201d\n\nHe started writing what would become Sins of My Father, which he self-published in February 2020. In addition to telling Kelvin\u2019s personal story the book, written with Carole Donoghue, draws on private letters and other archival documents that reveal how perceived grievances, personal disappointment, and twisted self-regard led William Pierce to dedicate his life to white supremacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when his father\u2019s beliefs began to curdle \u2013 stories of radicalization are never so precise \u2013 Kelvin finds seeds of discontent in the years when William Pierce was a new husband, a new father and newly endowed with his physics doctorate. \u201cI think Dad was becoming angry and resentful and was suddenly frightened of the future and the heaviness of it all,\u201d Kelvin writes. \u201cHe hated the idea of working for someone else. He never wanted to have to answer to anyone else, even his wife.\u201d\n\nThis period in William Pierce\u2019s life coincided with the rise of progressive identity politics \u2013 the acceleration of the civil rights movement, for instance, and the dawn of second-wave feminism. He wanted to be a man who mattered, a man people listened to. White nationalism allowed him to be that. His life became one long ideological devolution, nourished by the power and attention he accrued evangelizing about hate.\n\nKelvin Pierce photographed at his home in Vienna. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nIf the story sounds familiar, it is. America is still plagued by the forces of rightwing radicalization. Sins of My Father draws parallels between William Pierce and Donald Trump, who \u201cemboldened white supremacists and mass-shooters by his words and deeds,\u201d as Kelvin writes. \u201cIn many ways, Trump has succeeded where Dad failed. He has taken hate and discrimination mainstream.\u201d\n\nOther evidence of his father\u2019s enduring impact hit closer to home. After Marieka Pierce enrolled in a police academy in Virginia, one day in class, her instructors showed the room a picture of her grandfather, describing him as an example of a homegrown extremist. \u201cMy hand went up,\u201d Marieka later told her mom.\n\nThe instructors were stunned to hear about the family connection. William Pierce was a staple in their curriculum about hate crimes; they\u2019d been teaching recruits about him for as long as they could remember. They asked to meet Kelvin to get a fuller picture of the man who, in obituaries, was remembered as \u201ca cold and calculating racist\u201d and \u201cthe godfather of hate in this country.\u201d\n\nDonny MacMullen has his own take on William Pierce: he thinks Kelvin\u2019s father was a great man.\n\nMacMullen, who is in his 30s, with reddish brown hair, a full beard, and striking blue eyes, moved to Mill Point from Massachusetts a few years ago to help preserve Pierce\u2019s legacy. Today, he\u2019s the caretaker of the National Alliance compound, which amounts to a few scattered buildings and the rocky sprawls of land between them.\n\nThe place is in a state of disrepair, and people rarely visit, but there are reminders of the community Kelvin\u2019s dad was trying to build before he died: an AV facility stocked with equipment that was first-rate in the early aughts; a library that once housed several thousand volumes; stacks of slickly produced magazines promoting racism; a meeting house where William Pierce presided over annual National Alliance conferences. Today, even as Pierce\u2019s ideas continue to find adherents, the organization he started is a shade of its former self.\n\nMacMullen was happy to welcome Kelvin to the compound in February. Indeed, members of the National Alliance had long made clear that William Pierce\u2019s son could visit anytime. For more than 15 years after his father\u2019s death, however, Kelvin stayed away. He wasn\u2019t ready to make peace with it, because he wasn\u2019t at peace with himself.\n\nIt was a steep drive up switchbacks to the heart of the compound, where MacMullen was waiting, wearing a knit cap with a swastika stitched to the front. When Kelvin asked him about the symbol, MacMullen laughed. It just represents love for the white race, he insisted. Kelvin pointed out that it was associated with hate and genocide, and MacMullen shifted gears. If you love something deeply, he said, then you have to hate anything that threatens it.\n\nDonny MacMullen\u2019s office at the West Virginia compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThis was another way of expressing the sentiment of a meme MacMullen once posted on his Facebook page: \u201cI\u2019m white but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist \u2026 I will put my boot in your ass, my knife to your throat, and your body in the dirt if you f**k with me and mine.\u201d\n\nKelvin and MacMullen walked for a while on the property, just the two of them. If it was painful to talk with a man who revered his father \u2013 who saw virtue in a racist who beat him every day of his childhood \u2013 Kelvin didn\u2019t let it show. They talked about their divergent beliefs, and neither man was interested in budging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree,\u201d MacMullen said at one point.\n\nWhen Kelvin recounted the conversation to his best friend, Gil Jullien, who\u2019d come on the trip as moral support, Jullien was furious. \u201cOh, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to disagree!\u201d\n\nJullien was speaking from experience. He was troubled that a close childhood friend had become a vociferous Trump supporter, the sort who regularly posts racist and sexist content on Facebook. Once, when the two men were at a high school reunion talking politics, Jullien\u2019s friend had told him they\u2019d have to agree to disagree. Jullien wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s ruining our country, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he later explained.\n\nKelvin shares Jullien\u2019s moral compass. \u201cAggression and hate and violence are the epitome of cowardice,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t want to feel antagonism or resentment toward anyone, not even white nationalists.\n\nHe prefers to listen and question, not to confront; to offer the possibility of connection rather than writing people off. His approach might not be for everyone, but for Kelvin it\u2019s vital. If he could be redeemed, why not someone like MacMullen?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself out there for people that want help and want change,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nBefore Kelvin left the compound, MacMullen gave him a copy of a book \u2013 a tome, really, at more than 1,000 pages. Written in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist who ran in the same circles as William Pierce, Which Way Western Man? bemoans the supposed decline of white civilization, the rise of feminism and multiculturalism, and the alleged chokehold liberal orthodoxy has on modern society \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of white supremacy\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nMacMullen said the text meant a lot to him. Back home in Virginia, in the spirit of listening and questioning, Kelvin cracked the book and read the first 50 or so pages. \u201cIt kind of boils down to, do you live your life stuck in the rat race, within society\u2019s norms, or do you break out from that and try to live a more authentic life, doing what you want to do, what you feel is right versus what society says is right?\u201d he said.\n\nThe language struck a chord. He heard echoes of his own transformation, of setting a new course for himself. Whereas Kelvin chose a path defined by hope and inclusivity, people who admire his father have let bigotry be their guide. Still, in their journeys\u2019 common origin, Kelvin saw promise \u2013 the possibility of trying again, and getting it right this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as insurmountable a task to start a recovery process as some people think. It does take discipline, but it actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that, right?\u201d\n\nThe trailer where William Luther Pierce once lived lies in disrepair at the National Alliance compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThe last time Kelvin saw his father, he jumped off a mountain.\n\nKelvin had started hang-gliding in his 20s, and during his first visit to the compound in West Virginia \u2013 the only one he took while William Pierce was alive \u2013 his dad had suggested he glide off one of the property\u2019s peaks. No way, Kelvin told him. There weren\u2019t open areas below where he could land. At best he\u2019d come away injured; at worst he could die.\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Kelvin traveled to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, for a series of flights over the Labor Day weekend. He invited his dad to come watch him. He didn\u2019t expect him to show, but as Kelvin was untying his glider from its rack on his truck, he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cYou need a hand with that?\u201d his father asked.\n\n\u201cYou actually came,\u201d Kelvin replied.\n\nWith his father\u2019s help, Kelvin made quick work of maneuvering his 80lb glider to the launch site. Before them was a pleated vista, gentle peaks and valleys thick with late-summer green. Kelvin suited up and pointed to the landing field where his father could meet him. \u201cClear!\u201d he yelled, before taking a few running steps and leaving the earth.\n\nThe flight was perfect. A swell of wind \u2013 a lift, as hang-gliders say \u2013 allowed Kelvin to pilot much higher than he\u2019d planned, rendering his dad a dot on the ground. He stayed in the sky for an hour. The view was majestic: forests and farms and fields stretching beneath him.\n\nHe touched down with ease in a wide field. As he was packing up his gear, he heard the familiar voice again: \u201cWow, Kelvin, that was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Kelvin knew for certain he\u2019d impressed his father.\n\nThey stood in the landing field talking for a bit longer. Then father and son said their goodbyes and went their separate ways: William Pierce to what Kelvin called \u201chis life of hate at the compound\u201d; he to new chapters of his existence. Some, such as parenthood, would be joyous. Wrestling with his past would be torment. But just like he navigated the wind high above the mountains, Kelvin would steer himself to a place where he could land, safe and whole, and invite others to join him, if only they too have the courage to leap.\n\nKelvin Pierce at a park nearby his home in Virginia.

Crudely written and wildly racist, The Turner Diaries has helped inspire dozens of armed robberies and more than 200 murders in the decades since its publication.\n\nThe Turner Diaries first made headlines when a violent white nationalist gang appropriated the name of The Order, following the tactical blueprint for terrorism in the book. Turner catapulted to national prominence when it was revealed to be a key inspiration for Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people using a truck bomb strikingly similar to one described in detail in the book. Since then, The Turner Diaries has inspired hate crimes and terrorism across the United States and in Europe in more than a dozen separate plots through the present day.\n\nBut beyond the violence committed by its readers, The Turner Diaries was also the seed of significant shift in white-nationalist ideology and recruitment, the effects of which are increasingly relevant today. In \u201cThe Turner Legacy,\u201d a new paper for ICCT \u2013 The Hague, I examine the complicated history of racist dystopian propaganda and the reasons for Turner\u2019s enduring impact.\n\nWhite nationalism was the law of the land in the United States through most of the country\u2019s history. In the wake of the Civil War, institutionalized white supremacy began to erode, a process that accelerated into the 20th Century. Against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, white nationalism began to develop complex ideologies, with a number of different strains emerging.\n\nPedestrian racism\u2014simply disliking or discriminating against people based on race\u2014still played a significant role in society, but as mainstream white nationalism became increasingly stigmatized, these ideological variants became subcultures in which violent extremism could fester.\n\nThe most important movements to emerge from this dynamic were neo-Nazism and Christian Identity. Neo-Nazism is heavily focused on Holocaust denial and symbolic identity markers, while Christian Identity is based on an elaborate religious justification that evolved out of a 19th century religious conspiracy theory called British Israelism, which claimed Anglo-Saxons were the lost tribe of Israel. Both movements trafficked heavily in anti-Semitism, but their animus was directed to all non-white people.\n\nThese movements, along with the Ku Klux Klan, became the face of white nationalism, resulting in further marginalization due to their flamboyant racism and increasing scrutiny from law enforcement, as their views and rhetoric became increasingly extreme.\n\nIt was within this context that William Luther Pierce split from the American Nazi Party and founded the National Alliance. Pierce, an atheist and scientist, was attuned to the fact that these ostentatious forms of white nationalism were deeply alienating to \u201cnormal people,\u201d attracting recruits he described as \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201ccrippled.\u201d The National Alliance downplayed swastikas and goose-stepping, and instead focused on creating propaganda capable of sidestepping mainstream media gatekeepers appealing to broader audiences.\n\nThe Turner Diaries was one of his earliest efforts, and undoubtedly the most successful. Serialized in a National Alliance newsletter, and later published in collected form, The Turner Diaries is a dystopian novel about a United States where non-white minorities have disarmed and oppressed white Americans, leading to an armed white nationalist revolution. In sparse, simplistic prose, the apocalyptic plot follows a white supremacist guerrilla resistance movement known as The Order as it launches a series of terrorist attacks, eventually blossoming into a full-blown insurgency. The Order wins in the end, and embarks on a campaign of global genocides against non-whites.\n\nThe Turner Diaries is notable for its lack of ideological persuasion. At one point in the novel, its protagonist, Earl Turner, is given a book to read. Turner claims the book perfectly explains the reasons for white supremacy and the justification of all of The Order\u2019s actions. Importantly, this magical tome\u2019s contents are never specified. Although the novel\u2019s epilogue broadly hints at a Nazi orientation, the book never explicitly identifies The Order with a specific movement.\n\nDue in part to Pierce\u2019s desire to appeal to \u201cnormal\u201d people, as well as the novel\u2019s limited initial circulation among neo-Nazis, Turner assumes its readers are already racist and do not need to be recruited to that mindset. The abandonment of \u201cwhy\u201d empowers a singular narrative focus on \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d\u2014the necessity of immediate, violent action and concrete suggestions about how to go about it. This is part of why the book has so often been associated with violence and terrorism.\n\nBut as the book\u2019s notoriety grew, it had another effect on the white nationalist movement. The Turner Diaries is a Rorschach test for racists of all stripes, pedestrian or ideological. Readers can bring their own ideologies and justifications to the narrative, or they can bring none at all.\n\nOver the course of time, this universalist approach to white supremacy became the dominant trend for the movement in the United States and Europe. Rather than attempting to market the elaborate mythology and scriptural footnotes of Christian Identity, or the stigmatized pageantry of Hitler and the Nazis, prominent white nationalists began to take a more carefully generic approach, playing on racial fear and resentment as they existed, rather than attempting to manufacture doctrinaire justifications.\n\nIt began with The Order, a real-life terrorist cell that was directly based on the organization described in The Turner Diaries. In a yearlong spree starting in 1983, The Order killed three people and stole millions of dollars, much of which was then distributed to white nationalist leaders and never recovered. Members of the group referred to Turner as their \u201cbible.\u201d\n\nOne member of The Order, David Lane, became a prolific writer in prison after authorities broke up the gang in 1984. Although he wrote a number of lengthy ideological tracts, one of his most important works was the three-page \u201cWhite Genocide Manifesto,\u201d which took Pierce\u2019s dislike for complex ideological formulations to new heights, instead arguing from a platform of \u201cNature's laws, common sense and current circumstances.\u201d The manifesto argues that \u201c\u2019racial integration\u2019 is only a euphemism for genocide,\u201d and that the \u201cwhite race\u201d is on the verge of extinction due to interbreeding with other races.\n\nLane later distilled his views further into a one-sentence statement now known as the 14 Words and widely quoted by white nationalists: \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\u201d Lane died in prison in 2007.\n\nHis simplified formulation avoided the alienating and stigmatized imagery of neo-Nazism and the elaborate Biblical convolutions of Christian Identity, allowing the highly factionalized white nationalist movement to coalesce around a theme on which they could all agree \u2013 an existential threat to the \u201cwhite race.\u201d\n\nThe manifesto itself was soon reduced to the simple phrase \u201cwhite genocide,\u201d which proliferated at the start of the 21st century and has become the overwhelmingly dominant meme of modern white nationalism. The theme was promoted by white nationalist Robert Whitaker, who added what he called \u201cthe mantra\u201d\u2014\u201cAnti-racist is a code word for anti-white.\u201d These two phrases were deliberately repeated and spread widely online, among white nationalists of various ideological persuasions.\n\nWhite nationalist Richard B. Spencer moved the bar even further with the latest iteration of white identity politics, creating the \u201cAlternative Right\u201d website in 2010, the seed of the broader movement is now known as the alt right. Even more amorphous than its predecessors, the alt right includes a variety of anti-social attitudes, including racism, misogyny and religious bigotry, offering many points of entry for new adherents who are frustrated with some aspect of society or politics. Many who identify with the alt right continue to promote the white genocide theme.\n\nWhile it would be a mistake to credit The Turner Diaries for the entirety of this transition in white nationalism, the novel demonstrated how to successfully leverage racial fears and resentments in the service of violence, without a call to a specific ideology, and the book remains widely influential today.\n\nWhile Turner is rightly infamous for the violence it has inspired, most notably in Oklahoma City, its impact on the shape of white nationalism\u2014and the movement\u2019s current resurgence\u2014is an equal part of its dark legacy."}, {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/william-pierce", "page_content": "Pierce was the movement's fiercest anti-Semitic ideologue and he built the Alliance into a money-making machine through its hate music business, Resistance Records. Pierce was also the author of the race war novel The Turner Diaries.

I hope one or two replacement groups spring up to draw away from us the defectives.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce's final speech, National Alliance leadership conference, April 2002\n\n\"If the protagonist learns something or comes to believe in something, if he changes his ideas, the reader tends to do the same thing, he changes too. So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce, quoted in a biography of him called Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, on the power of narrative\n\nBackground\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce's bigoted attitudes toward people of color were inculcated at an early age. He was born in Atlanta into an Old South aristocracy that included his mother and her ancestors. His great-grandfather, he has said, was governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to a fawning biography of Pierce by University of Vermont Professor Robert Griffin, Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce, he grew up in a Southern household during segregation with older relatives who treated a black servant like a virtual slave.\n\nPierce graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. It was during that time that Pierce became concerned by the threat to the white race that he believed was posed by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, and he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing group that once accused President Eisenhower, among many others, of being a communist.\n\nThe John Birch Society, which generally rejected anti-Semitism, turned out to be too namby-pamby for Pierce. In 1966, he quit a job as a senior research scientist at a Connecticut aerospace firm to join George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (1959-67). Upon buying a printing press, Pierce become editor of the party's National Socialist World. After Rockwell was assassinated the following year, Pierce continued to work with the remnants of the group, which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party. In 1968, Pierce became an official of Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting Alabama segregationist and former Gov. George Wallace's bid for the presidency. Willis Carto, already one of America's leading anti-Semitic activists, also joined the Wallace group and in 1970 he and Pierce reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance (NYA). But the two men had a major falling out, and each claimed to be the new group's leader. In 1971, Carto accused Pierce of stealing a mailing list belonging to Carto's anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby organization. Pierce had written to those on the mailing list, attacking the Liberty Lobby's leaders, including Carto. Eventually, Pierce won control of the NYA, which was limited to people under age 30 and focused on activities on college and university campuses.\n\nIn 1974, Pierce dropped the age limit and reorganized the NYA as the National Alliance (NA), which he would lead until his death in 2002. The NA, which aimed to be a vanguard party capable of leading the \"lemmings\" comprising the white masses to revolutionary victory, adopted the slogans \"Free Men Are Not Equal\" and \"Equal Men Are Not Free.\" Effectively a Leninist in terms of tactics, Pierce was not interested in winning his battle through electoral successes. He wanted his vanguard to lead the white masses to power, something that could only come after a period of ethnic cleansing that Pierce referred to as a \"temporary unpleasantness,\" the seizure of state power and creation of all-white nations.\n\nThe text that made Pierce famous, however, was his novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald after first being serialized in the NA publication Attack! The NA boasted that the book was a \"Blueprint,\" a \"Handbook for White Victory.\" Pierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens. Using \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city. The violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children. By the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPierce's novel has inspired many a terrorist. In 1983, the NA's Pacific Northwest leader, Robert Mathews, joined with three other Alliance members and, later, some 20 other people, to create The Order, a white supremacist terrorist group. Based on the group portrayed in The Turner Diaries, Mathews' gang ultimately robbed some $4 million from armored cars. Declaring \"War in '84,\" members of The Order murdered a well-known Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, in Denver. (The first person on their hit list was Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees. They abandoned that attempt due to high levels of security.) Later that year, Mathews was killed in a shootout with the FBI. Pierce hailed his martyred acolyte, saying Mathews \"took us from name-calling to bloodletting.\"\n\nIn 1995, Timothy McVeigh, aided by Army pals Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. The day before, according to officials, McVeigh called an NA recorded message line seven times. When McVeigh was arrested, police found excerpts from The Turner Diaries in his car. After the attack, which was patterned on a similar bombing depicted in The Turner Diaries, Pierce predicted, or maybe hoped, that resentment of Jews, minorities and others would lead to terrorism \"on a scale the world has never seen before.\" In 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\" There are many other cases, as well, where killers were said to be inspired by the novel.\n\nIn 1989, Pierce's publishing arm, National Vanguard Books, printed his second novel, Hunter, depicting the assassination of interracial couples, Jews and politicians. The book was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, convicted of the sniper murders of at least two black men. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, Pierce editorialized that the Nazi leader was \"the greatest man of our era.\" In 1991, Pierce began broadcasting a shortwave radio program, \"American Dissident Voices,\" that was heard worldwide. Within months, it was carried by several AM stations.\n\nIn 1984, after several years in the Arlington, Va., area, Pierce paid $95,000 in cash for a 346-acre tract of land atop a small mountain in West Virginia, where he set up what would become the NA's permanent compound. He would build several structures on the land, including a building for his Cosmotheist Church, which housed the bogus religion conjured up by Pierce primarily as an unsuccessful tax dodge. It was from this compound that Pierce ran an empire that ultimately included sales of books, cassettes, music, and racist paraphernalia. The group created a system of monthly dues and produced a monthly update for its members, the National Alliance Bulletin. At its peak, around the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the NA had more than 1,400 dues-paying members.\n\nThe NA also served as a launching pad for many white supremacist terrorists. Besides the Order members, in 1996 officials arrested NA member Todd Vanbiber in Florida after a pipe bomb he was building exploded in his face. After Vanbiber was sentenced for federal firearms violations, other NA confederates testified that the Vanbiber gang had robbed three banks and donated at least $2,000 to Pierce. A week before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Larry Shoemake opened fire on a black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., killing one person and wounding seven others. Relatives said he was inspired by Pierce's writings.\n\nIn 1999, Pierce made an important business investment, buying white power music label Resistance Records for some $250,000. The deal gave Pierce control of the label's CD catalogue, inventory, mailing list and publishing arm. In the next few years, Resistance came to dominate the white power music scene and also became the biggest moneymaker in the NA empire. Pierce added to that empire in 2000, after \"national socialist black metal\" musician and convicted German murderer Hendrik M\u00f6bus took up residence at the NA headquarters. M\u00f6bus' music label, Cymophane, was then transferred to Pierce's control. Three months after arriving at the compound, M\u00f6bus was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany. Pierce spearheaded a campaign to free M\u00f6bus and raised money to pay for his legal fees. Ultimately, however, M\u00f6bus was deported and jailed in Germany.\n\nIn 2001, in a major break with the past, the NA began to hold rallies and engage in other public activities like leafleting. Organized by Deputy Membership Coordinator Billy Roper, NA members joined, for the first time, with other white supremacists in front of the Israeli Embassy to protest Jewish influence in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce married five times. His first wife was Patricia Jones, whom he met while at the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce was remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, who worked for the NA. The marriage ended in 1985, when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. In Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce talks of preferring immigrant women from Eastern Europe. He married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage that lasted until 1990, when she left Pierce and West Virginia \"for greener pastures in California.\" Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsannah, also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine. Zsuzsannah left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997. He was sharp and condescending toward his last wife, identified only with the pseudonym Irena in Fame, when he was not ignoring her. Irena was miserable living with the savior of the white race.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce made his last public speech at one of the NA's secretive \"leadership conferences\" that were held twice a year at the West Virginia compound. Held on April 20, Hitler's birthday, Pierce emphasized the need to continue building a professional organization while rejecting alliances with other hate groups, whom he derisively mocked. For the 10 days before his unforeseen death from kidney failure and cancer on July 23, 2002, Pierce instructed his subordinates, and worked feverishly to try to assure the survival of the NA. Pierce died an old-fashioned death, appropriate for a man who conceived of himself in decidedly old-fashioned terms \u2014 as a lord among serfs, an elite leader uniquely capable of leading \"his people\" to victory over Jews, \"race traitors,\" and a whole host of other enemies.\n\nPierce's 2002 death came at a critical moment for the NA. A quarter-century after birthing the group, Pierce had finally remade his outfit into a remarkably professional organization. Much of the previous two years had been spent building up a talented staff, learning how to run a profitable business, and intensifying recruiting and propaganda. Just before his death, the NA was bringing in more than $1 million a year, had a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history. Pierce's voice, broadcast via his \"American Dissident Voices\" Internet show, was being heard in Europe and the U.S. In just five days in June 2002, NA members in 20 states distributed 70,000 leaflets.\n\nSix days after Pierce's death, a committee of his key staffers announced that the NA had selected a new leader. Erich Gliebe, the hard-edged former boxer who fought professionally as \"The Aryan Barbarian,\" would be the new chairman, although all agreed that no one could replace Pierce, who was memorialized as \"Our Eternal Chairman,\" comparable to Hitler himself. But Pierce's condescending and harsh words during his final speech doomed the group. His comments that other hate groups were filled with \"freaks and weaklings,\" something first disclosed by the Intelligence Report, seriously undermined the group by driving away its customer base. Within a few months, infighting broke out among the leadership, and splits started to occur. By 2009, the NA had lost nearly all of its members, falling from a high of more than 1,400 to fewer than than 100, Resistance was losing money, and Gliebe was living in the basement of his mother's Cleveland-area home."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/708999681/turner-diaries-influence-on-white-nationalists-continues-to-grow", "page_content": "'The Turner Diaries' Influence On White Nationalists\n\nThe Turner Diaries is a fictional dystopic novel that's served as a foundational piece of white nationalist propaganda. It was written in the 1970s but its hold on the movement can be traced to today.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThe mass shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand, last month wrote the number 14 on his gun, a reference to a 14-word phrase that's popular among white nationalists about securing a future for white children. The phrase was coined by a terror group known as The Order, which took its name from a book of fiction called \"The Turner Diaries.\" NPR's Andrew Limbong reports on why that book continues to have such a lasting effect.\n\nANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: \"The Turner Diaries\" is a piece of dystopic fiction that ends in a nuclear war after which all nonwhites are killed. It was written by a man named William Luther Pierce.\n\nJ M BERGER: Pierce had come out of the neo-Nazi movements of the '60s and early '70s.\n\nLIMBONG: That's J.M. Berger. He studies extremism of all types at Swansea University School of Law and has published a paper about \"The Turner Diaries\" for the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism. Berger says Pierce wanted to broaden the appeal of white nationalism.\n\nBERGER: The ostentatious display of Nazi paraphernalia, for instance, was counterproductive and made it harder to recruit ordinary people. His goal was to radicalize ordinary white people.\n\nLIMBONG: Here's how.\n\nBERGER: The book opens with a cabal of Jews and black people who disarm white Americans, take away their guns so that they can't resist the government.\n\nLIMBONG: So Pierce appealed to those who fear gun control as well as minorities.\n\nBERGER: What follows is a description of a long guerrilla campaign and battle back and forth with this minority government.\n\nLIMBONG: Told through the diaries of a man named Earl Turner. Janet Wilson teaches postcolonial literature at the University of Northampton. She's written about the language used in \"The Turner Diaries.\" She says there's a powerful effect to have this story be told specifically through fictional diary entries.\n\nJANET WILSON: Well, a diary gives immediacy, as the first-person point of view always does. But with the diary, you have reflections.\n\nLIMBONG: You're not with Turner when he commits various acts of horrendous violence. You're with him as he processes, rationalizes and justifies them.\n\nWILSON: You feel the struggle. You don't feel sympathetic, particularly, towards this person, yet you recognize that he's in a cause.\n\nLIMBONG: The main fear in the book is demographic change, particularly through race mixing. There's one chapter devoted to hanging thousands of white people, mostly women, for being in relationships with a nonwhite person. Turner notes in his fictional diaries that this was, quote, \"a grim and bloody day, but an unavoidable one.\" The violence, how they systematically raid houses and pick who lives and who dies, is plainly laid out in instructional detail. But the ideology is more broad says, J.M. Berger, to appeal to different branches of white nationalism - religious, atheist, pagan.\n\nBERGER: So that you can kind of come through it and bring your own ideology and take away a plan of action.\n\nLIMBONG: Berger's research lists a number of terrorists who have been inspired by \"The Turner Diaries,\" including the Oklahoma City bomber. And he says the novel's influence has only grown as the text became widely available and discussed online, including the same message board where the Christchurch shooter first announced his plans. And Berger says the book's influence will continue online in part because we treat it differently from other extremist content. For example, ISIS.\n\nBERGER: There was nobody who was going to go out and argue that ISIS had a right to free speech. There was nobody who's going to complain about ISIS content being taken down off the Internet, whereas white nationalism is much more ingrained in our societies and our governments to the point that, you know, we have elected officials who are almost openly white nationalists in this country. In European countries, we have whole governments that are oriented toward white nationalism.\n\nLIMBONG: \"The Turner Diaries\" ends with Earl Turner murdering himself for the cause of white nationalism. The fictional book is one of the most important texts of white extremist propaganda, and it will likely continue to be a useful recruiting tool.\n\nAndrew Limbong, NPR News.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

American society is in upheaval. Crime rates skyrocket as roving gangs of blacks and other nonwhites rape and pillage nearly at will. Inflation soars and the standard of living drops dramatically. Gasoline is rationed. Two years before, the Cohen Act outlawed private ownership of firearms in the United States; to enforce the ban, Jewish-run human rights groups employed gangs of black men to invade the homes of whites, confiscate their firearms and brutally arrest and imprison the guilty parties -- 800,000 people are arrested -- in what are known as the Gun Raids. After being arrested and subsequently fired from his job in a laboratory, the 35-year-old Turner devotes all of his time to the work of his four-person \"unit,\" which operates in coordination with, but independently of, other cells in the Organization (the cells are directed at a distance by an unseen Revolutionary Command). The diaries begin with the Organization's decision to move beyond its campaign of recruitment and planning to action. The target is clear:\n\nIf the White nations of the world had not allowed themselves to become subject to the Jew, to Jewish ideas, to the Jewish spirit, this war would not be necessary. We can hardly consider ourselves blameless. We can hardly say we had no choice, no chance to avoid the Jew's snare. We can hardly say we were not warned.... The people had finally had their fill of the Jews and their tricks....If the Organization survives this contest, no Jew will -- anywhere. We'll go to the Uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the last of Satan's spawn.\n\nOn September 16, 1991, Organization units undertake acts of guerilla warfare and terrorism that set in motion the events that eventually lead to the overthrow of the System. Turner describes in lurid prose how, during ensuing weeks, he and his colleagues rob a liquor store for money (slitting the throat of the Jewish owner and knocking out his \"fat, grotesque-looking\" wife with a jar of kosher pickles), retrieve weapons stored in buried oil drums, plan assassinations and develop a scheme to bomb the F.B.I.'s headquarters. He goes into extensive detail about the merits of various explosives and his unit's laborious construction of a bomb.\n\nOne month after the start of the Revolution, Turner and his associates plant their device in a hijacked delivery truck, which they park in a subbasement loading area at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington, D.C. Their precisely calibrated efforts prove successful -- 700 people are killed and the building is badly damaged:\n\nAt 9:15 yesterday morning our bomb went off in the F.B.I.'s national headquarters building....the damage is immense. We have certainly dis-rupted a major portion of the F.B.I.'s headquarters operations for at least the next several weeks....we gaped with a mixture of horror and elation at the devastation.... It is a heavy burden of responsibility for us to bear, since most of the victims of our bomb were only pawns who were no more committed to the sick philosophy or the racially destructive goals of the System than we are. But there is no way we can destroy the System without hurting many thousands of innocent people....And if we don't destroy the System before it destroys us...our whole race will die.\n\nBecause of his loyalty and effectiveness, the Organization eventually selects Turner to join its elite inner circle of racial warriors known as \"The Order.\" Meanwhile, the Revolution grows increasingly violent and widespread. Turner's unit is raided, he is arrested and tortured by Israeli military intelligence, escapes from jail and, in part because he failed to kill himself rather than be arrested, is told by the Order that he will have to attempt a suicide mission to become a full-fledged member of the quasi-religious cadre. In the period before he receives this final command, the insurgent Organization, rapidly gaining adherents across the nation, lynches tens of thousands of \"race traitors,\" including liberal actors and politicians and white women who slept with black men, hanging them from utility poles with placards around their neck reading, \"I defiled my race.\" From this moment -- \"The Day of the Rope\" -- the Revolution lurches into genocide.\n\nFinally, Turner receives his suicide order. His last entry describes the mission with heroic self-disregard:\n\nIt's a one way trip to the Pentagon for me. The warhead is strapped into the front seat of the old Stearman [fighter plane] and rigged to detonate either on impact or when I flip a switch in the back seat. Hopefully, I'll be able to manage a low-level air burst directly over the center of the Pentagon. Failing that, I'll at least try to fly as close as I can before I'm shot down.\n\nIn an epilogue, the narrator explains that Turner's suicide bomb crippled the Pentagon and became a turning point in the Revolution. With the System's \"principal military nerve center\" destroyed, the Organization is able to begin destroying urban areas across the nation that were controlled by the enemy. As the Revolution's momentum grows, its mandate begins to extend to white populations and the nonwhite peril across the globe; we learn that white domination over the planet is ultimately achieved with nuclear bombs."}, {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/turner-diaries-other-racist-novels-inspire-extremist-violence", "page_content": "Few works of fiction have moved readers to action quite like The Turner Diaries. Written under a pseudonym by William Pierce, late founder of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, the bloody race-war novel has been dubbed the \"bible of the racist right\" by the FBI.\n\nPublished in 1978, The Turner Diaries has fueled some of the last two decades' most infamous outbreaks of extremist violence, including Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Although The Turner Diaries may be the most famous such novel, it is neither the first nor the last novelized version of dire conspiracies and drastic solutions.\n\nPierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white-supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens.\n\nUsing \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city.\n\nDespite Pierce's stilted prose \u2014 a holdover, maybe, from his career as a physics professor \u2014 the violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children.\n\nBy the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPublished by Pierce's own National Vanguard Press, The Turner Diaries didn't exactly rocket up the best-seller lists when it first appeared. But Pierce certainly got through to Bob Mathews.\n\nA neo-Nazi follower, Mathews organized a real-life group called The Order, based on Pierce's fictional Order, which committed a series of armored car heists and plotted serious racist violence before ambushing and murdering Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg in 1984.\n\nThe Turner Diaries reached its pinnacle of popularity in 1995, after it was widely reported that pages of the novel were found in a plastic baggie in McVeigh's car shortly after the bombing that killed 168 people in Oklahoma City. McVeigh, who sold copies of his favorite novel at gun shows across the country, later said that while he didn't subscribe to the book's racism, he was inspired by its \"pro-gun rights\" message.\n\nAfter McVeigh brought widespread attention to The Turner Diaries, the pace of violence it inspired picked up. In subsequent years, a variety of Earl Turner wannabes have been arrested \u2014 for stockpiling biological weapons, engaging in a racist shooting spree, robbing banks, and assembling pipe bombs with Jewish and black targets in mind.\n\nIn 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\"\n\nPierce, who died in 2002, seemed incredulous \u2014 though pleased \u2014 that his hastily written novel had attracted so much attention. Pierce began the book as a series of installments for Attack!, a racist tabloid published by his National Youth Alliance.\n\nAfter years of writing nonfiction, both about physics and about neo-Nazism, he wanted to explore the propagandistic possibilities offered by fiction. Pierce later told biographer Robert S. Griffin why he believed novels could be so effective: \"If the protagonist learns something or comes to believe in something, if he changes his ideas, the reader tends to do the same thing, he changes too. So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\nViolence and Virtue\n\nIn the past 15 years, dozens of racist and extremist novels have been published by writers hoping to use the tool of fiction as persuasively \u2014 if, perhaps, to a less explicitly violent end \u2014 as Pierce. The novels span every category of extremism \u2014 neo-Nazi, neo-Confederate, radical environmentalist, anti-immigration, antigovernment \u2014 but most stick to Pierce's formula: a white male hero, learning of a massive conspiracy against law-abiding whites, undertakes violent revenge.\n\nThe excessive violence draws readers in, says Griffin, a professor at the University of Vermont. But the ultimate message, he told the Intelligence Report, is \"that European people, white people, have a right to stand up for themselves, have a right to self-determination, to pride, to collective action.\"\n\nThough most are simple, formulaic and no more colorfully written than The Turner Diaries, these novels are finding readers (see sidebar, above). Their authors aren't in a big hurry to sell a million copies, though. They know that Pierce's novel marinated on bookshelves for 17 years before the Oklahoma City bombings made it famous.\n\n\"There are some books that become more popular as the years go by,\" says Gerald James McManus, author of a racist fable called Dark Millennium. \"Moby Dick was not a great success when it was first written, and today it's a classic, so you never know.\"\n\nAmerica's first important extremist novel also took a while to catch on. Published in 1905, Thomas Dixon's The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan made its impact 10 years later when D.W. Griffith adapted it into the landmark film, \"Birth of a Nation.\" Once the movie became a hit, Dixon's maudlin ode to white supremacy helped fuel a massive resurgence of the KKK, which had nearly died out after Reconstruction.\n\nDixon's novel even gave Klansmen a new technique: cross-burnings, which had not been part of the first Klan movement.\n\nThe Clansman depicts a South under barbaric \"black rule\" during Reconstruction. The plot is touched off by an \"apelike\" black man, his \"yellow teeth grinning through thick lips,\" raping the daughter of a white politician.\n\nShamed, the daughter and her mother are both driven to suicide \u2014 which is later avenged by the \"chivalric\" Klan, hooded and robed men Dixon describes as \"noble in sentiment, generous in manhood, and patriotic in purpose.\"\n\nNoble sentiments were hardly the key to The Clansman's success, says Notre Dame professor Rory McVeigh. \"The novel and the film played on fears and prejudices held by many white Americans of the time,\" says McVeigh. \"In particular, they appealed to stereotypes that portrayed black men as lust-crazed beasts who posed a danger to the safety and virtue of white women.\"\n\nProhibited Notions\n\nMore than half a century later, French novelist Jean Raspail tapped into a similar set of stereotypes and fears with his anti-immigration novel, The Camp of the Saints. Written in the early 1970s during a wave of Algerian immigration into France, The Camp of the Saints also took a while to catch on in the U.S. But when it did, two decades later, it had a major influence on the American anti-immigration movement.\n\nFar more fluidly written than most extremist novels, The Camp of the Saints is infused with apocalyptic foreboding. The plot concerns a famine-induced pilgrimage to the shores of the French Riviera by Hindu refugees described as \"kinky-haired, swarthy-skinned, long-despised phantoms.\"\n\nAs the flotilla makes its way around Africa to France, Raspail writes about the ineffectual reactions of government officials, church leaders, liberals and soldiers \u2014 the cultured and civilized who belong to the \"camp of the saints.\" He rails against the \"monstrous cancer\" of multiculturalism and lingers over descriptions of the brown and black hordes with their \"fleshless, Gandhi arms\" \u2014 all heading ominously, disastrously, toward France.\n\nWhen The Social Contract Press, an anti-immigration hate group, reprinted The Camp of the Saints in 1995, the book caught fire with extremists. Reviewing the novel in the white-supremacist American Renaissance magazine, editor Jared Taylor proclaimed, \"this may be the first significant racialist novel since the days of Thomas Dixon.\"\n\nThe Camp of the Saints was \"astonishingly current,\" Taylor said, given the influx of Hispanic immigrants into the U.S. Its \"central tragedy\" was the \"suicidal white weakness\" demonstrated by Westerners reluctant to turn away the immigrants.\n\nTaylor and other anti-immigration activists also picked up on Raspail's notion that the Algerian immigration amounted to a \"peaceful invasion\" of France; many U.S. activists are convinced that a \"Mexican invasion\" of America is currently underway.\n\nThe anti-immigration activists at The Social Contract Press recognized how influential a book like Raspail's could be. \"The poet, the playwright, the novelist, the filmmaker can present truths and open our eyes in ways that demographic analyses, comparative income studies, or social welfare statistics never can,\" reads a publisher's note to the 1995 edition. \"The storytellers can advance notions prohibited to others.\"\n\nFeeding the Hogs\n\nThe main \"prohibited notion\" in recent extremist novels is the oppression, unseen but insidious, of white people.\n\nIn Ellen Williams' Bedford, a World Vision, a small Southern village \u2014 loosely based on Williams' own hometown of Leroy, Ala. \u2014 has been overtaken by liberals. The story revolves around 14-year-old Horace Adam Pruitt Jr., a Southern Baptist kid who's fallen under the influence of a left-wing teacher. Young Pruitt sues his parents for making him go to church \u2014 but that's only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBedford is in upheaval as public schools are \"dumbed down,\" abortion is legalized, secularists advocate euthanasia of the elderly to conserve resources, and speaking out against homosexuality is outlawed. To make matters even worse, the U.S. flag is banned in favor of a United World flag. States have been dissolved, and the country divided into regions.\n\n\"Most people have liked it,\" Williams told the Intelligence Report. \"People say the book is coming true.\" Williams (see Honoring the Confederacy) belongs to both the Council of Conservative Citizens and the League of the South, predominantly Southern hate groups that often work on \"heritage issues.\" At League of the South gatherings, she often provides entertainment, singing such tunes as \"Dixie\" and \"God Save the South.\"\n\nAnother neo-Confederate, author Lloyd Lenard, sings a similar tune about the oppression of Southern whites in The Last Confederate Flag (see C-4 and the Confederacy). Lenard's protagonist, Stonewall Bedford, is persecuted by militant blacks because of his loyalty to the rebel flag.\n\n\"The carpetbaggers aren't all white,\" Bedford tells his wife. \"Hundreds of them are black. They spring up right in our midst, spurred on daily by the goading of their own political leaders. Protected by the U.S. Justice Department, these militants push for the necessity of remolding Southerners into more pliant people.\"\n\nBut they won't remold Bedford. As angry blacks threaten to remove the Confederate battle flag from city hall \u2014 and open fire on Bedford's family \u2014 he tries valiantly to preserve the flag. Nothing can keep him from being true to his Southern heritage.\n\nIn John Ross' Unintended Consequences, a white Southern man faces another form of oppression \u2014 an \"obscure federal gun law written to promote massive noncompliance and give idled [gun] prohibition agents something to do.\" Ross paints Henry Bowman as a Fourth-Amendment underdog who ultimately has no choice but to fight back against the federal government.\n\n\"You fools have been using blank search warrants, planting evidence, and perjuring yourselves in court,\" Bowman tells federal agents after he's turned the tables and apprehended them during a failed raid. \"You've reinterpreted your own rulings and used entrapment to put people in prison over paperwork disputes.\"\n\nBowman, an expert gunman, makes sure that the agents he captures don't abuse citizens' rights any more: He dismembers them and feeds their bodies to hogs.\n\nBowman's violent revenge has drawn comparisons \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 to Earl Turner's adventures. A review from Publisher's Weekly notes that Ross's novel \"seethes with a grudge against a government that is portrayed as having persecuted praiseworthy citizens who merely want to exercise their civil rights. Like the notorious and paranoid Turner Diaries, this novel may speak to readers on the fringes of American society \u2014 but it misses the middle, both artistic and political, by a long shot.\"\n\nWhites in Outer Space\n\nOf course, the middle is not what these novelists are aiming for. Extremist novelists see radical problems that mainstream Americans don't \u2014 and they dream up equally radical solutions. In Gerald James McManus' Dark Millennium, the problem is \"multicultural democracy.\" The solution is unwavering racial violence.\n\nMcManus' novel follows racist tyrant Alexander McGrail as he rises \"with phenomenal quickness from relative obscurity to the top rung of American politics\" \u2014 and then usurps the U.S. presidency to become \"President of Earth for Life.\" McGrail directs a worldwide extermination of all people of color, except for a few particularly intelligent Asians.\n\nMcManus describes the victims being herded into pits and shot, massacred in the streets, and sterilized through tainted drinking water. Whites who fail an IQ test are sterilized, too. Pregnant black women are killed on sight.\n\n\"I think the ultimate message in the book is that the world is heading for terrible problems,\" McManus told the Intelligence Report. He's flattered when readers tell him that his book is \"like a sequel to The Turner Diaries,\" even if he's never actually read Pierce's work.\n\nLike Pierce, McManus is not about to apologize for the mass killings of people of color. His concern, he says, is ultimately the preservation of humanity.\n\n\"The only way for humanity to prosper and expand into outer space is through some type of worldwide benevolent government,\" says McManus. \"We have to quell the population and produce the homogenous society that's needed to survive.\"\n\nOuter space is often the ultimate destination for white characters who survive the violent plots of these books. In Hold Back This Day, Ward Kendall describes a racist dystopia \u2014 a super-globalized world of \"Unification\" where all major religions are distilled into one, Chrislamhindbuddhism, and where brown skin is preferred over white.\n\nThe story revolves around one of the Earth's remaining fair-skinned men, Jeff Huxton. After having a white son in his first marriage, Huxton joins the multicultural majority, taking an Asian woman as his second wife and fathering a biracial daughter. When his white son, Adam, has trouble fitting in at school, Huxton recalls his own days of being a misfit: \"Like Adam, he too had been the class 'freak,' having had the misfortune of being born to one of the last sets of parents who were 'unblended.' \"\n\nYoung Adam finds a white mentor, Karl Ramstrom, who teaches him about white history, back in the good old days before Unification. Adam falls in love with Ramstrom's daughter. The plot thickens when Huxton discovers Adam's plan to leave for Mars with his new white friends and join Avalon, the only white colony left in the universe. Huxton comes around to a new way of thinking, rejecting his multicultural beliefs and blended family in favor of Avalon.\n\nKendall says his novel has been embraced by \"white nationalists\" not because it ends with a utopian fantasy, but because it's based on reality. \"It shows our struggle from the viewpoint of a single man, facing a world determined to see our kind made extinct,\" says Kendall.\n\nAgainst the Odds\n\nThe idea of a lone hero doing battle with the world's evils is nothing new. But William Pierce was apparently on to something when he gave that old storyline a new, white-supremacist twist. Most extremist novels published since The Turner Diaries focus on a white protagonist who wakes up to what's wrong with the world, and then acts against the odds to make things right.\n\nThere's a good reason for that, says Harvard University lecturer Rebecca Wingfield. Social protest novels \u2014 whether it's Uncle Tom's Cabin or Hold Back This Day \u2014 work on readers by drawing them into the experiences of a protagonist they can relate to.\n\n\"As the character undergoes a shift in his or her political position,\" Wingfield says, \"we, as readers, undergo this shift with him or her. Since the appeal here is to our emotions and sympathies, and not just our intellects, fiction offers a much more subtle way of bringing us around to a particular point of view than abstract political argument.\"\n\nPat Shannan certainly hopes so. A writer for the antigovernment Media Bypass magazine, Shannan centers his novel, One In a Million, around the character of Brock Freeman, an easy-going, wholesome attorney from the Midwest. Freeman begins to question the federal tax system, revisiting laws like the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and determining that gold and silver are the only valid forms of tender.\n\n\"Lawful money is defined in 12 USC 152 as '... gold and silver coin of the United States,'\" Freeman explains to his wife, Sarah. \"So you see Honey, these were bona fide receipts good for redemption in the real wealth at any time.\"\n\nFreeman goes on to discover what antigovernment \"Patriots\" have been saying all along: filing taxes is downright un-American. In the shower one morning, he ruminates: \"The Fourth Amendment protection of people to be secure in their 'persons, homes, papers, and effects' is violated by any law that would require one to voluntarily declare all that information on a government form. ...\n\n\"Even if there is a law that requires people to file,\" Freeman decides, \"the law is inapplicable to anyone who doesn't volunteer to fall under it.\"\n\nAs Freeman shifts his thinking, Shannan hopes readers will shift theirs along with him \u2014 and feel his fury when the IRS cracks down on the tax-protesting hero, killing his wife in the process.\n\nShannan told the Intelligence Report that One In a Million is \"a historical novel because most of it's true.\" Not the part about the IRS killing his wife, but the amendments and laws and tax-protesting plot. \"Most of it actually happened to me because I've done battle with the IRS,\" he says.\n\nAfter years of writing nonfiction stories for Media Bypass and other outlets, Shannan says he turned to fiction because it works. \"The way to get people to listen to your message,\" he says, \"is to give them some blood and guts.\"\n\nA century after Thomas Dixon brought out The Clansman, Shannan hopes to take a page out of Dixon's book \u2014 by taking his \"blood and guts\" approach to the big screen. He's convinced that One In a Million could work as a movie. To that end, he's mailed a copy of the novel to Hutton Gibson, Mel's anti-Semitic father.\n\n\"I can see Mel Gibson playing Brock Freeman,\" Shannan says. No word yet on whether the star is interested."}], "The Turner Diaries depicts a violent revolution in the United States leading to the overthrow of the federal government and the extermination of non-whites and Jews.": [{"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/books/turner-diaries-white-supremacists.html", "page_content": "In \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d a group of white supremacists attacks the Capitol in an effort to overthrow the U.S. government.

The fictional diary describes a racist\u2019s vision of a nightmare world, in which \u201cThe System\u201d\u2014African American enforcers led by Jewish politicians\u2014attempt to confiscate all guns in the United States. A secretive organization known as The Order rises up to take back the country for white supremacists, eventually winning an apocalyptic insurgency and nuclear war, first taking over the country and later the world.\n\nThe Turner Diaries was created in the 1970s by William Luther Pierce, leader of the neo-Nazi group the National Alliance. Crudely written and wildly racist, The Turner Diaries has helped inspire dozens of armed robberies and more than 200 murders in the decades since its publication.\n\nThe Turner Diaries first made headlines when a violent white nationalist gang appropriated the name of The Order, following the tactical blueprint for terrorism in the book. Turner catapulted to national prominence when it was revealed to be a key inspiration for Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people using a truck bomb strikingly similar to one described in detail in the book. Since then, The Turner Diaries has inspired hate crimes and terrorism across the United States and in Europe in more than a dozen separate plots through the present day.\n\nBut beyond the violence committed by its readers, The Turner Diaries was also the seed of significant shift in white-nationalist ideology and recruitment, the effects of which are increasingly relevant today. In \u201cThe Turner Legacy,\u201d a new paper for ICCT \u2013 The Hague, I examine the complicated history of racist dystopian propaganda and the reasons for Turner\u2019s enduring impact.\n\nWhite nationalism was the law of the land in the United States through most of the country\u2019s history. In the wake of the Civil War, institutionalized white supremacy began to erode, a process that accelerated into the 20th Century. Against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, white nationalism began to develop complex ideologies, with a number of different strains emerging.\n\nPedestrian racism\u2014simply disliking or discriminating against people based on race\u2014still played a significant role in society, but as mainstream white nationalism became increasingly stigmatized, these ideological variants became subcultures in which violent extremism could fester.\n\nThe most important movements to emerge from this dynamic were neo-Nazism and Christian Identity. Neo-Nazism is heavily focused on Holocaust denial and symbolic identity markers, while Christian Identity is based on an elaborate religious justification that evolved out of a 19th century religious conspiracy theory called British Israelism, which claimed Anglo-Saxons were the lost tribe of Israel. Both movements trafficked heavily in anti-Semitism, but their animus was directed to all non-white people.\n\nThese movements, along with the Ku Klux Klan, became the face of white nationalism, resulting in further marginalization due to their flamboyant racism and increasing scrutiny from law enforcement, as their views and rhetoric became increasingly extreme.\n\nIt was within this context that William Luther Pierce split from the American Nazi Party and founded the National Alliance. Pierce, an atheist and scientist, was attuned to the fact that these ostentatious forms of white nationalism were deeply alienating to \u201cnormal people,\u201d attracting recruits he described as \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201ccrippled.\u201d The National Alliance downplayed swastikas and goose-stepping, and instead focused on creating propaganda capable of sidestepping mainstream media gatekeepers appealing to broader audiences.\n\nThe Turner Diaries was one of his earliest efforts, and undoubtedly the most successful. Serialized in a National Alliance newsletter, and later published in collected form, The Turner Diaries is a dystopian novel about a United States where non-white minorities have disarmed and oppressed white Americans, leading to an armed white nationalist revolution. In sparse, simplistic prose, the apocalyptic plot follows a white supremacist guerrilla resistance movement known as The Order as it launches a series of terrorist attacks, eventually blossoming into a full-blown insurgency. The Order wins in the end, and embarks on a campaign of global genocides against non-whites.\n\nThe Turner Diaries is notable for its lack of ideological persuasion. At one point in the novel, its protagonist, Earl Turner, is given a book to read. Turner claims the book perfectly explains the reasons for white supremacy and the justification of all of The Order\u2019s actions. Importantly, this magical tome\u2019s contents are never specified. Although the novel\u2019s epilogue broadly hints at a Nazi orientation, the book never explicitly identifies The Order with a specific movement.\n\nDue in part to Pierce\u2019s desire to appeal to \u201cnormal\u201d people, as well as the novel\u2019s limited initial circulation among neo-Nazis, Turner assumes its readers are already racist and do not need to be recruited to that mindset. The abandonment of \u201cwhy\u201d empowers a singular narrative focus on \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d\u2014the necessity of immediate, violent action and concrete suggestions about how to go about it. This is part of why the book has so often been associated with violence and terrorism.\n\nBut as the book\u2019s notoriety grew, it had another effect on the white nationalist movement. The Turner Diaries is a Rorschach test for racists of all stripes, pedestrian or ideological. Readers can bring their own ideologies and justifications to the narrative, or they can bring none at all.\n\nOver the course of time, this universalist approach to white supremacy became the dominant trend for the movement in the United States and Europe. Rather than attempting to market the elaborate mythology and scriptural footnotes of Christian Identity, or the stigmatized pageantry of Hitler and the Nazis, prominent white nationalists began to take a more carefully generic approach, playing on racial fear and resentment as they existed, rather than attempting to manufacture doctrinaire justifications.\n\nIt began with The Order, a real-life terrorist cell that was directly based on the organization described in The Turner Diaries. In a yearlong spree starting in 1983, The Order killed three people and stole millions of dollars, much of which was then distributed to white nationalist leaders and never recovered. Members of the group referred to Turner as their \u201cbible.\u201d\n\nOne member of The Order, David Lane, became a prolific writer in prison after authorities broke up the gang in 1984. Although he wrote a number of lengthy ideological tracts, one of his most important works was the three-page \u201cWhite Genocide Manifesto,\u201d which took Pierce\u2019s dislike for complex ideological formulations to new heights, instead arguing from a platform of \u201cNature's laws, common sense and current circumstances.\u201d The manifesto argues that \u201c\u2019racial integration\u2019 is only a euphemism for genocide,\u201d and that the \u201cwhite race\u201d is on the verge of extinction due to interbreeding with other races.\n\nLane later distilled his views further into a one-sentence statement now known as the 14 Words and widely quoted by white nationalists: \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\u201d Lane died in prison in 2007.\n\nHis simplified formulation avoided the alienating and stigmatized imagery of neo-Nazism and the elaborate Biblical convolutions of Christian Identity, allowing the highly factionalized white nationalist movement to coalesce around a theme on which they could all agree \u2013 an existential threat to the \u201cwhite race.\u201d\n\nThe manifesto itself was soon reduced to the simple phrase \u201cwhite genocide,\u201d which proliferated at the start of the 21st century and has become the overwhelmingly dominant meme of modern white nationalism. The theme was promoted by white nationalist Robert Whitaker, who added what he called \u201cthe mantra\u201d\u2014\u201cAnti-racist is a code word for anti-white.\u201d These two phrases were deliberately repeated and spread widely online, among white nationalists of various ideological persuasions.\n\nWhite nationalist Richard B. Spencer moved the bar even further with the latest iteration of white identity politics, creating the \u201cAlternative Right\u201d website in 2010, the seed of the broader movement is now known as the alt right. Even more amorphous than its predecessors, the alt right includes a variety of anti-social attitudes, including racism, misogyny and religious bigotry, offering many points of entry for new adherents who are frustrated with some aspect of society or politics. Many who identify with the alt right continue to promote the white genocide theme.\n\nWhile it would be a mistake to credit The Turner Diaries for the entirety of this transition in white nationalism, the novel demonstrated how to successfully leverage racial fears and resentments in the service of violence, without a call to a specific ideology, and the book remains widely influential today.\n\nWhile Turner is rightly infamous for the violence it has inspired, most notably in Oklahoma City, its impact on the shape of white nationalism\u2014and the movement\u2019s current resurgence\u2014is an equal part of its dark legacy."}, {"url": "https://www.csis.org/analysis/military-police-and-rise-terrorism-united-states", "page_content": "The Issue\n\nU.S. active-duty military personnel and reservists have participated in a growing number of domestic terrorist plots and attacks, according to new data from CSIS. The percentage of all domestic terrorist incidents linked to active-duty and reserve personnel rose in 2020 to 6.4 percent, up from 1.5 percent in 2019 and none in 2018. Similarly, a growing number of current and former law enforcement officers have been involved in domestic terrorism in recent years. But domestic terrorism is a double-edged sword. In 2020, extremists from all sides of the ideological spectrum increasingly targeted the military, law enforcement, and other government actors\u2014putting U.S. security agencies in the crosshairs of domestic terrorists.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is growing concern about the extent to which U.S. military and law enforcement personnel have perpetrated\u2014and been victims of\u2014domestic terrorism.1 In March 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) sent a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees which concluded: \u201cDoD is facing a threat from domestic extremists (DE), particularly those who espouse white supremacy or white nationalist ideologies.\u201d It continued that some domestic extremist networks \u201c(a) actively attempt to recruit military personnel into their group or cause, (b) encourage their members to join the military, or (c) join, themselves, for the purpose of acquiring combat and tactical experience.\u201d2 In 2020, the FBI alerted the DoD that it had opened 143 criminal investigations involving current or former service members\u2014of which nearly half (68) were related to domestic extremism. Most investigations apparently involved veterans, some of whom had unfavorable discharge records.3 The January 6, 2021, events at the U.S. Capitol raised additional concerns, since one reservist, one National Guard member, and at least 31 veterans were charged with conspiracy or other crimes.4 In addition, at least four police officers and three former officers faced federal charges for their involvement in storming the Capitol.5\n\nIn response to these developments, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III pledged to intensify the DoD\u2019s effort to combat extremism in the military, remarking, \u201cIt concerns me to think that anyone wearing the uniform of a soldier, or a sailor, an airman, Marine, or Guardian or Coast Guardsman would espouse these [extremist] sorts of beliefs, let alone act on them. But they do. Some of them still do.\u201d6 Secretary Austin also signed a memo directing commanding officers and supervisors to conduct a one-day \u201cstand-down\u201d to discuss extremism in the ranks with their personnel.7 In addition, the DoD launched an investigation in January 2021 to determine the extent to which the department and military have implemented policies and procedures that prohibit advocacy and participation related to white supremacist, extremist, and criminal gang activity by active-duty personnel.8\n\nNumerous police agencies also conducted investigations into extremism within their departments. As Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City remarked, \u201cAnyone who expresses racist views shouldn\u2019t be a police officer, anyone who expresses white supremacist views shouldn\u2019t be a police officer, anyone who encourages violence against our democratic institutions shouldn\u2019t be a police officer.\u201d9\n\nWhile these steps are an important start, there has been little publicly available data about military or law enforcement involvement in domestic terrorism\u2014as well as attacks against troops and police. In addition, some research is plagued by selection bias because it focuses on a single incident, such as the January 6 event at the U.S. Capitol.10 Without more systematic data, it is hard to gauge the severity of the problem and to make useful recommendations. To help fill the gap, this analysis utilizes CSIS\u2019s data set of domestic terrorist plots and attacks since January 1, 1994, which was updated through the end of January 2021.\n\nThe data indicate that U.S. military personnel have been involved in a growing number of domestic terrorist plots and attacks. The percentage of attacks and plots committed by active-duty and reserve personnel rose in 2020 to 6.4 percent of all attacks and plots (7 of 110 total), up from 1.5 percent in 2019 (1 of 65 total) and none in 2018. Active-duty personnel perpetrated 4.5 percent of the attacks in 2020 (five incidents), and reservists conducted 1.8 percent (two incidents). While these individuals represent a tiny percentage of all current active-duty and reserve personnel, the increased number of incidents is still concerning.11 The data also indicate a rise in law enforcement involvement in attacks. The growth is notable since individuals with a military or law enforcement background have skills that extremists want\u2014such as proficiency in firing weapons, building explosive devices, conducting surveillance and reconnaissance, training personnel, practicing operational security, and performing other types of activities. The data should serve as a cautionary tale. While the numbers are relatively low, they are growing\u2014and the military and law enforcement agencies need to take preventive action now.\n\nThere are several other notable findings from the data set. First, domestic extremists increasingly targeted the military, police, and other government agencies\u2014putting security agencies in the crosshairs of domestic extremists. In 2020, government, military, and especially police personnel and facilities were the target of 38 percent of attacks, the most of any category. Second, there was a rise in the number of terrorist plots and attacks in 2020, despite a relatively low number of fatalities. This trend indicates that terrorism is a growing problem in the United States; there were more terrorist plots and attacks in 2020 than in any year since the CSIS data set started in 1994. Third, the motivations for terrorism have shifted dramatically over the past two decades, from religious extremists inspired by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State after September 11, 2001, to white supremacists, anarchists, and others today. White supremacists, extremist militia supporters, and other like-minded individuals were involved in two-thirds of the attacks and plots in 2020. Anarchists, anti-fascists, and other like-minded individuals perpetrated roughly 23 percent of the plots and attacks in 2020, a notable increase from recent years. And Salafi-jihadists were involved in a mere 5 percent\u2014their lowest share of incidents since 2008.\n\nThe rest of this brief is divided into four sections. The first provides an overview of terrorism and outlines the data set. The second section assesses the main findings on military personnel and law enforcement, both as perpetrators and targets. The third outlines other findings from the CSIS data set. The fourth section offers brief implications.\n\nDomestic extremists increasingly targeted the military, police, and other government agencies\u2014putting security agencies in the crosshairs of domestic extremists.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThis brief focuses on terrorism, which involves the deliberate use\u2014or threat\u2014of violence by non-state actors in order to achieve political goals and create a broad psychological impact.12 Violence and the threat of violence are important components of terrorism. As Professor Bruce Hoffman of Georgetown University argues, terrorism is \u201cthe deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change.\u201d13 U.S. Code, which is the official compilation of general and permanent laws of the United States, defines domestic terrorism under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2331 as \u201cviolent acts or acts dangerous to human life\u201d that occur primarily within U.S. territory. It organizes terrorism acts into three components: the act is intended to \u201cintimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d it aims to \u201cinfluence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,\u201d and it involves \u201cmass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\u201d14\n\nIn focusing on terrorism, this brief does not cover the broader categories of hate speech or hate crimes. There is some overlap between terrorism and hate crimes, since some hate crimes include the use or threat of violence.15 But hate crimes can also include non-violent incidents, such as graffiti and verbal abuse. Hate crimes and hate speech are obviously concerning and a threat to society, but this analysis concentrates only on terrorism and the use\u2014or threat\u2014of violence to achieve political objectives. In addition, this analysis does not focus on protests, riots, looting, and broader civil disturbances\u2014unless they meet the definition of terrorism. While these incidents are important to analyze, most are not terrorism. Some are not violent, while others lack a political motivation or the intention to create a broad psychological impact.16\n\nFinally, while there is often a desire among government officials and academics to focus on terrorist groups and organizations, the terrorism landscape in the United States remains highly decentralized. Many are inspired by the concept of \u201cleaderless resistance,\u201d which rejects a centralized, hierarchical organization in favor of decentralized networks or individual activity.17 The decentralized nature of terrorism is particularly noteworthy regarding the use of violence, which CSIS data suggest is often planned and orchestrated by a single individual or small network.18\n\nBased on this definition, the data set includes 980 cases of terrorist plots and attacks in the United States between January 1, 1994, and January 31, 2021. The data set includes such categories as the incident date, perpetrator, location, motivation, number of individuals wounded or killed, target, weapons used, and perpetrators\u2019 current or former affiliations with law enforcement and the military. The data set\u2014including the codebook, definitions, and limitations\u2014is explained in more detail in a methodology supplement linked at the end of this analysis.\n\nMilitary and Law Enforcement: Perpetrators and Targets\n\nThis section begins with a historical overview of military and law enforcement personnel involved in terrorism. It then examines more recent data about military and law enforcement personnel as both perpetrators and targets of terrorism. To be clear, this analysis does not focus on the broader question of extremism in the military, including its pervasiveness and causes. Nor does it offer a systematic analysis of why these numbers have increased, though it does offer some hypotheses. While these are important issues, the data set focuses on terrorist incidents.\n\nIn addition, there are important distinctions between the types of military personnel. While active-duty members serve full time in the military, reservists serve only part time and cannot be charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) when they are off duty. The military has less authority to respond to veterans who become involved in extremist behavior, but if their conduct violates the UCMJ, the military may be able to respond with retroactive demotions and reduced pensions.19\n\nHistorical Trends: A small number of military and law enforcement personnel have been involved in domestic extremism over the years. In her study of the white power movement, for example, Professor Kathleen Belew of the University of Chicago argues that the Vietnam War and other political, economic, and social factors led to a consolidation and expansion of white power activists, who attempted to recruit active-duty soldiers, reservists, and veterans involved in the Vietnam War.20 In 1970 alone, the U.S. Marine Corps recorded over 1,000 incidents of racial violence at installations in the United States and Vietnam, including violent altercations between black and white Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.21 While most of these were not acts of terrorism, they still contributed to an enabling environment for extremist acts.\n\nIn addition, several influential extremists in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s served in the U.S. military or law enforcement agencies. One of the most prominent white supremacist figures was Louis Beam, who enlisted in the Army when he was 19 years old and fought in the Vietnam War.22 In his speeches and writings\u2014including his influential Essays of a Klansman\u2014Beam argued that activists needed to continue waging the war on U.S. territory using guerrilla warfare.23 Beam was not alone. Randy Duey, a member of the white supremacist group The Order, was an Air Force veteran and instructor at the survival school at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington.24 Randy Weaver\u2014a Christian Identity adherent who held white supremacist and anti-government views, and who was involved in the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff near Naples, Idaho\u2014was a former U.S. Army engineer.25 Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured more than 680 others, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1988 and fought in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. There were also other veterans involved in extremism, such as William Potter Gale, Richard Butler, Bo Gritz, Frazier Glenn Miller, and Eric Rudolph.26\n\nIn addition, some former law enforcement officers were involved in domestic terrorism, including those that were members or sympathizers of the Ku Klux Klan.27 Among the most prominent was Gerald \u201cJack\u201d McLamb, a retired Phoenix police officer who urged resistance to those who supported a one-world government and wrote a 75-page manifesto titled, Operation Vampire Killer 2000: American Police Action Plan for Stopping World Government Rule.28 White supremacist groups also attempted to infiltrate and recruit from law enforcement agencies, according to FBI assessments.29\n\nAmong the most prominent white power books during this period was The Turner Diaries, a dystopian novel that drew heavily on the concept of military and law enforcement personnel as white power soldiers. Written by William Pierce and published under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, The Turner Diaries depicts a violent revolution in the United States which leads to the overthrow of the federal government, a nuclear war, and a race war that results in the extermination of non-whites. In a reference to the U.S. military\u2019s experience fighting communist governments and insurgent groups across the globe, the protagonist, Earl Turner, notes, \u201cWe have had the example of decades of guerrilla warfare in Africa, Asia, and Latin American to instruct us.\u201d30 William Pierce and his National Alliance, a white supremacist and neo-Nazi political organization, attempted to recruit military and law enforcement personnel.31\n\nAccording to FBI data, 37 percent of lone offender terrorists in the United States between 1972 and 2015 served in the military.32 But in the decade after September 11, 2001, there were few attacks by active-duty, reservist, or law enforcement personnel, though extremist groups attempted to infiltrate the military and law enforcement.33 In June 2006, for example, Shayne Allyn Ziska, a state correctional officer in California, was sentenced to 17.5 years in prison for aiding a white supremacist prison gang called the Nazi Low Riders.34 But the trends began to change over the past several years.\n\nMilitary: As Figure 1 shows, there was an increase in the percentage of domestic terrorist plots and attacks perpetrated by active-duty and reserve personnel in recent years.35 In 2020, 6.4 percent of all domestic terrorist attacks and plots (7 of 110 total) were committed by one or more active-duty or reserve members\u2014an increase from 1.5 percent in 2019 (1 of 65 total) and none in 2018. While the attacks in 2021 account for only one month, the numbers in January 2021 showed another increase: 17.6 percent of domestic terrorism plots and attacks (3 of 17 total) were committed by active-duty or reserve personnel.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, for example, the FBI and U.S. Army Counterintelligence Coordinating Authority arrested a U.S. Army soldier, Cole James Bridges, at Fort Stewart after he conspired to blow up the 9/11 Memorial in New York and attempted to provide support to the Islamic State.36 On May 30, 2020, authorities in Las Vegas, Nevada, arrested Andrew Lynam, an Army reservist, alongside Navy veteran Stephen T. Parshall and Air Force veteran William L. Loomis\u2014all self-identified Boogaloo Bois\u2014for conspiring to firebomb a U.S. Forest Service building and a power substation to sow chaos during the protests held in response to the murder of George Floyd.37 On June 10, 2020, the FBI arrested Army Private Ethan Melzer, who sent sensitive U.S. military information to the Order of the Nine Angles (O9A), an occult-based neo-Nazi and white supremacist group, in an attempt to facilitate a mass-casualty attack on Melzer\u2019s Army unit.38 On May 29, 2020, Air Force Staff Sergeant Steven Carrillo, a supporter of the Boogaloo Bois who wanted to ignite a civil war, shot and killed Pat Underwood, a protective security officer, and wounded his partner in Oakland, California. Carrillo also killed a Santa Cruz County sheriff\u2019s deputy in Ben Lomond, California, with an assault rifle on June 6, 2020.39\n\nIn addition, the January 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol included veterans, reservists, a member of the National Guard, members of several militias and extremist organizations (such as the Sons of Liberty New Jersey, Groyper Army, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, Boogaloo Bois, and Three Percenters), supporters of the extremist conspiracy QAnon, and other groups and networks. No participants have been identified as active-duty military personnel. On January 13, the FBI arrested Jacob Fracker, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, for his involvement in the Capitol attack.40 As Fracker explained in an Instagram post, \u201cSorry I hate freedom? Sorry I fought for it and lost friends for it? . . . I can protest for what I believe in and still support your protest for what you believe in. Just saying . . . after all, I fought for your right to do it.\u201d41\n\nVeterans have also been involved in domestic terrorist attacks and plots.42 In October 2020, for example, the FBI arrested Adam Fox, Barry Croft, and several other accomplices in a plot to kidnap and potentially execute Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Members of this network, which had ties to militias in Michigan and other states, referred to Governor Whitmer as a \u201ctyrant\u201d and claimed that she had \u201cuncontrolled power right now.\u201d43 Paul Edward Bellar, a U.S. Army veteran who had been honorably discharged roughly a year before his arrest, trained the group on the use of firearms, medical care, and other tactical skills.44 Veterans consistently committed more attacks and plots than active-duty and reserve troops\u2014including 10 percent of all domestic terrorist attacks and plots since 2015, according to CSIS data.\n\nDomestic extremist groups and networks have also attempted to recruit veterans, active-duty personnel, and reservists. To be clear, this analysis is not suggesting that individuals serving in the military or who are veterans are more inclined to embrace extremism than the general population or are attracted to extremist ideologies. Nevertheless, violent far-right and far-left networks have solicited military personnel because of their skill sets. According to one estimate, veterans and active-duty members of the military currently make up roughly 25 percent of active militia members.45 Such organizations as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters include active-duty personnel, reservists, veterans, and law enforcement personnel.46 The Boogaloo Bois, anti-fascists, and extremists with other motivations have also included active-duty personnel, reservists, and veterans.\n\nLaw Enforcement: CSIS data identified six incidents since 1994 in which current or former law enforcement personnel committed domestic terrorist plots and attacks\u2014though all six cases occurred since 2017. As with active-duty and reserve military personnel, this is an increase, despite representing a small fraction of all law enforcement professionals in the United States. Between October 2020 and January 2021, three domestic terrorist attacks or plots involved current law enforcement officers. For example, Joseph Wayne Fischer, an off-duty patrolman from Pennsylvania, participated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack and was reportedly in the front wave of rioters pushing back police officers. Fischer was charged with multiple criminal offenses, including obstruction of law enforcement and violent entry.47 At least four current police officers and three former officers were allegedly involved in the January 6 incident at the Capitol.48\n\nFormer law enforcement officers were involved in two incidents in 2017 and one in 2020. On October 19, 2020, former Houston police captain Mark Anthony Aguirre ran a repairman off the road, pinned him to the ground, and threatened him at gunpoint, claiming that the man was transporting 750,000 false ballots as part of an election fraud scheme\u2014a conspiracy theory pushed by the group Liberty Center for God and Country.49\n\nTerrorist Targeting of Military and Law Enforcement: CSIS data also show that the U.S. government, military, and law enforcement were increasingly targeted by domestic terrorists. As shown in Figure 2, government, military, and police personnel and facilities were the targets of 34 of 89 attacks in 2020 from perpetrators of varying ideologies, making them the most frequent targets.50 Of these 34 attacks, 19 targeted the government, 15 targeted law enforcement, and 1 targeted the military.51 The attacks were led by perpetrators of various ideologies, including violent far-right, violent far-left, religious, and the Boogaloo Bois\u2014who were responsible for all attacks coded as \u201cother\u201d in the 2020 data.\n\nIn addition, the percentage of domestic terrorist attacks against government, military, and police agencies increased over the past five years. In 2020, 38 percent of all domestic terrorist attacks targeted these institutions. This was the second-highest percentage since at least 1994\u2014exceeded only in 2013, when attacks against government, military, and police targets comprised 46 percent of all attacks. The frequency of attacks against military and\u2014in particular\u2014law enforcement targets may be due, in part, to a growing belief by extremists that security agencies are the most visible arm of an illegitimate and oppressive government.\n\nFor some anti-fascists, the police are quintessential symbols of a repressive state\u2014including against minority populations.52 \u201cAs for the police . . . the historical record shows that along with the military they have also been among the most eager for a \u2018return to order,\u2019\u201d wrote Mark Bray in Antifa: The Anti-fascist Handbook.53 This explains why some anti-fascists and anarchists conducted attacks against police stations and police vehicles during the protests in the summer of 2020. As highlighted by the events on January 6, 2021, however, some on the violent far-right also consider law enforcement the main security arm of a government they believe is illegitimate. \u201cTraitors! Traitors! Traitors!\u201d chanted some individuals on the Capitol steps on January 6. \u201cThe blue does not back you,\u201d read a message from a pro-Proud Boys group on the social networking service Parler, \u201cThey back the men who pay them.\u201d54\n\nWhile this analysis does not conduct a comprehensive analysis of why there was a rise in the number and percentage of active-duty and reserve personnel involved in domestic terrorist attacks and plots, there are several hypotheses worth considering. For example, it would be worth examining whether the deployment of soldiers to controversial battlefields such as Iraq and Afghanistan triggered a backlash against U.S. society and the government (much like with the Vietnam War); whether military personnel have been increasingly influenced by the political polarization prevalent in the United States; or whether military personnel have been more active on the internet and social media platforms, which has contributed to radicalization. In addition, there may be other social, economic, educational, or cultural variables at play, along with the possible proliferation of charismatic individuals that have spread propaganda in the military.\n\nOther Findings\n\nCSIS also examined trends in the number and characteristics of attacks and plots. This section analyzes the data in two parts: number of incidents and fatalities, and perpetrator ideology.\n\nIncidents and Fatalities: In 2020, the number of domestic terrorist attacks and plots increased to its highest level since at least 1994, though fatalities were relatively low. Across all perpetrator ideologies, there were 110 domestic terrorist attacks and plots in 2020\u2014an increase of 45 incidents since 2019 and 40 more incidents than in 2017, the year which previously had the most terrorist attacks and plots since the beginning of the data set. Despite this sharp increase in terrorist activity, the number of fatalities from domestic terrorist attacks was at its lowest level since 2013. Five people were killed in terrorist attacks in 2020\u2014an 86 percent decrease from 2019, when 35 individuals died in terrorist attacks.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for this drop in lethality. First, there were 21 terrorist plots recorded in 2020 which were disrupted before an attack could take place. Some decrease in fatalities, then, may be attributed to the effective work of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in preventing attacks.\n\nSecond, there were no mass-casualty terrorist attacks in 2020. All five victims were killed with firearms in five separate attacks. In comparison, there were seven fatal attacks each in 2018 and 2019, resulting in 19 and 35 fatalities, respectively. Though the number of fatal attacks was similar, each of these previous years included a mass-casualty attack that significantly raised the total. In 2018, Robert Bowers murdered 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in 2019, Patrick Crusius murdered 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. This alone does not explain the reduction, however, because there was ample opportunity for similar mass-casualty events in 2020. As highlighted in Figure 2, soft targets such as demonstrators and private individuals were frequent targets of terrorist attacks and plots. Furthermore, previous CSIS analysis found that vehicles were increasingly common weapons in terrorist attacks in 2020, joining firearms, explosives, and incendiaries as some of the most commonly used weapons\u2014all of which have high potential lethality.55\n\nThird, the restraint shown in those attacks may point to perpetrators prioritizing sending a message through fear rather than fatalities. Though there has been substantial rhetoric about bringing about a second civil war\u2014such as from the Boogaloo Bois and some white supremacists\u2014many extremists may wait for their ideological adversaries to act first, whether through violent action or policy change that is perceived as an existential threat. This is consistent with the philosophy put forward by militia leaders such as the Three Percenters\u2019 co-founder Mike Vanderboegh, who in 2008 advised his followers not to \u201cfire first\u201d and instead to wait and act under the justification of the common defense so as to \u201cnot cede the moral high ground.\u201d56\n\nPerpetrator Ideology: CSIS also coded the ideology of perpetrators into one of five categories: ethnonationalist, religious, violent far-left, violent far-right, and other. (The link to the methodology, which includes definitions of these categories, can be found at the end of this brief.) All religious attacks and plots in the CSIS data set were committed by terrorists motivated by a Salafi-jihadist ideology.\n\nWhite supremacists, extremist militia members, and other violent far-right extremists were responsible for 66 percent of domestic terrorist attacks and plots in 2020\u2014roughly consistent with their share in other recent years.57 For example, on June 7, Harry H. Rogers\u2014a self-proclaimed leader of the Ku Klux Klan\u2014intentionally drove his pick-up truck into a crowd of Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Henrico, Virginia. One protester was injured, and Rogers received a six-year prison sentence.58 In addition, anarchists, anti-fascists, violent environmentalists, and other violent far-left extremists conducted 23 percent of terrorist attacks and plots in 2020\u2014an increase from the previous three years, in which violent far-left incidents comprised between 5 and 11 percent of all domestic terrorist attacks and plots. For example, on August 29 in Portland, Oregon, Michael Reinoehl\u2014an Antifa extremist\u2014followed two members of the far-right group Patriot Prayer and then shot and killed one of them, Aaron \u201cJay\u201d Danielson.59\n\nMeanwhile, the portion of attacks and plots inspired by a Salafi-jihadist ideology fell to 5 percent in 2020\u2014a sharp decline compared to recent years such as 2019, in which they comprised 29 percent of incidents. For example, on May 21, Adam Aalim Alsahli\u2014a Syrian-born U.S. citizen inspired by jihadist figures such as Ibrahim al-Rabaysh\u2014drove his vehicle into the gate of Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas and then opened fire on a guard.60 The proportion of attacks and plots by ideology in January 2021 remained roughly consistent with the 2020 data.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nU.S. military and law enforcement agencies need to better understand the scope of the problem through better data collection and analysis. The U.S. military has already taken steps along these lines in such areas as sexual assault and suicides. At the moment, the number of active-duty military personnel, reservists, and police involved in domestic terrorism is relatively small, though it is rising.61\n\nThese challenges will persist since extremist networks seek to embed their members in the military and law enforcement agencies and to actively recruit current and retired personnel.62 The Russian government has also recognized that these groups may be vulnerable to extremist ideologies and has targeted active-duty personnel, reservists, veterans, and police through an aggressive cyber and disinformation campaign on digital platforms.63 Military and law enforcement personnel have valuable skills that extremist networks want, such as small unit tactics, communications, logistics, reconnaissance, and surveillance. They may also have access to weapons and explosives. In January 2021, for example, several pounds of C-4 explosives went missing from a Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, California.64\n\nAny effort to disrupt extremism in the military must address all stages of service. In vetting new recruits and renewing existing security clearances, for example, revisions to the SF-86 process should help identify individuals associated with extremist networks. At least one reservist who participated in the January 6 Capitol attack held a security clearance and was well known among his colleagues for harboring extremist views.65 An FBI database of lone offender terrorism in the United States indicated that 10 percent of offenders between 1972 and 2015 took steps to join the military but were either disqualified during the application process or dropped out after realizing they might not meet the qualifications.66 Deterrence is critical. The DoD should publicly announce any changes to its vetting processes to deter those with extremist views from even attempting to join the military.\n\nU.S. military and law enforcement agencies need to better understand the scope of the problem through better data collection and analysis.\n\nThe military and police should also increase their focus on counterextremism education as well as offer clear reporting and oversight processes for current service members and police officers. This may include training personnel on identity signaling within extremist networks, including symbols displayed in tattoos and on apparel. On the law enforcement side, organizations such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) should increase efforts to better understand and counter extremism within police forces. Finally, there should be a focus on veterans and individuals exiting the services, who are at an increased risk of recruitment.67\n\nA data-driven understanding of the nature of extremist behavior among military and law enforcement personnel could help inform and prioritize these efforts. For example, CSIS analysis found that while there was an increase in active-duty and reserve personnel involvement in terrorist attacks and plots, the majority of perpetrators affiliated with the military in recent years were veterans. Though the military does not have as much influence over the behavior of veterans once they separate from the military, the DoD could pull service records for all military-affiliated perpetrators and gather information to better understand the causes. Such patterns could inform efforts to disrupt radicalization pathways before individuals leave the military. Congressionally directed or agency-initiated efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could also help identify and counter extremist activity among veterans, and data-sharing agreements between the DoD and VA could strengthen deradicalization efforts.\n\nSimultaneously, the U.S. government should prepare for the military, law enforcement, and other government agencies to continue to be frequent targets of domestic terrorism. Attacks against these institutions are increasing from extremists of diverse ideologies. This risk may be exacerbated by such issues as gun control, immigration, and Covid-19 policies. The DoD and law enforcement agencies should conceptualize efforts to counter domestic extremism as an issue of self-defense and support for their personnel. This concern may shape strategies to eliminate extremist ideology among service members. For example, individual commanders could work to build a trusting environment to report and address these problems framed in terms of unit defense and cohesion, rather than levying blame.\n\nFurthermore, concerns about extremism in the military and law enforcement are not confined to the United States.68 Germany has faced significant problems, from which the United States may be able to draw some lessons. In November 2020, a German government investigation identified 26 soldiers and 9 police officers who organized and participated in online chat groups that shared far-right, anti-Semitic, and neo-Nazi content.69 The investigations came on the heels of an October 2020 report by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, or BfV), which documented more than 1,400 cases of far-right extremism in the police and intelligence services over the previous four years.70 In 2020, Germany\u2019s Defense Ministry identified 20 far-right extremists within a company of the country\u2019s elite special forces, the Kommando Spezialkr\u00e4fte. The German military disbanded the 2nd Company, though 48,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 135 pounds of explosives went missing from the unit\u2019s stockpiles.71 More broadly, the European police agency Europol warned in a confidential report that extremist groups in Europe attempted to bolster their \u201ccombat skills\u201d by recruiting military and police members.72\n\nOf broader concern, the U.S. government does not publicly release data on terrorist attacks and plots, nor on the characteristics of perpetrators. However, if a centralized data collection effort were established, data analysis could offer an objective mechanism for apportioning counterterrorism resources and efforts relative to actual threats. For example, CSIS data show that domestic terrorist attacks and plots from violent far-right and far-left actors are on the rise, while Salafi-jihadist-inspired terrorism is declining. This presents a clear case for continuing to redirect resources away from Salafi-jihadist to other types of extremism.\n\nDespite these challenges, one reason for hope is the low number of deaths from domestic terrorism. Terrorism from violent far-right and far-left extremists has not killed many Americans\u2014at least not recently. This could change, of course, as Timothy McVeigh illustrated in 1995. Terrorism expert Brian Jenkins once wrote that \u201cterrorism is theater\u201d and \u201cterrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead.\u201d73 These aphorisms may not have been true of al-Qaeda and Islamic State adherents, as Jenkins recognized.74 But the data certainly raise questions about how far most domestic terrorists are willing to go today.\n\nSeth G.

A car bombing of FBI headquarters kills hundreds. On \u201cThe Day of the Rope,\u201d members of the Organization publicly hang members of Congress, journalists and others they deem traitors. The goal, of course: to overthrow a federal government they believe is engaged in a vast elitist conspiracy.\n\nWhen historian and author Kathleen Belew watched a white mob of Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, leaving five people dead, she immediately thought of the novel, partly because others have thought about it too: the white supremacists who stormed the Capitol and the law enforcement agencies that monitor them. The FBI has called \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d \u201cthe bible of the racist right.\u201d\n\nThe novel was written by William Luther Pierce, head of the neo-Nazi group the National Alliance, under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. \u201c[It] imagines a successful coup by white power activists who take over a homeland, the U.S., then the world,\u201d Belew, author of \u201cBring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,\u201d wrote Thursday in a Twitter thread explaining the connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the books most widely read and cited by extreme far-right groups like the Order and the Aryan Republican Army, \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d has inspired hate crimes and terrorism in the U.S. and beyond for more than 40 years. The Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, which killed 168 people, bore striking similarities to events in the book.\n\nThis morning, a lot of people thinking about The Turner Diaries, so here is some history. Turner Diaries is a novel that imagines a successful coup by white power activists who take over a homeland, then the US, then the world (1) \u2014 Kathleen Belew (@kathleen_belew) January 7, 2021\n\nBelew spoke with the Times on Friday about Wednesday\u2019s attack and how it felt to watch one of the most infamous and virulent novels in American history come to life.\n\nWhere were you when you heard what was happening at the Capitol?\n\nI was watching it live, anticipating that something like this might occur. From the beginning, it was clear that protesters were moving aggressively on the Capitol. We had indications from people who were watching those online chat spaces that they were planning an action. And it was clear that the mainstream reporting and the Capitol police were not responding in the way one would think. Even among experts who study this, and perhaps were not surprised by the events of Wednesday, it\u2019s still an astounding thing to see a mob violently storm the Capitol and gain access to the building. It\u2019s an incredibly upsetting moment.\n\nAt what point did \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d come to mind?\n\nIt\u2019s clear to anyone who studies this movement that some of the activists at Wednesday\u2019s action were white power activists. What we\u2019re looking at on Wednesday is sort of a broad coalition of Trump fans and QAnon believers and more extremist white power groups. But I think that \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d really becomes a clear point of reference if you look at the photographs of the action. Activists erected a gallows outside the Capitol and hung up symbolic nooses. I saw another photograph of someone who had smashed a television camera and made the cord into a noose. That\u2019s a reference to \u201cThe Day of the Rope,\u201d the systematic hanging of lawmakers and other people they consider enemies. The \u201cDiaries\u201d also features very prominently an attack on Congress that is significantly not a mass casualty attack. Although there are lots of mass casualty attacks in \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d what happens at Congress is instead meant to be a show of force that a group of activists can impact even a highly secured target. So what we see there is a really clear alignment [with] the way it\u2019s imagined in the movement.\n\nWhat role does such a book play in white power movements?\n\n\u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d is a novel but it\u2019s also a manual of operations and a cultural lodestar, or center point, for white power activists. It has been since it came out in the 1970s. The novel is important not because it\u2019s a good novel \u2014 and here I want to just remind readers never to purchase this novel new because you may inadvertently contribute money to white power groups \u2014 but because it provides an answer to a really important question to this movement: How can a small group of fringe activists wage war on a militarized superstate like the United States of America? In the novel, they put it as: \u201cHow can a gnat assassinate an elephant?\u201d\n\nAnd what it does is lay out a plan for guerrilla warfare and domestic terror that involves not only mass casualty attacks but also symbolic attacks that seek to \u201cawaken\u201d other white people to the cause. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at this week. This is meant to be a symbolic strike not to tally a large body count \u2014 although certainly the casualties would\u2019ve been a lot higher if the bombs had gone off and the Molotov cocktails deployed and the assault rifle used \u2014 but an event that will be seen as a highly symbolic victory. Activists successfully stormed the nation\u2019s Capitol. They got into the building. They made legislators cower. They defaced offices. And they delayed the tallying of our election. They actually did carry out a really successful action this week, and I think it will be seen as a green light by many people in this movement.\n\nHistorian Kathleen Belew has studied for years the influence \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d has had on white supremacist groups. (Brian McConkey)\n\nThe guerrilla army in the book that attempts to overthrow the government also seeks to overthrow institutions like the media. On Wednesday, journalists were assaulted and the words \u201cMurder the media\u201d scratched on a door. What connections did you see there?\n\nThe \u201cDay of the Rope\u201d \u2014 some of the targeted enemies include journalists. But part of what\u2019s going on in the white power movement, from at least the early 1980s to the present, is that they believe in a conspiracy theory in which a group of corrupt elites controls government, banking, the media and others. Often this is imagined as Jewish elites or people of color controlling white people. Clearly, we are seeing this now morph into or at least coexist with QAnon, which also has conspiratorial beliefs about elites. That same theory unites a whole bunch of different enemies in the eyes of the movement. And that\u2019s everybody from people of color to Jewish people to people they consider race traitors \u2014 to journalists, communists, socialists and lawmakers. They\u2019re all on that list of targets.\n\nWhat other real-world events might have been inspired by the book?\n\nFirst, let me talk about how we know the novel is important to these activists. I just saw a video of Proud Boys telling a journalist to read \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d that was going around online. It shows up everywhere. In the 1980s, there are all of these stories about people finding the book in bookstores all around the world. They kept stacks of them, not just one copy but 15 copies in the book house of one white power terrorist group. They distributed them at paramilitary training camps. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh carried and read and sold the book to others on the gun show circuit. And it\u2019s just one of those things that keeps coming up because it answers this question of how a fringe movement can exert military control on a superstate like the United States.\n\nWhat was it like to watch on Wednesday, knowing the source material so well?\n\nIt\u2019s a very strange thing. I have the unique position perhaps of not being particularly surprised, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t incredibly disheartening. What I will say is that knowing this history, it\u2019s very clear that there is an ideological frame to what\u2019s happening. There is a history of the recent past that explains who these activists are and what they\u2019re trying to do, and that history can really help us make sense of what we are seeing in the present.\n\nAnd what are we seeing? What can we learn that will help?\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been trying to tell us that white supremacist extremism is the greatest terrorist threat to the United States, that they represent an enormous danger to our democracy and to everyday people. I hope that after Wednesday, more people will heed that warning and that we can finally hold our lawmakers accountable for keeping us safe from that threat.\n\nWhat role do you think President Donald Trump played in this?\n\nI think people are putting a lot of stock in Trump\u2019s role here, and I think it\u2019s correct that he incited the riot and has served as the figurehead for this movement. But one thing we can learn from the history of white power activism is that there is very little reason to think he will retain any kind of coherent command over this groundswell, and I think the fact he can call these people to arms does not mean he can call them off."}, {"url": "https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/turner-diaries", "page_content": "Birth of the New World Order\n\nIt is 1991, or 8 BNE (Before the New Era). American society is in upheaval. Crime rates skyrocket as roving gangs of blacks and other nonwhites rape and pillage nearly at will. Inflation soars and the standard of living drops dramatically. Gasoline is rationed. Two years before, the Cohen Act outlawed private ownership of firearms in the United States; to enforce the ban, Jewish-run human rights groups employed gangs of black men to invade the homes of whites, confiscate their firearms and brutally arrest and imprison the guilty parties -- 800,000 people are arrested -- in what are known as the Gun Raids. After being arrested and subsequently fired from his job in a laboratory, the 35-year-old Turner devotes all of his time to the work of his four-person \"unit,\" which operates in coordination with, but independently of, other cells in the Organization (the cells are directed at a distance by an unseen Revolutionary Command). The diaries begin with the Organization's decision to move beyond its campaign of recruitment and planning to action. The target is clear:\n\nIf the White nations of the world had not allowed themselves to become subject to the Jew, to Jewish ideas, to the Jewish spirit, this war would not be necessary. We can hardly consider ourselves blameless. We can hardly say we had no choice, no chance to avoid the Jew's snare. We can hardly say we were not warned.... The people had finally had their fill of the Jews and their tricks....If the Organization survives this contest, no Jew will -- anywhere. We'll go to the Uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the last of Satan's spawn.\n\nOn September 16, 1991, Organization units undertake acts of guerilla warfare and terrorism that set in motion the events that eventually lead to the overthrow of the System. Turner describes in lurid prose how, during ensuing weeks, he and his colleagues rob a liquor store for money (slitting the throat of the Jewish owner and knocking out his \"fat, grotesque-looking\" wife with a jar of kosher pickles), retrieve weapons stored in buried oil drums, plan assassinations and develop a scheme to bomb the F.B.I.'s headquarters. He goes into extensive detail about the merits of various explosives and his unit's laborious construction of a bomb.\n\nOne month after the start of the Revolution, Turner and his associates plant their device in a hijacked delivery truck, which they park in a subbasement loading area at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington, D.C. Their precisely calibrated efforts prove successful -- 700 people are killed and the building is badly damaged:\n\nAt 9:15 yesterday morning our bomb went off in the F.B.I.'s national headquarters building....the damage is immense. We have certainly dis-rupted a major portion of the F.B.I.'s headquarters operations for at least the next several weeks....we gaped with a mixture of horror and elation at the devastation.... It is a heavy burden of responsibility for us to bear, since most of the victims of our bomb were only pawns who were no more committed to the sick philosophy or the racially destructive goals of the System than we are. But there is no way we can destroy the System without hurting many thousands of innocent people....And if we don't destroy the System before it destroys us...our whole race will die.\n\nBecause of his loyalty and effectiveness, the Organization eventually selects Turner to join its elite inner circle of racial warriors known as \"The Order.\" Meanwhile, the Revolution grows increasingly violent and widespread. Turner's unit is raided, he is arrested and tortured by Israeli military intelligence, escapes from jail and, in part because he failed to kill himself rather than be arrested, is told by the Order that he will have to attempt a suicide mission to become a full-fledged member of the quasi-religious cadre. In the period before he receives this final command, the insurgent Organization, rapidly gaining adherents across the nation, lynches tens of thousands of \"race traitors,\" including liberal actors and politicians and white women who slept with black men, hanging them from utility poles with placards around their neck reading, \"I defiled my race.\" From this moment -- \"The Day of the Rope\" -- the Revolution lurches into genocide.\n\nFinally, Turner receives his suicide order. His last entry describes the mission with heroic self-disregard:\n\nIt's a one way trip to the Pentagon for me. The warhead is strapped into the front seat of the old Stearman [fighter plane] and rigged to detonate either on impact or when I flip a switch in the back seat. Hopefully, I'll be able to manage a low-level air burst directly over the center of the Pentagon. Failing that, I'll at least try to fly as close as I can before I'm shot down.\n\nIn an epilogue, the narrator explains that Turner's suicide bomb crippled the Pentagon and became a turning point in the Revolution. With the System's \"principal military nerve center\" destroyed, the Organization is able to begin destroying urban areas across the nation that were controlled by the enemy. As the Revolution's momentum grows, its mandate begins to extend to white populations and the nonwhite peril across the globe; we learn that white domination over the planet is ultimately achieved with nuclear bombs."}, {"url": "https://www.vox.com/22232779/the-turner-diaries-novel-links-to-terrorism-william-luther-pierce", "page_content": "Following the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Amazon took the unusual step on January 12 of removing all copies of a novel called The Turner Diaries from its virtual shelves. That may seem like a drastic stance given the debate over censorship and free speech that has accompanied these types of purges. But it\u2019s one that signifies just how notorious the book has become, and how much real-world damage it\u2019s arguably caused.\n\nWritten and self-published by a racist man who founded a dangerous white supremacist organization, The Turner Diaries has long been viewed as a fundamental manual of extremism. While other more well-known cultural artifacts like The Catcher in the Rye (a favorite of presidential and other assassins) or The Anarchist Cookbook (a well-known \u201cmurder manual\u201d for terrorists, mass shooters, and other extremists) have captured the public consciousness as bait for potentially violent, disaffected loners, The Turner Diaries has been little-known for decades outside of extremist circles. But within those extremist circles, it became well-established as a core text due to its use as, essentially, a training manual for America\u2019s largest neo-Nazi organization \u2014 and then the internet made it more accessible than ever.\n\nAlthough The Turner Diaries is fiction, its narrative mirrors recent real-world events, probably because many modern-day extremists have been so influenced by it. We can see that influence in the most direct and chilling way \u2014 because, among other things, The Turner Diaries ends with a violent terrorist coup against the US government, not unlike the January 6 Capitol insurrection. But while The Turner Diaries is foundational to modern white supremacy\u2019s terrorist tactics, it may have shaped the ideology even more \u2014 and that\u2019s an influence that will be harder to remove than the book itself.\n\nThe Turner Diaries was written by an avowed neo-Nazi\n\nThe Turner Diaries was first published in its entirety in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The real author was William Luther Pierce \u2014 a racist man the hate-watch group Southern Poverty Law Center dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important Nazi\u201d of the 20th century. It would be hard to overstate Pierce\u2019s galling contributions to the cause of US white supremacy \u2014 and that\u2019s without considering The Turner Diaries.\n\nBorn in Atlanta in 1933 and raised in Virginia and Alabama, Pierce reportedly claimed to be descended from a Civil War governor, and attended a military high school in Texas before going on to attain a doctorate in physics. According to an offensively obsequious 2001 biography of Pierce \u2014 in which author Robert Griffin extensively quotes Pierce spouting unchallenged white supremacist propaganda \u2014 Pierce was raised for part of his childhood by a relative who had a Black person who\u2019d been convicted of a crime working for him who \u201cin effect was his slave.\u201d Racism was a consistent part of Pierce\u2019s upbringing and his political pursuits, and he eventually left a career as a rocket scientist in 1966 to invest more deeply in American Naziism.\n\nHe first joined the American Nazi Party, then gradually latched onto a different group created in support of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace and his 1968 presidential election campaign. Pierce evolved that organization into what ultimately became, in 1974, a group called the National Alliance. The group grew rapidly and gained influence at home and abroad, as Pierce preached dire warnings about how a rise in diversity and the societal changes of the civil rights movement would bring about \u201cthe end of white America.\u201d\n\nThrough the National Alliance, Pierce ran his own underground media empire, including a newspaper, a book press, a radio station, and an extremist record distributor \u2014 all to broadcast his message of violent white nationalism. His efforts worked. In a report published in 1998, the Anti-Defamation League noted, \u201cWith 16 active cells from coast to coast, an estimated membership of 1,000 and several thousand additional Americans listening to its radio broadcasts and browsing its Internet site, the National Alliance is the largest and most active neo-Nazi organization in the nation.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s goals, the ADL reported, were to establish \u201ca racially clean area of the earth\u201d and to \u201cdo whatever is necessary to achieve this White living space and to keep it White.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s biography reveals Pierce to be a man isolated by his own heinous ideas. Late in his life, he was estranged from both of his sons and was living in rural West Virginia with a lonely young wife with whom it seemed he could barely communicate. She was the latest in a string of Eastern European wives, all of whom he\u2019d chosen based on his belief that Eastern European women were more subservient to men than American women. At the time of his death in 2001, he was reportedly living alone.\n\nBut Pierce\u2019s impact on the national political landscape was far more lasting than his personal relationships.\n\nThe Turner Diaries became exactly what it was intended to be \u2014 a manual for violence\n\nThe Turner Diaries began as a fictional adventure series that Pierce published in the National Alliance newspaper, Attack, starting in 1975. A dystopian novel set in a future version of America, it follows the journal entries of a man named Earl Turner as he turns to increasing violence in his resistance to the US government as part of a group called the Organization.\n\nIn Pierce\u2019s scenario, Turner is fighting an orgiastic ultraconservative fantasy of an unchecked liberal future: The government confiscates all guns from private citizens and pursues resistors using a force called \u201cthe Equality Police.\u201d The media and Hollywood operate as untrustworthy left-wing propaganda, while racial and ethnic minorities gain power and enact anti-white laws. The back cover of the book asks readers, \u201cWhat will you do when they come to take your guns?\u201d\n\nThe book contains lurid, graphic violence carried out against liberals, government officials, members of the media, and Black and Jewish citizens. It gleefully urges white militias to rise up and engage in guerrilla warfare against the oppressive government \u2014 think the \u201980s action movie Red Dawn, in which Russia invades the US and small-town civilians fight back with renegade tactics, but with more racism and bloodlust. Among other things, the book features car bombings, suicide missions, and one scene in which white supremacist terrorists hang politicians en masse \u2014 a scene that some experts felt had echoes in the Capitol insurrection, during which a gallows was erected amid calls to hang certain elected officials.\n\nThe book chillingly culminates in Turner planning to fly a plane into the Pentagon in a suicide bombing mission \u2014 an act the narrative tells us ushered in a \u201cNew Era\u201d of white supremacist rule and made Turner a national folk hero to the subsequent Aryan civilization.\n\nBy all accounts, Pierce intended the book to be influential, more than just a work of fiction, and it was. In many chapters of the National Alliance, the book was required reading and was essentially presented to new members as an instruction manual. Pierce also intended it to glorify violence against nonwhites and progressives. The ADL report quoted a 1997 radio broadcast in which Pierce said:\n\nIn 1975, when I began writing The Turner Diaries ... I wanted to take all of the feminist agitators and propagandists and all of the race-mixing fanatics and all of the media bosses and all of the bureaucrats and politicians who were collaborating with them, and I wanted to put them up against a wall, in batches of a thousand or so at a time, and machine-gun them. And I still want to do that.\n\nAfter its serial publication, Pierce published The Turner Diaries in novel form in 1978 through his own independent press, after which it circulated underground for over a decade, known mainly only to white nationalists, extremists, and the people who kept a close watch on them. By the late 1980s, an advertisement for the book had appeared in the extremist survivalist magazine Soldier of Fortune, making it available via mail order. That\u2019s how it ended up in the hands of an Army recruit named Timothy McVeigh.\n\nLater, at McVeigh\u2019s trial for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing \u2014 the worst terrorist attack on US soil prior to 9/11 \u2014 McVeigh\u2019s fellow soldiers would testify that he was obsessed with the book and pored over it constantly. He sold copies of the book at gun shows, and mailed others to friends and family urging them to read it.\n\nOne of them did read it, and later recognized McVeigh\u2019s attack on the Oklahoma City federal building as drawing straight from The Turner Diaries\u2019 terrorist template. When authorities arrested McVeigh, they found excerpts from the book in his car.\n\nMcVeigh\u2019s terrorism is the most famous, but it\u2019s far from the only Turner Diaries-influenced act of extremism or racist violence. These range from lone individual hate crimes to at least one mass assault to numerous crime rings.\n\nOne group of domestic terrorists operating in the \u201980s called itself \u201cthe Order\u201d after one of the fictional militias in the book, which they referred to as a bible. Their ringleaders were former members of Pierce\u2019s National Alliance, and they allegedly hoped their acts of violence might help usher in the dystopian uprising fictionalized in The Turner Diaries.\n\nIn 1998, another group of National Alliance members planned to detonate 14 bombs across the city of Orlando, including one at the entrance to Walt Disney World; they failed when one of the would-be bombers accidentally set off one of the bombs as he was building it. The Southern Poverty Law Center cites at least 14 terrorist acts linked to the National Alliance between 1983 and 2005.\n\nMuch of this activity, crucially, took place before the internet, which of course made it possible for The Turner Diaries to spread and gain more influence \u2014 even beyond the scope of terrorist acts it influenced.\n\nThe novel\u2019s biggest impact on far-right politics may have been philosophical\n\nExtremist expert J.M. Berger has argued that even beyond its practical instruction in violent tactics, The Turner Diaries was directly responsible for a profound shift in extremist right-wing ideas \u2014 particularly regarding the way Pierce\u2019s National Alliance, and later the neo-Nazi movement more generally, recruited new members. Through his organization and then through the book, Pierce broadened neo-Nazi messaging by emphasizing emotional rhetoric rather than drilling down into specific, potentially alienating philosophical debates.\n\nBerger wrote in the Atlantic in 2016 that through Pierce\u2019s influence, \u201cprominent white nationalists began to take a more carefully generic approach, playing on racial fear and resentment as they existed, rather than attempting to manufacture doctrinaire justifications.\u201d\n\nIn many respects, Berger argued, The Turner Diaries presaged the amorphous, slippery character of the modern alt-right, with its various loosely allied groups all united under one general commitment to the theme of white nationalism. \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdemonstrated how to successfully leverage racial fears and resentments in the service of violence, without a call to a specific ideology.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but The Turner Diaries\u2019 rhetorical emphasis, the constant drumbeat of its themes \u2014 they\u2019re coming to take your guns; they\u2019re coming for you; the media can\u2019t be trusted; violent reaction is all but inevitable \u2014 seems not only to form the backbone of far-right propaganda but to contain significant parallels to today\u2019s mainstream conservative ideology. As a text, it offers the kind of heady heroic narrative that appeals to would-be rebels, patriots, and martyrs for a cause. It teaches its adherents not just to adopt the mentality that they are at war with progressives, but that a real-life war is inevitable. As the New York Times observed after the Capitol insurrection, a Telegram user watching the melee wrote, \u201cThe turner diaries mentioned this. Keep reading.\u201d\n\nStill, Berger told Vox that while prohibiting access to The Turner Diaries is an important part of dismantling white supremacy, it\u2019s not as crucial as many in the media have made it seem. \u201cThe Turner Diaries is a landmark text in white nationalism, and it\u2019s worth talking about,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut I think its relevance to the Capitol Siege has been overplayed somewhat.\u201d\n\nBerger pointed out that while the book\u2019s removal from Amazon is a step forward, it\u2019s not the only such work out there that white supremacists have drawn inspiration from.\n\n\u201cThe book is already notorious and widely available online for free, so while it\u2019s probably a net positive that it\u2019s been removed from Amazon, it\u2019s not exactly a game-changer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the significance has more to do with Amazon waking up to the problem of extremist content on its platform, which can be seen in some of its other recent moves as well,\u201d he added. He noted that in recent weeks, Amazon has removed products promoting the QAnon conspiracy and banned white nationalist groups from its charity program, after previously removing merchandise related to other white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations. \u201cSeveral of these removals are more pragmatically important because they deny revenue streams to current extremist leaders and groups,\u201d Berger explained.\n\nIn other words, it takes dismantling a white supremacist village to fully attack the ugliness that leads to real-world violence. Removing The Turner Diaries and these other elements from Amazon, along with deplatforming extremists from other parts of the mainstream internet, won\u2019t totally remove their ability to access harmful material that helps fuel their hate. Still, these actions may crucially make such material harder for potential recruits to find.

Nur die anklagenden Schilder fehlten. Jene rechtsextremen User, die in den Tagen vor dem 6. Januar auf verschiedenen Plattformen dazu aufforderten, \"einen Strick mitzubringen\", bezogen sich aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach auf \"The Day of the Rope\", ein in solchen Kreisen weithin bekannter \"Ehrentag\", auch wenn bislang nur in der Phantasie vorweggenommen. \"The Turner Diaries\" sind vom FBI als \"Bibel der rassistischen Rechten\" eingestuft worden, was deren Autor so sehr schmeichelte, dass er diese Verurteilung gleich als Werbespruch auf dem Umschlag des n\u00e4chsten Nachdrucks verwendete.\n\n\n\nGeschrieben wurde die neonazistische Kolportage von einem gewissen William Luther Pierce, geboren 1933 in Atlanta, Georgia, einem promovierten Physiker, der seine Karriere an den Nagel h\u00e4ngte, um \"sich g\u00e4nzlich dem Dienst an meinem Volk zu widmen\", und zwar als f\u00fchrendes Mitglied der National Alliance (sp\u00e4ter National Vanguard). Den gr\u00f6\u00dften Erfolg hatte er mit der Publikation seines ersten Romans, der 1976 unter dem Pseudonym Andrew MacDonald erschien.\n\n\n\nEs w\u00e4re nicht das erste Mal gewesen, dass \"The Turner Diaries\" als Blaupause f\u00fcr ein Gewaltverbrechen gedient h\u00e4tten. Timothy McVeigh, der 1995 in Oklahoma City ein Verwaltungsgeb\u00e4ude in die Luft sprengte und 168 Menschen t\u00f6tete, war besessen von diesem Buch, das er jahrelang auf Waffenmessen zum halben Preis verscherbelte. In seinem Wagen wurden nach seiner Verhaftung ein Gewehr, ein Messer und einige Seiten aus \"The Turner Diaries\" gefunden. Im Prozess berichtete McVeighs Schwester von seiner Obsession. Er habe sie gezwungen, das Buch zu lesen. Kurz vor dem Anschlag habe er sieben ausgew\u00e4hlte Seiten daraus an sie geschickt.\n\n\n\nVielleicht befand sich darunter auch jene Szene, in der die Hauptfigur Earl Turner die Zentrale des FBI an der Pennsylvania Avenue mit Ammoniumnitrat und Dynamit (genau dem Sprengstoff von McVeigh) in die Luft jagt und Hunderte von Menschen umbringt. Leichte Gewissensbisse stellen sich im Buch ein, werden jedoch schnell beiseitegeschoben: \"Es gibt keine M\u00f6glichkeit, das System zu zerst\u00f6ren, ohne Tausende unschuldiger Menschen zu opfern. ... wenn wir dieses Krebsgeschw\u00fcr nicht aus unserem lebenden Fleisch herausschneiden, wird unsere ganze Rasse sterben\".\n\n\n\nDie Aufzeichnungen enden mit einem Selbstmordanschlag von Turner, der mit einem Kleinflugzeug samt \"60-Kilotonnen-Sprengkopf\" das Pentagon ausl\u00f6scht. Nicht ganz unwesentlich ist der Kalendertag, an dem dieser Anschlag ausgef\u00fchrt wird: der 9. November, \"unser traditioneller M\u00e4rtyrertag\". Wer die Sprengkraft der j\u00fcngsten Ereignisse in den Vereinigten Staaten untersch\u00e4tzt, wird durch dieses Datum auf historischem Umweg vielleicht zum \u00dcberdenken angeregt. Am 9. November 1923 versuchte Adolf Hitler unter Duldung und zum Teil t\u00e4tiger Mithilfe der bayerischen Regierung sowie Verwaltung, die Macht mittels eines Putsches zu \u00fcbernehmen, zuerst in M\u00fcnchen und danach dem Plan zufolge im ganzen Deutschen Reich. Der Putsch misslang bekanntlich, die Macht\u00fcbernahme wurde verschoben, um keine zehn Jahre.\n\n\n\nDer 9. November erweist sich in \"The Turner Diaries\" als enorm symboltr\u00e4chtiger Tag. Am 9. November 1989 wird Turner wegen unerlaubten Waffenbesitzes verhaftet; am 9. November 1991 gibt es eine Sondersitzung des Kongresses, um Gesetze im Kampf gegen Rassismus und Terrorismus einzuf\u00fchren. \"Das Kapitol war von etwa 3000 bis 5000 Geheimpolizisten und schwerbewaffneten Soldaten umstellt. Jeeps mit montierten Maschinengewehren waren \u00fcberall . . . Keine Bande von Guerrilleros, die auf Sabotage oder Attentate aus war, h\u00e4tte es bis auf zwei H\u00e4userblocks heran geschafft ...

Most of the victims were Black.\n\nIdeas from the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d filled a racist document supposedly posted online by the white 18-year-old accused of targeting Black people in Saturday\u2019s rampage. Authorities were still working to confirm its authenticity.\n\nCertainly, there was no mistaking the racist intent of the shooter.\n\nWhat is the \u2018great replacement theory?\u2019\n\nSimply put, the conspiracy theory says there\u2019s a plot to diminish the influence of white people.\n\nBelievers say this goal is being achieved both through the immigration of nonwhite people into societies that have largely been dominated by white people, as well as through simple demographics, with white people having lower birth rates than other populations.\n\nThe conspiracy theory\u2019s more racist adherents believe Jews are behind the so-called replacement plan: White nationalists marching at a Charlottesville, Virginia, rally that turned deadly in 2017 chanted \u201cYou will not replace us!\u201d and \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d\n\nA more mainstream view in the U.S. baselessly suggests Democrats are encouraging immigration from Latin America so more like-minded potential voters replace \u201ctraditional\u201d Americans, says Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism.\n\nWhat is this conspiracy theory\u2019s origins?\n\nHow long has racism existed? Broadly speaking, the roots of this \u201ctheory\u201d are that deep. In the U.S., you can point to efforts to intimidate and discourage Black people from voting \u2014 or, in antagonists\u2019 view, \u201creplacing\u201d white voters at the polls \u2014 that date to the Reconstruction era, after the 15th Amendment made clear suffrage couldn\u2019t be restricted on account of race.\n\nIn the modern era, most experts point to two influential books. \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d a 1978 novel written by William Luther Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, is about a violent revolution in the United States with a race war that leads to the extermination of nonwhites.\n\nREAD MORE: How the U.S. Capitol attack highlights the challenges of thwarting online right-wing extremism\n\nThe FBI called it a \u201cbible of the racist right,\u201d says Kurt Braddock, an American University professor and researcher at the Polarization and Extremism Research & Innovation Lab.\n\nRenaud Camus, a French writer, published a 2011 book claiming that Europe was being invaded by Black and brown immigrants from Africa. He called the book \u201cLe Grand Remplacement,\u201d and a conspiracy\u2019s name was born.\n\nWho are its adherents?\n\nTo some of the more extreme believers, certain white supremacist mass killers \u2014 at a Norway summer camp in 2011, two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques in 2019, a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 \u2014 are considered saints, Pitcavage says.\n\nThose \u201caccelerationist white supremacists\u201d believe small societal changes won\u2019t achieve much, so the only option is tearing down society, he says.\n\nThe Buffalo shooter\u2019s purported written diatribe and some of the methods indicate he closely studied the Christchurch shooter \u2014 particularly the effort to livestream his rampage. According to apparent screenshots from the Buffalo broadcast, the shooter inscribed the number 14 on his gun, which Pitcavage says is shorthand for a 14-word white supremacist slogan.\n\nA written declaration by the Christchurch shooter was widely spread online. If the message attributed to the Buffalo shooter proves authentic, it\u2019s designed to also spread his philosophy and methods to a large audience.\n\nIs the theory making wider inroads?\n\nWhile more virulent forms of racism are widely abhorred, experts are concerned about extreme views nonetheless becoming mainstream.\n\nIn a poll released last week, The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 1 in 3 Americans believe an effort is underway to replace U.S.-born Americans with immigrants for electoral gain.\n\nOn a regular basis, many adherents to the more extreme versions of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory converse through encrypted apps online. They tend to be careful. They know they\u2019re being watched.\n\n\u201cThey are very clever,\u201d Braddock says. \u201cThey don\u2019t make overt calls to arms.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s talking up this theory?\n\nIn particular, Tucker Carlson, Fox News\u2019 most popular personality, has pushed false views that are more easily embraced by some white people who are concerned about a loss of their political and social power.\n\n\u201cI know that the left and all the gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term \u2018replacement,\u2019 if you suggest the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World,\u201d he said on his show last year. \u201cBut they become hysterical because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, actually, let\u2019s just say it. That\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nA study of five years\u2019 worth of Carlson\u2019s show by The New York Times found 400 instances where he talked about Democratic politicians and others seeking to force demographic change through immigration.\n\nFox News defended the host, pointing to repeated statements that Carlson has made denouncing political violence of all kinds.\n\nWATCH: Tucker Carlson\u2019s influence and his increasingly extreme views\n\nThe attention paid by many Republican politicians to what they see as a leaky southern border along the United States has been interpreted, at least by some, as a nod to the concern of white people who worry about being \u201creplaced.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik\u2019s campaign committee was criticized last year for an advertisement that said \u201cradical Democrats\u201d were planning a \u201cpermanent election insurrection\u201d by granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants who would create a permanent liberal majority in Washington. Stefanik represents a New York district.\n\nPitcavage says he\u2019s concerned about the message Carlson and supporters are sending: \u201cIt actually introduces the \u2018great replacement theory\u2019 to a conservative audience in an easier-to-swallow pill.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/turner-diaries-other-racist-novels-inspire-extremist-violence", "page_content": "Few works of fiction have moved readers to action quite like The Turner Diaries. Written under a pseudonym by William Pierce, late founder of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, the bloody race-war novel has been dubbed the \"bible of the racist right\" by the FBI.\n\nPublished in 1978, The Turner Diaries has fueled some of the last two decades' most infamous outbreaks of extremist violence, including Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Although The Turner Diaries may be the most famous such novel, it is neither the first nor the last novelized version of dire conspiracies and drastic solutions.\n\nPierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white-supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens.\n\nUsing \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city.\n\nDespite Pierce's stilted prose \u2014 a holdover, maybe, from his career as a physics professor \u2014 the violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children.\n\nBy the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPublished by Pierce's own National Vanguard Press, The Turner Diaries didn't exactly rocket up the best-seller lists when it first appeared. But Pierce certainly got through to Bob Mathews.\n\nA neo-Nazi follower, Mathews organized a real-life group called The Order, based on Pierce's fictional Order, which committed a series of armored car heists and plotted serious racist violence before ambushing and murdering Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg in 1984.\n\nThe Turner Diaries reached its pinnacle of popularity in 1995, after it was widely reported that pages of the novel were found in a plastic baggie in McVeigh's car shortly after the bombing that killed 168 people in Oklahoma City. McVeigh, who sold copies of his favorite novel at gun shows across the country, later said that while he didn't subscribe to the book's racism, he was inspired by its \"pro-gun rights\" message.\n\nAfter McVeigh brought widespread attention to The Turner Diaries, the pace of violence it inspired picked up. In subsequent years, a variety of Earl Turner wannabes have been arrested \u2014 for stockpiling biological weapons, engaging in a racist shooting spree, robbing banks, and assembling pipe bombs with Jewish and black targets in mind.\n\nIn 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\"\n\nPierce, who died in 2002, seemed incredulous \u2014 though pleased \u2014 that his hastily written novel had attracted so much attention. Pierce began the book as a series of installments for Attack!, a racist tabloid published by his National Youth Alliance.\n\nAfter years of writing nonfiction, both about physics and about neo-Nazism, he wanted to explore the propagandistic possibilities offered by fiction. Pierce later told biographer Robert S. Griffin why he believed novels could be so effective: \"If the protagonist learns something or comes to believe in something, if he changes his ideas, the reader tends to do the same thing, he changes too. So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\nViolence and Virtue\n\nIn the past 15 years, dozens of racist and extremist novels have been published by writers hoping to use the tool of fiction as persuasively \u2014 if, perhaps, to a less explicitly violent end \u2014 as Pierce. The novels span every category of extremism \u2014 neo-Nazi, neo-Confederate, radical environmentalist, anti-immigration, antigovernment \u2014 but most stick to Pierce's formula: a white male hero, learning of a massive conspiracy against law-abiding whites, undertakes violent revenge.\n\nThe excessive violence draws readers in, says Griffin, a professor at the University of Vermont. But the ultimate message, he told the Intelligence Report, is \"that European people, white people, have a right to stand up for themselves, have a right to self-determination, to pride, to collective action.\"\n\nThough most are simple, formulaic and no more colorfully written than The Turner Diaries, these novels are finding readers (see sidebar, above). Their authors aren't in a big hurry to sell a million copies, though. They know that Pierce's novel marinated on bookshelves for 17 years before the Oklahoma City bombings made it famous.\n\n\"There are some books that become more popular as the years go by,\" says Gerald James McManus, author of a racist fable called Dark Millennium. \"Moby Dick was not a great success when it was first written, and today it's a classic, so you never know.\"\n\nAmerica's first important extremist novel also took a while to catch on. Published in 1905, Thomas Dixon's The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan made its impact 10 years later when D.W. Griffith adapted it into the landmark film, \"Birth of a Nation.\" Once the movie became a hit, Dixon's maudlin ode to white supremacy helped fuel a massive resurgence of the KKK, which had nearly died out after Reconstruction.\n\nDixon's novel even gave Klansmen a new technique: cross-burnings, which had not been part of the first Klan movement.\n\nThe Clansman depicts a South under barbaric \"black rule\" during Reconstruction. The plot is touched off by an \"apelike\" black man, his \"yellow teeth grinning through thick lips,\" raping the daughter of a white politician.\n\nShamed, the daughter and her mother are both driven to suicide \u2014 which is later avenged by the \"chivalric\" Klan, hooded and robed men Dixon describes as \"noble in sentiment, generous in manhood, and patriotic in purpose.\"\n\nNoble sentiments were hardly the key to The Clansman's success, says Notre Dame professor Rory McVeigh. \"The novel and the film played on fears and prejudices held by many white Americans of the time,\" says McVeigh. \"In particular, they appealed to stereotypes that portrayed black men as lust-crazed beasts who posed a danger to the safety and virtue of white women.\"\n\nProhibited Notions\n\nMore than half a century later, French novelist Jean Raspail tapped into a similar set of stereotypes and fears with his anti-immigration novel, The Camp of the Saints. Written in the early 1970s during a wave of Algerian immigration into France, The Camp of the Saints also took a while to catch on in the U.S. But when it did, two decades later, it had a major influence on the American anti-immigration movement.\n\nFar more fluidly written than most extremist novels, The Camp of the Saints is infused with apocalyptic foreboding. The plot concerns a famine-induced pilgrimage to the shores of the French Riviera by Hindu refugees described as \"kinky-haired, swarthy-skinned, long-despised phantoms.\"\n\nAs the flotilla makes its way around Africa to France, Raspail writes about the ineffectual reactions of government officials, church leaders, liberals and soldiers \u2014 the cultured and civilized who belong to the \"camp of the saints.\" He rails against the \"monstrous cancer\" of multiculturalism and lingers over descriptions of the brown and black hordes with their \"fleshless, Gandhi arms\" \u2014 all heading ominously, disastrously, toward France.\n\nWhen The Social Contract Press, an anti-immigration hate group, reprinted The Camp of the Saints in 1995, the book caught fire with extremists. Reviewing the novel in the white-supremacist American Renaissance magazine, editor Jared Taylor proclaimed, \"this may be the first significant racialist novel since the days of Thomas Dixon.\"\n\nThe Camp of the Saints was \"astonishingly current,\" Taylor said, given the influx of Hispanic immigrants into the U.S. Its \"central tragedy\" was the \"suicidal white weakness\" demonstrated by Westerners reluctant to turn away the immigrants.\n\nTaylor and other anti-immigration activists also picked up on Raspail's notion that the Algerian immigration amounted to a \"peaceful invasion\" of France; many U.S. activists are convinced that a \"Mexican invasion\" of America is currently underway.\n\nThe anti-immigration activists at The Social Contract Press recognized how influential a book like Raspail's could be. \"The poet, the playwright, the novelist, the filmmaker can present truths and open our eyes in ways that demographic analyses, comparative income studies, or social welfare statistics never can,\" reads a publisher's note to the 1995 edition. \"The storytellers can advance notions prohibited to others.\"\n\nFeeding the Hogs\n\nThe main \"prohibited notion\" in recent extremist novels is the oppression, unseen but insidious, of white people.\n\nIn Ellen Williams' Bedford, a World Vision, a small Southern village \u2014 loosely based on Williams' own hometown of Leroy, Ala. \u2014 has been overtaken by liberals. The story revolves around 14-year-old Horace Adam Pruitt Jr., a Southern Baptist kid who's fallen under the influence of a left-wing teacher. Young Pruitt sues his parents for making him go to church \u2014 but that's only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBedford is in upheaval as public schools are \"dumbed down,\" abortion is legalized, secularists advocate euthanasia of the elderly to conserve resources, and speaking out against homosexuality is outlawed. To make matters even worse, the U.S. flag is banned in favor of a United World flag. States have been dissolved, and the country divided into regions.\n\n\"Most people have liked it,\" Williams told the Intelligence Report. \"People say the book is coming true.\" Williams (see Honoring the Confederacy) belongs to both the Council of Conservative Citizens and the League of the South, predominantly Southern hate groups that often work on \"heritage issues.\" At League of the South gatherings, she often provides entertainment, singing such tunes as \"Dixie\" and \"God Save the South.\"\n\nAnother neo-Confederate, author Lloyd Lenard, sings a similar tune about the oppression of Southern whites in The Last Confederate Flag (see C-4 and the Confederacy). Lenard's protagonist, Stonewall Bedford, is persecuted by militant blacks because of his loyalty to the rebel flag.\n\n\"The carpetbaggers aren't all white,\" Bedford tells his wife. \"Hundreds of them are black. They spring up right in our midst, spurred on daily by the goading of their own political leaders. Protected by the U.S. Justice Department, these militants push for the necessity of remolding Southerners into more pliant people.\"\n\nBut they won't remold Bedford. As angry blacks threaten to remove the Confederate battle flag from city hall \u2014 and open fire on Bedford's family \u2014 he tries valiantly to preserve the flag. Nothing can keep him from being true to his Southern heritage.\n\nIn John Ross' Unintended Consequences, a white Southern man faces another form of oppression \u2014 an \"obscure federal gun law written to promote massive noncompliance and give idled [gun] prohibition agents something to do.\" Ross paints Henry Bowman as a Fourth-Amendment underdog who ultimately has no choice but to fight back against the federal government.\n\n\"You fools have been using blank search warrants, planting evidence, and perjuring yourselves in court,\" Bowman tells federal agents after he's turned the tables and apprehended them during a failed raid. \"You've reinterpreted your own rulings and used entrapment to put people in prison over paperwork disputes.\"\n\nBowman, an expert gunman, makes sure that the agents he captures don't abuse citizens' rights any more: He dismembers them and feeds their bodies to hogs.\n\nBowman's violent revenge has drawn comparisons \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 to Earl Turner's adventures. A review from Publisher's Weekly notes that Ross's novel \"seethes with a grudge against a government that is portrayed as having persecuted praiseworthy citizens who merely want to exercise their civil rights. Like the notorious and paranoid Turner Diaries, this novel may speak to readers on the fringes of American society \u2014 but it misses the middle, both artistic and political, by a long shot.\"\n\nWhites in Outer Space\n\nOf course, the middle is not what these novelists are aiming for. Extremist novelists see radical problems that mainstream Americans don't \u2014 and they dream up equally radical solutions. In Gerald James McManus' Dark Millennium, the problem is \"multicultural democracy.\" The solution is unwavering racial violence.\n\nMcManus' novel follows racist tyrant Alexander McGrail as he rises \"with phenomenal quickness from relative obscurity to the top rung of American politics\" \u2014 and then usurps the U.S. presidency to become \"President of Earth for Life.\" McGrail directs a worldwide extermination of all people of color, except for a few particularly intelligent Asians.\n\nMcManus describes the victims being herded into pits and shot, massacred in the streets, and sterilized through tainted drinking water. Whites who fail an IQ test are sterilized, too. Pregnant black women are killed on sight.\n\n\"I think the ultimate message in the book is that the world is heading for terrible problems,\" McManus told the Intelligence Report. He's flattered when readers tell him that his book is \"like a sequel to The Turner Diaries,\" even if he's never actually read Pierce's work.\n\nLike Pierce, McManus is not about to apologize for the mass killings of people of color. His concern, he says, is ultimately the preservation of humanity.\n\n\"The only way for humanity to prosper and expand into outer space is through some type of worldwide benevolent government,\" says McManus. \"We have to quell the population and produce the homogenous society that's needed to survive.\"\n\nOuter space is often the ultimate destination for white characters who survive the violent plots of these books. In Hold Back This Day, Ward Kendall describes a racist dystopia \u2014 a super-globalized world of \"Unification\" where all major religions are distilled into one, Chrislamhindbuddhism, and where brown skin is preferred over white.\n\nThe story revolves around one of the Earth's remaining fair-skinned men, Jeff Huxton. After having a white son in his first marriage, Huxton joins the multicultural majority, taking an Asian woman as his second wife and fathering a biracial daughter. When his white son, Adam, has trouble fitting in at school, Huxton recalls his own days of being a misfit: \"Like Adam, he too had been the class 'freak,' having had the misfortune of being born to one of the last sets of parents who were 'unblended.' \"\n\nYoung Adam finds a white mentor, Karl Ramstrom, who teaches him about white history, back in the good old days before Unification. Adam falls in love with Ramstrom's daughter. The plot thickens when Huxton discovers Adam's plan to leave for Mars with his new white friends and join Avalon, the only white colony left in the universe. Huxton comes around to a new way of thinking, rejecting his multicultural beliefs and blended family in favor of Avalon.\n\nKendall says his novel has been embraced by \"white nationalists\" not because it ends with a utopian fantasy, but because it's based on reality. \"It shows our struggle from the viewpoint of a single man, facing a world determined to see our kind made extinct,\" says Kendall.\n\nAgainst the Odds\n\nThe idea of a lone hero doing battle with the world's evils is nothing new. But William Pierce was apparently on to something when he gave that old storyline a new, white-supremacist twist. Most extremist novels published since The Turner Diaries focus on a white protagonist who wakes up to what's wrong with the world, and then acts against the odds to make things right.\n\nThere's a good reason for that, says Harvard University lecturer Rebecca Wingfield. Social protest novels \u2014 whether it's Uncle Tom's Cabin or Hold Back This Day \u2014 work on readers by drawing them into the experiences of a protagonist they can relate to.\n\n\"As the character undergoes a shift in his or her political position,\" Wingfield says, \"we, as readers, undergo this shift with him or her. Since the appeal here is to our emotions and sympathies, and not just our intellects, fiction offers a much more subtle way of bringing us around to a particular point of view than abstract political argument.\"\n\nPat Shannan certainly hopes so. A writer for the antigovernment Media Bypass magazine, Shannan centers his novel, One In a Million, around the character of Brock Freeman, an easy-going, wholesome attorney from the Midwest. Freeman begins to question the federal tax system, revisiting laws like the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and determining that gold and silver are the only valid forms of tender.\n\n\"Lawful money is defined in 12 USC 152 as '... gold and silver coin of the United States,'\" Freeman explains to his wife, Sarah. \"So you see Honey, these were bona fide receipts good for redemption in the real wealth at any time.\"\n\nFreeman goes on to discover what antigovernment \"Patriots\" have been saying all along: filing taxes is downright un-American. In the shower one morning, he ruminates: \"The Fourth Amendment protection of people to be secure in their 'persons, homes, papers, and effects' is violated by any law that would require one to voluntarily declare all that information on a government form. ...\n\n\"Even if there is a law that requires people to file,\" Freeman decides, \"the law is inapplicable to anyone who doesn't volunteer to fall under it.\"\n\nAs Freeman shifts his thinking, Shannan hopes readers will shift theirs along with him \u2014 and feel his fury when the IRS cracks down on the tax-protesting hero, killing his wife in the process.\n\nShannan told the Intelligence Report that One In a Million is \"a historical novel because most of it's true.\" Not the part about the IRS killing his wife, but the amendments and laws and tax-protesting plot. \"Most of it actually happened to me because I've done battle with the IRS,\" he says.\n\nAfter years of writing nonfiction stories for Media Bypass and other outlets, Shannan says he turned to fiction because it works. \"The way to get people to listen to your message,\" he says, \"is to give them some blood and guts.\"\n\nA century after Thomas Dixon brought out The Clansman, Shannan hopes to take a page out of Dixon's book \u2014 by taking his \"blood and guts\" approach to the big screen. He's convinced that One In a Million could work as a movie. To that end, he's mailed a copy of the novel to Hutton Gibson, Mel's anti-Semitic father.\n\n\"I can see Mel Gibson playing Brock Freeman,\" Shannan says. No word yet on whether the star is interested."}]}
