He broke into pro ball with Hartfords of the National Association in 1874 under manager Lip Pike during the dead ball era. In that season Billy Barnie batted .184 in 184 at bats spanning 45 games. Defensively he played 23 games as a catcher, 21 in RF and 1 game at shortstop.\n\nThe next year, 1875, Billy Barnie played 10 games with the New York Mutuals and 10 games with the Keokuk Westerns, splitting his time equally defensively with 10 games in the outfield and 10 games as a catcher. After the National Association folded at season\u2019s end, he played locally.\n\nManaging during the Dead Ball Era:\n\nIn 1883 with the start of a new major league, the American Association, AA, Bald Billy Barnie started managing the Baltimore Orioles and managed the team until 1889. Then managed the following teams: Buffalo/Brooklyn AA 1890\u2026 Philadelphia Athletics AA 1891\u2026 Bal Orioles AA 1891\u2026 Washington Nationals of the National League 1892\u2026 Louisville NL 1893-94\u2026 Brooklyn 1897-98.

His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://ripbaseball.com/2018/12/06/grave-story-billy-barnie-1853-1900/", "page_content": "Here lies \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie, a catcher/outfielder who went on to manage until the day he died. Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/time-passages/orioles-break-the-sunday-baseball-taboo-in-brooklyn-maryland-5f9376c3e31d", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\u2019s Orioles Broke the Sabbath Taboo South of Baltimore\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles played their first-ever Sunday baseball game in Brooklyn, Maryland, June 15, 1890, on a pleasant summer afternoon that ended with a sloppy 11\u20138 Oriole victory and the arrest of the team\u2019s manager for breaking a state law that prevented people from working on the Sabbath.\n\nThe game was played at Brooklyn\u2019s Acton\u2019s Park at the foot of the famous Long Bridge between the present-day Reedbird Park and Masonville Cove in a difficult-to-imagine-today, but then-quaint Brooklyn, Maryland. The Baltimore Sun reported that 6,065 fans attended, a huge number for that era, and the reported number may actually have been larger since throngs of fence climbers made their way over the 12-foot barrier into the park before and during the game. Attendees had picnics on the grass while the game was played, kids frolicked in the nearby fields, and many of the fans may not have noticed when manager Billy Barnie was arrested after the final out.\n\nBilly Barnie, manager of the Baltimore Orioles from 1883 to 1891.\n\nThe New York-born Barnie began his career as a catcher and outfielder for the National Association in 1870s, but wasn\u2019t an everyday player. He started his career playing for the Hartford (Conn.) Dark Blues in 1874, and drifted around the northeast playing for the Keokuck (N.Y.) Westerns and the New York Mutuals through 1875. A journeyman by 24, he bounced around to Columbus, Buffalo and San Francisco trying to find playing time. By 1881 he was playing for the Brooklyn (N.Y.) Atlantics on the Eastern Championship Association, and in 1883 he re-emerged as a manager for the American Association Baltimore Orioles. He even took the field as a catcher in 19 games in 1883 and 1886. He found more success as a manager than a player, but in his eight years in Baltimore never finished above third place. Despite his lack of success he became a local celebrity and was well known in Baltimore.\n\nFans Wanted Sunday Baseball\n\nIn recounting the events of that day, the Sun said that after the umpire ended the game, \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie was approached by Anne Arundel County Sheriff James S. Armiger and Deputy James T. Small, who produced a warrant and who placed him under arrest. It was the first time Barnie was ever arrested, he told reporters. He was taken to Justice Thomas Green\u2019s office in Brooklyn and was booked and kept overnight. Justice Green set a $300 bail, and at 10 a.m. the next morning, Acton\u2019s Park owner Samuel G. Acton showed up and bailed the manager out. For his part in the affair, Barnie was fined $5.\n\nTechnically, Barnie was truly responsible for fielding the team that broke the law. He violated Section 247, Article 27 of the State\u2019s Code of Public General Laws by unlawfully playing, or causing to be played, baseball on the Sabbath Day. Yes, there was actually a law on the books prohibiting baseball on Sundays in Maryland. The Old Line State wasn\u2019t alone in that regard; many other states had similar laws. The Orioles charged admission and players were paid, thus making it illegal. Sheriff Armiger sounded almost apologetic in explaining that he was advised by State\u2019s Attorney James Munroe that he must enforce the law against any illegal act.\n\nSome in the press speculated that the Acton\u2019s Park game was meant to test the Sabbath laws, which were beginning to seem antiquated. On that same Sunday the Orioles played in Brooklyn, the Washington Nationals played Wilmington in D.C., but no one was arrested there.\n\nBut why play in Brooklyn? It might have been because the two years the Orioles spent at Oriole Park II were tumultuous, and its location in Waverly in north central Baltimore at Greenmount Avenue and East 29th Street was not well appreciated by fans. Alternatively, it might have been because as a test of the Sabbath laws, the team might have found a more sympathetic host in Anne Arundel County than in Baltimore County. Furthermore, the Long Bridge made Acton\u2019s Park a favorite location among many of Baltimore\u2019s elite. Orioles officials even told the Sun that they were considering making it their new home field. But the team turmoil continued, and Oriole Park III, also known as Union Park, was created in Baltimore at Guilford and 25th Streets.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sabbath laws were slowly being repealed throughout the country, especially in the post-World War I years. Returning servicemen and their families were looking for more types of Sunday recreation. Even with the Acton\u2019s Park \u201ctest\u201d in June 1890, Maryland didn\u2019t completely resolve the Sunday baseball issue until nearly 30 years later when Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals overturned Sabbath Blue Laws in 1919. Acton\u2019s Park barely lasted that long. Its longtime owner, Samuel G. Acton, died in 1903, and by 1919 Baltimore had annexed Brooklyn and was selling the property for industrial uses. By then the Orioles had moved on to a new Baltimore location, Oriole Park V, also known as Terrapins Park, at Greenmount and 29th Streets.\n\nA Seminal, Sloppy Sunday Game\n\nSo what happened on the field that day in 1890? The Orioles held off the Hartfords 11\u20138 in a sloppy game that the Sun called \u201cinteresting.\u201d Catcher George Townsend was the hero, going three-for-three and driving in three runs. Norm Baker was the Orioles winning pitcher. But the Orioles certainly won ugly. Combined, both Baker and Hartford pitcher, James Lyston (a Baltimore native), gave up only six earned runs. But Baker walked four and Lyston handed out seven free passes. The Orioles logged six errors on a dry field worn down by local teams; Hartford had three errors of their own. The Orioles ran rampant on Hartford catcher, Alfred Moore, stealing eight bases that day. The crowd was large and boisterous, but the Orioles didn\u2019t play great baseball. And then skipper Billy Barnie went to jail."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/billy.barnie/1752102", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\n\nbaseball player\n\nJanuary 26, 1853 (age 47) New York City\n\nBorn in New York City, he played as a right fielder in the National Association in 1874-1875.

The first vote for players to be admitted into the hall was held in 1936, the date sometimes given for the hall\u2019s establishment. Dedication ceremonies took place in June 1939.\n\nSelections to the Hall of Fame are made annually by two groups: the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America (BBWAA) and the Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans. For the period 1971\u201377 a special committee inducted nine players from the Negro leagues into the Hall of Fame.\n\nBritannica Quiz Great Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nPlayers are selected by members of the BBWAA who have been active for 10 years and by a few honorary members of the BBWAA. Approximately 450 writers participate each year. To be eligible for selection, the prospective player must have been active in the major leagues at some time during a period beginning 20 years before and ending 5 years prior to election. (When, however, Roberto Clemente was killed in an airplane crash in late 1972, the 5-year waiting period was waived so that he could be immediately inducted in 1973. Later in 1973 the election rules were changed to permit selection of a player six months after his death.) Further rules stipulate that a player must have played at least 10 years in the major leagues and is required to receive 75 percent of the votes to be elected. There is no set number of players elected each year. No write-in votes are permitted, and the ballot is formed of those players who received a vote on a minimum of 5 percent of the ballots cast in the preceding election or those who are eligible for the first time and are nominated by any two of the six members of the BBWAA Screening Committee.\n\nIn 1953 the Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans was established.

Brock surpassed Cobb\u2019s career total in 1977, 16 years after The Georgia Peach\u2019s death.\n\nBreaking Cobb\u2019s mark suddenly brought a 19th century player back into the news. His name was \u201cSliding Billy\u201d Hamilton, a 5-foot-6 outfielder who had been elected to the Hall of Fame in 1961.\n\nBut when Brock surpassed Cobb, suddenly there were students of the game who rose to say, \u201cWhoa, not so fast. There still remains Sliding Billy.\u201d\n\nIt was true. Hamilton was in the record books with his 937 steals, even if set apart as a pre-1900 figure. And the pre-1900 barely explained his total. From 1886 to 1897, stolen bases were awarded for any number of base running advances: Moving up on a throw to another base, moving up on an error \u2013 all this and more contributed to the total.\n\nStill, no one ran up a total like Hamilton did. He was the best at what he did; the best of his era. In his first two years with the Phillies, 1890 and \u201991, he had 102 and 111 steals, (in only 123 and 133 games, respectively), even as altered by modern research. His head-first slides were crowd pleasers, and he played center field for Philadelphia between two other Hall of Fame-bound outfielders in Big Sam Thompson (6-foot-2) and Ed Delahanty (6-foot-1).\n\nApart from his superlatives in stolen bases (his total has since been revised to 914), he had a .344 career batting average.\n\nRemarkably, he scored 198 runs in 132 games in 1894, and there was nothing odd in the rules about runs scored then. No one has ever come close to that \u2013 Babe Ruth\u2019s 177 in 1921 being the modern era mark.\n\nA native of Newark, N.J., Hamilton had been a high school sprinter who turned to pro baseball at age 22. He reached the majors with Kansas City Cowboys of the American Association (then a major league) in 1886 and went to Philadelphia when they folded two years later. He played 14 years in the major leagues, including six years with Boston, wrapping up his career in 1901.\n\nHamilton was a player/manager in the minors until 1910, stealing bases until he was 44. His last job in pro ball was as manager and part owner of Worcester in the Eastern League in 1916, the year after Cobb set his record of 96 thefts in one season.\n\nHamilton passed away on Dec. 15, 1940.\n\nOn Sept. 23, 1979, Brock stole the final base of his career. He made sure to get number 938 and surpass what was then considered Hamilton\u2019s lifetime total."}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/billy-martin-hall-of-fame-candidate-veterans-committee-yankees/1rnq3u9rxsyxw1hp0a66wiu6gt", "page_content": "It\u2019s been more than 26 years since Billy Martin died in a drunk driving accident.\n\nThe fiery New York Yankees manager fought and drank his way through life, so when the end came during a trip home from a bar on Christmas Day 1989, the only surprise was that a friend was behind the wheel of Martin\u2019s truck. \u201cFor some, 61 is young,\u201d Tom Boswell wrote a few days later for the Washington Post. \u201cFor Martin it was very old.\u201d\n\nEven in an abbreviated life, though, Martin might rank as one of the best managers in baseball history. While he couldn\u2019t keep a job very long and had a knack for getting fired and re-hired by George Steinbrenner, Martin excelled wherever he went. He had at least 90 victories six times, winning records with five clubs, and just three losing seasons in 19 as a manager.\n\nHis .553 career winning percentage is fourth-highest of any manager with at least 10 seasons who isn\u2019t in the Baseball Hall of Fame, behind Davey Johnson, Steve O\u2019Neill and Joe Girardi, according to Baseball-Reference.com.\n\nThe Hall of Fame certainly hasn\u2019t forgotten Martin. The Veterans Committee considered Martin four times between 2003 and 2010, before reforming into three committees that meet on a rotating basis. Martin has been on the ballot for the Expansion Era Committee both times it\u2019s met so far, ahead of the 2011 and 2014 inductions. (Here's a list I compiled of more than 1,300 known candidates since 1953.)\n\nMORE: The 25 best players not in the Baseball Hall of Fame\n\nMartin might have the credentials for Cooperstown as a manager and could figure as a candidate when the Expansion Era Committee meets again this fall. But his window for the Hall of Fame might be closing as a crop of more recent, less controversial, and arguably better managers are becoming eligible.\n\nCooperstown chances: 40 percent\n\nWhy: The first thing to know about the Hall of Fame with managers is that it sometimes takes awhile for skippers to get in. The Veterans Committee considered Leo Durocher, another controversial manager, at least 10 times before finally enshrining him in 1994.\n\nDurocher had 2,008 wins, tenth best in baseball history, as well as a reputation for helping develop a young Willie Mays. It might have helped compensate for more unsavory aspects of his case, such as his suspension for the 1947 season for associating with gamblers or his affair with actress Laraine Day.\n\nMartin has a long list of things holding his candidacy back and not as much to compensate beyond winning a lot. There\u2019s his infamous fight with a marshmallow salesman in 1979 and all those firings, so many that Steinbrenner and Martin eventually made a commercial poking fun at it. And who could forget Martin\u2019s pedantic insistence on obscure rules being enforced, such as the length of pine tar on George Brett\u2019s bat in 1983?\n\nOther managers with more amenable personalities than Durocher or Martin have been long-term Hall of Fame candidates as well. Walter Alston was a Veterans Committee candidate five times, Dick Williams at least seven.\n\nWhen the committee inducted Ned Hanlon in 1996, it might have seemed like a shot out of nowhere, given that Hanlon managed the old Baltimore Orioles of the 1890s. In fact, Hanlon got nominated for Veterans Committee consideration at least 12 times going as far back as 1953.\n\nThe Hall of Fame simply doesn\u2019t induct that many managers, with only 23 enshrined currently. For a manager to get in Cooperstown without too much struggle, he\u2019d better inarguably be one of the best managers of his generation.\n\nSuch was the case in December 2013, when the Expansion Era Committee last met and unanimously inducted Tony La Russa, Bobby Cox and Joe Torre, who rank as the third, fourth, and fifth winningest managers in baseball history, respectively.\n\nMartin, whose 1,253 wins are 38th best, was also on the ballot and might have looked far outclassed. The secretive committee would only say that Martin received fewer than seven votes out of a possible 16.\n\nThis fall, no manager of La Russa, Cox, or Torre\u2019s caliber will be eligible with the Expansion Era Committee, though it will be interesting to see what happens with Jim Leyland, who\u2019s eligible for the first time.\n\nThe 15th-winningest manager in baseball history, Leyland made three straight National League Championship Series appearances with the Pittsburgh Pirates, won the 1997 World Series with the Florida Marlins, and went to it twice with the Detroit Tigers.\n\nBut he also logged a 54-108 season when he stuck around to manage the Marlins after their fire sale following that World Series, and he had several losing years with the Pirates, totaling a .506 career winning percentage overall. Leyland might need a few tries with the Expansion Era Committee.\n\nThe same can be said for Lou Piniella, who didn\u2019t even make the committee ballot when it last met, thanks perhaps to Cox, La Russa, and Torre.\n\n\u201dPiniella may not feel like a Hall of Famer to some people, the same ones who argue that Tim Raines or Alan Trammell or John Smoltz don't feel like immortals,\u201d Joe Sheehan wrote in 2010. \u201cPiniella, like those players, suffers in part by having contemporaries who were among the very best who ever lived.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Davey Johnson, who\u2019s been a Veterans Committee candidate before but not an Expansion Era Committee one because of the unusual timeline of his career. Voting rules hold that a manager either needs to be retired for five years or, if he\u2019s 65 or older, retired at least six months, a rule that dates to Casey Stengel in the 1960s.\n\nThe Veterans Committee considered Johnson in 2008 and 2010, giving him fewer than three votes out of 16 each time. Johnson resumed managing in the majors in 2011 after an 11-year break and, like Leyland, retired too soon before the Expansion Era Committee met in December 2013 to be eligible for it.\n\nJohnson maybe doesn\u2019t feel like a Hall of Fame manager either, though he\u2019s got the highest winning percentage of any manager with at least 10 seasons who isn\u2019t in Cooperstown, at .562. That\u2019s equivalent to going 91-71 every season.\n\nBottom line, Martin looks to have some competition on the Expansion Era Committee ballot this fall. And it will only get more competitive in elections to come as managers like Bruce Bochy, Dusty Baker, and Terry Francona become eligible.\n\nCooperstown Chances examines the Baseball Hall of Fame case of one candidate each week.

Buck O'Neil played in the Negro Leagues and later became one of its greatest ambassadors. He's now been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame class of 2022. Here's reporter Greg Echlin in Kansas City.\n\nGREG ECHLIN, BYLINE: Before John Jordan \"Buck\" O'Neil died in 2006 at the age of 94, he had spent almost 70 years of his life connected with professional baseball. For his last 16 years, he was chairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum that he co-founded in Kansas City. But in 2006, when 17 players and owners from the Negro Leagues era were elected, O'Neil wasn't among them. Raymond Doswell was on the committee making the decision. As curator of the Negro Leagues Museum, he pushed for O'Neil.\n\nRAYMOND DOSWELL: Well, for me, it was his complete body of work - player, manager and ambassador.\n\nECHLIN: Buck O'Neil grew up in Florida watching Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees during spring training. His Negro Leagues career began in 1937 as a first baseman. He was observant while playing the game and developed an eye for talent at the same time. In his later years with the Kansas City Monarchs, he was a player and manager. In 2003, before the late Ernie Banks started his hall-of-fame career with the Chicago Cubs, he told me about a shy kid from Dallas whose career took off with the Monarchs - under O'Neil.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nERNIE BANKS: He'd bring me out to the field early and hit ground balls and batting practice. And I only weighed 140-some pounds. And I just thought it was just wonderful to see and be around a man who had that much interest and confidence in me and felt that I could play baseball.\n\nECHLIN: In his own heyday as a player, O'Neil was a three-time Negro Leagues all-star first baseman, but he conceded that wasn't enough to sway voters toward electing him to the hall of fame in 2006.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBUCK O'NEIL: I believe the ones that voted against, didn't put that vote for me, was the people - strict baseball people, strictly baseball. What did you do on the baseball field?\n\nECHLIN: O'Neil spoke that day from the museum that salutes those who played segregated baseball before Jackie Robinson broke the Major League's color line in 1947. Robinson and a handful of others had already entered baseball's hall, but O'Neil became the voice of the largely forgotten other great Negro League players.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nO'NEIL: If I hadn't got in and they didn't put but two guys in, now I'd have been sad. You know what I mean? But to put this many guys in, man - make me feel good.\n\nECHLIN: After his days with the Monarchs, O'Neil became a scout for the Chicago Cubs before being named by them in 1962 as the first Black coach in the Major Leagues. As a scout, he mentored players like hall-of-famers Lou Brock and Billy Williams. One of Buck O'Neil's last public appearances was among those hall of famers, as speaker in 2006 on behalf of the 17 Negro Leaguers elected into Cooperstown. He died three months later. But next summer, O'Neil will reach true baseball immortality when he's officially inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Greg Echlin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF WIL BLADES' \"RED LANTERNS ARE BLUE\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

He had one of the best arms in baseball, the kind of arm that tempted scouts at times to make him a pitcher. He had hands that seemed to almost make a catcher\u2019s mitt superfluous. He swung a 42-ounce bat that made most everyone else\u2019s bats look like a toothpick, thanks to massive wrists and forearms.\n\nThere was his nose, a massive protuberance that earned him the almost inevitable nickname of \u201cSchnozz,\u201d and there was his lack of speed.\n\nBut more than anything, Lombardi was one of the biggest \u2013 and best \u2013 hitters the game has seen.\n\nLombardi topped .300 on 10 different occasions. He won a pair of batting titles (in 1938 and 1942), becoming first catcher to win multiple batting crowns. Lombardi was named the National League MVP in 1938 and was a key member of the Reds\u2019 1939 National League champs and 1940 World Series champs.\n\nNothing about Lombardi was conventional, including his batting grip: He held the baseball bat like a golf club, interlocking his hands. There was no reason to ever change to a more conventional grip, because Lombardi was able to rip line drives like few before or since.\n\nHe had to hit scorching line drive \u2013 because that was about the only way he could get a hit. Lombardi hit .306 for his career even though teams could play him deeper than anyone else in the game. Infielders knew Lombardi\u2019s lack of speed would give them time to get the ball to first from deep in the hole or even from the shallow part of the outfield. Infielders kept moving farther back against Lombardi, buying time to try to handle his line drives.\n\nBehind the plate, Lombardi led the NL in putouts, double plays and caught stealing percentage one season apiece \u2013 and he was the catcher for Johnny Vander Meer\u2019s back-to-back no-hitters.\n\nLombardi passed away on Sept. 26, 1977. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1986."}, {"url": "https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2021/1/26/22251675/baseball-hall-of-fame-vote-curt-schilling-barry-bonds-roger-clemens", "page_content": "For the first time since 2013, no player reached the 75 percent vote threshold required for entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Curt Schilling led all players with 71.1 percent of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America (BBWAA) vote, while Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens were behind him at 61.8 and 61.6 percent, respectively. All three have one year of eligibility remaining, though none of them has moved significantly closer to the mark since the 2020 ballot.\n\nThat 2013 class remains an embarrassing footnote in the history of the Hall of Fame and baseball discourse in general. It was a doughnut hole in the Hall\u2019s record, characterized by pettiness and infighting within the baseball community. But it also set the stage for this year\u2019s empty class by foregrounding the most nebulous and complicated criterion for Hall of Fame eligibility: the so-called character clause. And while the 2013 class was a watershed moment that led to greater clarity and consensus among voters, the 2021 class could portend an even more contentious and confusing future for the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Hall of Fame means more to baseball than it does to other sports, because baseball is obsessed with its own history and mythology. Sometimes this makes the sport resistant to necessary institutional change, and lends itself to \u201cBack in my day \u2026 \u201d\u2013type commentary. But baseball\u2019s history is much more of a strength than a weakness. For almost 150 years, high-level professional baseball has been part and parcel of the American cultural landscape, chronicled in exacting detail by contemporary journalists and record-keepers. In terms of stories, numbers, and folklore, there\u2019s more information out there about baseball than any two other American sports put together.\n\nThat rich history makes Hall of Fame season a highlight of the baseball calendar. It\u2019s a chance to weigh the stars of the recent past against those from years gone by; in comparing Scott Rolen to Brooks Robinson, we relive the highlights of both players\u2019 careers. We get to dig up old photos and videos, discover and rediscover old stories, and above all, share them with others who love the game as much as we do.\n\nMost fans have, at the very least, their own heuristic understanding of what makes a Hall of Famer\u2014if not an actual codified list of who ought to make the cut. But the electorate who puts players in or keeps them out is drawn from the BBWAA, the professional guild of people who cover the sport full time. (I\u2019m a member of the BBWAA, but still several years from becoming a Hall of Fame voter.)\n\nBaseball\u2019s Hall of Fame is unique among those of the four major North American sports in that it outsources some (but not all) of its selections to an outside group of journalists, rather than giving an internally selected committee full control. Those voters are issued a detailed set of procedures and instructions, along with one very important line that explains the Hall\u2019s main criteria for entry: \u201cVoting shall be based upon the player\u2019s record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.\u201d\n\nThe bookends to that sentence are the fun stuff. Weighing Gary Sheffield\u2019s bat against Andruw Jones\u2019s glove; determining whether Billy Wagner\u2019s 900-odd career innings were dominant enough to get him over the line; or gaming out how much of Todd Helton\u2019s gaudy numbers were the result of his home ballpark.\n\nBut that middle \u201cintegrity, sportsmanship, character\u201d section\u2014the character clause, in contemporary vernacular\u2014complicates matters.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, the character clause went from a forgettable aside to a dictate of titanic import. That\u2019s when the sport began dealing with the fallout from the Steroid Era. At that time, a large bloc of voters cited the character clause as a reason to exclude players whose on-field accomplishments would otherwise have easily guaranteed enshrinement. Some, like Bonds and Clemens, had clear links to PEDs but had never been suspended. Others, like Mike Piazza and Jeff Bagwell, were made to wait based on nothing more than innuendo.\n\nAs voters rallied against the inclusion of steroid users, the ballot became backlogged. The embarrassing empty class of 2013 was just one year in which there were more deserving candidates than ballot slots. In recent years, the problem has sorted itself out to a certain extent. Piazza, Bagwell, and most of the deserving players from the 1990s are in now, while others\u2014Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro\u2014have fallen off the ballot. But while the Steroid Era has now more or less passed the Hall of Fame by, it brought the character clause to the forefront of public attention\u2014just in time for an even bigger conundrum to emerge.\n\nCurt Schilling won 216 games, struck out 3,116 batters, and posted 79.5 bWAR in a 20-year big league career. He made six All-Star teams, finished second in Cy Young voting three times, and was one of the best postseason starters of all time. In 1993, Schilling won NLCS MVP and threw a complete-game shutout in the World Series, one of only five in the past 30 years. In 2001, he was co-MVP of the World Series, and in 2004 his \u201cbloody sock game\u201d became an inextricable part of Red Sox folklore. In 19 postseason starts, he went 11-2 with an ERA of 2.23 and struck out 120 batters in 133 1/3 innings.\n\nIf Schilling had never spoken publicly after his retirement, he would\u2019ve been a Hall of Famer years ago. Instead, he became one of ESPN\u2019s lead baseball announcers, a position he lost in 2016 after he posted a transphobic statement to Facebook. He\u2019d been suspended the season before for an anti-Muslim tweet, and gained notoriety for his collection of Nazi memorabilia. In late 2016, Schilling approvingly tweeted a picture of a man at a Trump rally who was wearing a T-shirt that called for the murder of journalists (he later deleted the tweet).\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough to dissuade 285 voters from ticking Schilling\u2019s box this time around. A few expressed regret for that decision when, one week after the New Year\u2019s Eve deadline for Hall of Fame votes to be submitted, the former pitcher expressed his support for the pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the broadest sense of \u201cintegrity, sportsmanship, character,\u201d steroid use isn\u2019t especially condemnatory. Particularly when it happened in an era when PED use was not only an open secret, but tacitly condoned by league officials and the media. It\u2019s a penny-ante sin\u2014punishable, but hardly unforgivable. Schilling, though, who earned a voice because of his excellence on the baseball diamond, has espoused a doctrine of hate at a time when American democracy is wobbling like a chair with three legs. If baseball players are to be denied Hall of Fame membership for reasons of character, surely Schilling\u2019s rhetoric qualifies.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not the only candidate whose past warrants closer consideration.\n\nIf I\u2019d had a vote this year, and on-field achievement were the only criterion, I would have filled a 10-person ballot: Bonds, Clemens, Schilling, Rolen, Wagner, Sheffield, Helton, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Jones, and Bobby Abreu. However, at least four of those players, Schilling included, merit a second look when character comes into play.\n\nIn 2008, the New York Daily News reported that Clemens had groomed country singer Mindy McCready when she was only 15, and that the two had later carried on an affair. (Clemens denied the story.) In 2012, Jones was arrested on charges of domestic assault after police said he choked his wife, who suffered \u201cvisible injuries,\u201d and threatened to kill her. And in 1995, Bonds\u2019s ex-wife testified at their divorce trial that the Giants star had beaten her repeatedly throughout their marriage. (Bonds denied this.) Another serious Hall of Fame candidate, Omar Vizquel, was arrested on assault charges in 2016, a fact that came to light last month when Vizquel\u2019s ex-wife told The Athletic he had abused her.\n\nThe imperative to consider character leaves Hall of Fame voters in an uncomfortable position. The run-up to this year\u2019s selection featured no shortage of public soul-searching by voters left to consider men with laudable on-field achievements and shameful off-field behavior. Pieces like those are polarizing, but they\u2019re underlined by a relatable and appropriate ambivalence. How can we conceive of a Hall of Fame without two of baseball\u2019s greatest players? But then again, how could one consider character and cast a ballot for someone with a history of bigotry or abuse?\n\nIt\u2019d be much easier if the Hall of Fame judged players based only on what they did on the field. But that\u2019s not how it works.\n\nSchilling\u2019s support for the Capitol rioters served as a bracing reminder that behaviors euphemistically described as \u201coff-the-field issues\u201d are connected to the actual society we have to live in. Real life, after all, happens off the field, and sometimes even reflects back into the on-field product.\n\nThe baseball community has the opportunity to reconsider its own structure and values. Last week, the Mets fired GM Jared Porter after ESPN reported that he\u2019d sexually harassed a female journalist. The story renewed focus on the issues of who is comfortable in the baseball world, and who\u2019s never really safe. Of who makes the decisions that drive the sport\u2019s culture, and how and why those decisions get made.\n\nI hope\u2014perhaps naively\u2014that recent events cause us to think purposefully about what we valorize, encourage, and tolerate. About who gets elevated, and how, and what message that sends. About the distinction between a great ballplayer and a great person. The discomfort at these decisions could be an acknowledgement that these are tough determinations, and that they\u2019re challenging to make. Or it could be a pang of conscience, reminding us to act according to our character."}]}
