{"Anne de Gaulle was the only child of Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle.": [{"url": "https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2017/04/26/a-fathers-love-the-story-of-charles-and-anne/", "page_content": "In World War II, Charles de Gaulle saved France\u2019s honor from the shame of defeat. Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/travel/charles-de-gaulle-london-history.html", "page_content": "With its bland architecture and gray concrete pavement, little distinguishes Curzon Square from its surroundings in the heart of London\u2019s Mayfair district. But it was here that Charles de Gaulle wrote a speech that would change his country\u2019s fate and, he believed, fulfill his destiny.\n\nOn June 17, 1940, still reeling from France\u2019s fall to Nazi Germany three days earlier, de Gaulle fled to London, where he borrowed a friend\u2019s apartment at 3 Curzon Square (then called Seamore Grove) and drafted a passionate call to arms. The next day he broadcast a message on BBC radio \u2014 a direct, clarion appeal to the French people:\n\n\u201cI, General de Gaulle, now in London, call on all French officers and men who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, with or without their arms; I call on all engineers and skilled workmen from the armaments factories who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, to get in touch with me.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s initial broadcast reached only a few parts of occupied France. (Subsequent transmissions on June 19 and 22 reached greater swathes of Vichy territory.) But today, it is considered one of the most significant moments in French history, even honored with its own square in Paris, Place du 18 Juin 1940.\n\nImage De Gaulle in the BBC studios, broadcasting his call to arms to all French people on British soil.

Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. No one, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petite Anne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love.\n\n________________________________\n\nDr. Samuel Gregg is Research Director at the Acton Institute.

His faith saw him\u2014and her\u2014through.\n\nLate last year on BreakPoint, I told you about an extraordinary bit of censorship by the French government.\n\nWhat was censored was an ad featuring a smiling, happy child with Down syndrome. The ad, entitled \u201cDear Future Mom,\u201d told potential mothers about the joy and love that these children can and will bring into their lives.\n\nSo, why was it banned? Because the French government believes that the ad is \u201clikely to disturb the conscience of women\u201d who had aborted their babies after learning that the child had Down syndrome.\n\nNow I\u2019m going to tell you a story about a Frenchman who saw things very differently: Charles de Gaulle.\n\nYou probably weren\u2019t expecting to hear that. To most Americans, de Gaulle was, as one writer put it, \u201can obnoxious, overly ambitious man who, in the grand French manner, strutted sitting down.\u201d\n\nHe may have been some or all of these things, but there was a side of Charles de Gaulle that few people know about, and that side revolved around his love for his daughter, Anne.\n\nAnne was born on New Year\u2019s Day, 1928, the third of Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s three children. In De Gaulle\u2019s words, Anne was \u201cun enfant pas comme les autres,\u201d a child not like the other children.\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably guessed, Anne had Down syndrome. Only it wasn\u2019t called \u201cDown syndrome\u201d back then. The children were called \u201cmongoloids,\u201d and, as a recent story by Samuel Gregg of the Acton Institute in the Catholic World Report told readers, \u201cit was common [back then] for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not something that de Gaulle and his family did. As de Gaulle put it, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d And so the family worked hard to make a place for Anne.\n\nWhile Yvonne worked on the logistics, Charles worked on the affection. You heard that right: the affection. Anne was the apple of his eye. As the article tells us, \u201cThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne.\u201d\n\nHe sang to her, read her stories, and taught her how to pray. Every night, Anne would \u201cpainstakingly . . . repeat each word after her father.\u201d In turn, de Gaulle would proudly tell his relatives that \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nAs Gregg tells readers, de Gaulle was well aware of how the Nazis treated children like Anne, and this, in turn, inspired his refusal to surrender to the Nazis. His \u201cact of resistance\u201d was a way of \u201csafeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\u201d As he later said, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between de Gaulle and his successors in the Elys\u00e9e Palace is almost too painful to contemplate. He refused to surrender to the Nazis to protect children with Down syndrome. After Anne\u2019s death, he and his wife established a foundation, staffed by nuns, to care for people \u201cwho are not like the others.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle was a complicated man\u2014most great men are\u2014but one of his complications was his Catholic faith that enabled him to love Anne. It was a love that, as Gregg put it, helped restore France\u2019s honor, the same honor that was tarnished when, out of fear for hurting people\u2019s feelings, it denied the humanity of the people de Gaulle worked tirelessly to save.\n\nTo read Samuel Gregg\u2019s outstanding article, \u201cA Father\u2019s Love: The Story of Charles and Anne,\u201d please come to BreakPoint.org, click on this commentary, and we\u2019ll link you to it.\n\nFurther Reading and Information\n\nFrance and Down Syndrome: The French Government Should Learn from Charles DeGaulle\n\n\n\nRead the touching account of Charles de Gaulle and his great affection for his daughter Anne, born with Down syndrome.

The largest and busiest airport in France is named after him\n\nA\u00e9roport de Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle or Paris Charles De Gaulle International Airport is recognized as the largest and busiest airport in the country.\n\nLocated in Roissy-en-France, 23 kilometers northeast of the French capital, the Charles de Gaulle Airport also goes by the names Roissy Airport and Paris CDG. It opened in 1974 and spans 32.38 square kilometres of land.\n\nThe Charles de Gaulle Airport is the world\u2019s 9th busiest airport. In Europe, it is second only to London\u2019s Heathrow. Within the EU, it is on the number one spot in terms of passenger numbers.\n\n2. He is known in France simply as \u201cle G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d or \u201cthe General\u201d\n\nGen. Charles de Gaulle was a statesman and officer in the French army who headed the Free French movement that fought the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s interest in the military started when he was a boy. It was not surprising that he decided to attend the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in Guer, France.\n\nIn 1913, de Gaulle, who was then a young second lieutenant, became a member of an infantry regiment that Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain commanded. P\u00e9tain who fought in the First World War would later be imprisoned for treason.\n\nAs a soldier, de Gaulle was brilliant, hardworking, and passionate. Throughout his military career that spanned from 1912 to 1944, he had been known to possess outstanding courge and great self-assurance. His rank was brigadier general.\n\n3. He had fought in 8 battles\n\nGeneral de Gaulle had fought in a total of 8 battles, which were the following: Battle of Verdun, Battle of the Somme, Polish \u2013 Soviet War, Battle of France, Battle of Montcornet, Battle of Abbeville, Battle of Dakar, and the Liberation of Paris.\n\n4. Charles de Gaulle saved France from several crises\n\nGen. de Gaulle had saved his country from several deep crises.\n\nFirst, he was hugely responsible for the liberation of France from the Nazis during the Second World War. This made \u201cle G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d a war and national hero.\n\nWhen World War II was over, de Gaulle became the leader of the nation during some of France\u2019s tensest periods \u2013 from 1944 through 1946 and from 1958 until 1969.\n\nHe is also linked with the founding of the most recent Fifth French Republic as well as the making of a new constitution which strengthened the institution of the presidency.\n\nAs president, Charles de Gaulle worked hard for the French politics to be more nationalist, which reinforced its position in the international scene.\n\n5. Charles de Gaulle married on April 6, 1921\n\nCharles de Gaulle was a military captain who was recently home from a mission in Poland when he met young Yvonne Vendroux.\n\nA year later, on 6 April 1921, the two were married in the Notre-Dame de Calais Church in Calais on the Opal Coast, where the Vendroux family was from.\n\n6. Charles de Gaulle had a daughter with Down syndrome\n\nThe union of Charles de Gaulle and Yvonne Vendroux produced three children: Philippe (born in 1921), \u00c9lisabeth (born in 1924), and Anne (born in 1928).\n\nThe youngest child, Anne de Gaulle, was born in the German city of Trier where her soldier father was stationed. She was born with Down syndome, a genetic disorder that is usually associated with distinct facial features, intellectual disability which can be mild to moderate, and delays in physical growth.\n\nSuffice it to say, Anne was his father\u2019s favorite. He would often sing and dance with her, or do pantomimes to entertain her.\n\nIn 1945, the de Gaulles established the Fondation Anne de Gaulle at the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur at Milon-la-Chapelle, in north-central France. It was a private hospital for handicapped girls like Anne, who succumbed to bronchial pneumonia in 1948.\n\n7. Charles de Gaulles was a devout Catholic\n\nCharles de Gaulle was raised in a strictly Catholic family. Henri de Gaulle, Charles\u2019 father, taught history and literature at a Jesuit high school in Paris.\n\nIt was Charles de Gaulle\u2019s religious parents who were responsible for his spiritual and intellectual formation in the Catholic faith. Prior to the military academy, he attended Catholic schools.\n\nWhen he was 16, Charles de Gaulle volunteered to be a stretcher-bearer at Lourdes. There he witnessed a miracle: a paralyzed Italian girl cured during the holy procession.\n\nDe Gaulle frequently attended the Mass and as a student he was one of the few who joined Congregation of the Holy Virgin, a religious organization devoted to prayer and spiritual meditation.\n\n8. De Gaulle became President of the French Republic on 21 December 1958\n\nDe Gaulle was elected President by an electoral college. He was reelected for a second term in 1965. He resigned from presidency in 1969, following the failure of his referendum in which he proposed more decentralization.\n\n9. His First Lady was also a conservative Catholic\n\nYvonne de Gaulle was strictly Catholic just like her husband. Mrs. de Gaulle fought against prostitution, pornography and its sale in newsstands, and the display of sex and nudity on TV.\n\nFor her conservative Catholic views, Yvonne de Gaulle garned the famous nickname \u201cTante Yvonne,\u201d or \u201cAuntie Yvonne.\u201d\n\n10. Charles de Gaulle survived 30 attempts on his life\n\nIf cats had nine lives, Charles de Gaulle had 30!\n\nThe most prominent of all these attempts was led by Jean Bastien-Thiry, a lieutenant-colonel in the French Air Force and also a military air-weaponry engineer.\n\nBastien-Thiry belonged to the Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te, a right-wing organization that opposed President de Gaulle\u2019s decision to sign the independence of Algeria.\n\nHe was the last man in France to be executed by firing squad for his foiled assassination attempt on the president on August 22, 1962.\n\n11. His daughter Anne\u2019s picture saved General de Gaulle\u2019s life\n\nThe 22 August 1962 failed assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle took place as he was riding his limousine with his wife at Petit-Clamart, a suburb of Paris.\n\nA potentially fatal bullet from the machine gun that ambushed the couple hit the frame of Anne de Gaulle\u2019s picture that her father always carried with him.\n\nThat day, the picture frame was placed on the rear shelf of the de Gaulle\u2019s limo, saving President de Gaulle\u2019s life by stopping the bullet that would have otherwise hit him.\n\n12. Charles de Gaulle died a natural death two weeks shy of his 80th birthday\n\nAfter so many foiled attempts on Charles de Gaulle\u2019s life, he enjoyed a very healthy life until November 9, 1970 \u2013 just a couple of weeks shy of his 80th birthday.\n\nHe died of aneurysm in his home in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, watching TV and playing cards.\n\nThen French President Georges Pompidou announced General de Gaulle\u2019s death the following morning with a simple statement: \u201cLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle est mort; la France est veuve.\u201d Translated to English, it means: \u201cGeneral de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.\u201d\n\nHi, I\u2019m Christine \u2013 a full-time traveler and career woman. Although I\u2019m from the Philippines, my location independent career took me to over 40 countries and lived in 4 continents in the last 10 years, including France.

They had taken refuge there with an aunt after leaving the family home at Colombey Les Deux Eglises about a month before. The Germans were advancing fast towards Western France, and when General De Gaulle reached London, he asked that urgent steps be taken to rescue his wife and family.\n\nThe decision was taken with Winston Churchill's agreement to send a plane with an SOE intelligence officer who was fluent in French to carry out this rescue. It had been intended that the mission should be carried out by Colonel Louis Franck, but he was diverted to the important mission of trying to persuade the King of the Belgians not to give up the armed struggle, and to bring him to England. The officer who replaced Colonel Franck was my uncle and godfather, Captain Norman Hope. Employed before the war by BP, he had lived in Saigon in French Indo-China, as it then was,so was a fluent French speaker. It is public knowledge that Madame De Gaulle and her children escaped by boat from Brest on 18 June. The following day, the Germans completed their conquest of Brittany. For 40 years, we did not know what had happened to those on board the plane.\n\nMy father noted laconically in his private war diary, '17 June. Norman Hope flew over to France on a special mission and no further news was received about him.' Some time later, Norman's wristwatch and some other personal effects were brought out of France by an escaping Frenchman. In February 1941, my father noted, 'Marjorie heard from the War Office that Norman must now be presumed to have been killed in France on 17(sic) June 1940.' Marjorie was Norman's wife and my aunt. She never referred to him in the hearing of my brother, my cousin or me, but when she died in 1982, there were instructions that the notice of her death should include the words, 'widow of Norman Hope, Chevalier du Legion'd'Honneur.' And she had the medal. In the way things turn out, it was too late to find out anything from my aunt. But we needed to find out something about Norman's final hours from somebody.\n\nThanks to a small number of important personal contacts, including Colonel Franck, my cousin was put in touch with Flt Lieut Kevin Baff, the historian of No 10 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force. He had been particularly interested in the flight because two of the crew were the first Australian Air force casualties of the war. Kevin Baff had the perseverance of experise of the true researcher, and in the late 1970's and early 1980's, he was gradually piecing the story together. What happened was this.\n\non 17 June, Norman travelled with his orders to a Coastal Command base near Plymouth, and was directed to a Supermarine Walrus, an amphibious aircraft with a crew of three, Flt Lieut John Bell, RAAF, Sgt Charles Harris, RAAF and Cpl Bernard Nowell, RAF. The purpose of the flight was so secret that noone at the base knew where the aircraft was going. Norman's briefing was to the crew only. They took off at about 0300 on 18 June with the intention of reaching Carantec at first light. They crossed the Breton coast about 20km west of Carantec, and it is believed they were fired on by the Germans or possibly the Frenc. Having been hit,the pilot was attempting to land in a field close to Ploudaniel, about 18km inland, when the plane hit a low embankment, burst into flames and all four men were killed.\n\nIt was fortunate that Madame de Gaulle knew nothing of this attempt to rescue her. Had she waited in Carantec, she might have been captured, and the consequences of that would have been extremely serious, to put it mildly. In the event, she found a car in which she drove with her children to Brest. They were delayed, because on the way the car broke down. Had it not, they would have gone on board a ship which later in the day was sunk in the English Channel with the loss of almost all on board. Instead, they found room on the last boat to leave Brest before the Germans arrived.\n\nIn the field near Ploudaniel, a number of people gathered at the site of the crash, and the bodies of my uncle and the crew members were carefully retrieved from the burnt out aircraft, and buried in the town cemetery. All this with the Wehrmacht almost upon them. After the war, the War Graves Commission put headstones on the graves, and the townspeople continue to remember these four casualties of war on All Souls' Day (2 November) and other times of remembrance.\n\nMy cousin, brother and I are certain my aunst never visited the grave. We assume she must have received information from the War Graves Commission that her husband was buried in Ploudaniel. All that is symptom of a family mystery we are unlikely to unravel. However, in 2003, we were able after long preparations, to visit the grave, and get as close as we could to the site of the crash: Kevin Baff had established from contacts in the area that the field layout had been substantially altered. It was deeply moving to be there, and we said prayers of remembrance for Norman and the crew of the Walrus.\n\nThere remains one further uncertainty about which we are looking for help. It is about the award of the Legion d'Honneur to Norman Hope. The medal exists, but the Central Office for Military Archives in France says there is no record of a citation. Can anyone help us reach a solution to this part of a story which remains in part mysterious?\n\nSources\n\nSir Edward Spears. Two Men who saved france. 1966\n\nEdward Ashcroft.

On Aug. 24, she left the hospital against the advice of her doctors after a photographer, disuised as a nurse, sneaked into her room one nignt ana LOOK pictures of ner in nea.\n\nYvonne Charlotte Anne\u2010Marie de Gaulle was born in Calais on May 22, 1900, the daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux. Her father was an industrialist. She first met Charles de Gaulle when he was a young officer, just after World War I. After their second meeting, at ball given at St.\u2010Cyr, the famous military school, she was said to have remarked, \u201cIt will be him or no one.\u201d Four months later, on April 6, 1921, they were married.\n\nWhile she was known for her modesty and retiring nature, Yvonne de Gaulle could show courage too.\n\nA car in which she and her husband were riding in 1962 was ambushed near - Paris and the pair narrowly escaped death in a hail of machine\u2010gun fire. The bullet\u2010riddled car, its tires flattened, escaped. When Mrs. de Gaulle was assisted from the car by the police, her first words were, \u201cHow are my chickens?\u201d She had bought some chickens in jelly at Fauchon's, the famous Paris food store, that morning and they were in the trunk of the car.\n\nEnjoying the Joke\n\nThe de Gaulles were not unaware of the mild humor they provoked and enjoyed some of the stories themselves. In one, Mrs. de Gaulle enters a room where her husband is waiting. She trips on the rug and involuntarily mutters \u201cMon Dieu!\u201d He replies: \u201cHow many times must I remind you? It is quite sufficient to say `Mon general.\u2019 \u201c\n\nPresident de Gaulle's feelings for his wife were expressed in the dedication of his memoirs. \u201cTo Yvonne,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwithout whom I could have done nothing.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2020/11/charles-de-gaulle-half-a-century-on/", "page_content": "On the evening of November 9, 1970, 50 years ago last week, at his home and refuge of nearly four decades, La Boisserie in the commune of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises in the Haute-Marne, after a day at work on the second volume of his memoirs, and tea with his wife, Charles de Gaulle sat down to play patience. Just before 7pm he cried out in pain and slumped on the table. Yvonne de Gaulle called the doctor and cur\u00e9, who administered the Last Rites. It was an aneurysm. At 7.25pm the saviour of modern France was dead. The General\u2019s confidant and successor, Georges Pompidou, declared the next day, \u201cFrance is a widow.\u201d\n\nIn 1952 the last great Frenchman had laid out the plans for his obsequies with precision and an almost perverse humility and restraint. His requiem Mass would be held at his local church with only his family, a few members of the local community and some Companions of the Liberation present. There would be no homily. He would be buried beside his adored younger daughter, Anne, with room left for his widow. His tombstone would say nothing but Charles de Gaulle (1890 \u2013 1970).\n\nHis most recent, and perhaps his best biographer, Julian Jackson, Professor of History at Queen Mary, University of London, observes in A Certain Idea of France (2018), de Gaulle was riddled with \u201cextraordinary contradictions\u201d. The Times Literary Supplement\u2019s Sudhir Hazareesingh summed him up, \u201cHe veered between buoyant optimism and crippling melancholy, calculating rationalism and ethereal mysticism, selfless abnegation and narcissistic egotism, shameless opportunism and obdurate inflexibility. Fittingly, his surname was derived from the Flemish word for \u2018wall'\u201d.\n\nHe has been compared to Charlemagne, Joan of Arc, Richelieu, Henri IV, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Chateaubriand and Cl\u00e9menceau. His minister for culture, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, once asked to whom he would compare himself. His reply? \u201cMy only rival is Tintin! We are the small who refuse to allow ourselves to be cheated by the big. Only, no one notices the similarity because of my size.\u201d (He was 6ft 4inches, when the average height in France was 5ft 3inches.)\n\nCharles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, at his maternal grandparents\u2019 house in Lille. He was, however Petit Lillois de Paris \u2013 a Parisian from a distinguished family who had been born in Lille; not a provincial boy from Lille who found himself transported to Paris. He was the third of five children of Henri de Gaulle, who taught at a Jesuit school, and Jeanne Maillot, a member of the pious industrial bourgeoisie of Calais. The de Gaulles were austere traditional Catholics and minor aristocrats \u2014 an ancestor had fought at Agincourt. Charles\u2019s great-grandfather had been arrested during the Revolution and was spared the guillotine only by the fall of Robespierre. The family were monarchists under the skin, considering it a tragedy that the Comte de Chambord should have refused to accept the throne in 1873 if it meant also accepting the tricolor.\n\nThere was no question that he would be educated as a Catholic and after his school was closed he was sent to the Jesuits in Belgium. At school he was called Asparagus \u2013 his height and short-sightedness deflected by a chilly reserve. He brother, Xavier, suggested he had been dropped into an icebox at birth yet his vision and ambition knew no bounds.\n\nGraduating from St Cyr Military Academy in 1912, de Gaulle had chosen to serve in the 33rd Infantry stationed at Arras, under, then-colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s command. Come the First World War, he was in Verdun where the first bombardment wiped out the whole of Captain de Gaulle\u2019s company (he was the youngest French Captain in the Great War). He was thought to have been killed too. P\u00e9tain issued a citation: \u201cCaptain de Gaulle had \u2018led his men in a furious assault and fierce hand-to-hand fighting, the only solution he considered compatible with his sentiment of military honour. Fell in the fray. A peerless officer in all respects.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he spent the rest of the war in German camps, escaping five times, only to be recaptured after every break because of his height. He greeted the Armistice \u201cwith the indescribable regret at not having played a greater role.\u201d\n\nAfter the war he joined the French Military Mission to Poland; returned to lecture in military history at St Cyr; he attended the Ecole de Guerre; was a ghostwriter for Petain (until he realised he was not the only one); and then postings to Treves and Beirut. A position on the Secretariat of the Supreme War Council followed; and then, in 1937, having been promoted to colonel, command of a tank regiment. By 1938 he had published four books \u2014 on war, leadership and the army. The last of them, La France et son arm\u00e9e, contained a eulogy of the revolutionary Hoche, which, Professor Jackson noted, prompted a sad rebuke from his father.\n\nWhen war broke out, he was already critical of what he saw as the passivity of the French High Command. After the Germans attacked in May 1940, he was given command of a new armoured division, which, among so much defeat, distinguished itself. On June 5, five days after being promoted to Brigadier-General, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for National Defence, his first political office, in the government of Paul Reynaud.\n\nThe troops of General von K\u00fcchler\u2019s XVIIth army entered Paris on June 14, 1940, at 5.30 am. Two divisions advanced on the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. By midday, the German high command had taken up residence in the H\u00f4tel de Crillon on the Place de la Concorde. As Ferdinand Mount put it,\n\nThere had been no battle, or even the slightest sign of resistance. It was not as if the French had collapsed at the first puff of smoke. In six weeks, they had already had nearly a hundred thousand men killed and lost half their tanks, a worse kill rate than at Verdun. Nobody had fought with greater \u00e9lan than de Gaulle and his tanks in their three sorties, which failed only because of the odds against them.\n\nWhen Churchill recalled that in 1918 Clemenceau had said, \u2018I will fight in front of Paris, in Paris and behind Paris,\u2019 P\u00e9tain replied that in 1918 he had had sixty divisions to spare. Now there were none. \u2018To make Paris into a city of ruins will not affect the issue.\u2019\u2026.. Had it not been for P\u00e9tain and Weygand, de Gaulle might have had to pick his way through the rubble when he walked down the Champs Elys\u00e9es on Liberation Day. Like Churchill, he would have preferred it that way.\n\nOn June 17, the day after P\u00e9tain replaced Reynaud, de Gaulle left for London \u201calone \u2026.. and stripped of everything, like a man on the beach proposing to swim across the ocean.\u201d In fact, he was accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel, and Churchill\u2019s representative, General Edward Spears. He landed at Heston soon after midday, as P\u00e9tain was announcing the formation of the collaborationist government. He carried with him a pair of trousers, four shirts and a photograph of his family.\n\nOn June 18, Charles-sans-terre, with nothing but his uniform and his voice, broadcast from London. \u201cL\u2019Appel du 18 Juin\u201d (\u2018France has lost a battle, she has not lost the war\u2019) was also the anniversary of the Waterloo.\n\nReminding his people,\n\nFor France is not alone! She is not alone! She is not alone! She has a vast Empire behind her. She can align with the British Empire that holds the sea and continues the fight. She can, like England, use without limit the immense industry of the United States\u2026\u2026.\n\nHe ended with,\n\nI, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who might end up here, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the specialised workers of the armament industries who are located in British territory or who might end up here, to put themselves in contact with me.\n\nWhatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished\u2026\n\nOf the 50,000 members of the French military In Britain that day, 1000 would join him \u2013 the vast majority opted to be repatriated. Of the 1600 men in the White City camp, for example, only 152 signed up with de Gaulle. After the armistice in Syria, only 5500 of the Vichy troops rallied to the Free French; the other 30,000 chose to return to France.\n\nIn London he persisted with a combination of tactical skill, ruthlessness, obstinacy and sheer, grinding willpower. One of the many obstacles, he had to overcome was his lack of familiarity with English. He cited Charles V: \u201cOne speaks French to men, Italian to women, German to horses, Spanish to God but whoever heard of one speaking English?\u201d He had none of the expansive charm of a Franklin Roosevelt nor the sweeping oratorical power of a Winston Churchill. He also had to deal with divisions among his own supporters in London, and slights from the Americans. Roosevelt dismissed him as \u201cthe head of some French Committee\u201d.\n\nHis English hosts, too, were at best ambivalent. The waspish diplomat, Sir Alexander Cadogan, describes his guest as having \u201ca head like a pineapple and hips like a woman\u201d. Churchill wrote that the Cross of Lorraine was the heaviest cross he had had to bear. \u201cHe\u2019s selfish, he\u2019s arrogant, he thinks he\u2019s the centre of the Universe . . . he\u2019s a great man!\u201d As the New Yorker\u2019s Adam Gopnik put it, \u201cHis behavior was maddeningly adolescent, but he chose it for the same reason that an adolescent chooses his\u2014as the one way, in a position of actual dependency, to declare one\u2019s autonomy. Slamming the door of your bedroom is sometimes the only power you have when you are living in someone else\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nOne of de Gaulle\u2019s most precious assets was his family. In 1921, he had married Yvonne Vendroux, a good-looking, strong-willed, deeply private and deeply Catholic daughter of a prosperous Calais biscuit-maker, from a family not unlike his mother\u2019s. Her unpretentious nature and horror of adultery and divorce unfairly attracted the tag \u201cTante Yvonne\u201d from some of Paris\u2019s mondaine quartiers. She famously said, \u201cThe presidency is temporary, the family is forever\u201d. She detested living in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e and drew comfort and solace from the garden at La Boisserie, their home from 1934.\n\nThey had three children \u2014 Philippe (who became an Admiral and will be 99 in December); \u00c9lisabeth (1924-2013; who married Alain de Boissieu, later a general); and the beloved Anne (at left with her father in early Thirties) who was born in 1928, with Down\u2019s Syndrome. Papa was one of the few words she could pronounce and he was the only one who could make her laugh. He and Yvonne were devoted to her and fiercely protective. In 1945, Yvonne established an Anne de Gaulle Foundation for children with disabilities in a ch\u00e2teau bought for the purpose. De Gaulle\u2019s early biographer, Jean Lacouture, reported that one of the General\u2019s doctors said he heard his patient say: \u201cWithout Anne, perhaps I should not have done all that I have done. She gave me so much heart and spirit.\u201d\n\nAnne died in 1948, aged 20, of pneumonia, in her father\u2019s arms. After her body had been lowered into the earth, de Gaulle remained by the grave with Yvonne. Then he put his hand on his wife\u2019s arm and, as they turned to leave, murmured to her: \u201cShe\u2019s like others now.\u201d\n\nCome D-Day, de Gaulle was magnificent:\n\nThe supreme battle has begun \u2026 It is of course the Battle of France, and the battle for France \u2026 For the sons of France, wherever they may be, whoever they may be, the simple and sacred duty is to fight the enemy by all the means available \u2026 Behind the heavy clouds of our blood and our tears, the sunshine of our grandeur is re-emerging.\n\nChurchill wrote to Roosevelt the next day, the speech was \u201cremarkable, as he has not a single soldier in the great battle now developing.\u201d\n\nOn June 3, 1944, de Gaulle became Chairman of the provisional government of the French Republic. And finally, on August 25, 1944, he arrived in Paris. The next day the general strode \u2014 alone (his fellow resistors were asked to keep a few feet behind) \u2014 down the Champs Elysees in triumph, from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, and then went to hear Mass in Notre Dame. All France then sang a Magnificat. De Gaulle even managed to arrange the French to witness the German surrender the following May (\u201cThe French are here, too?\u201d one of the German generals reportedly quipped.)\n\nIn January, 1946, finding factionalism and parliamentary manoeuvring distasteful, he retired. This would be the first of several retreats and returns. Throughout the early and mid-Fifties he would return to the hustings. He also completed the first volume of his memoirs with its famous opening sentence: \u201cAll my life I have had a certain idea of France.\u201d\n\nAs a nationalist uprising in Algeria in 1954 escalated into a full-scale war, he sat at Colombey playing patience and listening to the clack of Yvonne\u2019s knitting needles. By June 1958, a group of right-wing French military men, alarmed at events in Alg\u00e9rie francaise, organised a series of coups. De Gaulle was asked by the French President to lead a government of \u201cnational union\u201d for six months. It was said that the pieds noirs, the huge community of French nationals in Algeria, had been sold-out. According to Professor Jackson, De Gaulle\u2019s triumph was to make the French \u201cbelieve that he had controlled the process; and to create a compelling narrative that explained France\u2019s disengagement from Algeria and turned it into a victory rather than a defeat.\u201d\n\nElected president in December 1958, he declared the Fifth Republic a month later. Over the next decade (he described his term to his son as \u201ca kind of popular monarchy\u201d) De Gaulle rebuilt France and made it modern, pushing through an extraordinary number of reforms \u2014 monetary, administrative and institutional \u2014 justifiably compared with those of the Consulate of Napoleon. He also established a Franco-German axis as a foundation for (continental) European unity, he recognized communist China, criticised America\u2019s war in Vietnam, and twice vetoed British membership of Europe. He also condemned Israel\u2019s seizure of Arab territories during the Six Day War in 1967. And there was his explosive call to the people of Montreal in July 1967, Vive le Qu\u00e9bec,\u201d he concluded, and \u2013 after a long pause \u2013 \u201clibre.\u201d\n\nThat mix of austerity and hauteur never deserted him. While in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, he insisted on paying the family telephone and electricity bills. When the government offered to award him a medal for his patriotic services, he retorted \u201cone does not decorate France\u201d.\n\nThe year 1968 was one of tumult all over the world. No less than en France. By May, the student rebellion that began in the streets of Paris had spread to the factories outside it. What was described as \u201can anti-materialist revolt with a largely incoherent practical politics\u201d \u2013 it sounds rather like the gilets jaunes \u2013 proved so deep an impatience with Gaullism that it transformed France within a week. May 29, 1968, was one of the most extraordinary day of his public life. De Gaulle left for Baden-Baden, where he met General Jacques Hassu (Did Hassu say, \u201cGive me two divisions and tomorrow, you can take your breakfast on the boulevard Saint Germain\u201d?) Was this his flight to Varennes? He then retreated, once again, to Colombey, and seemed on the brink of resignation. Instead, he returned to Paris and led an immense counter-demonstration. It was thought as many as a million supporters poured into the Champs Elys\u00e9e.\n\nIn the elections held in June 1969, the Gaullist party gained an outright parliamentary majority. Still, having lost an insignificant referendum on regional reform, an exhausted de Gaulle resigned a year later.\n\nHis tragedy was, according to Anthony Hartley, author of Gaullism: the Rise and Fall of a Political Movement (1972), that the president as arbiter led inexorably into becoming the president as party-boss, and in the process saw his own popularity decline as that of the party increased. He was endlessly disappointed in his countrymen, dismissing them as sheep (veaux).\n\nBack at la Boisserie in Colombey, he looked to his legacy as he embarked on the second volume of his memoirs, Endeavour. It was said that he planned to end his memoirs with an imagined dialogue between himself and Napoleon. As Patrice Gueniffey observes in Napoleon and de Gaulle: Heroes and History (2020), the important difference between the two men lay in their relationship to France, \u201cIf Napoleon was the least French of Frenchmen, de Gaulle was \u2026. the most French of Frenchmen.\u201d\n\nHe had once told a press conference, in his Sphinx-like way, \u201cReassure yourselves. I shall not fail to die.\u201d And so, thirteen days before his eightieth birthday, he did.\n\nOn November 12, as his simple ceremony took place at Notre Dame-de-Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, 3,000 mourners (including eighty heads of state) gathered in and around Notre Dame de Paris. There, at 11am, the choir broke into the chorale from Bach\u2019s Matthew Passion. In accordance with the General\u2019s wishes, Cardinal Marty, Archbishop of Paris, delivered no sermon. Instead, after reading the lesson from St. John\u2019s second epistle to Timothy, he asked the congregation to meditate in silence on the search for \u201cjustice and peace in the world.\u201d Bells began to toll from the Notre Dame de Paris to Notre Dame-de-Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises and churches throughout the Republic. The climax came with the singing of the De Profundis and the Magnificat, recalling that day in 1944 when toute la France joined in reciting it to celebrate their liberation, paying homage to both their God \u2014 and their saviour.\n\nMark McGinness, an Australian living in the United Arab Emirates, is a frequent contributor"}, {"url": "https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Charles-de-Gaulle/273951", "page_content": "Introduction Hulton Archive/Getty Images (1890\u20131970). Twice in 20 years France looked to Charles de Gaulle for leadership in a time of trouble. General de Gaulle led the Free French government in the dark days of World War II. In 1958 he returned to power as president in an attempt to save France from civil war. Throughout his career as military leader and statesman, de Gaulle was guided by a belief in the greatness of France.\n\nEducation and Early Military Career Charles-Andr\u00e9-Joseph-Marie de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, at Lille, in northern France. His father was a philosophy professor. His mother was a descendant of Scottish and Irish refugees who had fled to France with the Stuarts. In 1911 de Gaulle graduated near the head of his class from the prestigious military school at St-Cyr and became a second lieutenant in the infantry. He was wounded three times during World War I. At the battle of Verdun in 1916 he was captured by the Germans. De Gaulle made five unsuccessful attempts to escape. He was released after the 1918 armistice.\n\nTeaching and Writing Between Wars In 1921 de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux, the daughter of a biscuit manufacturer from Calais. They had three children. Their first child, Philippe, was named after de Gaulle\u2019s former commander, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain. After World War I de Gaulle served on a military mission to Poland and then taught military history at St-Cyr. He became P\u00e9tain\u2019s aide in 1927 and served in the army in Germany and the Middle East. De Gaulle wrote several books on military subjects. Perhaps the most important was The Army of the Future (1934), in which he was one of the first to suggest the use of a professional, mechanized infantry.\n\nLeader of Fighting French in World War II When Germany invaded France in 1940, de Gaulle was made a brigadier general and given command of an armored division. France failed to check the German advance, and P\u00e9tain signed a truce with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle flew to London for a series of conferences with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. While there, de Gaulle encouraged the French to keep fighting the Germans, declaring in a radio broadcast, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, but she has not lost the war.\u201d From his London base, he took control of the newly formed Free French resistance movement. After the American invasion of North Africa he joined Gen. Henri Giraud in Algiers to serve as copresident of the French Committee of National Liberation. De Gaulle later became sole president of the committee and chief of the Free French armed forces. He returned to Paris in 1944 on the heels of the retreating Germans.\n\nProvisional President Appointed president of the newly established French provisional government, de Gaulle tried to unite France\u2019s many political parties into a strong national administration. He fought extremist measures and tried to establish a moderately liberal regime. De Gaulle had always been opposed to France\u2019s historic system of an all-powerful legislature. He advocated a strong presidency as a check on the National Assembly. De Gaulle\u2019s proposed constitutional reforms met with increasing hostility from the Assembly, and early in 1946 he resigned. In 1947, still working for a strong central government, he organized a new political party\u2014the Rally of the French People. His influence declined, however, and he dissolved the party in 1953. In the years that followed, de Gaulle\u2019s warnings against unstable government were justified. No French government was able to stay in power for more than a few months. A major cause of the political uproar was the civil war fought in Algeria over French attempts to preserve colonialism in North Africa."}]}
