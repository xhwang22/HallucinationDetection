Kirby Smart announced Monday morning that McClendon is returning to the Classic City where he will coach the wide receivers and serve as the passing-game coordinator.\n\nMcClendon is coming on to replace Cortez Hankton, who after four years at UGA -- three as the receivers coach and pass-game coordinator, left for LSU. Salary details for McClendon have not yet been made available by the university. The Mays High School (Atlanta, Ga.) product joins the Bulldog staff after an extremely short stint (less than four weeks) at Miami where he held the co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach titles.\n\nMcClendon was the receivers coach at Oregon in 2020 and 2021. He was also the Ducks' interim head coach when Mario Cristobol left to take the Miami job. He was at South Carolina for the four seasons prior to that where he was hired by Will Muschamp, a current assistant coach on Georgia's defensive staff. McClendon held the co-offensive coordinator title at South Carolina in 2016 and 2017. He then became the offensive coordinator and play caller in 2018 and 2019 before being relieved of his duties.\n\nDuring his time with the Gamecocks McClendon helped develop current NFL wideouts Deebo Samuel and Bryan Edwards. They each went over 800 yards receiving in 2018 while Shi Smith had 673 yards receiving. Edwards stayed for the 2019 season and had over 800 yards receiving in that season, too.\n\nHis coaching career began at UGA in 2007 as a graduate assistant. He spent two seasons in that role before being promoted by Mark Richt to the on-field staff in 2009 as running backs coach. McClendon coached running backs from 2009 to 2014 and grew into one of the nation's top recruiters.\n\nMcClendon had a huge hand in Georgia winning out in the hotly tested recruitments of prospects like Isaiah Crowell, Isaiah Wynn, Keith Marshall, Todd Gurley, Sony Michel, and Nick Chubb among others. He was moved to coach wide receivers in 2015 to make room for Thomas Brown to join the coaching staff, but he spent just one season in that role before Richt was fired and most of the staff was let go. McClendon stayed on with the Bulldogs for the 2015 TaxSlayer Bowl and helped lead the team to a victory over Penn State.\n\nMcClendon is the son of UGA running back great Willie McClendon and joined the UGA football team as a player in 2002. He spent four years with the program and was a part of two SEC Championship teams in 2002 and 2005. Smart was the running backs coach on that 2005 team while McClendon was the team's second-leading receiver behind Leonard Pope. After his time at UGA as a player, McClendon was picked up by the Chicago Bears but didn't make it to the 2006 season with the team before he was let go."}, {"url": "https://247sports.com/Article/Georgia-football-Todd-Gurley-reacts-to-Bryan-McClendon-hire-for-Kirby-Smart-Bulldogs-181850549/", "page_content": "BOULDER, Colo.\u2014 Who's been talked about more in college football than Deion Sanders?\n\nWhether it's getting the nation's top recruit Travis Hunter to flip on signing day to Jackson State, his decision to accept the Colorado job or the massive roster overhaul that has taken place since the spring game (51 scholarship players total, 44 alone after the spring game) Sanders has given sports media plenty to write about while raising eyebrows across college football.\n\n\"We'll see how it works out but that, to me, looks bad on college football coaches across the country,\" Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi told 247Sports' Brandon Marcello in May, a quote that went viral. \"The reflection is on one guy right now but when you look at it overall \u2014 those kids that have moms and dads and brothers and sisters and goals in life \u2014 I don't know how many of those 70 that left really wanted to leave or they were kicked in the butt to get out.\"\n\nSanders believes his true true goal behind his roster makeover has been lost in translation. He addressed that and much more this week in a wide-ranging Q&A with 247Sports this week on campus, with Sanders and Colorado providing behind-the-scenes access to one of its summer football camps.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This interview has been edited for clarity.\n\n247Sports: What have you seen so far from your new team?\n\nSanders: \"Want, determination, effort, camaraderie. It is a collection of men \u2014 some wanting a second chance. And some of them are just trying to get to the next level. But all of them share a desperate want to get where they want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\n247Sports: What do you say to people like Pat Narduzzi who have been critical of your roster overhaul?\n\nSanders: \"What was his situation when he came to Pitt? He had a different situation than me. He is not mad at me, he is mad at the situation in football now that allowed his best player to leave a year ago. He\u2019s not mad at me, he\u2019s using me to shoot bullets at another coach who he has an issue with. I don\u2019t know who he is; if he walked in here right now I wouldn\u2019t know him.\"\n\n247Sports: There was a lot of smoke surrounding Travis Hunter when he entered the portal: Would he follow you to Colorado or land somewhere else? He obviously enrolled at Colorado. What are your expectations for him this season?\n\nSanders: \"People offered Travis Hunter a bag. About $1.5 million to try to lure him and buy him out of the transfer portal. But Travis is not the kind of guy that can be bought. He isn't built like that. Travis is a relational young man that is built on relationships and stability. And that\u2019s what he wanted and desired. That is why he decided to ride and stay with us. I cannot wait until they see what he is capable of doing in these next couple of years. Because he will be a top-5 or top-3 pick after his junior year. But the sky's the limit, he is going to play both ways and he is a vital part of the offense and the defense, and he wants that.\n\n247Sports: How do you manage him playing both ways?\n\nSanders: \"We don\u2019t have to manage that. His game is his game. It\u2019s nothing that we manage. Travis is bored when he is not on the field, Travis is not intertwined with things when he is not on the field. Travis likes to be in the action, that\u2019s who he is.\"\n\n247Sports: As I watched the workouts this week, one of the things that has stood out to me is the vocal leadership of Shedeur Sanders. You\u2019ve been coaching him from youth, to high school and now college football. How has Shedeur grown as a leader this spring in the transition to Colorado?\n\nSanders: \"It\u2019s funny telling you this because his brother is sitting here filming this, but [Shedeur\u2019s] nickname is \u201cGrown.\u201d Because he has always been truly mature for his age at different stages of his life that he has encountered and different obstacles he has overcome. He is rock-steady. Grown doesn't get flustered. He is not a 'ra-ra' guy. He's not a 'I\u2019m gonna talk about what he\u2019s going to do\u201d [type of person]. It\u2019s not too many things in life that will get him up or get him down. He is like a baseball player. Baseball players are rock-steady. Football players are up because they have to practice for six days and play one. Baseball players have to do it every day. That is his character. And I love the expectation that he has placed on himself. My expectation of him is far less than his expectations he places on himself. Because not only does he have tremendous expectations, but he is a Sanders. And he knows what that means.\"\n\nGet offseason and recruiting information on your favorite college team for $1 for first month\n\n247Sports: A lot of roster changes have been made.\n\nSanders: \"Necessary changes. Say: 'Necessary.'\n\n247Sports: How do you like your team going into the fall as opposed to what you had in the spring?\n\nSanders: \"Apples and Oranges. You can\u2019t compare the two. You are talking about a situation in which we inherited a team that was 1-11. And everyone knows there are going to be some changes. I don\u2019t understand how you would think that the coaching staff is the only thing that deserved a change. Now when you rid yourself of the entire coaching staff, you think you are going to keep all the kids? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense whatsoever when the previous staff was responsible for securing those kids. That\u2019s not the way that this game is played with us.\"\n\n247Sports: From a recruiting standpoint, if a young man wants to play for Colorado, what does he need to have?\n\nSanders: \"First he needs to have his grades correct and needs to be eligible through our compliance department. Then, he needs to be tough, smart, fast, disciplined and with character. And he has to understand that this coaching staff is old school. Not old fools, but old school. A lot of our principles and the way we attack the game comes from way back when. And we are still that way because that way is the way and it has not failed us yet. So it\u2019s a tremendous expectation, but we go hard and we play fast. And you have to love this thing. We don\u2019t want you to be 'in like' with it. We want you to be 'in love' with it.\"\n\nRELATED: 5 things Carl Reed learned from Colorado's spring game"}, {"url": "https://www.on3.com/teams/georgia-bulldogs/news/bryan-mcclendon-returning-to-georgia-as-wide-receivers-coach/", "page_content": "Georgia has made a move to fill the vacancy at wide receivers coach as sources have confirmed to DawgsHQ that Kirby Smart has hired Bryan McClendon away from Miami.\n\nThe former Bulldog pass catcher was set to be a member of Mario Crisobal\u2019s first staff at \u201cThe U\u201d after making the move from Oregon with him but will now head home to Athens where he played and began his coaching career.\n\nMcClendon played at Georgia from 2002 to 2005, hauling in 56 passes for 830 yards and six touchdowns over the course of his career.

McClendon then went to Oregon for two seasons as the wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator, also serving as the interim head coach when Cristobal made the move to Miami.\n\nMcClendon will be tasked with replacing quite a bit of lost talent and production in the wide receiver room this coming season. Aside from the departure of former position coach Cortez Hankton, Georgia saw George Pickens leave for the NFL Draft and Jermaine Burton, as well as Justin Robinson and Jaylen Johnson, enter the transfer portal. Luckily, the Bulldogs have Ladd McConkey, AD Mitchell and Kearis Jackson coming back to spearhead the passing game.\n\nDawgsHQ will continue to update this story as more details emerge.\n\nReady to get all your latest Georgia athletics news in one place?

He served as a graduate assistant at UGA in 2007-08 and was named to the full-time staff as running backs coach in 2009, a position he held until 2015. McClendon was named interim head coach at UGA at the end of the 2015 season and led the Bulldogs to a 24-17 victory over Penn State in the TaxSlayer Bowl.\n\nSince that time McClendon has held assistant coaching positions at South Carolina (2016-19, offensive coordinator and wide receivers) and Oregon (2020-21, passing game coordinator, wide receivers, interim head coach for 2021 Valero Alamo Bowl). He had accepted a position of co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach at Miami earlier this year but left when his alma mater offered him his current position.\n\nAs a member of the full-time staff, Georgia teams won 64 games and two SEC Eastern Division titles. He\u2019s been part of an offensive staff that led Georgia to the 2014 SEC scoring offense title (41.3 points per game) and three consecutive record-setting seasons: Total Yards in a Season (6,547 in 2012, 6,294 in 2013, 5,964 in 2014); Average Yards Per Game (467.64 in \u201812, 484.2 in \u201813, 458.8 in \u201814 ); and Most TD\u2019s in a Season (72 in 2012, 58 in \u201813, 70 in \u201814). At UGA, he coached a number of elite running backs during his tenure including Isaiah Crowell, Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, as well as Nick Chubb and Sony Michel.\n\nMcClendon lettered as a wide receiver at Georgia in 2002-03-04-05. During his tenure, the Bulldogs won three SEC Eastern Division titles (2002, \u201803, \u201805), two SEC championships (2002, \u201805) and played in four bowl games (2003 Nokia Sugar, \u201804 Capital One, \u201805 Outback, \u201806 Nokia Sugar), winning three of them. As a senior, McClendon caught 35 passes including six for touchdowns. He caught the game-winning TD pass in the closing minutes against Georgia Tech and then blocked a punt in the SEC Championship Game which led to the Bulldogs\u2019 third TD in the 34-14 victory over LSU. McClendon was part of a senior class that won 44 games \u2013 the most by any class in Georgia history at the time.\n\nFollowing the 2005 season, McClendon signed a free agent contract with the Chicago Bears. He graduated in December 2005 with a degree in Recreation and Leisure Studies. He is the son of former Georgia tailback Willie McClendon, 1978 SEC Player of the Year and running back for the Chicago Bears.\n\nMcClendon is married to the former Amber Arnold of Atlanta. They have three children, Bryan, Brooke and Brayden."}]}
