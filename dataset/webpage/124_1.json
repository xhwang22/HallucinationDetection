After watching that session, Oakland manager Bob Melvin said, \"He wears No. 74, but I swear, when I looked down at [the bullpen] a second time, he was wearing No. 47.\"\n\nSuch is the beauty, and confusion, of ambidexterity. Former journeyman infielder Jim Morrison (1977-88) once called it being \"amphibious,\" which he defined as \"being able to throw underwater.\" Ambidexterity is a strange, fascinating trait that, it seems, is shared more by great athletes, particularly baseball players, than not. Throwing a baseball is a natural, God-given motion; mostly, you can either do it or you can't. But even those who can throw a baseball really well with one arm can't throw at all with the other. But Venditte can.\n\nPat Venditte is still waiting for his first major league appearance after seven years in the minors. Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"I do everything right-handed, but my dad started me throwing a baseball left-handed when I was 3 years old because he thought it would be a good thing for me to have,\" Venditte said.\n\nHe spent seven years in the Yankees' system, reaching as high as Triple-A in 2012 and 2014, and now is with Oakland. He throws 85 mph right-handed and 81 mph left-handed; that's his biggest challenge. But in his first appearance with the A's in a spring training game, he got the final out (the Giants' Justin Maxwell) of one inning throwing right-handed, then got the first out of the next inning (Brandon Belt, strikeout, looking) throwing left-handed.\n\n\"I prepared the umpires for what they were about to see,\" Melvin said when Venditte entered the game. \"I also assured them that he's the only guy we have that throws both ways.\"\n\nBut a handful of pitchers in major league history have thrown with both arms, the first being Tony Mullane, who actually pitched right-handed and left-handed in one game in 1882. In \"The Baseball Encyclopedia,\" Mullane is listed as \"Bats, Both. Throws, Both.\" Jackie Price, the unusual shortstop from the 1940s (he could hit a baseball while hanging upside down), learned to throw a pitch right-handed and left-handed at the same time -- a fastball with one arm, and a curveball with the other. Greg Harris pitched with both arms in a major league game in 1995 with the Expos.\n\nBaseball has always been filled with ambidextrous players. But they weren't just pitchers; they were players who were skilled with both hands. ESPN analyst Mark Mulder, once a terrific left-handed pitcher mostly for the A's, says, \"I write right-handed. Everything I do below my waist, I do right-handed. Don't ask me to explain because I don't know why. I play golf right-handed. I bowl right-handed. If I played hockey, I would shoot right-handed. ... I shoot pool right-handed. I can play tennis with either hand. I played in a charity softball game and I had to pitch, and I had to pitch underhanded, so I pitched right-handed. But since I throw left-handed, I had to switch my glove to my other hand so if a ball was hit back to me, I could catch, then throw it with my left hand. ... I know, I'm completely screwed up.\"\n\nYou think? A pitcher who was one of the best left-handers in the game cannot pitch a softball left-handed because it is an underhand motion?\n\n\"That's the most peculiar form of ambidexterity I've ever heard of,\" said former MLB catcher Ted Simmons, one of the great switch-hitters ever. Peculiar? Mulder is way beyond that.\n\nBrooks Robinson's ambidexterity helped him become a Hall of Fame third baseman. Rogers Photo Archive/Getty images\n\nPeculiar is former pitcher Dave Stieb, who throws and bats right-handed, but shoots a basketball left-handed. Angels outfielder Collin Cowgill throws a baseball left-handed, but shoots a basketball right-handed. Former Brewers pitcher Steve Woodard can shoot a basketball with either hand and, in harmless pickup games, would alternate shots from right-handed to left-handed. And ex-outfielder Jim Dwyer, who batted left-handed, carries left-handed and right-handed clubs in his golf bag because he hits some shots better right-handed than left-handed. Orioles first baseman Chris Davis said he \"isn't sure which way to swing a golf club.\" Mariners first-base coach Andy Van Slyke throws and plays golf right-handed, writes, bats and plays hockey left-handed.\n\n\"I tried to hit a golf ball left-handed, and I whiffed,\" he said. \"It confuses me, especially the hockey and golf thing. Why left-handed one way and the other way right-handed? It's a left-brain, right-brain thing, but for me, it's a no-brain thing.\"\n\nIn terms of handedness, baseball has a lot of screwed-up players. And in that regard, screwed-up is good because it means both hands work well. It also means the hand that goes inside the glove is dexterous, so chances are it will help the player defensively, if not in all ways. The first time I met the great Brooks Robinson, who won 16 Gold Gloves at third base, was at a luncheon in 1979. He ate with his left hand. Later that day, I saw him signing autographs with his left hand. How could this be? How much more right-handed can you get than a right-handed hitting third baseman?\n\n\"I noticed it the first day I met him,\" said Davey Johnson, who played second base for the Orioles when Robinson was the third baseman. \"I looked at Brooks and thought to myself, 'He's the best defensive third baseman of all time, and he writes with his left hand.' So I wrote with my left hand for a year hoping that it would make me a better defensive second baseman. It didn't work.\"\n\nBabe Ruth, the greatest baseball player ever (and a good basketball player), batted and threw left-handed, but wrote and ate right-handed. Hall of Famer Craig Biggio bats and throws right-handed, yet writes and eats left-handed. Ex-outfielder Al Oliver throws and hits left-handed, but plays racquetball (once at a world-class level) right-handed. Former outfielder Lance Johnson bats and throws left-handed, but writes right-handed. Tom House, a former pitcher, throws and bats left-handed, he knocks in a nail and swings a sledgehammer left-handed, but writes, eats and plays pingpong and tennis right-handed. He kicks right-footed, but when doing squats, his left leg is his dominant leg. For movement requiring power, he uses his left hand or foot. For movement requiring finesse, he uses his right.\n\nWhy is this? And why are great athletes more like this than nonathletes?\n\n\"They have a genetic predisposition,\" said House, who has a degree in kinesiology. \"Kids that are gifted athletes have more nerve endings for the brain to program. When the brain says go, more is being accessed. The genetically blessed have more nerves in more muscles, and their brains work very well with the nervous system. Their freeway system has a lot more outlets than nonathletes. And if there's enough repetition of a skill or an exercise at an early age, the athletes can flip-flop -- left to right, right to left -- much more easily.\"\n\nBilly Wagner could throw 100 mph as a left-handed closer, even though he originally threw right-handed. Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n\nFormer closer Billy Wagner used to throw right-handed, but he broke his right arm as a young boy, and was forced to throw a baseball left-handed, which he eventually did at 100 mph. Red Sox third baseman Pablo Sandoval is a natural left-handed thrower, but chose to switch to right-handed as a kid because it allowed him to play more positions. Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett used to throw batting practice left-handed to his teammates on the Royals. Tigers DH Victor Martinez, a right-handed thrower, can throw 75 mph left-handed. So can Indians right-hander Carlos Carrasco. And former major league pitcher John Burkett, a right-hander, is a tremendous bowler. He once bowled 40 games in one day, \"but I got so tired,\" he said, \"I bowled the final 10 games with my left hand.\"\n\nAnd then there are the curious cases of Travis Lee, a former first baseman for several teams, and Tom Foley, a coach for the Rays. Lee throws a baseball left-handed, but in high school, he was a right-handed quarterback. Foley throws right-handed, but in high school, he played quarterback and threw left-handed. How can this be? Throwing a football and throwing a baseball are basically the same motion. When Foley played for the Pirates, teammate Steve Cooke pitched left-handed, but was a right-handed quarterback in high school.\n\n\"I do everything right-handed. The only thing I do left-handed is play baseball,\" Lee said. \"I don't know why. I asked my parents, and they told me when I was a kid, I just picked up a left-hander's glove and started throwing.\" But when Lee picked up a football, he threw it right-handed. \"I can throw a baseball with my right hand, but I can't throw a football left-handed -- all I throw are ducks,\" Lee said. \"In high school, guys would say, 'Roll to your right and throw right-handed; roll to your left and throw left-handed.' But I couldn't do that.\"\n\nLee says he \"just doesn't feel comfortable\" with the glove on his left hand. \"In a perfect world,\" he said, \"I'd catch the ball, take my glove off, switch hands, and throw with my right.\"\n\nFoley is the opposite. \"I'm left-handed, but I bowl, and shoot pool right-handed -- I have no idea why,\" he said. \"My dad was right-handed; he gave me a right-hander's glove, so I threw right-handed.\" Foley can throw a baseball left-handed, also. Can he throw a football right-handed? \"I had to after I separated my [left] shoulder in high school,\" he said. \"I sat out two weeks. Then our other quarterback got hurt, so I had to play, and I played right-handed. I completed four out of seven passes. There were some strange looks on the sidelines.\"\n\nTravis Lee played first base left-handed, but was a right-handed high school quarterback. AP Photo/Mark Duncan\n\nFoley smiled. \"It's weird. If I lost my left hand, I'd be dead. I can't wipe my ass right-handed.\"\n\nLee and Foley are confusing, as is Rickey Henderson, one of the greatest players ever. He bats right-handed, but throws left-handed. Only five nonpitchers since 1900 have played 1,000 games batting right-handed and throwing left-handed: Henderson, Ryan Ludwick, Cody Ross, Cleon Jones and Hal Chase. Former outfielder Mark Carreon is one of only six since 1900 who played at least 500 games that way. Why are these guys so rare, and yet there are hundreds of players who bat left-handed and throw right-handed, like Joe Morgan, George Brett and Carl Yastrzemski? Is it just that there are a lot more right-handed people in the world than lefties?\n\n\"It means I'm using both sides of my brain, which is good ... I think,\" said Carreon, who shares his right-left distinction with former Yale first baseman George Herbert Walker Bush and Eddie Gaedel, the midget who batted once for the 1941 Browns. There are usually only two or three players per year who bat right-handed and throw left-handed, yet there are usually 30 pitchers who are that way, including the Cubs' Travis Wood. Why so many pitchers, and so few position players? Ex-pitcher Terry Mulholland, who was a terrible hitter, says, \"I know I'm a left-handed hitter, but I bat right-handed because I'm the youngest of five boys, and my dad wasn't about to teach the last one how to hit left-handed.\"\n\nNothing is simple when trying to explain the forms of ambidexterity. Most ambidextrous players can't explain it, but they're happy to be that way because it is one reason they are major leaguers. Simmons and House can explain it, but it gets a little cloudy when they talk about right-brain, left-brain function, synapses and kinetic awareness.\n\n\"I have the greatest example ever of ambidexterity; this is way more impressive than any switch-hitter, or anyone who can throw with both hands,\" said Simmons. \"I know a woman; she's a soccer player and a schoolteacher. She can write on the blackboard with her left hand, and write on the desk -- that's two different planes -- with her right hand at the same time. I asked her, 'Can you write in cursive with each hand?' She said, 'Of course I can.' Try that someday. That is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.\"\n\nBut watching Venditte is pretty cool, also.\n\n\"Now I can throw a football with my left hand,\" Venditte said. \"I had never tried before, but throwing something heavier than a baseball can strengthen your arm, so I tried it. I couldn't throw a football at all at first left-handed, but now I can almost throw a good spiral.\""}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/George-Milne-(cricketer)", "page_content": "George Taylor Milne (18 January 1877 \u2013 3 November 1968) was an English cricketer.

We\u2019ve all done it. Some of us who played baseball had our own stance, possibly fashioned after our baseball heroes. Some of us could copy stances, maybe even dozens of them.\n\nEvery ballplayer has their own stance. In a way, like snowflakes, no two are exactly the same. Mike Schmidt used to wiggled his front hip in the batters\u2019 box in what he called \u201chis dance with the pitcher.\u201d Eric Davis wagged his fingers and rotated the bat as he waited for the pitch. Will \u201cThe Thrill\u201d Clark was known for his signature \u201crocking\u201d motion, which was simply a timing mechanism. Tony Batista stood facing the pitcher in an extreme open stance, then he\u2019d swing his arms and the bat toward home plate as if he was placing something on a table. John Wockenfuss did something that\u2019s hard to describe. There were players who liked to shake the bat a lot, like Gary Sheffield and Vlad Guerrero. Batting stances are unique to each hitter.\n\nAnyone who has ever stood in the box to hit in professional baseball has had a batting stance, but most of them have been forgettable. This article is about the history of batting stances and the players who had famous stances.\n\nPut it Right Here: The First Batting Stances\n\nWhat did Cap Anson\u2019s batting stance look like? How about Billy Hamilton or Dan Brouthers?\n\nWe will never know what the stances were like for these 19th century stars, but we can infer some things based on how the game was played back then.\n\nPrior to 1887, a batter could call for a pitch to be either \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow.\u201d The pitcher was required to deliver a pitch somewhere above or below the batters\u2019 waist. As late as 1882 the pitcher could not release a pitch from above his hips. Batters were in a position of strength. In 1876, the year the National League conformed by playing under the same rules, a man named Ross Barnes hit .429. It was the fourth time he\u2019d hit over .400 in six years. There were guys hitting over .400 nearly every year before 1900.\n\nAs a result of rules that favored the batter, hitters didn\u2019t worry about having to make contact. Most of them stood erect in the box and faced the pitcher with both eyes and held their bats near where they wanted a pitch to be placed. Contact was a given, missing a ball was unusual. Walks were extremely rare and not encouraged. At one point it took nine balls for a batter to get a walk. The point was for the batter to put the ball in play. (How refreshing). Even though pitchers were standing much closer to the plate (45 feet in some cases), the rules favored the hitter because pitchers couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t throw the ball hard, and their tosses were meant to be reasonable offerings. Few pitchers could make the baseball curve. It was a batting practice fastball league.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1890s that individualized batting stances became common, after the pitcher was allowed to throw from a uniform elevated mound. The batter no longer had a great advantage and pitchers were becoming sophisticated with their pitching repertoires. The baseball was being thrown harder than ever before: it was moving, dipping and diving. Hitters adjusted their approach and that meant, in part, that they needed to be comfortable.\n\nA few hitters had unusual stances. Cy Seymour, who had a 16-year career that started in 1896, was a known tinkerer. he started as a pitcher but he converted to the outfield in mid-career. Seymour adopted a stance that placed him deep in the box while leaning on his front (right) foot, placing most of his weight on the front leg. It looked awkward, but Seymour won the batting title that way in 1905 when he hit .377 for the Reds.\n\nEd Delahanty, one of the best hitters of the late 19th century, held the bat high and off his back shoulder while spreading his legs wider than most hitters (later Hank Aaron\u2019s stance would be compared to his). Until he tumbled over Niagara Falls after drinking one too many, Big Ed hit for great power and his style was copied by many sluggers.\n\nHands Apart and Feet Together: How Ty Cobb and The Babe Did It\n\nIf there was ever a batting stance that deserved imitation it was the one used by Ty Cobb. He won 12 batting titles with it, and he didn\u2019t change it much at all in the 24 years he spent in the major leagues on his way to a .367 career batting average.\n\nThere were four notable things about Cobb\u2019s stance:\n\n1) He kept his hands very low, below his waist, tilting the bat toward the catcher on a 45 degree angle.\n\n2) He held his hands one to three inches apart on the bat handle.\n\n3) He kept his feet pretty close together.\n\n4) Cobb crouched over at the waist, but did not bend his legs, it was like he was reaching over to get something on the other side of the table.\n\nOnly one of those things was unusual. That\u2019s #4. Most players in Cobb\u2019s era stood up straight. While some historians have made a big deal out of Cobb holding his hands a few inches apart on the bat handle, it was not unusual. Wee Willie Keeler and others had also used the method previously.\n\nCobb\u2019s stance allowed him to do the things he felt were most important. He stood with his feet close together so he could quickly shuffle them into either direction depending on where he wanted to hit the ball. (Ichiro Suzuki later used the same approach with his feet in the batters\u2019 box.) Cobb held his hands low so he could easily get them into position to bunt or slap the ball in any direction. And Cobb bent over so he could position his head closer to the plate, better to see the inside part of the strike zone.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s clarify something: Cobb did not swing the bat with the split-grip. When the Georgia Peach saw a pitch he liked, he would move either his top hand down (to hit for more power) or slide the bottom hand up (to choke on the bat). When he swung the bat, Ty\u2019s hands were together. He had more than 4,000 hits and he didn\u2019t get them by swinging a bat with his hands apart.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a century since Babe Ruth took his first swing in the big leagues. His exploits are legendary. He\u2019s still almost universally considered the greatest baseball player in history. But can anyone tell you what his batting stance was like?\n\nMovies were in their infancy when the Great Bambino stepped on stage as a raw rookie in 1914. And many photographs of The Sultan of Swat show him in poses, facing the camera or following through on an imaginary swing. It was rare for photographers of that era to take photos of players in their normal stances. And the center field TV camera angle of batter vs pitcher we\u2019re so used to know didn\u2019t exist. But we do have a sprinkling of videos of the Babe in his stance, and it was unique to the great slugger.\n\nRuth stood with his feet nearly touching each other and standing at the extreme rear of the batters\u2019 box. Like Cobb, he held the bat low, practically cradling the nob on his belt. A video from the 1932 World Series shows Ruth moving his hands so that the bat seems to be turning, as if he was churning butter. When the pitch arrived, Ruth moved his mammoth frame forward toward the baseball, putting every ounce of his body into his swing. The bat came up slightly and the Yankee slugger followed through with great emphasis. One historian wrote that Ruth\u2019s follow through left his body \u201ctwisted in such contortion that he resembled a human barbers\u2019 pole.\u201d\n\nThis method \u2014 feet close together, hands very low, tremendous weight shift \u2014 clearly worked very well for the Babe. So why didn\u2019t more players try it? The answer is probably talent. A select few did attempt to use the Babe\u2019s stance: teammate Bob Meusel tried it for nearly a full season. He urged Lou Gehrig to try it too, but Gehrig stayed with his preferred stance, in which his feet were spread shoulder width apart and the bat was held far off his back shoulder. Ken Williams of the St. Louis Browns \u2014 like the Babe a left-handed hitter \u2014 used Ruth\u2019s stance for a few years with success, but then returned to his favored style. Mostly though, players did not have the talent to emulate Babe\u2019s power hitting, and after some of them tried and were unable to see great returns, they quickly abandoned it. Maybe they assumed only immortals like Ruth could use such a stance.\n\nMasters of the leg kick\n\nGiants\u2019 outfielder Mel Ott was one of the best players in baseball during a career that spanned from 1926 to 1947. He stepped into the batters\u2019 box for the first time when he was only 17 years old, and he took his last swings when he was 38. In between, \u201cMaster Melvin\u201d hit 511 home runs, winning the National League home run crown six times. He hit four more home runs in the World Series, helping the Giants to a title in 1933 when he clubbed a pair of homers and had seven hits in five games in the Fall Classic. When he retired he ranked first in NL history in homers and third only to Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx all-time. He remains one of the greatest right fielders to ever play the game.\n\nUnlike Foxx and the Babe, Ott was a small man, weighing in at 170 pounds and standing just five foot nine inches tall. On the field, Ott looked like nothing special, and off the diamond he didn\u2019t seem any different than the average man on the street. But his batting stance helped him become one of the greatest hitters in baseball history.\n\nOtt employed a high leg kick to initiate the weight shift needed to produce his power. As the pitcher started his delivery, the left-handed batter would lift his left lead leg off the ground (about eight to twelve inches), then as he swung through the ball his front foot would come back to earth. A weight shift with a slight lifting of the front foot had been done before, of course. It was probably a natural physical response to a pitch coming in at high speeds, an attempt to accentuate a weight shift. In fact, photos exist of Ty Cobb at the plate with his front foot a few inches off the ground. But previous hitters had never lifted their leg as high as Ott. The video below shows Ott taking several swings with his unique leg kick.\n\nWeight shift is one thing, but actually lifting the lead leg and holding it while in a batting stance has been unusual. Ott was famous for it, but few players followed his suit. It took a player thousands of miles from the U.S. to popularize the stance, and when he perfected it, he inspired an entire country to copy his style. Sadaharu Oh was a physical match for Ott, built almost identical, and also a left-handed hitter. Oh used what he called the \u201cflamingo\u201d leg kick, an exaggerated version of Ott\u2019s stance, in which he lifted his front leg high off the ground and curled it close to his back foot. Oh hit 868 home runs in his career, setting a world record. His success was copied by generations of Japanese ballplayers.\n\nOh never played in the U.S., his only cracks at big league pitching came in exhibition home run derbies against Hank Aaron, but in 2001, batting star Ichiro Suzuki became the first Japanese position player to sign a contract in Major League Baseball. Ichiro quickly proved he was worthy, winning the MVP and Rookie of the Year awards. Ichiro employed a stance where he pointed his bat out at the pitcher prior to the pith, pinched his legs close together, and lifted his front leg as he prepared to swing, influenced slightly by Oh. Ichiro eventually compiled more than 3.000 hits in the majors and won two batting titles. In \u201904 he broke the major league record for hits in a season when he piled up an incredible 262. In all, between Japan and the U.S., Ichiro has more than 4,300 hits in his career, more than Pete Rose or any other American ballplayer. Clearly, the unorthodox methods used by Ott, Oh, and Ichiro, all left-handed hitters, didn\u2019t halt their assault on the record books.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning another player who was known for a dramatic leg kick: Darryl Strawberry, who hit more than 300 home runs. Strawberry was known for having one of the prettiest swings in the game, and his leg kick helped him generate his signature power.\n\nStan The Man and The Peek-A-Boo\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine now, more than seven decades after his first major league game, but Stan Musial\u2019s batting stance was revolutionary for his time. The 21-year old debuted with the Cardinals in 1941, and he quickly made a big impact from the left side of the plate.\n\nAla Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth, \u201cStan The Man\u201d kept his feet close together, but he tucked himself back into a closed configuration. His front hip was pulled in, and his front shoulder was closed to the pitcher as much as anyone had ever seen. Musial tucked his neck and head behind the lead shoulder, and as a result it appeared as if he was playing \u201cpeek a boo\u201d with the pitcher. His body looked like a question mark retreating from the mound, coiled and ready to explode into the pitch.\n\nIt worked pretty damn well: Musial won seven batting titles. His success led to imitation: within a few years there were other big league hitters closing their stances, most famously Harvey Kuenn, who won a batting title for Detroit.\n\nMusial\u2019s stance was so famous, and such a part of his image, that for years after he retired, when he appeared in public, Stan would do it for the fans. A statue at Busch Stadium in St. Louis shows the Hall of Famer in his famous batting stance.\n\nTiny Strike Zones\n\nFor decades no one paid much attention to bases on balls. For a while no one kept track of them. A walk was considered a mistake by the pitcher. The batter deserved no credit for it.\n\nBut eventually, a few smart folks inside the game noticed that some players got more walks than others. It wasn\u2019t solely because they were great hitters and were getting pitched around: these hitters were drawing walks because they had a good eye. Or maybe it was something else.\n\nShorter ballplayers naturally have a smaller strike zone. Even if they simply stand straight up, their strike zone (from the shoulders to the top of the knee for most of modern baseball history) will be smaller than a taller man.\n\nA small handful of players stooped to help themselves over the years, most famously catcher Stan Lopata in the 1950s on the advice of Rogers Hornsby. Lopata, who was over six feet tall and looked odd crouching very low, had a mid-career resurgence and started drawing a lot more walks.\n\nLittle fellas like Maxie Bishop and Eddie Stanky drew walks, so that made sense. But there were also taller guys like Elbie Fletcher, Augie Galan, and Tennessee Roy Cullenbine who consistently ranked near the top in walks. What did they have in common?\n\nFletcher, Galan, Cullenbine, and Bishop all employed very low, crouching batting stances. But in their eras, it wasn\u2019t the thing to do, so few players imitated their success. In the 1970s that changed.\n\nRickey Henderson developed his batting stance independent of any outside influence. A smart player, Henderson realized with his speed that if he could get on base he could take control of the game. He worked on hitting from an extreme crouch, leaving very little room for the pitcher to throw a strike. As a result, Rickey walked 2,190 times, setting a record (later topped by Barry Bonds).\n\nWhat was different about Henderson\u2019s stance? It was copied by many other big leaguers, even hitters who were known for their power.\n\nIn 1951 the St. Louis Browns took the tiny batting stance to the extreme when they sent midget Eddie Gaedel to the plate as a pinch-hitter in a game against the Detroit Tigers. Gaedel was only 43 inches tall and he had no intention of swinging his (plastic) bat. He promtly watched four high pitches go by for a walk, retiring with a perfect 1.000 on-base percentage.\n\nThe Great Shrinking Charlie Hustle\n\nPete Rose came into baseball when it was still shaking off the 1950s, an era dominated by the three New York teams. It was an era when newsreels, radio and newspapers began sharing space with TV. The graceful, conservative Hollywood style of Joe DiMaggio was going by the wayside. The 1960s would be about individualism. Rose quickly personified that. Upon witnessing Rose run to first base after a walk, Yankee pitcher Whitey Ford called Pete \u201cCharlie Hustle.\u201d\n\nAs a young Cincinnati Red in the 1960s, Rose\u2019s batting stance reflected the \u201cold times.\u201d He stood fairly straight up with his bat out in front of his chest, ready to whip it through the strike zone. But as the 60\u2019s began to morph into the 1970s, Rose started to clench his stance into a new form, making himself smaller and smaller. He hunched himself down into a \u201cC\u201d in the batters\u2019 box from the left side, with his head peering over his front shoulder, almost Musial-like. When he swung he uncoiled and propelled himself toward the baseline. It was really a sight to see. Rose\u2019s stance was intended to give pitchers a smaller strike zone to throw to, and it gave Rose a short, compact, energy-efficient swing.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Rose\u2019s stance (the \u201cCrouching C\u201d stance that he used during the heyday of the Big Red Machine and for the remainder of his career) is the most imitated in history. Not by big leaguers, but by players at all levels. When I was growing up in Michigan in the 1970s every kid in my neighborhood was able to do the Pete Rose stance. Few tried to hit from it, but everyone could imitate it. Big leaguers could do it too, but no one, other than maybe Mickey Rivers, ever hit like that in the majors.\n\nBecause Rose was a switch-hitter he had to reverse the stance when he was in the right-hand side of the box. I guess we should call it a \u201cParenthesis\u201d stance, since the result is a left parenthesis when Pete was batting left handed and right parenthesis the other way. It worked well: Charlie Hustle had a 44-game hitting streak in 1978 and seven years later he broke Cobb\u2019s all-time hit record, a mark that may never be topped.\n\nCharley Lau and His Disciples\n\nBy the time his book \u201cThe Art of Hitting .300\u201d was published in 1980, Charley Lau had cultivated a cult following that adopted his strategies on hitting a baseball. Most notable was Kansas City third baseman George Brett, who hit .390 the year the book came out, the highest average since Ted Williams in 1941.\n\nLau was a catcher in the Detroit organization in the 1950s when he realized his approach to hitting wasn\u2019t working. He tinkered and tinkered, and finally by 1962 he had developed a philosophy that he would hone for the next two decades until his untimely death from cancer in 1984.\n\nLau came up with nine absolutes of hitting. I won\u2019t list them all here (you can see them on his wikipedia page), but the two most important are: (1) a good weight shift and (2) having the bat in launch position as soon as the front foot touches the ground.\n\nRealizing the importance of these tactics, and aware that he was not physically gifted enough to do them strictly through athletic prowess, in 1962 Lau started using a batting stance that was designed to help him get the bat into the hitting zone quicker. He stood with his feet far apart and the bat off his back shoulder almost flat and perpendicular to the ground. Lau hit .276 for the balance of his career, almost a 100-point improvement over his previous mark. Baltimore hired him as a hitting coach when his playing career ended and Charley started teaching young Orioles his hitting method. But his approach seemed weird to veterans in the organization and he was let go after one year. The A\u2019s tried him for a year until they too got rid of his \u201ccrazy ideas.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Royals accepted Lau\u2019s methods. It took an expansion team desperate for success for Charley to get a shot. Lau convinced Brett, Hal McRae and others in the organization like Al Cowens and Willie Wilson to adopt his methods. Brett was so successful that Lau called him his \u201cFrankenstein Monster.\u201d Brett changed his batting stance late in 1975, leaning far back on his left leg like a \u201cforward slash\u201d. He won his first batting title the following year. He was hitting as high as .400 in the first week of September of 1980. He was a beast in the post-season. He won the MVP award in \u201980 and a third batting title ten years later. He reached 3,000 hits and is one of the greatest third basemen to ever play the game. After the Lau conversion, Brett never again changed his batting stance.\n\nThe Fiddlers: Yaz and Ripken\n\nOf all the great players in baseball history, the two that are best known for tinkering with their batting stances are Carl Yastrzemski and Cal Ripken Jr. Both played a long time (more than 3,000 games each), which gave them lots of trips to the plate to fiddle. As a result, there\u2019s no \u201cdefinitive\u201d Yaz or Cal stance.\n\nEarly in his career, Yaz employed a common stance: feet a little more than shoulder width apart, bat held high and back and well away from his rear left shoulder. He had a slightly closed stance, but not much. Yaz tucked his jaw into his lead right shoulder, something he did his entire career no matter what stance he used. This was the stance Yaz used in 1967 when he won the Triple Crown while leading the Red Sox to the pennant.\n\nThe early 1970s saw Yaz mess with his batting stance almost every spring. By 1974 Yaz settled on an odd stance that saw him leaning dramatically forward on his right leg toward the pitcher. He still held the bat high and away from his body and tucked that jaw into his lead shoulder. By 1983, his final big league season, Yaz had tried several variations, including a very closed stance and a version where he held the bat flatter near his shoulder (perhaps influenced by the teachings of Charley Lau). No matter what he did, Yaz hit: the Hall of Famer retired with more than 3,000 hits and 400 home runs.\n\nNo superstar changed his batting stance as much or as dramatically as Cal Ripken Jr. Noted batting stance imitator Gar Ryness (dubbed \u201cThe Batting Stance Guy\u201d) has cataloged Ripken\u2019s stances, even giving them names. They include \u201cThe DeCinces\u201d, \u201cThe \u201990s Hand Flutter\u201d, \u201cThe 1991 MVP\u201d, \u201cThe Dojo\u201d, and my personal favorite, \u201cThe Violin.\u201d Ripken also notably mimicked other stances, including those of teammate Mickey Tettleton and the bizarre John Wockenfuss contortion stance.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of Ryness doing many of his batting stance imitations:\n\nWhile other stars have changed their stances in mid-career (Pete Rose and Rod Carew come to mind), it\u2019s usually because of some revolution in hitting science. Yastrzemski and Ripken were not afraid to change things up to get out of a slump.\n\nThe Hall of Famer traded because of his batting stance\n\nIn 1990 the Red Sox were trying to win the division title and needed bullpen help. On August 30, the Sox acquired veteran lefthander Larry Andersen from the Astros. The southpaw pitched brilliantly for Boston down the stretch and the Sox edged Toronto for the division crown. The cost of that division title? A Double-A prospect named Jeff Bagwell, the lone player sent to Houston for Andersen. Bagwell went on to a Hall of Fame career for the Astros, and the trade remains one of the most lopsided in history.\n\nWhy did the Sox part with Bagwell? There are several reasons handy: at the time he was a third baseman and Boston had Wade Boggs; they also had a good first baseman in Carlos Quintana, blocking a move of Bagwell to his other position. In many ways it was a knee-jerk reaction by a front office trying to win a World Series. Can\u2019t blame them much for that. But there\u2019s another reason Bagwell was included on a list of players the Astros could choose from: his peculiar batting stance.\n\nBagwell\u2019s stance has been described as a man sitting in a chair waiting for his dinner. The righthanded hitter crouched so low and so dramatically that his backside looked as if he was sitting in a kitchen chair. Yet somehow he maintained balance. At the time of the trade, Bagwell was tearing up the minor leagues, but he wasn\u2019t hitting home runs. Some people in the Red Sox organization predicted he would never hit for enough power to be successful in Fenway Park. Some scouts simply thought his batting stance was too odd to lead to a long career.\n\n\u201cBags\u201d fooled his detractors, winning the Rookie of the Year Award in 1991, and an MVP award three years later. As for the power? He hit as many as 30 homers nine times, retired with 449 home runs, and in 2017 he was elected to the Hall of Fame. He might be the only Hall of Famer to be discarded because he had a funny batting stance.\n\nThe Age of Weird Stuff\n\nThrough the years there have been players with strange batting stances. Dick McAuliffe held the bat very high out in front of and over his head while pointing his lead foot out to the mound. He looked extremely uncomfortable. Milt May stretched the bat two to three feet above his head as he waited in the box, almost as if he was raising a broom to the rafters. In the 1970s, Oscar Gamble stuck his backside out and leaned across the plate, and Mickey Rivers did something similar, tightening his body into a ball, sort of like Pete Rose, with an added bat wag. Joe Morgan was famous for his \u201cflap\u201d where he flexed his rear left elbow as the pitch was being delivered. Morgan used the tactic to remind himself to keep his hands back.\n\nBut the strangest batting stance of the 1970s belonged to John Wockenfuss, a utility player primarily for the Detroit Tigers. A right-handed batter, \u201cFuss\u201d pulled his front left foot in so it was directly in front of his back left foot, as if he were walking a tight rope. He pulled his upper body back in a closed fashion, but that was only part of the strangeness. Wockenfuss also held the bat out in front of his chest with his fingers extended and wiggling, as if playing a flute. When the pitch arrived, he\u2019d pull his arms into hitting position and uncoil his body as he stepped into the baseball. It was so unusual that nearly every time he went to the plate the announcer mentioned it. Fans found it bizarre but imitated it. Wockenfuss hit 86 home runs as a part-time player in his 12-year career, finding exceptional success against lefties.\n\nThe weirdness in batting stances has exploded since the age of Wockenfuss and other random oddballs. Julio Franco emerged in the 1980s with his high extended arms and his method of pointing the barrel of the bat at the pitching mound over his head. Kevin Youkilis used a similar stance years later but added a twist: he separated his hands so his top (right) hand was several inches forward on the bat, making it appear that Youk was tuning a violin.\n\nAaron Rowand used what became called \u201cThe Drunk\u201d \u2014 he stood with his legs extremely far apart and leaned back and to the side awkwardly, looking like he was going to tip over. Johnny Damon\u2019s stance could have been called \u201cThe Shake & Wiggle\u201d because he wiggled his bat behind his head and shook his body back and forth, faster and faster as the pitcher began his delivery. He seemed like a pot on the stove coming to boil.\n\nCraig Counsell may hold the record for the most ugly batting stance in baseball history. Counsell was a middle infielder for 16 years in the National League and he was named MVP of the 2001 NLCS while with the Diamondbacks. But Counsell is remembered by many for his peculiar batting form. Rather than try to explain it, here\u2019s a photo:\n\nTony Batista had an extreme stance, and we\u2019ll share a video here because words don\u2019t do it justice:\n\nCal Ripken Jr. has explained that a \u201cbatting stance is just a starting point\u201d in the entire process of the swing. Some players like to be calm at their starting point, like Cobb standing with his feet together and almost still, while others, like Dave Winfield, liked to move their feet and body (\u201cdancing with the pitcher\u201d) as the pitch was en route. Both approaches worked for getting to the Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/26/archives/about-baseball-mantle-takes-sides-in-dispute-his-lefthanded-hitting.html", "page_content": "Mickey discussed the subject thoroughly a couple of years ago when an injured shoulder made it difficult for him to swing left\u2010handed.\n\n\u201cOne thing would prevent me from changing,\u201d he said, \u201cand that one thing would be enough\u2014the curve ball.\u201d\n\nBatting, after all, is a matter of building a set of reflexes by repetition.

He had a fine First-Class debut as an 18-year-old when he took 4/52 against Canterbury.\n\n\n\nOn the back of his Champions League performances, he was selected to play for the Kiwis against Pakistan in December 2010 and has so far played only a couple of T20Is. He was also named in the 30-man initial probables list for the 2011 World Cup, but didn't make the final cut.\n\n\n\nMilne was frequently hit with injuries during 2011-12, which interrupted his First-Class career to a great deal. However, he hit the headlines again when he was included in New Zealand's squad for the 2012 T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\nMilne, made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2012. After being out of the international circuit for over a year, Milne then, received a surprise recall to the ODI side for the series against Sri Lanka in November 2013. He featured in two ODIs, but his performances were nothing to note about. He played an ODI each against West Indies and India at home, before playing four matches of the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE in December 2014, where he grabbed eyeballs with his ability to consistently bowl at 145-150kph. Impressed by his show, the selectors named him in the squad for the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\n\nAlthough age is on Milne's side, he will have to constantly adapt his style to the changing pitch and conditions, if he needs to survive at the highest level. He needs to work towards maintaining high fitness levels, if he has to retain his place in the national side.\n\n\n\nFive years after making his debut, Milne has played only a handful of ODIs and T20Is because of constant injury. The fast bowler suffered a year of hamstring, side and elbow injuries before returning to franchise cricket with Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2017. After having a decent season in the IPL, Milne was named in the Champions Trophy squad.\n\n\n\nBy Srivathsa"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29020906/tim-kurkjian-baseball-fix-weird-tales-players-throwing-right-handed-left-handed", "page_content": "On April 18, 1950, former president Harry S.

So while we await its return, every day we'll provide you with a story or two tied to this date in baseball history.\n\nON THIS DATE IN 1950, things were ambidextrous, not amphibious.\n\nPresident Harry Truman threw out the ceremonial first ball at the Washington Senators game. He made two throws -- one right-handed and one left-handed.

So I ate and wrote with my left hand for a year to see if it would make me a better second baseman. It didn't.''\n\nJeff Roberson/AP Photo\n\nThird baseman George Brett used to throw batting practice left-handed. Catcher Victor Martinez can throw 75 mph left-handed. Right-handed pitcher Vince Velasquez had his glove knocked off by a line drive in 2018, picked up the ball and threw a strike left-handed to first, which then-Phillies manager Gabe Kapler called \"the greatest play I have ever seen.'' Velasquez in college sometimes played the outfield and threw left-handed when he didn't pitch. Right-hander Greg Harris pitched left-handed in a major league game in 1995; he used a reversible glove. So does switch-pitcher Pat Venditte, who has pitched with both arms in major league games for several years.\n\n\"I watched him throw a bullpen this morning,'' said A's manager Bob Melvin, joking. \"He started off throwing right-handed wearing No. 46.

Tom Foley, a former middle infielder, throws right-handed but played quarterback in high school as a left-hander. He was once teammates on the Pirates with left-handed pitcher Steve Cooke, who played quarterback in high school right-handed. Foley was a coach with the Rays, and the first baseman on that team, Travis Lee, threw a baseball left-handed but played quarterback in high school right-handed.\n\n\"It is weird,'' Foley said.\n\nWeird describes Mark Mulder, once a terrific left-handed pitcher. Everything he does below the waist, as he put it, he does right-handed -- such as bowl or swing a golf club. Everything he does above the waist he does left-handed, such as throw a baseball. He once pitched in a celebrity softball game. Since that motion is underhand, he pitched with his right hand. But when a ball was hit back at him, he would have to switch his glove to his other hand, \u00e0 la Jim Abbott, so he could throw to first base.\n\n\"I'm completely screwed up,'' Mulder said.\n\nBut in baseball, and with presidents, that's good.\n\nOther baseball notes for April 18"}, {"url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/1510-adam-milne-playerprofile", "page_content": "Adam Fraser Milne Profile\n\n\u2018Meteoric\u2019 is the word which aptly sums Adam Milne\u2019s rise to the national side. At 17, the speedster was busy opening the bowling for his school team before earning an unexpected call-up from the Central Districts as Michael Mason\u2019s replacement, who in turn had been called up for national duty for the Kiwis.\n\n\n\nThe Palmerston North-born player impressed on his first-class debut in 2010 against Canterbury, scalping his maiden wicket in only his second ball and finished off the innings with figures of 4-52. His initial performances amazed his club who decided to look beyond his inexperience and included him for the 2010 Champions League T20 held in South Africa. He played two games in the tournament and impressed with his sheer pace. Cricket pundits touted him as the fastest New Zealand bowler after Shane Bond. He clocked speeds in the range of 145-150 kph consistently. His raw talent earned him a place in New Zealand\u2019s squad for the T20I series against Pakistan, where he made his debut. However, he didn't have a good start and after that, injuries disrupted his first-class career.\n\n\n\nMilne once again came into the limelight when he was selected in New Zealand's squad for the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. But, he kept on suffering from injuries and that led the selectors to adopt a cautious approach regarding him. That limited his first-class exposure. He only got a few games on and off for his national side but again grabbed attention during the series against Pakistan in UAE in December 2014, where he troubled the batsmen and hurried them constantly. That caught the fancy of the selectors again as he got named in the squad for the 2015 World Cup. He was the third frontline pacer and fulfilled his duty till the quarter-final. Luck once again did not favour him as his campaign ended due to another injury before the semi-final.\n\n\n\nAdam Milne was picked in the Indian T20 League auction by Bangalore in 2015 but missed the tournament due to fitness issues. He was retained by them in the year 2016 but only got one game. Hamstring, side and elbow injuries kept him away from cricket for a year after which he returned to play for his franchise. The 2017 season saw him play four matches but he didn't make any kind of substantial impact. After that, he featured for the Kiwis in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and fared decently but there was no noteworthy performance. The good thing is that he is young but to survive in international cricket over a long period, the speedster continuously needs to adapt his game to suit different pitches and conditions. Fitness is also a major issue which he needs to address."}], "George Milne's bowling style was right-arm medium-pace.": [{"url": "https://wisden.com/stories/archive/turning-back-the-clock-the-forgotten-and-formidable-art-of-medium-pace-spin", "page_content": "Amol Rajan, the BBC\u2019s media editor and author of Twirlymen, the Unlikely History of Cricket\u2019s Greatest Spin Bowlers, wondered what happened to the forgotten and formidable art of medium-pace spin.\n\nFirst published in 2017\n\nIt is a curious fact that when cricket was first becoming popular in England, in the latter half of the 18th century, all bowlers were either spinners or had great ambitions to be. This was because at the time bowling referred to the action we now associate with ten-pin bowling: rolling the ball along the surface of the earth, from bended knee, as if making a proposal of marriage to the distant batsman. A bowler\u2019s best hope during this, the dawn of the game, was for a mole-hill, fox-hole, or adder enclave to impart deviation and so befuddle the batsman. When, finally, bowlers were allowed to give the ball air \u2013 probably around 1770 \u2013 their under-arm actions couldn\u2019t generate much pace. So they relied on spin.\n\nAll the reports, including those of John Nyren, author of cricket\u2019s first notable work of literature The Young Cricketer\u2019s Tutor, show that the earliest air bowlers, men such as Edward \u2018Lumpy\u2019 Stevens and Lamborn, the \u2018Little Farmer\u2019, used \u2018twist\u2019 to break the ball from off to leg or, more commonly, leg to off. The round-arm and over-arm revolutions were many decades away alas, so bowling was a twirlyman\u2019s task. This pattern continued for so long that, rightly understood, the modern dominance of pace bowling is akin to a decades-long aberration from the norm. The history of mystery didn\u2019t leave much space for pace.\n\nOn July 15, 1822, a maverick named John Willes, who had been pushing the boundaries of the laws of the game for over a decade, bowled a round-arm delivery for Kent against MCC at Lord\u2019s. The umpires called no-ball. Willes threw the ball down in disgust, called for his horse and rode off into the sunset, scarcely playing again, so ostracised was he by cricket\u2019s fraternity. Little did he know that he had planted the seeds of a revolution that would catapult the game into modernity. In 1828, MCC moderated Rule 10 to allow the hand as high as the elbow; in 1835 another change allowed the arm up to shoulder height; in 1845 the benefit of the doubt was declared (as usual) against the bowler; and in 1864, the grand overlords of the game finally succumbed and declared over-arm bowling legal.\n\nBut then a funny thing happened, and kept happening for years. Rather than open the floodgates to a new breed of super-fast bowling tyrant, the dominant form of bowling right up to the interwar period became something the like of which we hardly see in today\u2019s game, to the detriment of fans and players alike. In the late Victorian period, all the most successful bowlers in the game were those who, rather than submit to an illusory need for speed, decided they could have the best of both worlds. They bowled spin, but at medium pace.\n\nIn England, three dominated: WG Grace, AG Steel, and George Lohmann. In Australia, a further three stood out: FR Spofforth, Monty Noble and Hugh Trumble. Each in turn pre-empted the rise, and extraordinary success, of the most complete bowler that ever lived, that cantankerous English rascal Sydney Barnes. He too was a medium-paced spinner. In fact, if you look to see who has the best career averages and best strike-rate in Tests, you\u2019ll alight on Lohmann and Barnes. All of which rather begs a question. If medium-pace spin was so effective, why on earth did it die out?\n\nBefore answering that question, it may be worth establishing the credentials of these bowlers, by focusing briefly on Barnes who, understood in the proper context, is really their apogee. The dashing county player Jack Meyer said Barnes was definitely quicker than Alec Bedser, which seems astonishing. My guess is that, depending on the pitch, Barnes would hit around 70 or even 75 mph. If you\u2019re a club cricketer, that\u2019s probably up there with the fastest you\u2019ve faced. CB Fry said of him that: \u201cIn the matter of pace he may be regarded either as a fast or fast-medium bowler. He certainly bowled faster some days than others; and on his fastest day he was distinctly fast.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, as he brought his arm over, Barnes gave the ball an almighty rip. I\u2019m not talking here about using seam and swing to extract cut from the pitch. I\u2019m talking full-on spin, with a couple of special attributes. That is why John Arlott could say of Barnes: \u201cHe was a right-arm fast-medium bowler with the accuracy, spin and resource of a slow bowler.\u201d Note that Arlott, who always chose his words carefully, describes Barnes not as medium or even medium-fast, but as fast-medium. And that he was a genuine, even prodigious, spinner of the ball is evidenced by Barnes\u2019 account of an extraordinary meeting with Noble.\n\nTwirlymen constitute a special breed within cricket, a fraternity that bestows special privileges on its members, and through the ages spinners have met with each other to pass on the wisdom they have gleaned. Shane Warne and Abdul Qadir once sat across a Persian carpet from each other in the latter\u2019s house in Pakistan, spinning oranges hither and thither. Similarly, Barnes said he once asked Noble, \u201cIf he would care to tell me how he managed to bring the ball back against the swerve\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe said it was possible to put two poles down the wicket, one 10 or 11 yards from the bowling crease and another one five or six yards from the batsman, and to bowl a ball outside the first pole and make it swing to the off-side of the other pole and then nip back and hit the wickets. That\u2019s how I learned to spin a ball and make it swing. It is also possible to bowl in between these two poles, pitch the ball outside leg stump and hit the wicket. I spent hours trying all this out in the nets.\u201d\n\nFor such a fastidious man, Barnes is rather lazy in conflating \u2018swerve\u2019 and \u2018swing\u2019 here. What he means by both is what we today refer to as \u2018drift\u2019: the glorious tendency of a spinning ball to move in the air in the opposite direction to the eventual spin off the wicket. Unlike modern spinners, Barnes\u2019 wrist was slightly cocked back at the point of release, as if he was screwing or unscrewing a light bulb above his head (screwing for the off-break; unscrewing for the leg-break). This, for reasons only a better physicist than I could tell you, compensates in accentuated swerve for what it sacrifices in turn off the wicket.\n\nSo the picture we have of the man (above) who took 189 wickets in just 27 Tests at 16.43, with a wicket every seven overs \u2013 and a record 49 wickets in four Tests against South Africa in 1913/14 (he refused to play the last Test in a dispute over his wife\u2019s hotel fare) \u2013 is of genuine pace and genuine spin combined. He was perhaps quicker, and spun the ball more, than the other swift pioneers of the late Victorian period. But is there any good reason that modern bowlers resolutely refuse to ape Barnes\u2019 astonishingly successful method? My answer is emphatically no.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there has been a conspiracy against spinners throughout the course of the game \u2013 shorter boundaries, limited overs, bigger bats, video replays (which cost them dearly until Hawk-Eye) came in and, above all, covered pitches. The last of these may partly explain the dwindling of the art. But there are three other possible reasons too: first, fashion; second, modern coaching; and third, sheer laziness.\n\nNone of these are forgivable, of course, particularly the needless and harmful conservatism of coaches who insist young players specialise early. Barnes had only three hours of coaching in his entire life. He would scoff at the refusal of fast bowlers to learn the art of spin, and vice versa; and if there is no good reason to keep the two art forms distinct, there must be hope that some brave young bowler could raise the spirit of medium-pace spin from the sporting grave to which it has prematurely been consigned. If he had the wit just to try, and the talent to come into mild success, lovers of the game the world over would be eternally in his debt, for re-acquainting cricket with a once great technique.\n\nSwerve Kings WG Grace Test record: 9 wickets at 26.22\n\nFirst-class record: 2,809 wickets at 18.14 \u2018The Doctor\u2019 may have been more famed for his batting but in his youth, before his hearty appetite and legendary thirst took a toll on his body, he was a crafty and prolific with the ball. Grace started out as a fast bowler but over the course of his career he reduced his pace and focused on subtlety and deception. His skills had waned by the time he made his Test debut at the age of 32 but he still took 240 five-fers and 64 10-wicket match hauls in a career spanning 43 years. George Lohmann Test record: 112 wickets at 10.75\n\nFirst-class record: 1,841 wickets at 13.73 In terms of average and strike-rate, Lohmann ranks as the best bowler Test cricket has ever seen. The England and Surrey right-armer took his 100th Test wicket in his 16th match \u2013 a record that still stands today \u2013 and was the very definition of unplayable on the 1896 tour of South Africa when he took 35 wickets at 5.80. Fred Spofforth Test record: 94 wickets at 18.41\n\nFirst-class record: 853 wickets at 14.95 Regarded by many as the godfather of \u2018swerve\u2019, Spofforth rose to fame by taking 97 wickets at 11 on Australia\u2019s 1878 tour of England. \u201cSpofforth\u2019s no bowler, he\u2019s a hypnotist,\u201d said Notts all-rounder Billy Barnes, an opponent that summer. Known as \u2018The Demon\u2019, Spofforth\u2019s larger-than-life personality made him a folk hero in Australia. He claimed four 10-wicket match hauls in 18 Tests. Sydney Barnes Test record: 189 wickets at 16.43 First-class record: 719 wickets at 17.09 Barnes was a latecomer to international cricket, debuting for England in 1901 at the age 28 after previously focusing on playing club cricket for well-paying amateur sides in the Lancashire League, but quickly built a reputation as the most skilled bowler of his time. He combined seam and spin to devastating effect, taking 24 five-wicket hauls in 27 Tests. \u201cThe wonder of his career is that he took 77 of his 106 Australian Test wickets on the wickets of Australia when they were flawless and the scourge of all ordinarily good bowlers,\u201d wrote Neville Cardus.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Nightwatchman, The Wisden Cricket Quarterly.\n\nFirst published in 2017"}, {"url": "https://cricketershub.com/types-of-fast-bowlers-cricket/", "page_content": "Cricket is a game that features many different types of fast bowlers, and each individual will add their own unique style to that type of bowling. However, there are certain ways in which we group fast bowlers together in order to categorise them and make them easier to tell apart. Some of you who are new to the game, or even some of you who are just researching the game, may want to know what these categories are! So I\u2019ve spent a bit of time putting this list together in order to make it all nice and easy to understand.\n\nFast bowlers in cricket aim to get the batsman out by using the speed of the ball, its movement off the pitch (commonly known as seam movement) or its movement in the air (commonly known as swing) as their primary weapons. They can be split into three main categories, which are as follows:\n\nRight/Left Arm Medium\n\nRight/Left Arm Fast Medium\n\nRight/Left Arm Fast\n\nEach of the categories listed above are used to describe specific characteristics of fast bowlers, but they can often lead to a lot of confusion. What does each term mean? Are there other terms that mean the same thing as the ones listed above? Well\u2026that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go through in this post!\n\nWhat Is A Right/Left Arm Medium Bowler?\n\nA right arm (or left arm) medium bowler is the slowest out of all of the pace bowlers. They\u2019re also commonly referred to as \u2018medium pacers\u2019 and their normal deliveries will often be between 100-120kph (60-75mph).\n\nThe effectiveness of these bowlers often comes down to their ability to use slower balls such as cutters or back of the hand deliveries to trick batsmen during the flight of the ball. They are also often rather good at getting the ball to swing, which is a useful weapon even at this lower pace! Batsmen who have gotten used to facing quicker bowlers during their innings may relax a bit when they see that a medium pacer is coming on to bowl. This may cause them to get too loose with their shots, which is very risky when the ball is swinging. The disadvantage to the type of swing that medium pacers get is that it usually occurs \u2018straight from the hand\u2019. If the ball begins swinging as soon as the bowler releases it, then this is a lot easier for the batsman to anticipate and react to.\n\nIn longer forms of cricket, this type of bowler is not usually a big part of the bowling attack as they\u2019re not great wicket taking options. They will be used primarily when the other faster bowlers need a rest, or just as a change when wickets are hard to come by. They will also often be part-time bowlers. In limited overs matches they are more widely used because a large part of the game is about limiting the other team\u2019s scoring rates. Medium pacers like Scott Styris, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Paul Collingwood and Chris Harris spring to mind as bowlers who were quite tricky for batsmen to play against in limited overs cricket!\n\nWhat Is A Right/Left Arm Fast Medium Bowler?\n\nThe majority of pace bowlers in the professional game fall into the fast medium category. The average speed of their deliveries will usually be somewhere in the range of 120-145kph (75-90mph).\n\nFast medium bowlers are very dangerous, and have many methods they can use to dismiss batsmen. Some of them are able to swing the ball incredibly effectively, and can make the swing occur later than medium pacers. When the ball swings late, it gives the batsman a lot less time to adjust to the change in trajectory and can lead to more edges as well as play and misses. The added pace also leads to these types of bowlers being able to reverse swing the ball, which is one of the deadliest weapons a bowler can possess! (If you\u2019re not sure what reverse swing is, click here to read my explanation post!) Slower balls are more effective when your standard delivery is bowled at higher speeds, and it also makes yorkers and bouncers harder to play! Put simply, they give the batsman a lot more to worry about!\n\nAll teams will have at least one, if not multiple bowlers of this type on their team, and they\u2019re effective in all formats of cricket! In longer forms of the game, fast medium bowlers will look to mainly bowl line and length, and will generally be less willing to go to their variations such as yorkers and slower balls. In limited overs games, fast medium bowlers will use their pace as well as their variations to try to keep the scoring rate to a minimum whilst picking up wickets. Some of my favourite fast medium bowlers over recent years have been guys like Jimmy Anderson, Dale Steyn and Zaheer Khan. The more things a bowler can do, the more I\u2019ll be interested in watching them!\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that sometimes you will see these bowlers being referred to as \u2018fast medium\u2019 and sometimes as \u2018medium fast\u2019. The difference between the two can be a source of a lot of confusion! Some people say that \u2018medium fast\u2019 bowlers are slightly slower than \u2018fast medium\u2019 bowlers and that that is the reason for the difference, but I personally don\u2019t choose to make that distinction. Instead I combine the two and refer to the entire group as fast medium bowlers!\n\nWhat Is A Right/Left Arm Fast Bowler?\n\nA right/left arm fast bowler is the quickest of all of the pace bowlers, capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 145kph (90mph).\n\nThey are the most intimidating bowlers in cricket due to their extreme pace and hostility. The best right/left arm fast bowlers will possess a sharp and accurate bouncer that pushes batsmen back and threatens their bodies, as well as an ability to get the new ball to swing slightly, and the old ball to reverse swing! The increase in pace makes most of their deliveries more dangerous if they\u2019re well directed, and as I mentioned previously, it usually means that the slower balls they bowl are more effective.\n\nThese kinds of bowlers are a lot rarer than fast medium bowlers, and it\u2019s not uncommon for professional cricket teams to have zero players that are capable of bowling at these speeds! The teams that do have them will usually only have one! Longer forms of cricket, they are often most effective when they\u2019re used in short 4-5 over spells where they can maintain their high speeds and effort throughout the spell. Bowling consistently over 145kph requires a lot of energy, so to keep this going throughout a 10 over spell is incredibly tough!\n\nIn limited overs matches, the best right/left arm fast bowlers are primarily used at the beginning and ends of innings, as these are the most crucial periods. They are also sometimes used in the middle overs if the bowling side desperately requires wickets to be taken! For this type of bowler to succeed in limited overs games they need to have impeccable line and length, variations such as the yorker, bouncer and slower ball, and they also need to be mentally strong. Good mental strength certainly helps if you\u2019re getting hit for a lot of runs\u2026which is very possible in the modern game! Some of the best right/left arm fast bowlers I\u2019ve seen over the last decade or so have been guys like Brett Lee, Shoaib Akhtar and Mitchell Johnson! If you want to go even further back than that I\u2019ve always tried to watch a lot of players like Dennis Lillee, Andy Roberts and Michael Holding!\n\nOther Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is A \u2018Seam Bowler\u2019?\n\nThe term \u2018Seam bowler\u2019 is another term that is used to categorise fast bowlers based on their style of bowling. This time, rather than using the speed of the bowlers to segregate them from each other, the term \u2018seam bowler\u2019 is used to refer to fast bowlers who do not aim to get the ball to swing. Instead, they prefer to try to get the ball to deviate when it hits the pitch by landing the ball on its seam! This means that theoretically seam bowlers can fall into any 3 of the categories we\u2019ve already discussed in this post. It just depends how fast they are!\n\nThe seam is the most pronounced part of a cricket ball, so if the bowler can land the ball with the seam tilted slightly (as can be seen in the diagram below) it can cause the ball to shoot off at awkward angles.A ball that hits the pitch and changes direction slightly is almost impossible to react to due to the fact that batsmen have very little time to adjust! As a result, seaming deliveries can often lead to edges or batsmen being bowled our out LBW.\n\nLanding The Ball On The Pitch Like This Can Lead To Seam Movement\n\nYou will see and hear the term \u2018seam bowler\u2019 being used a lot to describe bowlers, whether that be on the internet or live TV broadcasts. Personally, my favourite seam bowler was Glenn McGrath. Known as \u2018The Metronome\u2019, he was famous for being ridiculously accurate, and being able to land the ball wherever he wanted. Because he bowled in such dangerous areas, any seam movement that he got from the pitch was often deadly! Click here and watch his spell against England at Lords from 2005 if you don\u2019t believe me!\n\nWhat Is A \u2018Swing\u2019 Bowler?\n\nLike with seam bowlers, the term \u2018Swing bowler\u2019 is used to further define the characteristics of fast bowlers. Swing bowlers primarily aim to get the ball to move in the air in order to confuse the batsman. They force batsmen to be disciplined in their foot movement as well as their shot selection due to the fact that they can bowl the ball outside off stump and cause it to swing back into the pads, or bowl the ball on an off stump line and then swing it away. Again, a bowler from any of the three categories that I mentioned at the beginning of this post can be a swing bowler! It is just easier for batsmen to play against swing bowlers when they are bowl at a medium pace!\n\nI know I mentioned these two guys before, but arguably the best two swing bowlers of this generation have been Jimmy Anderson and Dale Steyn. Steyn in particular was ferociously quick, more so than Anderson, and his late swing was deadly when the ball was moving at such speed. Anderson has the most wickets ever for a fast bowler, and he is a true master of the swinging ball. He can bowl accurate inswingers and outswingers at will! Swing bowling is a really hard art to master, but if you\u2019d like somewhere to get started, then read my post here so you can learn how to swing a cricket ball!\n\nWhat Are \u2018Cutters\u2019?\n\nThis is another question I see being asked a lot. A cutter is a type of slower ball that requires a change of grip position as you release the ball. There are two types of cutters: The off cutter & the leg cutter.\n\nFor a right arm bowler, an off cutter can be bowled by imparting spin on the ball in a clockwise direction as it is released from the hand. A leg cutter requires the right arm bowler to impart anti-clockwise spin on the ball (Spin is in the opposite direction for left arm bowlers). The change in grip position combined with the spin that is put on the ball results in the ball being bowled at a slower pace compared to the fast bowlers\u2019 usual delivery. Click here if you want to learn everything you need to know about the different slower balls in cricket, including how to bowl them!\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope this post has helped to clarify some of the terms that you\u2019ll see being used with regards to fast bowlers! It\u2019s important to note that other sources may have ever so slightly different definitions, especially when it comes to which speeds of bowlers fall into which category. There is no universal definition that everyone agrees on, but I think the ones I\u2019ve given you in this post are incredibly concise and easy to follow!

Spectators love to see the ball being hit out of the park and batsmen scoring big runs. As a result, with time the rules have been bent in the batsmen's favour. Moreover, the pitches have become more batsmen friendly. Lives of bowlers have become tougher and this has demanded the bowlers to become versatile.\n\nBowlers are often classified in mainly two categories - Pacers and spinners. Bowlers are included in the team considering their bowling style and whether their style of bowling will be suitable on a particular pitch or not. However, there is this rare category of players who have been able to bowl both spin and pace.\n\nPlayers like Zaheer Khan, Sohail Tanvir, Manoj Prabhakar have occasionally bowled spin at a few occasions but some players have done it more regularly. These bowlers are a blessing for the captain as it provides him with more options. We will look at 4 players who have bowled both spin and pace in international cricket.\n\n#4 Colin Miller\n\nColin Miller sporting a blue hair colour\n\nColin Miller was an Australian bowler who played 18 Tests for his country from 1998 to 2001. Miller had this unique ability to bowl both spin and pace. While he bowled medium pace in Tests in Australia, he turned an off-spinner in subcontinent conditions. The Victorian made his debut for Australia at the age of 34 and retired in 2001. He took 69 Test wickets and was fairly successful on the International stage.\n\nIndian fans will remember Miller for his spell of 3-41 that threatened to take the match away from the Indians in the last innings of the famous Chennai Test in the 2001Test series.\n\n#3 Andrew Symonds\n\nAndrew Symonds was a more than useful bowler\n\nAndrew Symonds made headlines during his career for reasons more than one. Even though he was involved in a lot of on-field and off-field controversies, Symonds was an extremely talented cricketer. Known more for his hard-hitting batting, the Australian was also a more than useful bowler and bowled some match-winning spells for his team.\n\nOne of the main features of Symonds' bowling was his ability to bowl both spin and medium pace bowling. While in the early part of his career he bowled medium pace bowling, the all-rounder turned into an off-break bowler later. Symonds took 165 international wickets.\n\n#2 Sir Garfield Sobers\n\nSobers is regarded as the best all-rounder of his era\n\nSir Garfield Sobers is one of the all-time greats of the game. There were very few things that the legendary West Indies player couldn't do. He scored 8032 runs at an outstanding average of 57.78. Sobers' 365 not out against Pakistan in 1958 was the highest individual Test score until Brian Lara scored 375 in 1994.\n\nSobers originally started playing cricket as a bowler. He took 235 wickets in his Test career. The all-rounder bowled left-arm fast medium as well as slow left-arm orthodox to good effect. He wasn't afraid of trying out new things as he also bowled chinaman quite a few times in his international career.\n\n#1 Sachin Tendulkar\n\nTendulkar did not shy away from trying different things with the ball\n\nIt is not a hidden fact that Sachin Tendulkar aspired to be fast bowler when he started his career. While he eventually became a top-class batsman, Sachin did bowl medium pacers, especially in the initial part of his career. During the 1992 World Cup he bowled seam-ups regularly. The Master Blaster later tried his hand at off-spin and leg-spin bowling. In the later stages of his career, he predominantly became a leg spinner.\n\nSachin bowled according to pitch conditions and match situations. He was often used by the captains as a fifth bowler. The batting maestro has 201 international wickets to his name. Sachin has won a lot of matches for India with his bowling too.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.cricbuzz.com/profiles/3860/manoj-prabhakar", "page_content": "\n\nFull profile A useful bat lower down the order, Manoj Prabhakar was a right-arm medium pace bowler for India who made his ODI debut at Sharjah in April 1984 against Sri Lanka.

He made his impact immediately as he ended up with match figures of 10-3-16-2. He was more a line and length bowler who used to contain the flow of runs than an attacking option for his captain. He bagged 4 wickets for 19 runs against Zimbabwe at Mumbai in 1987, his best bowling figures then, before bettering it with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand at Amritsar in 1995. He last played an ODI in 1996 having featured in 130 games with 157 wickets at an impressive economy rate of 4.27. Prabhakar, the batsman, had a wonderful time at the fag end of his career when he made all his 11 fifties in a space of two years. He also had a couple of centuries to his credit.\n\n\n\nPrabhakar was included in the Test squad for the England series at home and he made his debut at his home ground, Feroz Shah Kotla. However, he was not selected again for a while and he returned to the Test team for India's tour of Pakistan in 1989. In the first Test match of the series at Karachi in 1989, which was also Sachin Tendulkar's debut match, Prabhakar bagged his maiden fifer before going one step further in the next Test at Faisalabad to claim 6 wickets in an innings. Since then he was a certainty in the side. He bagged his third fifer in Tests against Australia at Perth in 1992. The third Test against New Zealand at Cuttack in 1995 was his last appearance in the longest format of the game. His most noted performance with the bat came against West Indies in 1990 at Mohali when he scored his only century in Tests. He also made nine fifties.\n\n\n\nHe represented Delhi in first-class cricket and played over 150 games making 7469 runs with a highest of 229 alongside 385 wickets. He also flew to England and played for Durham in their domestic circuit.\n\n\n\nAfter the 1996 World Cup, Prabhakar was dropped for India's England tour, to which the fast bowler voiced strongly against the then captain Mohammad Azharuddin and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). He also went on to accuse Azharuddin of match-fixing. He participated in Tehelka's sting operation of match-fixing in 1999 but was himself charged with involvement and was later banned by the BCCI. The controversy brought an end to an international career that spanned across 39 Tests and 130 ODIs."}, {"url": "https://theswagsports.com/top-10/6-bowlers-who-bowled-both-pace-and-spin-in-international/cid5680100.htm", "page_content": "Bowling is an art in cricket. Not everyone can master this art. Great players of the game like Lasith Malinga, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Kapil Dev, Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath, Shaun Pollock, Shane Bond and several others achieved mastery in pace bowling. At the same time, the likes of Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralitharan, Saqlain Mushtaq, Daniel Vettori and other bowlers were excellent as spin bowlers.\n\nHowever, there have been some bowlers who have bowled both pace and spin in international cricket. In this article today, we will look at six such bowlers:\n\n1. Andrew Symonds\n\nFormer Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds was a right-arm bowler. In some matches, Symonds bowled right-arm medium pace, while on some occasions, he bowled right-arm off-breaks. Overall, he took 165 wickets in his international career.\n\n2. Garry Sobers\n\nSir Garry Sobers had three bowling styles. He owns the record for the most wickets by a bowler who can bowl with different styles. Sobers took 236 international wickets for West Indies by bowling left-arm pace, left-arm wrist spin and slow left-arm.\n\n3.

From WG Grace\u2019s \u201cThey\u2019ve come to see me bat, not you bowl,\u201d cricket has always been, and continues to be, firmly in favour of the batsmen.\n\nNowadays, with the advent of field restrictions, massive bats and tiny boundaries, batsmen have found innovative ways to use the rules to their advantage. Through pioneers such as Eoin Morgan, AB de Villiers and Colin Munro, we see a new approach to batting \u2013 360\u00b0 scoring. A yorker, the traditional, \u201cperfect death bowling ball\u201d can now be hit over the wicketkeeper\u2019s head by a batsman standing outside his off stump.\n\nIt\u2019s high time bowlers start thinking outside the box, before they become glorified bowling machines. The solution will not be found looking into the future, but instead, into the past. Cricket, somewhere along the way, lost a type of bowling that was once a staple of the game. Medium-paced spin.\n\nWhat exactly is medium-paced spin?\n\nThis is not to be confused with off-cutters and leg-cutters. This isn\u2019t just running the fingers over the ball, this is full blown spin. Pace bowling with a rip. It comes at the batsman at 110-125 kph, drifts in like a leg-break and then spins away at pace. Absolutely 100% unplayable.\n\nThe fast spinner was an absolute essential in the weaponry of the 19th and early 20th-century bowler when overarm bowling was first allowed. Bowlers tried to get the best of both worlds, bowling pacy deliveries that spun both ways.\n\nBowlers like George Lohmann, Fred Spofforth, AG Steel, WG Grace, Hugh Trumble and Monty Noble, some of whom had scarcely believable averages and strike rates, developed this art and unleashed it on batsmen on occasion. But it was Sydney Barnes who made it his stock delivery for the middle overs.\n\nSydney Barnes brought medium-paced spin to the world\n\nA captain\u2019s worst nightmare is when the pitch isn\u2019t spinning or seaming. Most go defensive, drying up the runs until the ball begins to reverse. However, this was not the case when Barnes was around. He terrorised batsmen by producing pace, bounce and spin, effectively taking the pitch out of the equation. He perfected an art that could well be the next frontier for bowlers.\n\nWith the advent of T20 cricket, finger spinners bowling consistently over 100kph is not uncommon, and the recently concluded IPL saw just that.\n\nSo who uses medium-paced spin today?\n\nBowlers like Washington Sundar and Imad Wasim, who bowl in consistently good areas with little variation other than in pace, have been gradually increasing their speed to \u2018medium-pace\u2019 levels and their effectiveness can be seen on turning tracks.\n\nLeg-spinners, too, are following suit, and in recent times wrist-spinners have focused less on their flight and drift and more on darting the ball in as fast as possible. While Kumble and Afridi used this very successfully in international cricket in the early 2000s, Rashid Khan\u2019s unique style of bowling is the one that is most similar to Barnes\u2019 at the top level. Hitting the high 90s, he spins the ball both ways, bringing his arm through rapidly.\n\nAnother type of modern medium-paced spinner is a bowler who receives the \u2018mystery spinner\u2019 tag. Sunil Narine and Ajantha Mendis befuddled batsmen in their day with a simple technique. They held the ball seam up and gave it a flick with the wrist, either forwards or backwards, at the point of release to make it spin in the direction they wanted.\n\nThis is very similar to the method Barnes used to put revs on the ball. However, the most successful exponent of medium-paced spin is Mustafizur Rahman, whose deadly \u2018cutter\u2019 gained international acclaim. However, in actuality, this is conventional off-spin, just bowled by a medium pacer. Rahman gives the ball a rip, thereby applying the overspin that creates the bounce he is famous for.\n\nWhy they are effective\n\nRashid has been extremely effective for Afghanistan\n\nThe reason for the success of medium paced spin is that it makes batsmen play spinners as they would fast bowlers. Batsmen cannot defend all the way in front, or use shots like the sweep and lap shot. Medium-paced spin is also effective to wrest control in the middle overs, when the batsmen thrive.\n\nOften, on subcontinental pitches, fast bowlers are used in a holding capacity in Test matches, to wear out a pitch till the spinners can come in and wreak havoc. The medium-pace spinner turns that dynamic on its head. In the shorter formats, this type of bowler will often induce the outside edge and cause batsmen to mis-hit the ball.\n\nWhile cutters only cause a small deviation, medium pace spin forces batsmen to play for the spin, which makes batting exponentially tougher. Furthermore, medium-spin bowlers often use a quicker one, a delivery 10-15kph faster than the stock, spinning ball, and can take a batsman completely by surprise.\n\nMustafizur used this effectively with his yorkers in the 2016 IPL. It is no surprise that on spinning, slow wickets, quick spinners would be effective. One does not need to look further than Kumble in one of his classic spells, or Rashid Khan\u2019s demolition of the West Indies a few days ago, for proof.\n\nShane Warne said time and again that \u201cif it [a pitch] seams, it spins\u201d and it cannot be emphasised enough how effective a medium-paced spinner would be on a seaming wicket, making the ball deviate too much to play, and drift in too much to leave.\n\nWhy we don\u2019t see more medium-paced spinners around today\n\nGiven the effectiveness of quick spin, it is surprising that cricket has not seen more of it, especially on dry pitches. However, a focus on bowlers that could make the ball swing a long way, and bowl consistently over 135 kph wiped out the very notion of the next Sydney Barnes.\n\nFurthermore, coaching academies that abide by the book often crush innovative actions before they have time to mature. It remains to be seen what the effect of the action is on the body; it is not surprising that it puts great strain on the arm and shoulder muscles and Mustafizur, the closest embodiment of the medium-paced spinner, has already suffered a major shoulder injury, possibly due to his unique action.\n\nHowever, given that he and Rashid Khan have both now gotten mass media attention, it is only a matter of time before spinners begin to get faster and pacers start to flick their wrists when bowling cutters.\n\nEvery few decades, sports go through watershed moments. One player or one team tries something innovative, which makes it the industry standard. Cricket has stumbled on many in its day, and perhaps the medium-paced spinner is next. It checks all the boxes.\n\nTeams are searching for bowlers who can take pace off the ball, making it difficult to hit. More and more bowlers are speaking about the importance of variety for success in the shorter formats, and medium-paced spin counters the white ball\u2019s surprising lack of swing in recent times by replacing it with drift.\n\nMedium-paced spin is not a novelty item to be used by one Bangladeshi a few times before it fades into obscurity, but it is a cure for the runs disease plaguing the game and in the years to come, it will be the new, old, normal.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/australian-batter-marnus-labuschagne-stuns-cricket-fans-bowls-medium-pace-in-country-cricket-watch-article-90862915", "page_content": "Marnus Labushagne stunned the cricket world by bowling medium pace |Courtesy screengrab\n\nSubscribe to Notifications\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS Marnus Labuschagne stunned the cricketing world in a country game\n\nLabuschagne is playing for Glamorgan\n\nLabuschagne was seen bowling medium pace\n\nMarnus Labuschagne left the cricket community in shock on Thursday during a county cricket game between Glamorgan and Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. The Australian batter who is widely regarded as one of the finest batters in world was seen bowling medium pace in the division two game.\n\nWhile cricket fans are well in aware of Labuschagne 's bowling abilities and have seen him bowl for Australia on multiple occasions, it was his style of bowling the county game that got the cricket world talking. Labuschagne, who is regarded as an off-spinner, was seen bowling medium pace in the four-day game.\n\nWith most avid followers of the game seeing Labuschagne bowl medium pace for the first time, it caught them by surprise. Glamorgan's decision to give the Australian batter the ball and his change in bowling style paid dividends as he took two wickets for his side. This included the dismissal of Ben Duckett , who was batting on 122 and also wicket-keeper batter Tom Moores who scored just 4 runs.\n\nSee video here\n\nAlthough he impressed with the ball, Marnus fell short with the bat and managed to make just three runs. In his first outing with the bat in the 2022 county season, the talisman Australian batter was trapped LBW by right-arm pacer Brett Hutton. Earlier in the game, hosts Nottinghamshire put up a massive total of 302 on the board after Glamorgan won the toss and chose to bowl first.\n\nTalking about Labuschagne, he has 13 Test wickets to his name in his 26 match Test career so far. While all of them have come bowling spin, it will be interesting see if he decided to use his medium pace skillset in international cricket too in the future.\n\nThe Australian Test side recently created history by winning a Test series Pakistan soil.

He followed this up with two County matches in the 1876 season. In 1877 Hay was playing professionally for Eland and played just one first-class match for Derbyshire in the 1875 season, scoring 31 not out, the highest score of his career thus far. Hay was back with Derbyshire in the 1878 season, still beating Hickton to the mantle of second-choice bowler, though now he had to shake competition off from John Platts, in the same position. Though he never played as often as he did during the 1878 season on any further occasions, Hay\"s round-arm bowling was at times preferred to John Platts\" occasional deceptively-layered pace. In the 1879 season Hay put in fewer games for Derbyshire as he was playing for Keighley. In the 1880 season, Derbyshire\"s first match of the season was against the touring Australians, fresh in their existence as a Test nation and with several young players at their disposal. The Derbyshire bowling pair of Mycroft and Hay dealt soundly with the Australians, but then the same treatment was dealt to the Derbyshire team in a second-innings eight-wicket haul by Fred Spofforth. Hay appeared in eight county matches for the team during 1880, scoring more runs in this season than in any other of his career. The 1881 season was nearly as successful a season, Hay playing in six county matches, Derbyshire winning two. From here on, Hay was on the playing staff of Master Control Console where he played matches against minor counties, while still putting in five games for Derbyshire over the next five years. His two final first-class matches were in teams made up of a variety of players from all the major cricketing counties. Hay was a right-arm round-arm fast-medium bowler and took 148 first-class wickets at an average of 16.51 and a best performance of 6\u201316. He was a right-handed batsman and played 94 innings in 55 first class matches with a top score of 49 and an average of 8.57. Hay umpired one first-class game in 1884 and after his retirement from playing, he took charge of nearly 70 first-class matches between 1887 and 1897, including several in the early years of the County Championship with a finalsingle game in 1902. Hay also played football, and was a goalkeeper for Staveley F.C., then an important club Hay died at Staveley at the age of 52."}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/a/A13530179", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Milne-203", "page_content": "Is George your ancestor?
