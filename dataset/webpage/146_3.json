She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).\n\nSara Montiel attending the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Week in 1956.\n\nHollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain.

The artist, who started acting at age 16, appeared in about fifty films and recorded nearly 500 songs.\n\n\"Sara was a woman who did what she wanted. Nobody could with beat her: neither Mexico, nor the United States nor the Franco regime [in Spain],\" says Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada, a Spanish professor at Drexel University and a friend of Montiel during her last years of life.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada refers to the indomitable character of the Iberian superstar. To fully understand and value Montiel\u2019s legacy,he says, her career must be viewed in terms of its four key stages.\n\nThe first was as a novice actress in the Spain of the 1940s, an impoverished country that had taken a step back in women\u2019s civil rights under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.\n\nAccording to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, Montiel was ahead of her time, a post-war woman who had to fight to be a protagonist in a society that had relegated her to play the role the Catholic Church commanded: a good mother, a good wife, a good housewife.\n\nMontiel managed to make 14 films in Spain before age 21, barely knowing how to read and write. To professor Rol\u00f3n-Barada, \"the lack of academic training can explain why Sara didn\u2019t have an automatic success during that first phase. She was very young and very weak facing seasoned actresses like Imperio Argentina or Amparo Rivelles.\u201d\n\nThe second moment of her career began in 1950, when the actress and her mother moved to Mexico in search of better opportunities. Mexico was the mecca of the Latin American film industry and was in the middle of its golden age.\n\nThere, Montiel got in touch with a circle of exiled Spanish intellectuals and improved her literacy skills with the help of poet Le\u00f3n Felipe.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada affirms that it is in Mexico where Sara's innate talent fused with her good luck \u2014 \u201can incredible luck because there she gets to work directly with Pedro Infante, who is at the peak of his career, and with Agust\u00edn Lara, the number one composer of Latin American music.\"\n\nNext to Infante, Montiel starred in films like Necesito Dinero, Ah\u00ed viene Mart\u00edn Corona (Little Love of my Life), and El Enamorado (all in 1952). \"She represented a challenge \u2014 she was the woman who broke the molds of that time and challenged her husband, a challenge to the Mexican \u201cmacho\u201d and the Hispanic male,\" says the professor.\n\nIn Mexico, she learned and evolved until she starred in Piel Canela (1953), a role that was made for her and film made to fit her and that leveraged Sara towards what would be, according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada, the third stage of her career: Hollywood.\n\n\"She does not go to Hollywood to look for a job or to knock on doors, but Hollywood comes to her to offer her contracts,\" he affirmed.\n\nMontiel debuted without knowing English in American film industry in 1954, playing the role of Nina in Vera Cruz, a western starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. The film was followed by blockbusters such as Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nIt was in the mecca of American film industry \u2013and consolidated as a world star\u2013 when Montiel's career began to stagnate.\n\n\"She fell into the same problem that many others experienced: she had two possibilities, she was being offered roles as Mexican or as American Indian,\" says Rol\u00f3n-Barada. \u201cBecause that stereotype existed, once they labeled her that way, they continued to see her as only that.\"\n\nSeven years after having left her mother country, Montiel returned to Spain and it was at that time \u2014the fourth stage in her career \u2014that the artist established herself as one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain.\n\nThere, she starred in El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 (The Last Torch Song, 1957), a film that according to Rol\u00f3n-Barada \"changed her life because[with it] she achieves total success with a minimal budget and [also] brings back the musical, a genre from the 1920s.\u201d\n\nEl \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 was followed by blockbusters like La Violetera (1958), Mi \u00daltimo Tango (1960), La Bella Lola (1962), White House Nights (1963) and La Mujer Perdida (1966).\n\nA life to discover\n\nSara Montiel died in Madrid on April 8, 2013, at 85 years of age and with a public life known A to Z by her followers and the media.\n\nHowever, three years ago a biography that promises to \"reveal the hardest and difficult aspects of life that she had to face in order to become Sara Montiel,\" began to be \u201ccooked over a slow fire\u201d in Philadelphia, where Dr. Israel Rol\u00f3n-Barada lives and teaches. Rol\u00f3n-Barada was an admirer of Sara during his adolescence, a friend of the superstar during her last years of life, and has now become her biographer.\n\nThe goal of the book, with a preliminary title of \"The Cost of Being Sara Montiel,\u201d is in the author\u2019s words \"to explain her real life trajectory: we all know how beautiful she was, the immense volume of her cinematographic and musical legacy, but we don\u2019t know the difficulties and very hard things that this woman had to go through to achieve her goal of being a professional actress.\"\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada recalls that his interest in Sara began very early in his life during his teenage years in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, every day after school, he went with almost religious discipline to the daily appointment he had with Hispanic cinema at his house.\n\nThe TV show was called \u201cCine de la tarde con Pilar Arenas,\u201d broadcasted on Channel 2.\n\n\"We used to watch the movies and then the next day we commented and sang the songs. That's how my admiration for Sara Montiel began,\" Rol\u00f3n-Barada remembers.\n\nIn 2001, while doing a Ph.D. in M\u00e1laga, Spain, he met her in person during a presentation and signing of her autobiography, Memorias, Vivir es un Placer.\n\nIn 2011, the Modern Language Association of America organized its annual conference in Seattle, which included- a panel called \u201cFrom Conchita Piquer to Isabel Pantoja: Divas and the Spanish Cultural Imaginary.\u201d\n\nBefore the panel, Rol\u00f3n-Barada managed a two-day interview with Sara Montiel on the island of Tabarca, a situation that, according to the professor, amused the diva because it came only 48 hours after their first talk on the phone, after which Rol\u00f3n-Barada flew from Philadelphia to Spain to meet her in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRol\u00f3n-Barada says that this biography differs from others that have come out about Montiel because his approach to documenting her life is as an academic and cultural historian, resulting in a tone and content distinct from the commercial or sensationalist elements of other publications.\n\nFor now, the professor needs to work on a couple of details and conduct a few additional interviews in Mexico and Spain before finishing his version of Montiel's life, which he expects to publish at the beginning of next spring."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Sara_Montiel", "page_content": "What we do.

She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular.[4] She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen[5] in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944,[6] immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944.[7] [8] They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).[9] Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself.[10] The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years,[11] being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film.[12] The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films,[13] which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film.[14] The success of The Violet Seller surpassed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved on her benefit.[15] She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the 10% of the records sale as royalties.[16] The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.[17]\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar.[18] Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, but many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each film,[19] and the press widely spread it, but this amount is far from what was published back then. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.[20] [21] [22]\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the title track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film title is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\"[23] She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\"[24] She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"[25]\n\nPersonal information\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a talent contest at age fifteen.[26] In her first movie, she was credited as \"Mar\u00eda Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film, she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in La Mancha region of her birth.

Later she conquered Mexico starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling after and she was introduced to US moviegoers in the film 'Vera Cruz' (1954) co-starring with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster and directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures which she quickly refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she free-lanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in 'Serenade' (1956) directed by Anthony Mann and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's 'Run of the arrow' (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson.\n\nThat same year she married Anthony Mann but returned briefly to Spain to star in a low budget film musical 'El ultimo cupl\u00e9' as a favor to producer-director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a who had helped her career in the early days. In the movie she was the first woman to display a low cleavage openly in Spanish cinema at a time when even a low cut dress was not acceptable. The cover for the album of the same title was censored. This film made her unexpectedly the number one actress-singer of that year in Europe and Latin America and she accepted a multi-million dollar offer for more films and recordings in Europe. Fifteen films followed her Cupl\u00e9 success, including 'La violetera' (1958), 'Mi ultimo tango' (1960), 'Noches de Casablanca' (a 1963 tribute to Hollywood's 'Casablanca'), 'Esa mujer' (1969) and 'Variet\u00e9s' (1971). Her films 'El ultimo cuple' and 'La violetera' netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 50s and 60s.\n\nMost of the movies were accompanied by a soundtrack album which also pushed her career as a singer. During these years she recorded over 30 albums and appeared on stage and television all over the world. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies and continued non-stop performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. She continued at that pace well into the 1990s. In 2000 she released her autobiography Memories: 'To live is a pleasure' followed by a second book called 'Sara and sex', which highlighted her love life. In 2005 Montiel was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' by actor Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as the character Zahara. In 2006 Montiel temporarily put aside her career in order to help her adopted son Zeus with his first recordings. Sarita died at the age of 85 on april 8, 2013.\n\nOn the web:\n\n- http://infomontiel.tripod.com/id17.htm\n\n- http://www.visitingsaramontiel.com\n\nIf you like this, you probably like... / european counterparts:\n\n\n\nWhat do we think:\n\nPR: Sarita Montiel is more actress than singer. But with an oeuvre of more than 30 albums since the late fifties, she is definitely one of Spain's most popular musical artists of the 20th century. And - whatever you may think of her - she still succeeds in claiming a spot in the limelights with her writings. Her material is mostly very traditional Hollywood-with-Spanish-lyrics and her singing is not tremendous. On the other hand, she sung a few beautiful songs that became international classics ('La violetra'). Her latest releases (eigthies & nineties) are over-the-top synthesiser disco albums, probably recorded for the gay-disco's and her die-hard fans.\n\nDB: Everyone who has seen Almodov\u00e1r's 'La mala educaci\u00f3n' will remember transvestite Sahara miming a warmblooded song in the microphone. Well, i do, and it was my first encounter with the music of Sarita, the singer Sahara is impersonating. While in Barcelona I tried to find as much of her orginal material i could lay my hands on including an autographed copy of Ulitmo Cuple (no, not the one with the revealing cover). Sarita made some great music but maybe suffers from some over confidence.

As La Vanguardia newspaper put it in its obituary, \"In an era of black shawls and hard bread, she kept us in touch with the times.\"\n\nMontiel's fame in Spain reached the point where for over two decades her plunging necklines, richly erotic deep voice and sensual singing of cupl\u00e9s \u2013 a type of popular, often romantic song \u2013 in a series of otherwise forgettable movies acted as a kind of pressure valve for censor-bound Spanish society.\n\nEl \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 (\"The Last Cupl\u00e9\", 1957), a low-budget film which combined cupl\u00e9s with the classic contemporary Spanish movie format (femme fatale plus willing-to-be-seduced bullfighter plus bullfighter's morally pure bride-to-be, equals sweeping melodrama) was the biggest of her box-office smashes. Its title song, \"Fumando Espero\" (\"I wait whilst smoking\"), recorded in a voice that the producer insisted Montiel made so husky and low she protested she would end up sitting underneath the piano, remained a major hit for years afterwards.\n\nBut as much as what she did or how she looked, what fascinated Spaniards was who she knew \u2013 which in 1950s Hollywood was just about everybody. In the last photo of a living James Dean, he is next to Montiel, both of them laughing. Friends included Elizabeth Taylor, Billie Holiday and Brando.\n\nHer list of lovers, affairs and broken hearts stretched from Dean (whose fatal car crash happened after \"an afternoon of love\" with her, or so she claimed), to playwright Miguel Mihura, Indalecio Prieto, one of the top ministers in the former Spanish Republic, and even the 1959 Nobel Prize-winning biologist, Severo Ochoa. (Montiel described him as \"the great love of my life... but him researching all day and me making films all day just didn't match.\")\n\nFor ordinary Spaniards, another appealing side of Montiel was her working-class background. Montiel was born and brought up in Campo de Criptana, a tiny town on the empty plains of central Castille, before moving to the Valencian coast as a teenager. Her father's income was so meagre as a field worker, she later claimed that she would dig up roots to eat. (If this recalls Scarlet O'Hara grubbing for potatoes in Gone with the Wind, then it would not be the first or last time that fact and fiction blurred in her life.)\n\nDiscovered when singing a religious song by film producer Vicente Casanova in 1944, aged 15, her first film was Te Quiero Para M\u00ed (\"I Want You for Me\"). Six years and 14 films later, including successes like Locura de Amor (\"The Madness of Love\", 1948), she started working in Mexico, performing mostly singing roles. Piel Canela (1953), in which she played a gangster's moll in a Havana nightclub, saw her shoot up the ladder to Hollywood's top circle of film stars, despite not speaking a word of English \u2013 the first Spanish actress ever to do so.\n\nTogether with Gary Cooper (with whom she had a much-publicised romance) she took part in the Western Vera Cruz (1954) and then, while playing a secondary role in Joan Fontaine's Serenade, she met and fell in love with Anthony Mann. Their wedding, as it was a civil one, was downplayed in Franco's Spain, as was the divorce in 1961 \u2013 in stark contrast to when she married Spanish businessman Jose Vicente Ramirez in 1964 in a massive Catholic church ceremony. (The fact that it only lasted a couple of months before they separated was discreetly ignored).\n\nBy then, her cachet as a sex symbol had mushroomed thanks to El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9, which kicked off a series of films \u2013 La Bella Lola (\"Beautiful Lola\", 1962), Noches De Casablanca (\"Casablanca Nights\", 1963), La Dama de Beirut (\"The Lady of Beirut\", 1965) \u2013 which, if unremarkable in their content, gave Montiel a vast following of fans in Spain.\n\nThe end of the dictatorship in 1975, though, meant that her appeal suddenly shrank; but Montiel made the perfect sideways move. She began a seemingly interminable series of TV chat show appearances, while well-timed interviews with \"intimate revelations\" in gossip magazines kept her star from fading.\n\nAs if that were not enough, she wrote biographies with suggestive titles like Sara and Sex (2003); sung rap music in her seventies; and, in 2002, married a Cuban film producer 36 years her junior \u2013 all of which helped to ensure that she maintained a certain presence.\n\n\"I am not your 'typical woman',\" she said last year. \"Not at all. I am 84 and I don't have a lot of time left. But in the last 54 years there's been nobody like me.\"\n\nAlasdair Fotheringham\n\nSara Montiel actress and singer: born Campo de Criptana, Spain 10 March 1928; married 1957 Anthony Mann (divorced 1961); 1964 Jose Vicente Ramirez Olalla (divorced 1978); 1979 Pepe Tous (died 1992, two adopted children); 2002 Tony Hern\u00e1ndez (divorced 2005); died Madrid, Spain 8 April 2013."}, {"url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/photo/1950s-star-sara-montiel-remembered-spain-flna1C9273329", "page_content": "Spanish film legend Sara Montiel, who featured in 1950s Hollywood films with the likes of Gary Cooper and smoked cigars with Ernest Hemingway, died on Monday at 85.\n\nMontiel, born Maria Antonia Abad, died at home in Madrid, according to Spanish actors' union AISGE.\n\nContinue reading.\n\n-- Reuters"}, {"url": "https://www.saramontiel.es/hollywood/?lang=en", "page_content": "His interpretations in Jail for women and Cinnamon Skin they opened the doors for Sara Montiel to enter Hollywood in 1954. There she would become the first Spanish artist to be successful., working with several of the greatest figures of the Star-system of the time as Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, Joan Fontaine y Vincent Price.\n\nHis first job in the \"Mecca of cinema\" was in the western Veracruz, directed by Robert Aldrich with a roster of famous actors such as Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, Denise Darcel, Cesar Romero, Ernest Borgnine y Charles Bronson. With Veracruz, where she played a beautiful and temperamental Mexican guerrilla, Sara Montiel achieved popularity ratings that a Spanish artist had never had. In the credits of this tape he appeared with the name of Sarita Montiel, and so it would appear in his other Hollywood jobs, where it came to be nicknamed \"The latin bomb\".\n\nAccording to various sources, the actress received a standard seven-year contract extended by Harry cohn, American business mogul Columbia Pictures, but she rejected it because she feared that an exclusivity agreement would pigeonhole her in Hispanic roles. Thus, Her next jobs were as an independent actress for different production companies, and when the time comes, she would be free to return to Spain without remaining tied to a contract.\n\nHis second job in the United States was the musical film Serenade (known in Spanish as Serenade or Two passions and a love), based on an account by James M. Cain and starring tenor and actor Mario Lanza. He said that he chose Sara as a partner because his daughter Colleen saw her in a Mexican magazine and gave her opinion: \"She is the most beautiful woman I have seen in my life\". The cast of Serenade included two stars already legendary: Joan Fontaine y Vincent Price. Filming started with a bad relationship between the two main actresses, which in a way reflected the tension of his characters: in a memorable scene, Sara gives some bullfighting passes and threatens Joan by pointing a rapier at her. Fortunately, the Spanish actress won the friendship of the American diva with a compliment: during the taking of some close-ups where Joan Fontaine did not appear, Sara begged him to stand before her, in order to better feel the emotions of the scene. They became friends, and Fontaine would help her land her next role. During the filming of this production Sara Montiel met who would be her first husband, Anthony Mann, the director of the tape, and in the breaks he dealt with Elizabeth Taylor y James Dean, who filmed Gigante on a nearby set.\n\nVideo: Veracruz \u2013 Sarita Montiel and Burt Lancaster\n\n\n\nDuring a brief stay in Spain, Sara shot The last couplet, and without waiting for its premiere, He returned to the United States to tackle his third film in Hollywood, this time for the company RKO Pictures: Run of the Arrow de Samuel Fuller (film that in Spain was titled Yuma). This film was produced by Joan Fontaine's husband, who interceded so that Sara obtained the only relevant female role. Here she played a Sioux Indian and had Rod Steiger as companions, Ralph Meeker, Brian Keith and again to Charles Bronson. Director Samuel Fuller recounted that Sara quickly hit it off with the royal Indians who participated in the film as extras.; in a short time he got on with them, which caught the attention of Clark Gable, who was filming another movie in a nearby place and went to meet the Spanish actress. Another curious fact is that according to some sources, Sara's voice was voiced by young actress Angie Dickinson."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/172b623f240e495ba0604d4cca22a2f7", "page_content": "MADRID (AP) \u2014 Sara Montiel, a famed, sultry-voiced Spanish actress who became the first to also achieve Hollywood stardom, died Monday. She was 85.\n\nHer biographer, Peter Villora, said Montiel died at her home in Madrid after passing out. \u201cShe was both an actress and singer, but mainly an actress, fulfilling the dream of her life,\u201d Villora said.\n\nMontiel was born Maria Antonia Abad in Campo de Criptana in the central region of La Mancha. An acknowledged beauty with an almost husky singing voice, Montiel starred in more than 50 films, many of which were musicals.\n\nShe married Anthony Mann, an American actor and film director, in 1957. But press reports, which Montiel never denied, claimed she had turbulent affairs with author Ernest Hemingway and actor James Dean.\n\nShe became known for smoking Havana cigars on stage while singing, something that was at the time associated mostly with men. Montiel said it was Hemingway who taught her to smoke.\n\nAfter limited success in Spain, her career took off in Mexico in the late 1940s where she featured in successful Spanish language films such as \u201cCarcel de Mujeres\u201d (Women\u2019s Prison).\n\nFrom there she made the leap to Hollywood, where she soon attracted the attention of actors and directors. She played a supporting role in the legendary 1955 western \u201cVera Cruz\u201d alongside actors Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster.\n\nHer second U.S. film was the musical \u201cSerenade,\u201d with tenor Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine and Vincent Price as stars.\n\n\u201cShe was the Spanish star with the greatest international impact until the arrival of Javier (Bardem) and Penelope (Cruz),\u201d Spanish actor Jose Sacristan said.\n\nHaving found success in Mexico and the U.S., Montiel then earned star status in her native Spain with 1957\u2032s \u201cEl Ultimo Cuple\u201d (The Last Couplet), which became one of the highest grossing movies in Spanish cinema history.\n\nThe fee for her next film, \u201cLa Violetera\u201d (The Violet Seller) netted Montiel more than $1 million, something unheard of for a Spanish star in those days.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Montiel gave up film work and dedicated herself to live musicals on stage and television.\n\nMontiel is survived by her daughter Thais and son Zeus.\n\n___\n\nJorge Sainz in Madrid contributed to this obituary."}, {"url": "http://kinotuskanac.hr/en/article/sara-sarita-montiel-biografija", "page_content": "Sara (Sarita) Montiel - biography\n\nSara (Sarita) Montiel (Campo de Criptana, Spain, March 10, 1928 - Madrid, Spain, April 8, 2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Spanish film actress, born Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isadora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez. In her early teens she had already won a beauty and talent show organised by Cifesa, at the time the most influential Spanish film studio. As a winner she signed an acting contract and in 1944 made her debut in Ladislao Vajda\u2019s I Want you for myself (1944). Noticing her talent, the studio gave her the leading role in the Empez\u00f3 en boda (1944), for which she became a blond and took the aristic name Sara Montiel. Her grandmother\u2019s first name was Sara, and Montiel is the name of a field in La Mancha where she was born. Her colleagues started calling her Sarita because of her youth and the name stuck. By 1950, she had acted in fourteen films, including Rafael Gil\u2019s Don de la Mancha (1947). Her first international success came with Juan de Ordu\u00f1e\u2019s movie Madness of Love (1948) in which she portrayed an Arabian princess. Thanks to this film she got the opportunity to make a film in Mexico where she shot Red Fury (1951). Continuing to shoot there she became one of the most popular actresses in Mexico. From 1950 to 1955, she made thirteen movies in Mexico. Some of them are: Miguel Zacar\u00edas\u2019 I Need Money (1952) and Little Love of My Life (1952), Juan Jos\u00e9 Ortega\u2019s Cinnamon Skin (1953), I Do Not Believe In Men (1954), Alfred B. Crevenn\u2019s The Scapegoat (1956). Audiences outside of Mexico knew her best from her role in Luis Mar\u00eda Delgada and Robert Elwyn\u2019s action comedy That Man From Tangier (1953), filmed in Spanish-American co-production. Thanks to her talent and popularity in Mexico her next big break came in an American production, Robert Aldritch\u2019s western Vera Cruz (1954) with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. For Warner Bros. studio she made the Anthony Mann\u2019s drama Serenade (1956). Two years later Montiel married the director Anthony Mann. After some time acted in the Spanish film biography of the singer Maria Luj\u00e1n directed by Juan de Ordu\u00f1ea The Last Torch Song (1957). The film did extremely well in Spanish movie theatres and fairly well in Western Europe and Latin America. At this time she was the most popular singer and actress in Spain. She acted in Samuel Fuller\u2019s western Run of the Arrow (1957), and her performance in Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori\u2019s The Violet Seller (1958) surpassed her popularity from The Last Torch Song. Because of the great popularity of her songs from the movies, she began to sell records and hold concerts in tandem. She starred in Tuli Demicheli\u2019s drama A Girl Against Napoleon (1959) and this movie was as successful as her next ones, My Last Tango (1960) and The Sin of Love (1961) by Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori. During the 1960\u2019s she continued to increase her popularity in Eastern Europe, Israel and Japan, at the same time performing in concerts. In this period she made films such as The Lovely Lola (1962), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1965), The Missing Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1968), That Woman (1969) and Variet\u00e9s (1971). After shooting Pedro Lazage\u2019s Five Pillows For Tonight (1974), she announced her retirement. She was disappointed in the open eroticism on film that became popular with the cease of censorship in post Franco\u2019s Spain. During the 1970\u2019s and 19080\u2019s she had many successful roles in theatre musicals. In 1990, she acted in her own TV miniseries Sara and point. From 1992 to 1993, she was the host of the TV show Ven al Paralelo and at the same time sang and acted in sketches in front of a live audience in a theatre in Barcelona where the show was being recorded. Apart from the abovementioned roles she continued to have cameos in numerous TV series and the occasional movie and stayed active right until she passed away. In 2000, she published her autobiography. In the Spanish region of La Mancha, not far from where she was born, a windmill was converted into a museum dedicated to Sara Montiel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilmography:\n\n\n\nThe 2 Faces of Death (2012) (video)\n\n\n\nEmbrace Me (2011)\n\n\n\nZero/infinity (2002) (voice)\n\n\n\nNot for Ketty (1997) (TV series, 1 episode)\n\n\n\nSara and point (1990) (TV series, 5 episodes)\n\n\n\nMare i fill, societat limitada (1980) (TV series, 1 episode)\n\n\n\nFive Pillows For Tonight (1974)\n\n\n\nVarieties (1971)\n\n\n\nThe House of The Martinez (1971)\n\n\n\nThat Woman (1969)\n\n\n\nTuset Street (1968)\n\n\n\nThe Missing Woman (1966)\n\n\n\nThe Lady of Beirut (1965)\n\n\n\nSamba (1965)\n\n\n\nCasablanca, Nest of Spies (1963)\n\n\n\nQueen Chantecler (1962)\n\n\n\nThe Lovely Lola(1962)\n\n\n\nSin of Love (1961)\n\n\n\nMy Last Tango (1960)\n\n\n\nA Girl Against Napoleon (1959)\n\n\n\nThe Violet Seller (1958)\n\n\n\nRun of the Arrow (1957)\n\n\n\nThe Last Torch Song (1957)\n\n\n\nThe Scapegoat (1956)\n\n\n\nSerenade (1956)\n\n\n\nYesterdays Waterfront Sin (1955)\n\n\n\nVera Cruz (1954)\n\n\n\nRequested Models (1954)\n\n\n\nWhy Don\u2019t You Want Me (1954)\n\n\n\nI Do Not Believe In Men (1954)\n\n\n\nCock o\u2019 The Walk!..

Sarita Montiel a.k.a. Saritisima, one of the Spanish-speaking world\u2019s biggest film and recording stars, died yesterday, April 8. Montiel, who was found dead by paramedics called to her house in Madrid\u2019s district of Salamanca, was 85. Earlier today, a funeral procession through the streets of Madrid was witnessed (and applauded) by thousands of fans.\n\nSara Montiel was born \u2013 if online sources are to be believed \u2013 Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isadora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez to a small farmer and a beauty products saleswoman on March 10, 1928. She left behind her poverty-stricken childhood, during which she spent her days dreaming of film star Imperio Argentina, after moving to post-Civil War Madrid in her mid-teens.\n\nFollowing diction and singing lessons, her film career took off after she landed roles in two 1944 releases: a supporting turn \u2013 billed as Maria Alejandra \u2013 in Ladislao Vajda\u2019s Te quiero para m\u00ed (\u201cI Want You for Me\u201d) and, as Sara Montiel, the young female lead in Raffaello Matarazzo\u2019s comedy about in-laws vs. marriage bliss, Empez\u00f3 en boda (\u201cIt Started at the Wedding\u201d).\n\nEarly Spanish career and her Mexican films\n\nBy the early \u201950s, Sara Montiel had become a well-known name in Spanish-language cinema. In Spain, her roles included those of Don Quixote\u2019s daughter Antonia in Rafael Gil\u2019s Don Quijote de la Mancha (1947), with Rafael Rivelles in the title role and future Luis Bu\u00f1uel collaborator Fernando Rey as Sans\u00f3n Carrasco; and the scheming Muslim princess Aldara in Juan de Ordu\u00f1a\u2019s nationalistic historical melodrama Locura de amor / The Mad Queen (1948), supporting Aurora Bautista as the Spanish queen \u201cJuana la Loca\u201d and Fernando Rey as her husband Felipe.\n\nFollowing a move across the Atlantic, Sara Montiel would star in about a dozen features for the booming Mexican film industry, most notably Miguel M. Delgado\u2019s (possibly Caged-inspired) women-behind-bars melodrama C\u00e1rcel de mujeres (\u201cWomen\u2019s Prison,\u201d 1951), opposite two other Mexican cinema icons, Miroslava and Katy Jurado \u2013 Miroslava and Montiel are enemy inmates in the film, with the former as a widow accused of having murdered her husband, whose lover was the vengeful Montiel; Miguel Morayta\u2019s Ella, Lucifer y yo (\u201cShe, Lucifer and Me,\u201d 1953), in which Abel Salazar makes a pact with the devil (Carlos L\u00f3pez Moctezuma) so luscious singer Montiel will fall in love with him; and Miguel Zacar\u00edas\u2019 Necesito dinero (\u201cI Need Money\u201d), co-starring superstar Pedro Infante as another man doing whatever it takes to gain Montiel\u2019s affection.\n\nSarita Montiel in Hollywood\n\nFor Hollywood studios, Sara Montiel, billed as Sarita Montiel, was featured in what amounted to a supporting role in Robert Aldrich\u2019s successful Mexican-set Western Vera Cruz (1954), starring Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster (and with Denise Darcel as the female lead); Anthony Mann\u2019s poorly received romantic melodrama Serenade (1956), in which singer Mario Lanza is torn between American society dame Joan Fontaine and Mexican wife Montiel; and Samuel Fuller\u2019s post-Civil War Western Run of the Arrow (1957), as a Sioux Indian named Yellow Moccasin (and reportedly voiced by Angie Dickinson) who ends up as U.S. soldier Rod Steiger\u2019s wife.\n\nAccording to online sources, at that time Columbia\u2019s Harry Cohn offered Montiel a seven-year contract, which the actress turned down because she didn\u2019t want to be typecast as Mexican spitfires and Yellow Moccasins in Hollywood movies. Be that as it may, Montiel did accept another kind of Hollywood offer: She and her Serenade director Anthony Mann were married in 1957.\n\nAlso in the \u201950s, Sara Montiel acquired Mexican citizenship. \u201cMexico is my home away from home,\u201d she would remark in a 2007 interview in Miami. \u201cWhen I arrived in Mexico in 1950 all doors were soon thrown open to me, I have great memories from those years.\u201d\n\nOn its home page, the Mexican Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences features an official announcement mourning Sara Montiel\u2019s passing.\n\nSuperstardom\n\n\u201cHollywood was not very kind to me, may be out of envy \u2026 I was an intruder in that world,\u201d Sara Montiel would later say.\n\nFollowing her brief Hollywood stint, Montiel could have resumed her career in Mexico, but at that time she received a good offer from her native country.\n\nSara Montiel became an international superstar following the unexpected success of Juan de Ordu\u00f1a\u2019s El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 / The Last Torch Song (1957), co-written by Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda de Arozamena (who would write many of Montiel\u2019s biggest movie hits) and Antonio Mas Guindal.\n\nSharing elements in common with Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s The Barefoot Contessa (1954), the low-budget The Last Torch Song stars Montiel as cabaret singer Mar\u00eda Luj\u00e1n, who finds professional success as a singing star but whose private life is burdened by tragedy.\n\n\u201cAlmost no one had any confidence in that project,\u201d Montiel would recall about The Last Torch Song, which, much like the Mexican melodramas of the period, was a throwback to Hollywood fare of the \u201920s and \u201930s, with Montiel bringing back to life characters played decades earlier by Kay Francis, Corinne Griffith, Ann Harding, Ruth Chatterton, Irene Dunne, Gloria Swanson, and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\n\u201cWhen El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9 premiered,\u201d Montiel would later recall, \u201cI got to know what success really meant. It was what I wanted, to move the audiences, the masses.\u201d The Last Torch Song reportedly became one of Spain\u2019s biggest blockbusters in history.\n\nSara Montiel movies: La Violetera Sara Montiel movies: La Violetera\n\nNext in line for the sultry, husky-voice actress was another tear-jerking blockbuster: Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori\u2019s La Violetera (\u201cThe Violet Peddler,\u201d 1958), for which Montiel reportedly (if somewhat dubiously) earned US$1 million. In this romantic musical melodrama, Montiel plays Soledad Moreno, a flower seller in turn-of-the-century Madrid who falls in love with an aristocrat (Raf Vallone). Inevitably, class issues arise. The heartbroken Soledad flees Spain for France, where she becomes (once again) a singing sensation. Tears, tantrums, the sinking of the Titanic, psychological trauma, and eternal love ensue. (Image: The sensual Sara Montiel strikes a Gina Lollobrigida-like pose.)\n\n\u201cLa violetera was even bigger than El \u00faltimo cupl\u00e9,\u201d Montiel affirmed. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became fully aware that I was born to become a movie star.\u201d And a recording star as well, as \u201cLa Violetera\u201d was a major seller worldwide, eventually becoming her trademark song.\n\nAmong Sara Montiel\u2019s other personal successes of the late \u201950s and \u201960s were Tulio Demicheli\u2019s Carmen la de Ronda / A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), based on Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s novel and co-starring Jorge Mistral and Maurice Ronet; Mi \u00faltimo tango (\u201cMy Last Tango,\u201d 1960), about a maid who inadvertently becomes a tango-singing sensation in Argentina, also co-starring Ronet and directed by La Violetera\u2018s Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori; and Amadori\u2019s Pecado de amor (\u201cSin of Love,\u201d 1961), as a former singing star (Magda Beltr\u00e1n) who becomes a nun (Sister Bel\u00e9n) to atone for her past sins.\n\nHanding \u2018El Cid\u2019 to Sophia Loren\n\nSara Montiel claimed to have turned down the female lead role in husband Anthony Mann\u2019s Spanish-set historical epic El Cid (1961), starring Charlton Heston, recommending the Italian Sophia Loren in her place. El Cid turned out to be a major international hit.\n\nInstead of El Cid, Montiel, whose marriage to Mann would end in divorce in 1963, was seen in Alfonso Balc\u00e1zar\u2019s La bella Lola (1962), a version of Camille co-starring Antonio Cifariello and Franck Villard (in place of Montiel\u2019s original choice, Roger Moore); Rafael Gil\u2019s World War I-set espionage melodrama La reina del Chantecler (\u201cThe Queen of the Chantecler,\u201d 1962), in which Montiel falls for no-good journalist and spy Alberto de Mendoza (among whose spying buddies is Greta Chi\u2019s Mata Hari); and Henri Decoin\u2019s Casablanca, Nest of Spies / Noches de Casablanca (1963), featuring another set of spies, Maurice Ronet, and Fabio Fabrizi. (This film\u2019s French-language title inspired the title, though not necessarily the plot, of the Michel Hazanavicius / Jean Dujardin spoof OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies.)\n\nIn Rafael Gil\u2019s Samba (1965), Sara Montiel plays no less than two (Spanish-speaking) Brazilians: an actress who gets bumped off by her lover and her dead-ringer slum dweller, who, during the course of the film, finds love, intrigue, (rumba-sounding) samba singing, Carnival dancing, and the smuggling of precious stones.\n\n\u2018Esa Mujer\u2019: Pedro Almod\u00f3var inspiration\n\nMario Camus directed Esa mujer (\u201cThis Woman,\u201d 1969), a sort of The Nun\u2019s Story meets Madame X meets Sarah and Son (a 1930 mother love melodrama that earned Ruth Chatterton a Best Actress Academy Award nomination). In Esa mujer, Montiel plays Soledad Romero Fuentes, a missionary nun who gets raped, becomes pregnant, abandons her convent, becomes a singing sensation, falls in love with a man who turns out to be her (long-thought-dead) daughter\u2019s lover, and is ultimately accused of murder. And that\u2019s only part of the plot.\n\nFast-forward to 1983 and inveterate Sara Montiel fan Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s unusual look at life in a convent, Dark Habits / Entre tinieblas, and to 1999 and Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winner All About My Mother, which features Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as a pregnant nun whose \u201cfather of the child\u201d is a transvestite named Lola who also happens to be dying of AIDS.\n\nFive years after All About My Mother, Almod\u00f3var paid direct homage to his idol in the brilliant Bad Education (2004). For starters, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal sings \u201cQuiz\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s, quiz\u00e1s\u201d by mimicking Montiel in Casablanca, Nest of Spies. Additionally, Bad Education features its two schoolboy-lovers masturbating one another while watching Montiel in Esa mujer on the big screen.\n\nSara Montiel: Last movies, stage, and television work Sara Montiel: Last movies, stage, and television work\n\nSara Montiel\u2019s last prestigious star vehicle was Juan Antonio Bardem\u2019s Variet\u00e9s (1971), in which she plays an aging actress who still dreams of becoming a star. The middle-aged hopeful eventually gets her chance, but success turns out to be ephemeral.\n\nBy that time, after one formulaic musical melodrama after another, Sara Montiel\u2019s movie-star appeal had been drastically reduced. Refusing to take part in Spain\u2019s then-burgeoning cine del destape \u2013 post-Franco softcore comedies \u2013 Montiel left films following the release of Pedro Lazaga\u2019s comedy Cinco almohadas para una noche (\u201cFive Cushions for One Night,\u201d 1974) \u2013 though she would also be seen the following year in Eduardo Manzanos Brochero\u2019s That\u2019s Entertainment-like compilation feature Canciones de nuestra vida (\u201cSongs of Our Lives\u201d).\n\nThirty-six years later, Montiel would return to the big screen one last time, playing (a parody of) herself in Oscar Parra de Carrizosa\u2019s Abr\u00e1zame (\u201cHug Me,\u201d 2011).\n\nMontiel would later lament that she (unlike Pola Negri, Bette Davis, Elisabeth Bergner, Jeanne Moreau, Marlene Dietrich, Viveca Lindfors, and Tallulah Bankhead) never got to play Catherine the Great. And even though she retired from films right when the fascistic government of Francisco Franco was in its death throes, Montiel also bemoaned the fact that she didn\u2019t have the chance to work with top-quality screenwriters unhindered by Franco\u2019s reactionary right-wing censors.\n\nAs her film career came to a halt, Montiel began focusing on her stage and concert shows. According to online sources, among her live successes, at times smoking a cigar between numbers, were Saritisima \u2013 though Montiel claimed she liked neither the nickname \u201cSaritisima\u201d nor \u201cSarita\u201d \u2013 and Increible Sara (obviously in reference to \u201cThe Incredible Sarah [Bernhardt]\u201d). Her trademark songs included the perennial \u201cLa violetera,\u201d in addition to \u201cB\u00e9same mucho,\u201d \u201cFumando Espero\u201d (\u201cSmoking, I Wait [for the man I love\u2026]\u201d), and the Spanish-language version of \u201cAmado m\u00edo\u201d (performed by Rita Hayworth, with Anita Ellis\u2019 voice, in Charles Vidor\u2019s Gilda). [Please scroll down to listen to Sara Montiel\u2019s husky rendition of \u201cAmado m\u00edo.\u201d]\n\nOn television, Sara Montiel was the star of the miniseries Sara y Punto (1990) and the variety show Ven al Paralelo (1992). She continued recording songs and appearing on several TV shows until the 2000s, most recently in Entrevista a la carta in 2012.\n\nCuriously, Montiel never received an Honorary Goya from the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She did, however, win two Best Actress awards from Spain\u2019s Cinema Writers Circle: for The Last Torch Song and La Violetera.\n\nHusbands and lovers\n\nFollowing her divorce from Anthony Mann, Sara Montiel would marry three more times, including a de facto two-month union with businessman Jos\u00e9 Vicente Ram\u00edrez Olalla in 1964. The marriage would be officially annulled in 1978.\n\nMontiel\u2019s last husband was Cuban video technician Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez, 36 years her junior, with whom she tied the knot in late 2002. As further proof of the dangers of heterosexual unions, that marriage reportedly lasted 10 days, though divorce would be finalized only in early 2005. \u201cMy one big mistake was marrying Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez,\u201d Montiel later admitted. \u201cIt was a catastrophe. I really regret it.\u201d\n\nMontiel had a longer union with businessman and journalist Pepe Tous: from 1979 to his death in 1992. Along the way, the couple adopted two children.\n\nSupposed Sara Montiel lovers \u2013 she drops names in her autobiographies \u2013 ranged from frequent co-star Maurice Ronet and James Dean (whom she met while he was starring in George Stevens\u2019 Giant) to Ernest Hemingway and Nobel Prize in Medicine winner Severo Ochoa, in addition to Esa mujer director Mario Camus, poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and playwright and screenwriter Miguel Mihura (Welcome Mr. Marshall!). Well-publicized romances included those with co-star Giancarlo del Duca (La mujer perdida, The Woman from Beirut) and La bella Lola cinematographer Mario Montuori.\n\nMontiel\u2019s first autobiographical tome, A Whole Life, was published in 2000. A sequel, Living Is a Pleasure, came out three years later.

She is still a much-loved and internationally known name in the Spanish-speaking movie and music industries. She was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of Castile-La Mancha in 1928. After her unprecedented international hit in Juan de Ordu\u00f1a's El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 in 1957, Miss Montiel achieved the status of mega-star in Europe and Latin America. She was the first woman to distill sex openly in Spanish cinema at a time when even a low cut dress was not acceptable. With the passage of time the title ofhas been awarded to her mythological cache. In legend she seems to thrive; growing stronger and even more famous. She is very much admired internationally today.\n\nShe was recently portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film Bad Education by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as the character Zahara and a film clip from one of her movies was used as well. Montiel was the most commercially successful Spanish actress during the mid Twentieth century in much of the world. Miss Montiel's film Varietes was banned in Peking in 1973. Her films El \u00daltimo Cuple and La Violetera netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 50s and 60s. She also played the role of Antonia, the niece of Don Quixote, in the 1947 Spanish film version of Cervantes's great novel.\n\nActing career\n\nMontiel started in movies at 16 in her native Spain where she filmed her first international success playing an Islamic princess in the 1948 film Locura de Amor. Later she conquered Mexico starring in a dozen films in less than five years. Hollywood came calling after and she was introduced to US moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz(1954) co-starring with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster directed by Robert Aldrich . She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures which she quickly refused afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she free-lanced at Warner Bros. with Mario Lanza and Joan Fontaine in Serenade (1956) directed by Anthony Mann and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957), opposite Rod Steiger and Charles Bronson\n\nThat same year she married Anthony Mann but returned briefly to Spain to star in a low budget film musical El Ultimo Cuple as a favor to producer-director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a who had helped her career in the early days. This film made her unexpectedly the number one actress-singer of that year in Europe and Latin America and she accepted a multi-million dollar offer for more films and recordings in Europe. It was obvious that Hollywood could not offer anything better, so she moved back to Spain and to a career that is now legendary. Fifteen monumentally successful films followed her Cuple success (including La Violetera (1958), Carmen, la de Ronda (1959, a very personal rendition of the Carmen myth), Mi Ultimo Tango (1960), Pecado de Amor(1961), La Bella Lola (1962, her own version of Camille), La Reina del Chantecler (a 1963 blockbuster specially in the Soviet Union and countries behind the Iron Curtain), Noches de Casablanca\" (a 1963 tribute to Hollywood's Casablanca), Samba (1964), La Dama de Beirut (1965), La Mujer Perdida (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969), Varietes (1971), etc. During these years she also recorded over 30 highly successful albums and appeared on stage and television all over the world.\n\nIn 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies and continued non-stop performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. She continued at that pace well into the 1990s. In 2000 her autobiography Memories: To Live Is A Pleasure became a huge best seller, followed by a second part Sara and Sex, which highlighted her love life.\n\nSince then she seems to have slowed down a bit although her status as Spain's only legendary film star remains unchallenged and her private life is a source of never ending controversies assuring her presence in gossip magazines and television talk shows. In 2006 she temporarily put aside her career in order to help her son Zeus with his first recordings."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.com/prime-video/actor/Sara-Montiel/amzn1.dv.gti.924772c2-6812-43e7-b9ab-2409887a9e5c/", "page_content": "Sara Montiel\n\nSara Montiel was born in the village of Campo de Criptana, province of Ciudad Real, in the region of Castille-La Mancha, Spain. Her parents were Isidoro Abad, a peasant, and Maria Vicenta Fern\u00e1ndez, a door-to-door beautician. The future star was christened Maria Antonia Alejandra Abad Fern\u00e1ndez. Barely in her teens, she won a beauty and talent contest held by Cifesa, the most influential Spanish film studio of that era. She was promptly signed to a movie contract and in 1944 made her debut playing a teenager in Te quiero para m\u00ed (1944), credited in the cast as \"Maria Alejandra\". By the end of 1944 she was given the starring role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (1944), which introduced her with a more adult image and a new name: Sara Montiel.\n\nIn the next four years she appeared in 14 films, including her first international success Locura de amor (1948), which led to a long term-contract in Mexico. She quickly established herself as one of the most popular film actors of the decade. starring in over a dozen films between 1950 and 1954. Hollywood came calling and she was formally introduced to American moviegoers in Vera Cruz (1954), playing Gary Cooper's love interest. Later she worked at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956) with Mario Lanza, directed by Anthony Mann, who became her first husband. After starring in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957) with Rod Steiger, Sarita shot The Last Torch Song (1957) (\"The Last Song\") in Spain, a musical production that turned out to be the biggest box-office success in Spain's film history. It played for over a year in the same theaters in which it opened. A similar reaction followed in Western Europe and Latin America. Sarita Montiel had become the most popular actress-singer of 1957 and a national treasure for Spain.\n\nThe unprecedented success of \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" threw a wrench into her Hollywood career, as she was offered a multimillion-dollar contract to star in four films in Europe. Her next vehicle, La violetera (1958) (\"The Violet Peddler\"), confirmed Sara's popularity and broke the box-office records set by the previous movie. The theme song from \"La Violetera\" became Montiel's signature song. The soundtrack albums from both films reportedly outsold Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra in the world market. From then on, Sarita would combine the making of films with the recording of highly successful albums and live concerts in four continents. By 1962 she had become a legend to millions of fans worldwide, reaching markets that had previously been uncharted territory for Spanish cinema. Among her many blockbusters of the 1960s were Mi \u00faltimo tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), La bella Lola (1962), La reina del Chantecler (1962) and Esa mujer (1969).\n\nHowever, by the 1970s her interest in films diminished, due largely to the almost pornographic turn of Spanish films in the late-Francisco Franco era when censorship was abolished and she retired from films in 1974. Her activities turned mainly to recording and stage work, and she achieved uncontested successes with her stage shows \"Sara en Persona\" (1970-73), \"Sarit\u00edsima\" (1974-75), \"Increible Sara\" (1977-78), \"Super Sara Show\"(1979-80), \"Do\u00f1a Sara de La Mancha\" (1981-82), \"Taxi Vamos Al Victoria\" (1983-84), \"Nostalgia\" (1985-86), \"Sara, Siempre Sara\" (1987-88) and others.\n\nIn the 1990s Sara surprised everyone by branching out into television: Sara y punto (1990), a mini-series of seven one-hour episodes, included a serialized biography of the star, many popular guests (including Luciano Pavarotti and Charles Aznavour, among others) and Miss Montiel singing her greatest hits in addition to new songs written especially for her. Next came Ven al Paralelo (1992), taped in a Barcelona theater where Montiel hosted,sang and acted in comedy sketches in front of a live audience.\n\nIt is quite impossible to cover here all the awards Sara Montiel has won in her long successful career but we must mention the \"Premio del Sindicato\" (at that time Spain's equivalent of the Oscar) for best actress, won two years in a row for her performances in \"El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9\" and \"La Violetera\". In 1972 she was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Los Angeles by Mayor Sam Yorty and was given the gold key to the city. Similarly she has been awarded the gold keys of New York, Miami and Chicago. In 1981 she received Israel's most prestigious honor, the Ben Guiron Award and in 1983 she was awarded France's Legion of Honor medal, after a retrospective of her career ran at the Autumn Film Festival in Paris. In 1986 \"Nosotros\", a Hollywood-based Hispanic actors advocacy organization founded by Ricardo Montalban, gave her its Golden Eagle Award for life achievement. The trophy was presented to Sarita by her \"Vera Cruz\" costar-producer Burt Lancaster in an emotional reunion that triggered a standing ovation from all their Hollywood peers witnessing the event. In 1997 she was awarded the \"Gold Medal\", also a life achievement recognition, given--rarely0--by Spain's Academy of Arts and Sciences. The two-hour ceremony was beamed live by national television. In 2008 Sara returned to her hometown to unveil a sculpture with her image at the new Sara Montiel Park. A nearby avenue was also named after her and there was at the same time a dedication ceremony of her newly renovated museum, located inside a 16th-century windmill. In addition, the government placed a commemorative plaque on the house where she was born.\n\nSara Montiel's private life has also been a large part of her legend. After divorcing Anthony Mann in 1963, she married three more times (Vicente Ramirez Olalla 1964-1978; Jose Tous 1979-1992; Antonio Hernandez 2002-2004). Before, during and after these marriages she had countless affairs, among them Nobel prize-winning scientist Severo Ochoa and Italian actor Giancarlo Del Duca. Unable to have children, she adopted two during her marriage to Jose Tous: Thais (born in 1979) and Zeus (born 1983). In 2000 she published her autobiography, which became a best seller. Undaunted by the passage of time and ignoring critics who accused her of mishandling her legendary image, Sara Montiel continued living and working at a hectic pace. She kept touring with her one woman show and making guests appearances on television. In 2009 she won a new generation of fans when she recorded \"Absolutamente,\" an outrageous duet with Fangoria's vocalist Alaska. Both the record and the promotional video reached the top of the popularity charts and remained there for weeks.\n\nNext Sara recorded some love duets with baritone Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rom\u00e1n Marcos and traveled to the United States for a short tour sponsored by New York's Cervantes Institute and the universities of Chicago and Cincinnati. In every city she charmed the audiences with her charismatic presence and sense of humor. Back in Spain she continued her activities which now included supporting the singing career of her son Zeus. She appeared in his 2011 \"Sex Dance\" video and caused quite a stir.\n\nIn February 2013 Sara Montiel became the subject of a made-for-TV documentary titled \"Sara's Dream\" which aired in Spain to high ratings and great reviews. It was a fitting celebration of her fantastic life and career which came at the right time. A couple of months later, the star who had seemed eternal, passed away suddenly and quietly in her Madrid penthouse. By her family's request, funeral services were private but the funeral procession, organized by the city of Madrid, was a very moving event attended by thousands who showed up at Plaza Callao to bid farewell to their beloved Sara. She was buried in the San Justo cemetery family plot."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/sara-montiel/biography", "page_content": "Sara Montiel Biography\n\nSpanish-Mexican actress and singer (1928\u20132013)In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is\n\nMar\u00eda Antonia Abad Fern\u00e1ndez MML (10 March 1928 \u2013 8 April 2013), known professionally as Sara Montiel, also Sarita Montiel, was a Spanish actress and singer. She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.\n\nMontiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as Women's Prison (1951) and Red Fury (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films Vera Cruz (1954), Serenade (1956) and Run of the Arrow (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.\n\nThroughout her career, Montiel's personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.\n\nCareer\n\nMontiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, Te quiero para m\u00ed (I want you for myself) in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in Empez\u00f3 en boda (It Began with a Wedding) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as Mariona Rebull (1946), Don Quixote (1947) and Madness for Love (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including Women's Prison (1951), Red Fury (1951) and Cinnamon Skin (1953).\n\nSara Montiel attending the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Week in 1956.\n\nHollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film Vera Cruz (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood's typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in Serenade (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller's Run of the Arrow (1957).\n\nBetween November 1956 and January 1957, before filming Run of the Arrow, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film The Last Torch Song during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Ordu\u00f1a. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.\n\nFollowing this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them The Violet Seller, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of The Violet Seller surp*ed that of The Last Torch Song, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, A Girl Against Napoleon (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer's net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. The Violet Seller soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.\n\nAll this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were My Last Tango (1960), Pecado de amor (1961), The Lovely Lola (a 1962 version of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias), Casablanca, Nest of Spies (1963), Samba (1964), The Lost Woman (1966), Tuset Street (1967), Esa Mujer (1969) and Variety (1971). The film Variety was banned in Beijing in 1973.\n\nIn 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.\n\nIn November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album Absolutamente. They recorded the *le track \"Absolutamente\" as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by \u00d3scar Parra de Carrizosa. The film *le is Abr\u00e1zame and was shot on location in La Mancha.\n\nShe is considered \"one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain\", and has been described by Spain's press as a \"myth of Spanish cinema.\" She has also been characterized as \"the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.\" She has also been called a \"sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.\"\n\nPersonal information\n\nMonument to Montiel in Campo de Criptana.\n\nMontiel, whose complete name was Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a talent contest at age fifteen. In her first movie, she was credited as \"Mar\u00eda Alejandra\" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film, she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in La Mancha region of her birth. It was in Mexico where she first learned how to read and write, taught by the poet Le\u00f3n Felipe, and in 1951 she acquired Mexican dual nationality.

She also claimed a long-term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that science wizard Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.\n\nIn her later years, she became an iconic figure to the gay community, and noted \"Cuando voy a actuar a alguna ciudad de EE UU all\u00ed est\u00e1n todos los gays de la ciudad\" (Whenever I perform in any city in the US, all the gays from that city show up). Montiel died in 2013 at her home in Madrid at the age of eighty-five from congestive heart failure, and was buried in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid.\n\nFilmography\n\nDiscography\n\nSara Montiel en Mexico\n\nCanciones de la Pel\u00edcula \"El \u00daltimo Cuple\" - Spain: Columbia.
