Taylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova\"s backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova\"s biggest hit, \"Fantasy.\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper\"s backing band on the tours for Cooper\"s mid-80s albums, Constrictor (1986) and Raise Your Fist and Yell (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice\"s band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \"Sahara\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album. Taylor remained in Winger throughout the band\"s most successful period, which included the two smash albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young. However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album. In 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a Greatest Hits album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects. More recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the United States. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014."}, {"url": "https://m.famousfix.com/topic/paul-taylor-musician", "page_content": "Paul Taylor was born on 4 June 1960 in San Jose, California.

Powerfully built, he immediately captured the attention of dance giants Martha Graham, Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, and Doris Humphrey. This young dancer had a commanding presence, instinctive talent, and a unique way of moving. Taylor was invited to join the Martha Graham Dance Company, where he began his professional career. While starring as a soloist with Martha Graham\u2019s company, Paul Taylor assembled The Paul Taylor Dance Company. Throughout the long career that has followed, his company became one of America\u2019s premier troupes. Today, Taylor is considered by many to be the greatest living choreographer.\n\nBorn in Wilkinsburg, PA, in 1930, Taylor had a turbulent and lonely childhood, often separated from his parents. After attending Syracuse University on scholarships in painting and swimming, he began to study dance. Two years later he joined the Martha Graham Dance Company, where he performed in a number of pieces, including \u201cClytemnestra\u201d (1958), \u201cAlcestis\u201d (1960) and \u201cPhaedra\u201d (1962). While still with the Martha Graham Dance Company, he danced for a number of other great contemporary choreographers, including Merce Cunningham and George Balanchine. It was, however, with his own dance company, which he founded in 1954, that Taylor made his greatest contribution to the art of dance.\n\nIn the mid-fifties, as New York was confidently asserting its position as the major cultural center for the arts, Taylor\u2019s emerging talent was beginning to be recognized. Excited by the experimental arts of the time, Taylor became friends and collaborators with the painters Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Taylor shared their desire to bring the vernacular into high art. Using gestures and stances from the street, Taylor\u2019s work reflects the beauty and pathos of society. In a number of his early pieces, Taylor composed dances of everyday gestures, such as checking a watch or waiting for a bus. Once seen separated from their context, one can recognize the richness of these everyday movements. For Taylor, a dance is the first step in returning the viewer to the street more aware of the beauty in the simple movements he or she sees every day.\n\nThroughout the late 50s, 60s, and 70s he performed some of the most exciting and inventive dances of the time. \u201cDuet\u201d (1957) was an experimental piece in which Taylor stands next to a reclining woman in street clothes, and neither one moves. This four-minute piece was a distillation of many essential elements of dance, calling attention to posture and the interconnection of people within a space. Similar to other minimalist experimental artists of the time, Taylor\u2019s break with convention was simply a starting-off point for further investigation. His later pieces combine this minimalist performance with ballet. Among the best known of these are \u201cThree Epitaphs\u201d (1956), \u201cOrbs\u201d (1966), \u201cThe Book of Beasts\u201d (1971), and \u201cAirs\u201d (1978). His \u201cAureole\u201d (1962) is one of the most highly respected dance works of the time for its grace and technical difficulty. It is Taylor\u2019s combination of the subtlety of ballet with the spontaneity of everyday gesture that has made him such a powerful force in modern dance.\n\nNo longer dancing himself, Taylor has spent the past two decades devoted completely to directing his company and teaching the younger generations the rigors and beauty of dance. Taylor continues to find his inspiration both in the streets and in the studio. For him, watching the dancers move and responding to those movements is an essential part of his work. In this way the choreography becomes both an individual and communal endeavor. Among the dancers to move through his company on the way to starting their own were Laura Dean, Twyla Tharp, Dan Wagoner, and Senta Driver. Through these students and through the continued productions of his dance company, Paul Taylor\u2019s work continues to inspire people throughout the world."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/paul-taylor-keyboardist", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nPaul Taylor was born on 4 June, 1960 in San Francisco, California, United States, is an American musician, guitarist/keyboardist with Winger.
