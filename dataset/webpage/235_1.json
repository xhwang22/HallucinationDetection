She is also remembered for her appearances in the Topper film series. Her unmistakable high-pitched, quivering and aristocratic voice, made her a frequent choice to play dimwitted or spoiled society types.She was married to Broadway producer and impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. from 1914 until his death in 1932.Early lifeBurke was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Blanche (n\u00e9e Beatty) and her second husband, William \"Billy\" Ethelbert Burke. She toured the United States and Europe with her father, a singer and clown who worked for the Barnum & Bailey Circus. Her family settled in London where she attended plays in the West End. She began acting on stage in 1903, making her debut in London in The School Girl. Her other London shows included The Duchess of Dantzic (1903) and The Blue Moon (1904). She eventually returned to America to star in Broadway musical comedies.CareerBurke went on to play leads on Broadway in Mrs. Dot, Suzanne, The Runaway, The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, and The Land of Promise from 1910 to 1913, along with a supporting role in the revival of Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's The Amazons. There she met producer Florenz Ziegfeld, marrying him in 1914. Two years later they had a daughter, author Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson (1916\u20132008).Burke was signed for the movies and made her cinematic debut in the title role of Peggy (1915). Her success was phenomenal, and she was soon earning what was reputedly the highest salary of any film actress up to that time. She followed her first feature with the 15-part serial Gloria's Romance (1916), another popular and critically acclaimed vehicle. By 1917, she was a favorite with silent-movie fans, rivaling Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Clara Kimball Young and Irene Castle. She starred primarily in provocative society dramas and comedies, similar in theme to The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, her most successful American play. Her girlish charm rivaled her acting ability, and as she dressed to the hilt in fashionable gowns, furs and jewelry, her clothes sense also won her the devotion of female audiences. Among the films in which she appeared during this period were Arms and the Girl (1917), The Mysterious Miss Terry, Let's Get a Divorce (1918), Good Gracious, Annabelle (1919), Away Goes Prudence (1920) and The Frisky Mrs. Johnson (1920). As a nod to himself for his wife appearing for Zukor and Lasky, Ziegfeld insisted on promotions for each of the films to carry the tag 'By Special Arrangement with Florenz Ziegfeld'.Burke's beauty and taste made her a major trendsetter throughout the 1910s and 20s. As early as 1909, following her Broadway performance in My Wife (1909), department stores began carrying the \"Billie Burke Dress\" with a signature flat collar and lace trim. During this time, much of Burke's on- and off-screen wardrobe was provided by the leading European couturier Lucile (in private life, Lady Duff Gordon), whose New York branch was the fashion Mecca of socialites and entertainment celebrities. Burke reflected on her reputation as \"a new kind of actress, carefree, and red-headed, and I had beautiful clothes.\"In 1916, Burke had a daughter. In 1917, Burke endorsed Pond\u2019s Vanishing Cream.Despite her success in film, Burke eventually returned to the stage, appearing in Caesar's Wife (1919), The Intimate Strangers (1921), The Marquise (1927) and The Happy Husband (1928).When the family's investments were wiped out in the Wall Street Crash the following year, she resumed screen acting to aid her husband.Burke made her Hollywood comeback in 1932, when she starred as Margaret Fairfield in A Bill of Divorcement, which was directed by George Cukor. She played Katharine Hepburn's mother in the film, which was Hepburn's debut. Despite the death of her husband Florenz Ziegfeld during the film's production, she resumed acting shortly after his funeral.In 1933, Burke was cast as Millicent Jordan, a scatterbrained high-society woman hosting a dinner party in the comedy Dinner at Eight, directed by George Cukor, co-starring with Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, John Barrymore, Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery. The movie was a great success and revitalized her career. She subsequently starred in many comedies and musicals, typecast as a ditzy, feather-brained upper-class matron, with her high-pitched voice.In 1936, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filmed a biopic of Florenz Ziegfeld (The Great Ziegfeld), a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Luise Rainer as Ziegfeld's common-law wife, Anna Held). William Powell played Ziegfeld and Myrna Loy played Burke; this infuriated Burke, who was under contract to the studio and believed she could have played herself, however, MGM considered her too old to cast in the part of her younger self.Burke appeared in Topper (1937) in which she played the twittering and puritanical Clara Topper, who is married to a man haunted by socialite ghosts played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. She returned to the role in the film's sequels. Her next performance as Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938) resulted in her only Oscar nomination. In 1938, she was chosen to play Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the musical The Wizard of Oz (1939), directed by Victor Fleming, starring Judy Garland. She had previously worked with Garland in the film Everybody Sing, in which she played Judy's histrionically hysterical actress-mother. Director George Cukor offered her the role of Aunt Pittypat in Gone With the Wind (1939), but she declined it. The role went to Laura Hope Crews, in a performance that Cukor wanted to be played in a \"Billie Burke-ish manner\" with \"the same zany feeling\". Another successful film series followed with Father of the Bride (1950) and Father's Little Dividend (1951), both directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor. Burke also portrayed Mrs. Ernest (Daisy) Stanley in the 1942 film The Man Who Came to Dinner.Burke wrote two autobiographies, both with Cameron Shipp, With a Feather on My Nose (Appleton 1949) and With Powder on My Nose (Coward McCann, 1959).Radio and televisionOn CBS Radio, The Billie Burke Show was heard on Saturday mornings from April 3, 1943, until September 21, 1946. Sponsored by Listerine, this situation comedy was initially titled Fashions in Rations during its first year. Portraying herself as a featherbrained Good Samaritan who lived \"in the little white house on Sunnyview Lane,\" she always offered a helping hand to those in her neighborhood. She worked often in early television, appearing in the short-lived sitcom Doc Corkle (1952). She was a guest star on several TV and radio series, including Duffy's Tavern.On television, Burke starred in her own talk show, At Home With Billie Burke, which ran on the DuMont Television Network from June 1951 through the spring of 1952. She was one of the first female talk show hosts, after the hostesses of the earlier DuMont series And Everything Nice (1949\u201350) and Fashions on Parade (1948\u201349) which both included some talk show segments.Billie Burke starred in an adaptation of Dr. Heidegger's Experiment on the TV version of Lights Out on November 20, 1950.Return to stage and final filmBurke tried to make a comeback on the New York stage. She starred in two short-lived productions: This Rock and Mrs. January and Mr. X. Although she got good reviews, the plays did not. She also appeared in several plays in California, although her mind became clouded, and she had trouble remembering lines. In the late 1950s, her failing memory led to her retirement from show business, although her explanation at the time was, \"Acting just wasn't any fun anymore.\"Burke made her final screen appearance in Sergeant Rutledge (1960), a western directed by John Ford.Personal lifeAmong Burke's early suitors was the operatic tenor Enrico Caruso.In 1910, Burke bought the Kirkham estate on Broadway in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and renamed the mansion, Burkeley Crest.In April 1914, Burke married Florenz Ziegfeld.In 1921, Burke retired to raise her daughter Patricia, but resumed work after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.In 1932, Burke moved from New York to Beverly Hills, California, after the death of Ziegfeld.Burke died in Los Angeles of natural causes on May 14, 1970, at the age of 85, and she was interred besideZiegfeld at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Westchester County, New York.LegacyFor many years, Burke's framed photo was displayed above the exit staircase at New York City's Ziegfeld Theatre, but it disappeared after renovations. An opening-night program bearing a picture of her from her 1912 triumph The Mind The Paint Girl (Sir Arthur Wing Pinero) is displayed in the lobby of the Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan.For her contributions to the film industry, Burke was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star at 6617 Hollywood Boulevard.The Academy Film Archive houses the Florenz Ziegfeld-Billie Burke Collection, which consists primarily of home movies.On November 4, 2015, the crater Burke, near the north pole of the planet Mercury, was named after Billie Burke.Performance careerRadioThe Ziegfeld Follies of the Air \u2013 1932Doubting Thomas - 1935Good News of 1939 \u2013 1938The Rudy Vallee Hour \u2013 1939The Gulf Screen Guild Theater \u2013 1939The Rudy Vallee Sealtest Show \u2013 1940\u201341The Pepsodent Show \u2013 1941The Billie Burke Show \u2013 1943\u20131946Duffy's Tavern \u2013 1944The Sealtest Village Store \u2013 1944Mail Call \u2013 1944The Charlie McCarthy Show \u2013 1944\u201347Tribute to Ethel Barrymore \u2013 1945The Rudy Vallee Show \u2013 1945Show Stoppers \u2013 1946The Danny Kaye Show \u2013 1946WOR 25th Anniversary \u2013 1947Your Movietown Radio Theatre \u2013 1948The Eddie Cantor Pabst Blue Ribbon Show \u2013 1948Family Theater \u2013 1948\u201352This Is Show Business \u2013 CBS-TV, 1949The Martin and Lewis Show \u2013 1949The Bill Stern Colgate Sports Newsreel \u2013 1949Stagestruck \u2013 1954Biography in Sound \u2013 1955\u201356BroadwayMy Wife \u2013 1907Love Watches \u2013 1908Mrs. Dot \u2013 1910Suzanne \u2013 1910The Philosopher in the Apple Orchard \u2013 1911The Runaway \u2013 1911The Amazons \u2013 1913The Land of Promise \u2013 1913Jerry \u2013 1914The Rescuing Angel \u2013 1917A Marriage of Convenience \u2013 1918Caesar's Wife \u2013 1919The Intimate Strangers (musical)|The Intimate Strangers \u2013 1921Rose Briar \u2013 1922Annie Dear \u2013 1924The Marquise \u2013 1927The Happy Husband \u2013 1928Family Affairs \u2013 1929The Truth Game \u2013 1930Ziegfeld Follies of 1934 \u2013 1934 (producer)Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 \u2013 1936 (producer)This Rock \u2013 1943Ziegfeld Follies of 1943 \u2013 1943 (producer)Mrs. January and Mr. X - 1944FilmographySee alsoAcademy of Music/Riviera TheatreList of actors with Academy Award nominationsReferencesFurther readingAlistair, Rupert (2018). \"Billie Burke\".

Burke weathered the highs and lows of over five decades in show business, as well as a high-profile marriage to the notorious Florenz Ziegfeld. She once shared the formula for her longevity: \"To survive in Hollywood, you need the ambition of a Latin American revolutionary, the ego of a grand opera tenor and the physical stamina of a cow pony.\"\n\nBurke was born in Washington D.C. but at the age of eight followed her father's circus troupe\u2014Billy Burke's Barnum & Great London Circus Songsters\u2014to London, where she dutifully fulfilled her mother's wish that she become an actress. Borrowing her father's name, she made her first stage appearance in 1903 at the London Pavilion, singing \"Mamie, I Have a Little Canoe,\" in a show called The School Girl. A hit, the show ran for two years and brought Burke some celebrity and better roles, including parts in The Duchess of Dantzic, The Blue Moon, and Mrs. Ponderbury's Past. In 1907, theater impresario Charles Frohman brought her back to New York to co-star with John Drew in My Wife. The delicate-featured redhead soon became the toast of Broadway, with a string of admirers, including Mark Twain, Enrico Caruso, James Barrie and Somerset Maugham. It was Maugham who escorted her to a New Year's Eve party at the Astor Hotel where she met the renowned producer of the Follies, Florenz (Flo) Ziegfeld, who was newly divorced from actress Anna Held . Burke would later say of that first encounter: \"[E]ven if I had known then precisely what tortures and frustrations were in store for me during the next eighteen years because of this man, I should have kept right on falling in love.\" After a whirlwind courtship, the couple eloped (with Burke's mother in tow) and were married in the back room of a parsonage in Hoboken, New Jersey. After a weekend honeymoon, the newlyweds made their first home in a hotel room.\n\nIn 1915, film pioneer Thomas Ince offered Burke an unprecedented $300,000 to appear in the film Peggy. She accepted but turned down a subsequent five-year contract knowing that if she stayed in Hollywood her marriage would not survive. She finally signed on to do a number of silents with Famous Players-Lasky (Paramount) who were based in New York, where she could keep tabs on the philandering Ziegfeld.\n\nAfter the birth of their daughter in 1916, they moved into a house, Burkely Crest, in Hastings-on-Hudson, which Ziegfeld, a master of overkill, outfitted with a menagerie that included a herd of deer, two bears, two lion cubs, a variety of birds, an elephant, and later a pony that had been previously owned by the prince of Wales. The couple's lavish lifestyle included dinners for 40, nightly motion pictures, and camping trips to Canada that, according to Burke, \"closely resembled a rajah on safari with carpets, ices, cooks, and distinguished guests.\"\n\nAfter a series of silents, the best of which are considered In Pursuit of Polly, Good Gracious Annabelle!, and The Misleading Widow, Burke grew weary of the movies and returned to Broadway in such hits as Booth Tarkington's Intimate Strangers and Noel Coward's The Marquise. Mothering responsibilities and the illness of her own mother also occupied much of her time, as did continuing problems with Ziegfeld, who took up gambling and Marilyn Miller almost simultaneously. When the stock market crash of '29 and a string of failures on Broadway brought Ziegfeld close to financial disaster, Burke went back to work in earnest. Her first character role in Ivor Novello's play The Truth Game, followed by another in The Vinegar Tree, led to a new image for the actress as a scatterbrained comedienne.\n\nAfter Ziegfeld's death in 1932, the movies beckoned Burke once again, and she embarked on the second phase of her career, playing what she referred to as \"my silly women.\" \"These characters,\" she wrote, \"these bird-witted ladies whom I have characterized so often \u2026 derived from my part in The Vinegar Tree. I am neatly typed today, of course, possibly irrevocably typed, although I sincerely hope not, for I should like better parts.\"\n\nWith Bill of Divorcement considered her talkie debut, other memorable efforts of this period were Topper, its sequel Merrily We Live (which earned her an Academy Award nomination), and the role of Glinda in The Wizard of Oz. Burke cited Glinda as her favorite film part\u2014nearest to her stage roles. In 1936, she was an advisor on the film The Great Ziegfeld, in which she was portrayed by Myrna Loy . Burke tried a straight role in The Cheaters in 1945, but audiences did not want to take her seriously, perhaps because they'd grown accustomed to her comedy, perhaps because her voice, always slightly high pitched, became more \"birdy\" with age.\n\nIn 1949, Burke wrote the first of her memoirs, With a Feather on My Nose. By that time, she had moved to a modest home in West Los Angeles, next door to her daughter and three grandchildren. Still busy, she continued to work until her retirement in 1953, after which she was lured out for only a few plays in stock, including The Solid Gold Cadillac, and some very small movie roles.

One of the most popular fantasy films of all time, the series has grossed over $3.3 billion in worldwide collections. And today we are going to talk about Billy Burke, an actor who is best known for portraying the role of Charlie Swan in Twilight. Further, he appeared as one of the lead characters in NBC series, Revolution.\n\nWilliam Albert Burke was born on November 25, 1966, in Everett, Washington, the United States. Billy began singing and acting at a young age. He studied drama at Western Washington University. After his dream of becoming a singer didn't go well, Billy pursued an acting career.\n\nBilly Burke's Married Life\n\nThe 1.88m tall actor was married to British actress, Pollyanna Rose. Billy and his ex-wife Rose began dating in 2008. After dating for a while, the couple tied their wedding knots in a private marriage ceremony on June 15, 2008.\n\nImage: Billy Burke married British actress, Pollyanna Rose in 2008 and divorced in 2017.\n\nSource: Getty Images\n\nWhile Billy was starring in Twilight, he welcomed a daughter named, Bluesy LaRue Burke. The couple was having a perfect married life until they decided to separate in 2017. After staying married for nearly ten years, Burke and Rose parted their ways. Further, they listed their Sherman Oaks home for $2.75 million in March 2017.\n\nImage: Billy and his ex-wife sold their Sherman Oaks home for $2.75 million in 2017.\n\nSource: La times\n\nBilly's ex-spouse, Pollyanna, was born in London and is best known for starring in movies such as Turistas (2006), Luster (2010), and The Devil's Chair (2007). Before marrying Burke, she was married to actor Max Brown from 2005-2008. Meanwhile, Billy is a single man who isn't dating anyone.\n\nNet Worth\n\nThe television and film actor Billy Burke has a net worth of $5 million. The majority of his income came from starting in television shows and movies. Burke has been active in the entertainment industry since 1990. Therefore, with a career spanning over 30 years, Burke has amassed a decent fortune from his career.\n\nSome of the movies in which Burke appeared collected excellent revenue at the Box-Office. Here take a look:\n\nYear Movies Box-Office Collections 2004 Ladder 49 $102.3 million 2008 Twilight $407.1 million 2009 The Twilight Saga: New Moon $709.7 million 2011 Red Riding Hood $90.2 million 2011 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn (I) $712.2 million 2012 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn (II) $829.7 million 2016 Lights Out $148.9 million 2018 Breaking In $51.4 million\n\nBurke mostly appears in supporting roles in films; hence his earnings are somewhat lower than the lead casts. On average, his annual income range between $45,000-$121,876. Apart from being an actor, Burke is a producer and a writer as well. He wrote and produced the 2003 film, Something More. Likewise, he wrote the story of the 2004 film, Dead & Breakfast.\n\nNotable Works\n\nBurke began his acting career with a small role in the early 90s films and tv shows such as Daredreamer, To Cross the Rubicon, Party of Five, etc. From 2012-2014, Billy appeared as Mile Matheson in the NBC series, Revolution.

At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/21/archives/billy-burke-golfer-who-won-open-in-31.html", "page_content": "CLEARWATER, Fla., April 20 (UPI)\u2014Billy Burke, the professional golfer, died here yesterday after a long illness.

He and George Von Elm were tied at the end of regulation play in that tourney over the Inverness Golf Club course at Toledo, Ohio, and went into the playoff the next day.\n\nAt the end of the 36 holes they still were tied and had to play another 36 holes the following day. Burke won by one stroke.\n\nBurke, who played with a slightly unorthodox grip because of the loss of parts of two fingers on his left hand, was a member of the United States Ryder Cup team in 1931 and 1933 and was golf professional at the Cleveland country club for 29 years."}, {"url": "https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/the-game/golfs-forgotten-major-winners-80671", "page_content": "Today\u2019s top golf professionals are among the most highly paid sportspeople in the world. They enjoy global fame and a worldwide following. Hundreds of millions of people watch each of the game\u2019s four Major men's tournaments and the winners of these most prestigious events become household names. Golf fans would recognise tens, if not hundreds, of current professional players and, even non-golfing sports fans would be able to recall a decent number.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the case and there are many great golfing champions who have been consigned to the dustbin of history.\n\nNow, winning a single Major championship is enough to set a player up for life, whereas in days gone by it might have earned them a few hundred pounds and a pat on the back at their local club.\n\nBelow we take a look at the fascinating stories of some of those Major champions whose achievements have been forgotten, or perhaps disregarded, by all but the most enthusiastic golf statisticians.\n\nRalph Guldahl (1911 \u2013 1987)\n\nRalph Guldahl (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBorn the year before Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, Ralph Guldahl\u2019s playing career peaked and troughed twice before either of those golfing legends reached their prime. The Texan turned pro in 1931 and quickly won the Santa Monica Open; he took the Arizona Open title the following season. In the 1933 US Open, the 6 foot 2 inch 21-year-old made up nine shots on Johnny Goodman in just 11 holes at the end of the final round. Guldahl faced a four-foot putt on the last green to force a playoff. He missed and effectively gave up competitive golf for three years, returning to his home in Dallas and becoming a used car salesman. But he took up the game again in 1936 and, between 1937 and 1939 Guldahl was arguably the best player in the world. He was second in the 1937 Masters before winning the US Open at Oakland Hills by two shots. He was second again in the 1938 Masters and successfully defended his US Open title, winning this time by six strokes at Cherry Hills. In 1939 he finally got his victory at Augusta and claimed three further titles that season.\n\nFor that brief spell, Guldahl was at the very pinnacle of the sport. But from 1940 onwards he lost his game and he quit tournament golf. He played his last US Open in 1949.\n\nMany believed his involvement in the writing of an instructional book was the reason for his golfing collapse \u2013 it caused him to over-analyse his game. Guldahl put it down to a lack of competitive drive and weariness because of the travelling.\n\nHe became a teaching professional at Braemar Country Club in California in 1959 where he worked until his death in 1987. Among many others, one of his students at Braemar was eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.\n\nJack Fleck (1921 \u2013 2014)\n\nJack Fleck - 1955 US Open champion\n\nWith Ben Hogan safely in the clubhouse two clear of little-fancied Jack Fleck, almost everyone had given \u201cThe Hawk,\u201d the 1955 US Open title. NBC television finished their coverage before Fleck had completed his round, ending with a shot of Gene Sarazen congratulating Hogan on another US Open title.\n\nBut Fleck still had four to play. He birdied the 15th and 18th holes to fire a 67 and tie Hogan at the top. The following day, Fleck beat the great champion in an 18-hole playoff.\n\nFor many years after Fleck\u2019s surprise victory at Olympic Club, his triumph was dismissed as a fluke. He was portrayed as a club pro or journeyman, a one-hit-wonder. It\u2019s true he didn\u2019t exactly become a world-beater, but he won twice more on the PGA Tour, recorded 41 top-10s on the circuit and made the cut in 261 of the 271 tournaments he entered.\n\nThe truth is Fleck was not the man the vast majority of golf fans wanted to win at Olympic Club. His triumph over Hogan could be compared to Stewart Cink\u2019s playoff victory over Tom Watson at Turnberry in 2009: The golfing public longed for a different result.\n\nAt the presentation ceremony in 1955, Hogan announced he was, \u201cthrough with competitive golf.\u201d Many of those watching began crying. Even Fleck\u2019s own son said to him, \u201cI rooted for you dad but I was sorry Hogan lost.\u201d\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t until recently, and particularly with the US Open returning to Olympic Club in 2012, that Fleck\u2019s achievement was more fully appreciated.\n\nFleck drove for 49 hours from his home in Iowa to San Francisco in June 1955. He opened his US Open campaign with a 76, nine shots worse than leader Tommy Bolt.\n\nBut he bounced back with a 69 to be in contention with two rounds to play. His closing 67 was one of the great Major rounds and his playoff win over the world\u2019s best player was a phenomenal display of ability and self-belief.\n\nDick Burton (1907 \u2013 1974)\n\nDick Burton (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nRichard \u201cDick\u201d Burton held the title of Open Champion longer than any man in the history of the tournament. He lifted the Claret Jug at St Andrews in 1939 and the competition was not held again until 1946, after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nWhen sending his application to the R&A in 1946, he included a short letter - \u201cDear Sirs, Please find enclosed my fee of five guineas for this year\u2019s Open. I will bring the trophy back when I come.\u201d\n\nBurton was no flash in the pan. Club professional at Ellesmere Port (then called Hooton) Golf Club and latterly Sale Golf Club, he won his first title at the 1934 Northern Professional Championship. He won seven professional tournaments and played three times in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBut his Open victory in the home of golf was his finest moment. Needing to shoot 72 in the final round to win, Burton birdied the 18th to beat Johnny Bulla by two strokes. Just a few weeks later war broke out and Burton enlisted in the RAF.\n\nIn later life, Burton was asked if he felt regret at not being able to take advantage of his Open triumph.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough,\u201d he replied. \u201cA lot of those who watched me at St Andrews also went off to war and they never came back. Some of my friends didn\u2019t make it either, I did.\u201d\n\nLionel Hebert (1928 \u2013 2000)\n\nLionel Hebert (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs a young adult, Lionel Hebert had to make a decision whether to be a golfer or a musician. He was an excellent trumpet player and had gone to Louisiana State University to study music.\n\nBut, following in his brother Jay\u2019s footsteps, Lionel decided to embark on a career as a pro golfer.\n\nThe Heberts (pronounced A-bear) were Cajuns \u2013 an ethnic group found mainly in Louisiana, descended from French speaking Acadians (now a part of Canada.)\n\nLionel and Jay are the only brothers to have won the USPGA Championship. Lionel was the last match-play winner in 1957, while Jay took the title in stroke-play format in 1960.\n\nLionel played an incredible 580 events on the PGA Tour and senior tour. He was twice chairman of the PGA tournament committee and a founding member of the senior tour. But he never travelled to play in the Open championship as he maintained the trip was, \u201ctoo pricey.\u201d\n\nHerman Keiser (1914 \u2013 2003)\n\nHerman Keiser (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe 1946 Masters marked the re-start of significant professional golf following the Second World War. The stars of the day had gathered and the Augusta patrons anticipated a great battle between Hogan, Snead and Nelson.\n\nBut, after three rounds it was a relatively unknown pro from Missouri \u2013 Herman Keiser \u2013 who held a five-shot lead.\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe Missouri Mortician\u201d for the somber expression he wore on the golf course, Keiser had served 31 months at sea during the war, aboard the U.S.S Cincinnati.\n\nHogan caught Keiser with one hole to play at Augusta but \u201dThe Hawk\u201d three-putted the final green and Keiser was the champion.\n\nKeiser played in the Ryder Cup of 1947 when the US won by 11-1. That one point for Britain came courtesy of Keiser\u2019s singles defeat by Sam King. \u201cThe Mortician\u201d quit competitive golf in the mid 1950s and bought a driving range in Ohio.\n\nAndy North (born 1950)\n\nAndy North - Twice US Open champion\n\nBest known to golf fans as a television commentator, Andy North won three events on the PGA Tour. There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about that, except two of those titles were the US Open.\n\nNorth had won the 1977 Westchester Classic, but coming into the 1978 US Open at Cherry Hills he could have been fairly described as a good journeyman. He wasn\u2019t considered a contender, but he outlasted Nicklaus, Watson, Miller and Player to win by a stroke.\n\nHe disappeared off the golfing radar again through the early 80s, recording just nine top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour between 1979 and 1984. But he reappeared in 1985 to win the US Open again, this time at Oakland Hills. After 1985, North recorded just three more top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.\n\nBilly Burke (1902 \u2013 1972)\n\nBilly Burke - 1931 US Open champion\n\nBilly Burke\u2019s victory in the 1931 US Open was notable for two reasons: He was the first Major champion to use steel-shafted clubs and his triumph came after the longest playoff in Major history.\n\nAfter four rounds at the Inverness Golf Club in Toledo, Burke was tied at the top of the leaderboard with George Von Elm. They returned for a 36-hole playoff the following day and were still tied after that. Another 36-hole playoff ensued and, this time Burke won by one \u2013 144 holes and 589 strokes, compared to Von Elm\u2019s 590.\n\nHaving lost a finger working in a foundry as a teenager, Burke used an unorthodox grip with considerable success. He recorded 80 top-10 finishes during his PGA Tour career. The son of Polish immigrants, Burke (born Burkowski) played in the Ryder Cups of 1931 and 33 and was undefeated.\n\nOther Forgotten Major Winners\n\nThe forgotten Major winners talked about above were just some of those considered in the research for this piece. There are numerous others, and too many to cover in detail.\n\nFor example, Walter Burkemo, the 1953 USPGA champion. He had only one other PGA Tour win during his career and quit the tour in 1954 to go back to life as a club pro.\n\nDick Mayer won the 1957 US Open, and was PGA Tour player of the year. But he battled with alcoholism and it\u2019s generally viewed this prevented him winning more. He died aged 64.\n\nDick Mayer - 1957 US Open champion\n\nAccording to Sam Snead and Ben Hogan, 1950 USPGA champion Chandler Harper was the best putter in the world. He was a great friend of Bobby Jones and, in later life, became a mentor to Curtis Strange.\n\nHow about back-to-back English winners of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1936 \u2013 Alf Perry and Alf Padgham? Perry\u2019s best Open finish was a tie for 17th prior to winning at Muirfield in 1935 while Padgham, having left his clubs in the Hoylake pro-shop overnight, had to break a window to retrieve them in time for his third round in 1936.\n\nAlf Perry - 1935 Open Champion\n\nAll these men earned some sort of fame from golf, no matter how briefly. But none were rewarded financially to anywhere near the extent of today\u2019s Major winners whose lives are changed for good by the endorsements and invitations that flow in. So when the green jacket is presented next April, spare a thought for Ralph Guldahl. When the Claret Jug is lofted at Royal Troon, consider Dick Burton and the two Alfs.\n\nThese great old warriors make up an important part of golf\u2019s rich tapestry, it\u2019s just the patch they occupy has become a touch faded."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/billy.burke/1754184", "page_content": "Billy Burke\n\ngolfer\n\nDecember 14, 1902 (age 69) Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nHe was also selected for the 1933 Ryder Cup team but not before some agitation by Gene Sarazen was done on his behalf. He and George Von Elm were tied at 292 (8-over-par) after regulation play. They played a 36-hole playoff the next day and tied again at 149 (7-over-par). The following day they played 36 more holes and Burke emerged victorious 148 to 149. Throughout Burke\"s golf career he used an unorthodox grip due to the loss of two fingers on his left hand.

His father, he had learned just hours before, had gone missing, and now he was asking the public for help. He began to cry as he shared his heart-wrenching story with the world.\n\n\u201cLast Sunday, nine days ago, my dad took some clothes, he took some cash, he got in his truck and drove away and no one has heard from him since. So he\u2019s been gone about nine days, I guess. No one really knows why. It\u2019s complete speculation as to why he left. He\u2019s been married to my mom for 30-plus years. You know, they still live in the house that I grew up in in Leesburg and I\u2019m just hoping that there\u2019s a story that maybe he goes to pgatour.com to check my tee time or check my score and sees this and understands that dad, we love you and we want you to come home.\u201d\n\nSadly, the story was met with a tragic end.\n\nBilly\u2019s father, Willard, went on to take his own life. Now, about a year-and-a-half on, Hurley is opening up it all. In a long and beautifully written piece on The Players\u2019 Tribune, Hurley describes how he felt in the lead-up to the event.\n\nAnd then \u2014 with kids running around the house laughing while Heather moved boxes \u2014 I found out about everything. I found out that you just got up and left. I found out that you had walked out the front door without saying anything to Mom, and then gotten in your truck and driven away. I found out you didn\u2019t have your cell phone. You didn\u2019t have your computer. You didn\u2019t have anything. You were just \u2026 gone.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get through the piece because it\u2019s so thick with Hurley\u2019s emotion. But even so, through all the conflicted feelings, the piece ends on an optimistic note. He knows he\u2019ll never get total clarity on the situation, but he doesn\u2019t need to, Hurley writes. He wants to remember the good times.\n\nI miss you, Dad. I love you. And one final thing I need you to know: I forgive you. Your legacy will live forever.\n\nGive it a read. You won\u2019t regret it."}, {"url": "https://www.deseret.com/2012/6/16/20419231/life-fortress-a-father-son-bond-is-priceless-for-professional-golfers-billy-and-bobby-casper", "page_content": "A lot of the things I\u2019ve experience in my life, I owe to him. His commitment to his family, his dedication to the game, the great example he is to his children is something I\u2019ll always cherish, respect and appreciate. \u2013 Bobby Casper\n\nHe stands across the table from Hall of Fame golfer Billy Casper at the Olympic Club in San Francisco this week and his love and appreciation for his father knows no bounds.\n\nBobby Casper knows the bond between a father and son can be a life fortress. He has dwelt in that castle all his life.\n\nThis week the 51-year old from Mapleton watched his father return to the site of his remarkable comeback victory over Arnold Palmer in the 1966 U.S. Open and perched at a table in the merchandise center at the Olympic Club, signing copies of his book \"The Big Three and Me.\" He's seen golf fans line up at the table as his father has greeted them for hours ever day.\n\nHe's watched as his father did interviews with national golf writers and personalities including Jaime Diaz of Golf Digest and NBC's Johnny Miller and Bob Costas.\n\nBobby has watched as his father, now late in years, is receiving well-deserved recognition as one of the most prolific golfers who ever lived. His remarkable 51 PGA Tour victories, three major championships including two U.S. Opens, the most career wins and points in Ryder Cup competition. The list goes on.\n\nBut here, at the Olympic Club, it all holds a special place for Billy. When he birdied No. 15 in the final round of the 1966 Open and Palmer made bogey, he continued the charge from five strokes back to force a playoff. He promptly throttled the legend the next 22 holes, and Palmer was never the same.\n\nPeople talk about the Big Three, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, but it should have been \u2014 for all time \u2014 Nicklaus, Palmer and Casper. If you lay out the record, Casper's career clearly eclipses that of Player. The difference, back in the day, is that Nicklaus, Palmer and Player were represented by sports agent Mark McCormick and that made all the difference between created fame and enjoyed fortune.\n\nBobby Casper grew up following his father all over the world. \"When I was a senior in high school we went over to Kenya where he played in the European Tour and that was the first time I met Seve Ballesteros. We always had opportunities to go places, like Morocco, Japan and New Zealand,\" said Bobby. It was the time of his life.\n\n\"I remember when we'd go to the Western Open, which is the BMW Championship today. He was represented by Wilson's Sporting Goods at that time. He'd go into the factory to get his clubs re-gripped with the old leather grips. When he'd be doing that, I got turned loose on the catalog and ordering all the sports equipment I could get my hands on, whether it was baseball, tennis, mitts, basketballs or baseballs.\"\n\nWhen Billy left home to compete, he'd be gone for two weeks at a time, but when he came home, it was his time to get away from it all. One of his favorite things to do was take his family, his sons, sport fishing out of the Port of San Diego. \"We'd do that for two weeks and then Dad would settle down and practice and get ready to play again.\"\n\nBilly said his commitment to get back to the game, both then and now, has been an example to him. His father was a dedicated competitor who practiced his craft and has always been giving of his time and talent to advance the game. Even today he holds a charity event at San Diego Country Club after the Masters every year to benefit the Boys & Girls Club. It raises $150,000 a year, for a total of more than $3 million since it was created.\n\nWhat would Bobby want people to remember about Billy?\n\n\"He's always been underestimated, as far as the game goes,\" said Bobby, who pointed to the marketing plan by McCormick. I don't think people realize the record he had and how good he was as a player over time. He's seventh all time in career wins on tour.\"\n\nThe new book, coauthored by Lee Benson and James Parkinson, is a great starting point to understand exactly who Billy Casper is and what he did.\n\n\"It's been really good for him. It's almost like his life story. In reading it, I've learned things about him that I never knew, and I've known him all my life.\n\n\"People have received it well and there have been great comments and feedback. It's an easy, fast read; its informative, and it keeps you enthralled in what's taken place. It's been fun to hear comments from people who never knew where he came from and what he's been through in his life.\"\n\nOn this Father's Day, Bobby said he'd like to express his gratitude and appreciation to his father for all he's given him and allowed him to experience in his life. A professional golfer himself, Bobby is a golf sportscaster and is covering the U.S. Open this week for the PGA Tour Network, which can be heard on SiriusXM satellite radio.\n\n\"A lot of the things I've experience in my life, I owe to him. His commitment to his family, his dedication to the game, the great example he is to his children is something I'll always cherish, respect and appreciate.\"\n\nOn Monday, Bobby will try to qualify for the U.S. Senior Championship in San Diego while his son, Mason, who qualified for the NCAA West Regional as a star at Utah Valley University, will attempt to qualify for the U.S. Amateur Public Links this week at Glen Eagle.\n\nThat is three generations of outstanding and talented golf in the Casper family.\n\nBobby's admiration for his father has an added dimension because as a father of five children of his own, he understands what it takes to raise kids. Billy Casper and his wife Shirley had a big family, made larger when they began adopting children. This unselfish parenthood garnered the attention of the American Mother's Association who named Shirley the California and National Mother of the Year in 1970.\n\nOne of his adopted sons, David, was named after LDS President David O. McKay. The Caspers raised David the same as the others, with love, support, kindness and many opportunities including caddying for Billy just like his brothers.\n\nBut David walked to his own drummer and made some horrible choices with friends, drugs and criminal activity. He is currently in prison in Ely, Nev. When he gets out, because he is a three-time convicted felon in California, he'll be taken to the Golden State where he will be imprisoned for the remainder of his life.\n\nBefore being incarcerated, David went on a 40-day crime spree in 1999 through California and Nevada that included 35 armed robberies and two car hijackings. All involved the use of a gun, his judgment clouded by addictions.\n\nWhile playing with Billy two years ago at East Bay Golf Course, I asked the superstar and legend about David. Tears came quickly to his eyes and he could not find the words to explain David. \"It's a tragedy,\" he said.\n\nBilly explains in his book, when David was sentenced to 105 years in prison, he stood before the judge and explained how sorry he was for his family. He turned and looked at his mother and father and siblings and said, \"I want them to know I take full responsibility for everything that has happened. I would change everything if I could. It is not their fault.\"\n\nWrites Billy, \"No one in the family gave up on David then, and no one ever will. In our faith, we are taught that families are forever and so is forgiveness. Whatever David has to answer for in this life, he must answer for, but our love and hope for him is unconditional and everlasting and goes infinitely beyond any life sentence.\"\n\nBobby describes his father's challenges with David as a heartbreaking part of his life.\n\n\"We all make mistakes and its all about decisions and choices. As a parent, there's only so much you can to do teach and provide direction for your kids. David had the same opportunities as the rest of us. Dad was gone at times playing golf but David had chances to go with him and caddy for him and be with him and he chose not to. When my Dad talks about him, it tears him up. It tears my mom up, too. Because they know his potential and know the abilities he has and he chose to get involved in drugs and activities and friends that didn't lead him to where he should have been. There's only so much you can do as a father, but I will say, it is probably the biggest regret of his life.\"\n\nToday, as the U.S. Open winds down and Billy and Bobby Casper share this week in San Francisco as father and son, the legacy of the father casts a big shadow over the storied Olympic Club where he took Palmer down.

He was of Lithuanian descent.\n\nProfessional career [ edit ]\n\nHis greatest season was 1931, when he won the U.S. Open, reached the semi-finals of the PGA Championship, and won four events on the professional circuit, plus appeared on the Ryder Cup team where he was undefeated in two matches. He was also selected for the 1933 Ryder Cup team but not before some agitation by Gene Sarazen was done on his behalf.[1] Burke won his only match in the 1933 competition.\n\nBurke's 1931 U.S. Open win came in a marathon playoff. He and George Von Elm were tied at 292 (8-over-par) after regulation play. They played a 36-hole playoff the next day and tied again at 149 (7-over-par). The following day they played 36 more holes and Burke emerged victorious 148 to 149.\n\nThroughout Burke's golf career he used an unorthodox grip due to the loss of two fingers on his left hand.[2] In 2005, Burke was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.[3] Burke died in Clearwater, Florida, in 1972.\n\nHonors and awards [ edit ]\n\nIn 1963, Burke was inducted into the Connecticut Golf Hall of Fame\n\nProfessional wins (17) [ edit ]\n\nPGA Tour wins (13) [ edit ]\n\nMajor championship is shown in bold.\n\nOther wins (4) [ edit ]\n\nthis list may be incomplete\n\nMajor championships [ edit ]\n\nWins (1) [ edit ]\n\nYear Championship 54 holes Winning score Margin Runner-up 1931 U.S. Open 2 shot deficit +8 (73-72-74-73=292) Playoff 1 George Von Elm\n\n1 Defeated George Von Elm in a playoff.

Someone could do what Bobby Jones did in 1930 (calendar year Grand Slam) or what Tiger Woods did in 2000-01 (four consecutive major wins). But the 1931 U.S. Open is a stubborn exception.\n\nNobody will ever win the national championship in the manner of Billy Burke 90 years ago this week.\n\nTournaments aren\u2019t even decided by 18-hole playoffs anymore\u2014it\u2019s either sudden death or an aggregate format of a couple of holes\u2014so the fact that Burke had to go through two 36-hole playoffs following 72 holes of medal play to defeat George Von Elm at Inverness Club in Toledo makes his achievement the ultimate outlier.\n\n\u201cApparently they are going on forever,\u201d Grantland Rice wrote in his syndicated column after the first playoff. \u201cAfter the most sensational 36-hole playoff in the history of golf, they are still tied up in a two-ply Gordian Knot at 149 strokes each. There were enough fireworks in this contest to make the fall of Pompeii look like a single Roman candle.\u201d\n\nHyperbolic to be sure, but Rice had a point. There were 25 lead changes over the 72 playoff holes. After making a birdie putt on the 72nd hole of regulation, Von Elm did it again on the 36th playoff hole to force another long day.\n\nBurke\u2019s count that early July week in Ohio: 144 holes, 589 strokes, 32 cigars, a one-stroke margin over Von Elm. The winner did it in scorching heat\u2014there a number of heat-related deaths in the area\u2014and on the heels of 72 holes of Ryder Cup qualifying and 72 holes of match-play competition in late June as . When Burke set out for Niagara Falls and a delayed honeymoon with his wife, Marguerite, after being the last man standing at Inverness, he had played 288 holes in 16 days.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that Burke was the first golfer to win a major title with steel shafts in his clubs (Von Elm was still using hickory), but he also did it with a lighter, 1.55 ounce ball that the USGA had mandated for that season to put more challenge into the game. Like the 36-hole playoff format, the lighter ball was gone after 1931.\n\nBurke was born in 1902, the same year as Jones and Gene Sarazen. William John Burkowski grew up in Naugatuck, Conn., and like Eugenio Saraceni came from a working-class family. \u201cHe impresses me as a player who has learned his game through a lot of hard work,\" Jones wrote in the The American Golfer, \"as contrasted to one who has come by it easily and naturally.\" John Kiernan of The New York Times observed that Burke was \u201ca square-shouldered stalwart who might pass as pugilist or a heavy-hitting second baseman.\u201d\n\nBurke succeeded at golf despite a disability from an accident in an iron foundry. (The New York Daily News)\n\nBurke did wear a small glove on his left hand, an accommodation for a disability after an accident at an iron foundry as a teenager cost him parts of two fingers. Having gotten exposed to golf as a young caddie at Naugatuck Golf Club (now Hop Brook Golf Course), Burke also toiled at other jobs including an office janitor and at factories making boots and safety pins before becoming a golf pro. For Burke, playing a sport for a living\u2014even a marathon championship in the heat\u2014really was a \u201cgolden grind,\u201d to use Al Barkow\u2019s wonderful term from his important 1974 history of the tour.\n\nFollowing his U.S. Open victory, Golf Illustrated predicted Burke was \u201ca new star who is destined long to shine.\u201d Credited with 11 PGA Tour victories, Burke didn\u2019t win another major title but had two third-place finishes in the Masters (1934 and 1939) and put up an admirable defense of his U.S. Open victory in 1932, tying for seventh.\n\nThe man who prevailed in a 72-hole playoff died in 1972, at age 69."}]}
