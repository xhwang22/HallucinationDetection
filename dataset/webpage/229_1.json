He was married in Erfurt on 15 July 1834, to Christine Sophia n\u00e9e Burgraf, the daughter of Johann Andreas Burggraf and Friedericke Louise Elizabeth n\u00e9e Beulke. They had at least three children: Johann (pastor in Bergholz, New York), Wilhelm (married Maria von Rohr, pastor in Cedarburg, Wisconsin), and Beata (whose married name was Gram). Grabau died on 2 June 1879 in Buffalo, New York.\n\n\n\nGrabau was educated at the grammar school in Olvenstedt (1809-1818), the Magdeburg Gymnasium (1818-1825) and finally at the University of Halle (1825-1829). After three years as a teacher in Magdeburg and Sachsa bei Nordhausen, Grabau was ordained and installed as pastor of St. Andrew\u2019s Church in Erfurt in June 1834.\n\n\n\nIn 1836 Grabau ran afoul of the Prussian state church for his opposition to the Union Agenda. After two years\u2019 imprisonment (1837-1839), Grabau was finally granted permission to emigrate along with his congregation. This group, under the leadership of Grabau and Captain Heinrich von Rohr, departed for America in the summer of 1839. Grabau and a majority of his congregation settled in Buffalo while von Rohr and some of the families continued to Wisconsin. In Buffalo the settlers established Trinity Old Lutheran Church, quickly followed by the founding of a school.\n\n\n\nGrabau and his congregation soon met with controversy, however. First was a split with a congregation of Silesian Lutherans who had accompanied Grabau\u2019s congregation across the Atlantic. While the Silesian pastor, Leberecht Friedrich Ehregott Krause, was in Germany, Grabau excommunicated the Silesians because of an unsettled debt to the shipping agent who had arranged their passage. The Silesians denied Grabau\u2019s authority in the matter, but Pr. Krause, who passed through Buffalo again in 1841 on his way to take up a call to Wisconsin, sided with Grabau. The Silesians approached the Saxon pastor E.M. B\u00fcrger [Buerger] who was passing through Buffalo at the time, intending to return to Germany, and B\u00fcrger, having investigated the situation, finally accepted their call and became the pastor of the congregation, known in distinction from Grabau\u2019s as First Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\n\n\nRelations between Grabau\u2019s group and the Saxon Lutherans in Missouri had already been placed on a shaky footing by Grabau\u2019s 1840 Hirtenbrief, a letter which he had written in response to the situation of the emigrants who had traveled with von Rohr to Freistadt, Wisconsin. In the absence of a pastor, they had appointed a schoolteacher to preach and administer the sacraments among them, a practice of which Grabau strongly disapproved. Grabau sent a copy of the Hirtenbrief to C.F.W. Walther and G.H. Loeber. The Missouri pastors disagreed with Grabau\u2019s teaching but were not able to send a response until 1843. An increasingly acrimonious exchange between the two groups continued for several decades, providing impetus for Walther\u2019s Voice of our Church on the Question Concerning the Church and the Ministry. The gap between Grabau and the Saxons widened further as portions of the Wisconsin congregations in Freistadt, Milwaukee, and Kirchhayn, offended by Pr. Krause\u2019s liberal use of excommunication, sought Saxon pastors to serve them.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Grabau proceeded with the work of church organization. In 1845 the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia [Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche] was formed by Grabau, von Rohr (who had in the meantime been trained and ordained as a pastor), Krause and Pr. G. A. Kindermann, a Pomeranian whose congregation had emigrated to Wisconsin. Grabau was elected senior ministerii or president of the synod, popularly known as the Buffalo Synod. The synodical paper, Kirchliches Informatorium, was established in 1851 under Grabau\u2019s editorship. In 1853/4 the Synod established the German Martin Luther College in Buffalo with Grabau as its rector.\n\n\n\nIn 1866 a schism arose within the Buffalo Synod itself. At the synodical assembly in June of that year, a majority of the Buffalo pastors, including von Rohr, turned against Grabau, accusing him of false doctrine. Grabau and three pastors withdrew, claiming to constitute the legitimate Buffalo Synod. In November von Rohr and his fellow pastors agreed to a colloquium with representatives of the Missouri Synod. As a result of this meeting, a majority of the Buffalo Synod pastors, under the leadership of Pr. Christian Hochstetter of Buffalo, joined the Missouri Synod at once. A rump group, under von Rohr\u2019s leadership until his death in 1874, continued to constitute a separate Buffalo Synod until 1877.\n\n\n\nGrabau continued as pastor of Trinity Old Lutheran Church in Buffalo and as president of the Buffalo Synod, which consisted of Grabau and those pastors who had refused to join in the condemnation of 1866. After a legal battle with von Rohr\u2019s Buffalo Synod, Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College in Buffalo and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau\u2019s synod after 1866 was Die Wachende Kirche, under his editorship. He continued in these responsibilities until his death on 2 June 1879."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/126206609/johannes-andreas_august-grabau", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

In 1836, he announced that as a strict Lutheran he could no longer use the Union liturgy, and when his superiors failed to persuade him he was deposed from office and forbidden to enter his church. He conducted services in private houses in defiance of the authorities until he was arrested March 1, 1837, and imprisoned at Heiligenstadt. In September, he escaped. With his rescuer, Capt. Heinrich K. G. von Rohr, who had been dismissed from the Prussian army for opposing the Union, he made his way about the country visiting sympathizers as far away as Stettin. On September 21, 1838, he was captured and remanded to prison. Finally, he received permission to emigrate; Von Rohr gathered a company of one thousand with Grabau as their pastor, and in June and July 1839, they sailed from Hamburg in five ships. Grabau and the greater part of the company settled in Buffalo in October. There he was pastor of the DreifaltigkeitsKirche for almost forty years. In 1840, with Von Rohr as his first pupil, he opened a school, later known as Martin Luther Seminary, to train candidates for the ministry. On July 15, 1845, Grabau, Von Rohr, and three other clergymen met at Milwaukee and organized the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia, which soon became known as the Buffalo Synod. In 1853-54, he and Von Rohr visited Germany to confer with Wilhelm Lohe on matters of doctrine. From 1842 until 1866, he carried on a fierce controversy with C. F. W. Walther and other theologians of the Missouri Synod on the subject of ordination, the ministry, and the church. The Missouri Synod made the controversy into a war of extermination against Grabau and his followers, set up rival congregations and rejoiced when the Buffalo Synod split into three factions in 1866. The largest faction, consisting of Christian Hochstetter and eleven other pastors, promptly allied themselves with the Missourians; Von Rohr continued at the head of his party until his death in 1874; and Grabau, with a few pastors still loyal to him, kept open his seminary, started a new paper, Die Wachende Kirche, to take the place of the old Informatorium, which remained in Von Rohr\u2019s possession, and was elected Senior Ministerii of the new Buffalo Synod. The last years of his life were peaceful.

Am 14.10.1831 wurde er Lehrer an der M\u00e4dchenschule in Magdeburg, im August 1832 Rektor der Schule in Sachsa.\n\nAm 20.02.1833 bestand er sein 2. Theologisches Examen. Nach eine Probepredigt am 16.02.1834 in Erfurt wurde am 03.05.1834 seine Berufung an die Andreaskirche vom Magistrat der Stadt best\u00e4tigt. Ordiniert wurde Grabau am 17.06 1834 durch Senior Johann Friedrich M\u00f6ller in der Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche. Am 22.06.1834 fand seine Einf\u00fchrung in der Andreaskirche statt.\n\nAm 11.09.1836 erkl\u00e4rte er \u00f6ffentlich im Gottesdienst, die neue preu\u00dfische Unions-Agende nicht mehr gebrauchen zu k\u00f6nnen, weder f\u00fcr die Abendmahlsfeier, noch f\u00fcr Taufen oder andere Amtshandlungen, weil sie das lutherische Bekenntnis leugne oder abschw\u00e4che. In der folgenden Woche wurde ihm daraufhin seine Suspension und das Verbot, seine Kirche zu betreten von einem Polizeikommissar \u00fcberbracht. Am 18.09.1836 wurde die Andreaskirche von Polizei umstellt, um ihn daran zu hindern, Gottesdienst zu halten. Zun\u00e4chst trafen sich die Gemeindeglieder, die Grabau folgen wollten, im Pfarrhaus. Bald wurde auch das verboten. Der M\u00fchlenbesitzer Friedrich Filss stellte das oberer Stockwerk seiner Storchm\u00fchle f\u00fcr Gottesdienste zur Verf\u00fcgung. (Informationen stammen aus einem Vortrag zum 170-j\u00e4hrigen Gemeindejubil\u00e4um der Christus \u2013 Kirchengemeinde Erfurt, gehalten am 07.10.2006).\n\nSein gr\u00f6\u00dfter Widersacher in Erfurt war der Pfarrer und Senior Johann Friedrich M\u00f6ller.\n\nGrabau gilt als Gr\u00fcnder der Altlutherischen Gemeinde Erfurts, die sp\u00e4tere Christusgemeinde.\n\nVerfolgt und wiederholt mit Gef\u00e4ngnis bestraft, entschloss er sich im Sommer 1839 mit etwa 1.000 Anh\u00e4ngern zur Auswanderung nach Nordamerika und lie\u00df sich in und um Buffalo nieder. Mit seinen Anh\u00e4ngern gr\u00fcndete er die heute noch im Gro\u00dfraum Buffalo bestehnde Dreifaltigkeitsgemeinde. Grabau blieb ihr Pfarrer bis an sein Lebensende.\n\nAm 15.07.1845 gr\u00fcndete er mit vier Pastoren die \"Synode der aus Preu\u00dfen eingewanderten Lutheraner\", die sich sp\u00e4ter \"Buffalosynode\" nannte. Ihre theologische Lehranstalt war das \"Martin-Luther-Kollegium\" in Buffalo.\n\nGrabau vertrat einen extremen lutherischen Amtsbegriff, wonach das Amt der Gemeinde \u00fcbergeordnet ist, w\u00e4hrend Karl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther, der Mitbegr\u00fcnder und F\u00fchrer der 1847 gegr\u00fcndeten \"Missourisynode\", erkl\u00e4rte, das Predigtamt sei das \"in Funktion gesetzte allgemeine Pristertum\". Wegen der Lehre von Kirche und Amt entbrannte zwischen den beiden streng lutherischen Synoden ein heftiger Streit, der 1866 durch das \"Kolloquium\" mit der \"Missourisynode\" zu einem vorl\u00e4ufigen Abschluss kam: 11 Pastoren der \"Buffalosynode\" schlossen sich nach diesem Kolloquium der \"Missourisynode\" an, w\u00e4hrend sich Grabau mit dem geringen Rest f\u00fcr die Fortsetzung der alten \"Buffalosynode\" erkl\u00e4rte. Er f\u00fchrte danach mit den ihm treu gebliebenen Gemeinden das 1840 in Buffalo gegr\u00fcndete Martin-Luther-Kollegium weiter und gab neben dem Kirchenblatt \"Die wachende Kirche\" auch Synodalbriefe, ein Gesangbuch und eine Agende heraus.\n\nAm 15.07.1834 hatte er Christine Sophia Burggraf in der Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche geheiratet.\n\nKinder: Wilhelm Grabau, geboren am 23.01.1835 in Erfurt, gestorben am 29.11.1906\n\nJohannes J.

Geburts- und 125. Todestag erinnert werden soll, erwarb sich schon fr\u00fch den Ruf eines \u00fcberaus begabten Kanzelredners und aufopferungsvollen Seelsorgers. Doch im theologischen Richtungs-Streit seiner Zeit, bei dem er einen strikt lutherischen Kurs vertrat und eine gro\u00dfe Eigenwilligkeit entwickelte, kollidierte er mit seinen kirchlichen Vorgesetzten,\n\nMagdeburg. Diese Kollision brachte ihm die Entlassung und dann auch Haftstrafen, ehe er mit Gleichgesinnten nach Nordamerika auswanderte, wo er zum umstrittenen Kirchenf\u00fchrer der so genannten \"Buffalo-Synode\" avancierte. Damit schrieb er in den jungen USA gewisserma\u00dfen Kirchengeschichte.\n\nGrabau wurde am 18. M\u00e4rz 1804 in Olvenstedt (heute zu Magdeburg) geboren. Sein Vater war ein wohlhabender Bauer, der ihm eine umfangreiche Schulbildung erm\u00f6glichte. Zun\u00e4chst absolvierte der vielseitig interessierte Knabe das Domgymnasium in Magdeburg, ehe er 1825 in Halle ein Theologiestudium aufnahm.\n\nAb 1830 fungierte der Jung-Theologe in Magdeburg und dann in Sachsa als Lehrer. 1934 wurde Grabau zum Pfarrer von St. Andreas nach Erfurt berufen. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser materiellen Sicherstellung heiratete er im gleichen Jahr die Kanzlistentochter Christiane Sophie Burggraf. Doch da er sich im Theologen-Streit als orthodoxer Lutheraner erwies, der keine Kompromisse einging und sich schlie\u00dflich auch weigerte, die unierte Liturgie weiter zu benutzen, begab er sich in seiner Amtsf\u00fchrung auf Glatteis. Seine sonstige Milde, seelsorgerische Umsicht und Kanzelbegabung halfen ihm nicht, als er auf seine Orientierung beharrte. Grabau wurde als Pfarrer von St. Andreas in Erfurt abgesetzt. Doch das machte ihn nur noch hartn\u00e4ckiger. F\u00fcr seine nicht unbetr\u00e4chtlichen Anh\u00e4nger hielt er in Privath\u00e4usern Gottesdienst. Die Kirchenoberen drangen auf Strafe. Der Staat war gefordert. Grabau wurde wiederholt verhaftet und letzlich verurteilt. Auf den eigenwilligen Theologen wartete das Gef\u00e4ngnis. Doch auch hier hatte er Anh\u00e4nger.\n\nMit Unterst\u00fctzung des Hauptmanns Heinrich von Rohr, der dann aus dem preu\u00dfischen Dienst entlassen wurde, gelang Grabau die Flucht. Danach einigten sich beide Parteien, der Theologe mit seiner Anh\u00e4ngerschar und die preu\u00dfische Regierung, auf einen Kompromiss. Den rund 1000 Abweichlern wurde mit Grabau und Rohr die Ausreise nach den USA erlaubt. F\u00fcnf Schiffe brachten die Unruhestifter in die Neue Welt, wo sie sich 1839 um Buffalo niederlie\u00dfen. Die unierte Kirche war mit dieser L\u00f6sung zufrieden. Die preu\u00dfische Regierung hatte einen Unruheherd weniger. Und Grabau jubelte mit seinen J\u00fcngern \u00fcber den salomonischen Ausweg.\n\nDer selbst ernannte Bewahrer der lutherischen Kirche gr\u00fcndete in Buffalo die Dreifaltigkeitsgemeinde, deren Hauptpfarrer er bis an sein Lebensende blieb. Nach seinen Vorstellungen sollten sich alle lutherischen Gemeinden in Nordamerika zu einer strikt lutherischen Synode zusammenschlie\u00dfen.\n\nDoch seine Orthodoxie, sein F\u00fchrungsanspruch und seine Unf\u00e4higkeit, Andersdenkende zu integrieren, brachten das kirchenpolitische Gro\u00dfprojekt zum Scheitern. So beschr\u00e4nkte sich seine Kirche auf die \"aus Preu\u00dfen ausgewanderte lutherische Kirche\" mit Hauptsitz Buffalo, die deshalb auch als \"Buffalo-Synode\" in die Geschichte einging. Unbeschadet der R\u00fcckschl\u00e4ge in der Neuen Welt setzte Grabau seine kompromisslose Haltung auch nach der Beschr\u00e4nkung auf Buffalo und Umgebung fort. So attackierte er wegen ritueller Auslegungsfragen die viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere Missouri-Gemeinde seines Konkurrenten Walther. Das war dann auch seinem bisherigen Gefolgsmann Rohr zu viel, der sich mit anderen Gl\u00e4ubigen von Grabau lossagte. Doch der Oberhirte von Buffalo blieb sich auch weiter treu. Er betrieb mit dem Rest seiner Anh\u00e4nger das \"Luther-Seminar\", gab eine Kirchen-Zeitung und ein Kirchen-Gesangbuch heraus.\n\nEr galt schlie\u00dflich als \"Senior Ministerii\" seiner \"Buffalo-Synode\". In dieser Stellung starb er vor 125 Jahren, am 2.

Grabau sent a copy of the Hirtenbrief to C.F.W. Walther and G.H. Loeber. The Missouri pastors disagreed with Grabau\u2019s teaching but were not able to send a response until 1843. An increasingly acrimonious exchange between the two groups continued for several decades, providing impetus for Walther\u2019s Voice of our Church on the Question Concerning the Church and the Ministry. The gap between Grabau and the Saxons widened further as portions of the Wisconsin congregations in Freistadt, Milwaukee, and Kirchhayn, offended by Pr. Krause\u2019s liberal use of excommunication, sought Saxon pastors to serve them.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Grabau proceeded with the work of church organization. In 1845 the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia [Synode der aus Preussen ausgewanderten lutherischen Kirche] was formed by Grabau, von Rohr (who had in the meantime been trained and ordained as a pastor), Krause and Pr. G. A. Kindermann, a Pomeranian whose congregation had emigrated to Wisconsin. Grabau was elected senior ministerii or president of the synod, popularly known as the Buffalo Synod. The synodical paper, Kirchliches Informatorium, was established in 1851 under Grabau\u2019s editorship. In 1853/4 the Synod established the German Martin Luther College in Buffalo with Grabau as its rector.\n\n\n\nIn 1866 a schism arose within the Buffalo Synod itself. At the synodical assembly in June of that year, a majority of the Buffalo pastors, including von Rohr, turned against Grabau, accusing him of false doctrine. Grabau and three pastors withdrew, claiming to constitute the legitimate Buffalo Synod. In November von Rohr and his fellow pastors agreed to a colloquium with representatives of the Missouri Synod. As a result of this meeting, a majority of the Buffalo Synod pastors, under the leadership of Pr. Christian Hochstetter of Buffalo, joined the Missouri Synod at once. A rump group, under von Rohr\u2019s leadership until his death in 1874, continued to constitute a separate Buffalo Synod until 1877.\n\n\n\nGrabau continued as pastor of Trinity Old Lutheran Church in Buffalo and as president of the Buffalo Synod, which consisted of Grabau and those pastors who had refused to join in the condemnation of 1866. After a legal battle with von Rohr\u2019s Buffalo Synod, Grabau retained control of the Martin Luther College in Buffalo and remained as its rector. The official organ of Grabau\u2019s synod after 1866 was Die Wachende Kirche, under his editorship. He continued in these responsibilities until his death on 2 June 1879."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/johannes.grabau/3766575", "page_content": "Johannes Grabau\n\nclergyman\n\nMarch 18, 1804 (age 75) Stadtkreis Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany\n\nAfter teaching for four years in Magdeburg and Sachsa, Grabau was elected pastor of St. Andreas in Erfurt March 3, 1834, and was ordained June 17, in the Barfiisser Kirche. In 1836, he announced that as a strict Lutheran he could no longer use the Union liturgy, and when his superiors failed to persuade him he was deposed from office and forbidden to enter his church. He conducted services in private houses in defiance of the authorities until he was arrested March 1, 1837, and imprisoned at Heiligenstadt. In September, he escaped. With his rescuer, Capt. Heinrich K. G. von Rohr, who had been dismissed from the Prussian army for opposing the Union, he made his way about the country visiting sympathizers as far away as Stettin. On September 21, 1838, he was captured and remanded to prison. Finally, he received permission to emigrate; Von Rohr gathered a company of one thousand with Grabau as their pastor, and in June and July 1839, they sailed from Hamburg in five ships. Grabau and the greater part of the company settled in Buffalo in October. There he was pastor of the DreifaltigkeitsKirche for almost forty years. In 1840, with Von Rohr as his first pupil, he opened a school, later known as Martin Luther Seminary, to train candidates for the ministry. On July 15, 1845, Grabau, Von Rohr, and three other clergymen met at Milwaukee and organized the Synod of the Lutheran Church Emigrated from Prussia, which soon became known as the Buffalo Synod. In 1853-54, he and Von Rohr visited Germany to confer with Wilhelm Lohe on matters of doctrine. From 1842 until 1866, he carried on a fierce controversy with C. F. W. Walther and other theologians of the Missouri Synod on the subject of ordination, the ministry, and the church. The Missouri Synod made the controversy into a war of extermination against Grabau and his followers, set up rival congregations and rejoiced when the Buffalo Synod split into three factions in 1866. The largest faction, consisting of Christian Hochstetter and eleven other pastors, promptly allied themselves with the Missourians; Von Rohr continued at the head of his party until his death in 1874; and Grabau, with a few pastors still loyal to him, kept open his seminary, started a new paper, Die Wachende Kirche, to take the place of the old Informatorium, which remained in Von Rohr\u2019s possession, and was elected Senior Ministerii of the new Buffalo Synod.

The line has since then influenced Chinese higher education greatly, Beida included. When Beida was founded in 1898 (known as the Imperial University of Peking then), one of the greatest problems it had was the lack of capable teachers. Missionaries, scholars and professors from England, Germany, the US and many other countries came to China to help build the first modern institution for higher education. Their contribution is unique and unparalleled. Amadeus William Grabau is one of them.\n\n\n\nThe year 2009 marked the 100th anniversary of Beida Department of Geology. To celebrate the anniversary, the department published an article looking back at its 100-year development. The article mentions Amadeus William Grabau in particular, an American geology professor, who joined the department in 1920. \u201cBy joining the department, Grabau exerted a significant and far-fetching influence on both the education at the department and the communication between Chinese and Western geologists\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third from left (Group photo of graduation, Department of Geology, 1934)\n\n\n\nGrabau was born in 1870 in a small Wisconsin town called Cedarburg. His father ministered to the German Lutheran community there. He finished his undergraduate study at MIT and got his doctorate at Harvard. His dissertation was \u201cPhylogeny of Fusus and Its Allies\u201d. In 1901, he started to teach at Columbia and left there in 1919. Despite his fame in China, he might not be so well-known in the US compared with his wife Mary Antin, the author of The Promised Land.\n\nWhen he set foot in Shanghai in 1920, Grabau might never have thought that he was going to spend the rest of his life in China. In truth, he devoted the second half of his life to the geological education at Beida and cultivated outstanding geological talents who would later compose half of the academia of geology in China. Besides, he united the geological talents during his time, bridging the communication between scholars from China, England, France, Germany, the US, etc. Besides educating students, Grabau also continued his research in the fields of geology and paleontology. His most well-known works include Principles of Stratigraphy, Stratigraphy of China, Rhythm of the Ages and the posthumous The World We Live In, the latter three finished during his years in China.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, geology was quite a new subject in China. Beida Department of Geology was established in 1909, marking the beginning of the geological education in China. Unfortunately, the department of geology saw only two students graduating in 1913. It was not until 1917 that it re-opened and welcomed its second class of students.\n\nBesides, lack of faculty members also threatened the newly born department. Ding Wenjiang, a famous Chinese geologist and social activist who later became one of Grabau\u2019s best friends, was appointed to take on the mission of finding teachers for the department. And it is for the two teachers that Ding recruited, namely Grabau and another young scholar Li Siguang, who brought the department of geology to rapid development and helped establish its fame worldwide in the next two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmadeus William Grabau\n\nGrabau arrived in late October, 1920 and started to teach at Beida on November 3. According to The University Daily, the first class he was going to teach on that day was Paleontology Lab. Until 1926, Grabau offered 8 courses in total, ranging from Theory of Evolution, Advanced Stratigraphy to Paleontology and Fossil Study. Students showed great enthusiasm to Grabau\u2019s courses as well. There were fifty students in his paleontology class, forty in historical geology and sixty in a newly opened comparative study course.\n\nGrabau taught his students more than geological knowledge. He told his students that they were \u201cpioneers in the development of this science in your country\u201d and he wanted them to \u201csearch out and make known the geological structure and history of this vast country\u201d. After noticing Chinese students\u2019 \u201creliance upon authority, their predilection for book learning\u201d, Grabau asked his students to put away all books and lecture notes and taught them to observe, to reason, to develop the power of independent judgment and self-reliance, \u201cto wean them from undue reliance on authority\u201d. He had faith not only in his students, but also in China: \u201cIn spite of all the present unrest and disorganization, this young republic has a great future, and we must help by giving the men who are to do the work of the future the sounded training possible.\u201d He believed that American scholars\u2019 efforts in this aspect would be a great part in \u201ccementing the friendship between the two countries\u201d.\n\nHowever, Grabau also met with difficulties. In his letter to Ray Bassler, an American geologist, he said that \u201cgeological work in China is difficult\u2026on account of the lack of good maps, the time consuming and fatiguing journeys before you reach the field\u2014much of the area can only be reached on mule back\u2026over atrocious roads or no roads at all\u2026\u201d. But still, he said that the fieldwork was \u201cwonderful\u201d because of the abundance of fossils he collected. In one expedition to Kaiping basin, he brought back forty boxes of fossils. No doubt, his years at Peking stimulated the scholar\u2019s passion once again and motivated him to finish more than half of his whole lifetime\u2019s publications. In 1924 and 1928, he published the two-volume Stratigraphy of China. Weng Wenhao, Grabau\u2019s colleague and also a famous geologist, praised that the book \u201cgive[s] a clear and comprehensive history of the successive stages of the geological and paleontological evolution in this part of the world\u201d.\n\nApart from in-class education, Grabau also contributed greatly to the mixing together of Chinese and Western scholars. In 1922, the Geological Society of China was founded, which was one of the earliest academic groups in China. Grabau was among the twenty-six charter members. What\u2019s more, Grabau generously provided his residence at Peking as the meeting places for scholars and students of geology from different nations. Allan Mazur, Grabau\u2019s biographer who wrote \u201cAmadeus Grabau in China: 1920-1946\u201d, comments that Grabau \u201cwas the glue that held Chinese and Western scientists together\u201d and that Grabau \u201cwas a pillar of all these associations\u201d. Grabau\u2019s sister Adele, who came to China to look after Grabau in 1934, also observed that \u201cAmadeus\u2026just sits somewhere in a room and at once all gather around him\u201d. Sven Hedin, a Swedish geographer and Grabau\u2019s friend, gave a detailed description of dinner at Grabau\u2019s house: \u201cthe guests frequently formed small academic groups to discuss scientific problems. Grabau\u2019s home became a focus, a salon, for the academic circles in Peking, and his hospitality knew no bounds\u201d.\n\nGrabau\u2019s influence was not limited to his students or colleagues. From December, 1920 to December, 1921, Grabau held a series of public speeches on \u201cThe Earth and the Evolution of Its Creatures\u201d. It happened that Bertrand A. W. Russel, the English philosopher, was lecturing around China at that time as well. The two scholars\u2019 speeches were so popular that they\n\nwere published in The University Daily and other newspapers. Shen Bao (also known as Shanghai News) commented that among the foreign lecturers in Peking, Russel and Grabau were the most popular.\n\nWhile playing a rather active role in the geology academia, Grabau had always been troubled with arthritis and had to use crutches. His sister Adele recorded that when Grabau left the house, he would \u201chave both legs bandaged from foot to knee. One leg has an open sore like a dollar size\u2014not running but just does not form skin over it\u201d. The illness \u201churts him much\u201d that when he could not walk to the classroom he would ask his students to come to his house and continue his teaching. Also, it was a common thing for teachers to get their salaries late at that time. There was one time when teachers did not receive their salaries until six months later. Despite the situation, Grabau would continue his teaching at home while the campus was closed for teachers\u2019 protests.\n\nGrabau\u2019s last few years were far from comfortable. He had been interned by the Japanese army in a vacated British embassy in the Legation Quarter since 1943. And it is during the years of internment from 1943 until his release in 1945 that Grabau\u2019s health deteriorated fast for lack of medical support. At that time, he was \u201cinvalided by age, severe arthritis, broken hip-bone, and other ailments. He is without funds or property, and is badly in need of financial assistance\u201d. When his students rescued him out of the compound, his first words were: \u201cAre you my students?\u201d A few months after his release, Grabau passed away.\n\nIn 1947, the Geological Society of China published volume 27 of the Bulletin of the Geological Society of China in memorial of Grabau. Zhang Hongzhao wrote the following poem for his friend Grabau, who contributed the second half of his life to the geological education and spread in China:\n\n\n\nA mighty mountain has been cleft in twain\n\nSo passed away a great man from our throng\n\nHis worthy work forever would remain\n\nTo vie with moon and stars and last as long\n\nThe world just tast'd the hard-earn'd cup of peace\n\nHe passed away, a life without regret;\n\nFor twenty years he lived a true Chinese\n\nAnd in this land his soul will linger yet\n\nGrabau was buried at the campus of Beida, \u201ca simple grave, but obviously regularly and lovingly tended\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grave of Professor Amadeus William Grabau (Photo credit to Zhang Yixin)\n\nSources:\n\n\u6f58\u4e91\u5510 . \u201c\u845b\u5229\u666e \u2014\u2014 \u4e2d\u56fd\u5730\u8d28\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u826f\u5e08\u76ca\u53cb . \u201d \u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u6280\u53f2\u6742\u5fd7 , no. 3, 1982, pp. 22-30.\n\n\u5b59\u627f\u665f . \u201c\u2018 \u4ed6\u4e61\u6843\u674e\u53d1\u65b0\u679d \u2019 \uff1a\u845b\u5229\u666e\u4e0e\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u5730\u8d28\u5b66\u7cfb .\u201d \u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u53f2\u7814\u7a76 , vol. 35, no. 3, 2016, pp. 341-357.\n\n\u590f\u7ea2\u536b\uff0c and \u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u56fd\u9645\u5408\u4f5c\u90e8 . \u5317\u5927\u6d0b\u5148\u751f . \u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff0c\u5317\u4eac\uff0c 2012."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Johannes_Andreas_August_Grabau", "page_content": "Johannes Andreas August Grabau (March 18, 1804\u2014June 2, 1879) was an influential German-American Old Lutheran pastor and theologian.
