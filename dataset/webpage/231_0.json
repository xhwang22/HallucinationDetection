He was the first Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois political leader since Confederation to attempt, through a referendum, to negotiate the political independence of Quebec. Starting his career as a reporter, and radio and television host, he later became known for his eminent role in Quebec's nationalization of hydro, and as an ardent defender of Quebec sovereignty. He was the founder of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and before that, a Liberal minister in the Lesage government from 1960 to 1966.Early lifeL\u00e9vesque was born in the H\u00f4tel Dieu Hospital in Campbellton, New Brunswick, on August 24, 1922. He was raised in New Carlisle, Quebec, on the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, by his parents, Diane (n\u00e9e Dionne) and Dominic L\u00e9vesque, a lawyer. He had three siblings, Andr\u00e9, Fernand and Alice. His father died when L\u00e9vesque was 14 years old.JournalistL\u00e9vesque attended the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 and the Saint-Charles-Garnier College in Quebec City, both of which were run by the Jesuits. He studied for a law degree at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City, but left the university in 1943 without having completed the degree. One of his classmates at Laval later recounted that L\u00e9vesque had been smoking in class, and refused to apologize to the professor, Louis-Philippe Pigeon, who refused to allow him back to class. L\u00e9vesque left, saying he really only wanted to write, not practise law. He worked as an announcer and news writer at the radio station CHNC in New Carlisle, as a substitute announcer for CHRC during 1941 and 1942, and then at CBV in Quebec City.During 1944\u20131945, he served as a liaison officer and war correspondent for the U.S. Army in Europe. He reported from London while it was under regular bombardment by the Luftwaffe, and advanced with the Allied troops as they pushed back the German army through France and Germany. Throughout the war, he made regular journalistic reports on the airwaves and in print. He was with the first unit of Americans to reach Dachau concentration camp.In 1947, he married Louise L'Heureux, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. L\u00e9vesque worked as a reporter for the CBC's French language section in the international service. He again served as a war correspondent for the CBC in the Korean War in 1952. After that, he was offered a career in journalism in the United States, but decided to stay in Canada.From 1956 to 1959, L\u00e9vesque became famous in Quebec for hosting a weekly television news program on Radio-Canada called Point de Mire.L\u00e9vesque covered international events and major labour struggles between workers and corporations that dogged the Union Nationale government of Premier Maurice Duplessis culminating with a great strike in 1957 at the Gasp\u00e9 Copper Mine in Murdochville. The Murdochville strike was a milestone for organized labour in Quebec as it resulted in changes to the province's labour laws.While working for the public television network, he became personally involved in the broadcasters' strike that lasted 68 tumultuous days beginning in late 1958. L\u00e9vesque was arrested during a demonstration in 1959, along with union leader Jean Marchand and 24 other demonstrators.Early political careerLib\u00e9ral cabinet ministerIn 1960, L\u00e9vesque entered politics as a star candidate and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1960 election as a Liberal Party member in the riding of Montr\u00e9al-Laurier. In the government of Jean Lesage, he served as minister of hydroelectric resources and public works from 1960 to 1961, and minister of natural resources from 1961 to 1965. While in office, he played a pivotal role in the nationalization of hydroelectric companies, greatly expanding Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, one of the reforms that was part of the Quiet Revolution.From 1965 to 1966, he served as minister of family and welfare. L\u00e9vesque, with his friend Eric Kierans, the Quebec minister of health, was heavily involved in negotiations with the Government of Canada to fund both Quebec and federal mandates for social programs.In a surprise, the Liberals lost the 1966 election to the Union Nationale but L\u00e9vesque retained his own seat of Laurier. Believing that the Canadian federation was doomed to fail, L\u00e9vesque began to openly champion separation from Canada as part of the Liberal platform at the upcoming party conference. Kierans, who had been elected party president, led the movement against the motion, with future premier Robert Bourassa attempting to mediate the dispute before siding with Kierans. The resolution was handily defeated, and L\u00e9vesque walked out with his followers.Founding of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coisAfter leaving the Liberal Party, he founded the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association (MSA). In contrast to more militant nationalist movements, such as Pierre Bourgault's Rassemblement pour l'Ind\u00e9pendance Nationale (RIN), the party eschewed direct action and protest and attempted instead to appeal to the broader electorate, whom L\u00e9vesque called \"normal people\". The main contention in the first party conference was the proposed policy toward Quebec's Anglophone minority; L\u00e9vesque faced down heavy opposition to his insistence that English schools and language rights be protected.The election of hardline federalist Pierre Elliott Trudeau as Prime Minister, and the politically damaging riot instigated by the RIN when he appeared at the St. Jean Baptiste Day parade of 1968, led to the sovereignty movement coming together. The MSA merged with another party in the Quebec sovereignty movement, the Ralliement National of Gilles Gr\u00e9goire, to create the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) in 1968. At L\u00e9vesque's insistence, RIN members were permitted to join but not accepted as a group.The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois gained 25 per cent of the vote in the 1970 election, running on a platform of declaring independence if government was formed. The PQ only won six seats, and L\u00e9vesque continued to run the party from Montreal by communicating with the caucus in Quebec City.The 1973 election saw a large Liberal victory, and created major tensions within the party, especially after L\u00e9vesque was unable to gain a seat. A quarrel with House Leader Robert Burns almost ended L\u00e9vesque's leadership shortly thereafter.Premier of Quebec (1976\u20131985)L\u00e9vesque and his party won a landslide victory at the 1976 election, with L\u00e9vesque finally re-entering the Assembly as the member for Taillon in downtown Longueuil. His party assumed power with 41.1 per cent of the popular vote and 71 seats out of 110, and even managed to unseat Bourassa in his own riding. L\u00e9vesque became premier of Quebec ten days later. The night of L\u00e9vesque's acceptance speech included one of his most famous quotations: \"I never thought that I could be so proud to be Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\"French languageHis government's signature achievement was the Quebec Charter of the French Language (introduced in the legislature and still colloquially known as Bill 101), whose stated goal was to make French \"the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business\". In its first enactment, it reserved access to English-language public schools to children whose parents had attended English school in Quebec. All other children were required to attend French schools in order to encourage immigrants to integrate themselves into the majority francophone culture (L\u00e9vesque was more moderate on language than some of the PQ, including the language minister, Camille Laurin. He would have resigned as leader rather than eliminate English-language public schools, as some party members proposed). Bill 101 also made it illegal for businesses to put up exterior commercial signs in a language other than French at a time when English dominated as a commercial and business language in Quebec.Quebec nationalismL\u00e9vesque was disappointed with the cold response by the American economic elite to his first speech in New York City as Premier of Quebec, in which he compared Quebec's march towards sovereignty to the American Revolution. His first speech in France was, however, more successful, leading him to a better appreciation of the French intelligentsia and of French culture.On May 20, 1980, the PQ held, as promised before the elections, the 1980 Quebec referendum on its sovereignty-association plan. The result of the vote was 40 per cent in favour and 60 per cent opposed (with 86 per cent turnout). L\u00e9vesque conceded defeat in the referendum by announcing that, as he had understood the verdict, he had been told \"until next time\".L\u00e9vesque led the PQ to victory in the 1981 election, increasing the party's majority in the National Assembly and increasing its share of the popular vote from 41 to 49 per cent.A major focus of his second mandate was the patriation of the Canadian constitution. L\u00e9vesque was criticized by some in Quebec who said he had been tricked by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the English-Canadian provincial premiers. To this day, no Quebec premier of any political side has endorsed the 1982 constitutional amendment.Other policies and eventsOn February 6, 1977, L\u00e9vesque accidentally killed Edgar Trottier, a homeless man who had been lying on the road, while driving his car. Trottier had in the past repeatedly used the maneuver to secure a hospital bed for the night. Police officers at the scene did not administer the breathalyzer test to L\u00e9vesque, because they did not suspect that he was impaired. L\u00e9vesque was later fined $25 for failing to wear his glasses while driving a car on the night in question. The incident gained further notoriety when it was revealed that the female companion in the vehicle was not his wife, but his longtime secretary, Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. L\u00e9vesque's marriage ended in divorce soon thereafter (the couple had already been estranged for some time), and in April 1979, he married C\u00f4t\u00e9.L\u00e9vesque's government completed the nationalization of hydroelectricity through Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. He also created the Quebec Charter of the French Language, the political party financing law, and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois itself. His government was the first in Canada to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the province's Charte des droits de la personne in 1977. He also continued the work of the Lesage government in improving social services, in which social needs were taken care of by the state, instead of the Catholic Church (as in the Duplessis era) or the individual. L\u00e9vesque is still regarded by many as a symbol of democracy and tolerance.The PQ government's response to the recession of the early 1980s by cutting the provincial budget to reduce growing deficits that resulted from the recession angered labour union members, a core part of the constituency of the PQ and the sovereignty movement.L\u00e9vesque's Act to govern the financing of political parties banned corporate donations and limited individual contributions to political parties to $3,000. This key legislation was meant to prevent wealthy citizens and organizations from having a disproportionate influence on the electoral process. A Referendum Act was passed to allow for a province-wide vote on issues presented in a referendum, giving a \"yes\" and \"no\" side equal funding and legal footing.ResignationL\u00e9vesque had argued that the party should not make sovereignty the object of the 1985 election and instead opt for the \"Beau risque\" strategy of seeking an understanding with the federal government of Brian Mulroney, which angered the strongest supporters of sovereignty within the party. He said the issue in the upcoming election would not be sovereignty. Instead, he expressed hope, \"that we can finally find government leaders in Ottawa who will discuss Qu\u00e9bec's demands seriously and work with us for the greater good of Qu\u00e9becers\". His new stance weakened his position within the party. Some senior members resigned; there were by-election defeats. L\u00e9vesque resigned as leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois on June 20, 1985, and as premier of Qu\u00e9bec on October 3, 1985.Retirement and deathL\u00e9vesque, a constant smoker, was hosting a dinner party in his Nuns' Island (Montreal) apartment on the evening of November 1, 1987, when he experienced chest pains; he died of a heart attack that night at Montreal General Hospital. A brief resurgence of separatist sentiment followed. Over 100,000 viewed his body lying in state in Montreal and Quebec City, over 10,000 went to his funeral in the latter city, and hundreds wept daily at his grave for months.L\u00e9vesque was made a grand officer of the French Legion of Honour. He was posthumously made a grand officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2008.LegacyDespite a perceived weakening of his sovereigntist resolve in the last years of his government, he reaffirmed his belief to friends and, notably, to a crowd of Universit\u00e9 Laval students months before his death, of the necessity of independence.His state funeral and funeral procession was reportedly attended by 100,000 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. During the carrying out of his coffin from the church, the crowd spontaneously began to applaud and sing Quebec's unofficial national anthem \"Gens du pays\", replacing the first verse with Mon cher Ren\u00e9 (My dear Ren\u00e9), as is the custom when this song is adapted to celebrate someone's birthday. Two major boulevards now bear his name, one in Montreal and one in Quebec City. In Montreal, the \u00c9difice Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the Maison Radio-Canada are both located on Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard, fittingly as L\u00e9vesque once worked for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the CBC, respectively. On June 22, 2010, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the government of Quebec commemorated L\u00e9vesque's role in Quebec's Quiet Revolution and his tenure as premier by renaming the 1244-megawatt Manic-3 generating station in his honour.On June 3, 1999, a monument in his honour was unveiled on boulevard Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque outside the Parliament Building in Quebec City. The statue is popular with tourists, who snuggle up to it, to have their pictures taken \"avec Ren\u00e9\" (with Ren\u00e9), despite repeated attempts by officials to keep people from touching the monument or getting too close to it. The statue had been the source of an improvised, comical and affectionately touching tribute to L\u00e9vesque. The fingers of his extended right hand are slightly parted, just enough so that tourists and the faithful could insert a cigarette, giving the statue an unusually realistic appearance.This practice is less often seen now, however, as the statue was moved to New Carlisle and replaced by a similar, but bigger one. This change resulted from considerable controversy. Some believed that the life-sized statue was not appropriate for conveying his importance in the history of Quebec. Others noted that a trademark of L\u00e9vesque was his relatively small stature.L\u00e9vesque today remains an important figure of the Quebec nationalist movement, and is considered sovereigntism's spiritual father. After his death, even people in disagreement with some of those convictions now generally recognize his importance to the history of Quebec. Many in Quebec regard him as the father of the modern Quebec nation. According to a study made in 2006 by Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and L\u00e9ger Marketing, L\u00e9vesque was considered by far, according to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the best premier to run the province over the last 50 years.L\u00e9vesque was notably portrayed in 1994 in the television series Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. In 2006, an additional television miniseries, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, was aired on the CBC. He was also portrayed in an episode of Kevin Spencer, a Canadian cartoon show. In it, his ghost attempted a camaraderie with Kevin because of their similarities in political beliefs, as well as the fact that the title character, like Ren\u00e9's ghost, claims to smoke \"five packs a day\".A song by Les Cowboys Fringants named \"Lettre \u00e0 L\u00e9vesque\" on the album La Grand-Messe was dedicated to him. They also mention the street bearing his name in the song called \"La Manifestation\".He was the co-subject, along with Pierre Trudeau, of the Donald Brittain-directed documentary miniseries The Champions.PersonalityL\u00e9vesque was a man capable of great tact and charm, but who could also be abrupt and choleric when defending beliefs, ideals, or morals essential to him, or when lack of respect was perceived, for example, when he was famously snubbed by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand at their first meeting. He was also a proud Gasp\u00e9sien (hailing from the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula), and had hints of the local accent.Considered a major defender of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, L\u00e9vesque was, before the 1960s, more interested in international affairs than Quebec matters. The popular image of L\u00e9vesque was his ever-present cigarette and his small physical stature, as well as his unique comb over that earned him the nickname of Ti-Poil, literally, \"Li'l Hair\", but more accurately translated as \"Baldy\". L\u00e9vesque was a passionate and emotional public speaker. Those close to L\u00e9vesque have described him as having difficulty expressing his emotions in private, saying that he was more comfortable in front of a crowd of thousands than with one person.While many Quebec intellectuals are inspired by French philosophy and high culture, L\u00e9vesque favoured the United States. Speaking fluent English, he was a faithful reader of The New York Times, and took his vacations in New England every year. He also stated that, if there had to be one role model for him, it would be US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. While in London during the Second World War, his admiration for Britons grew when he witnessed their courage in the face of the German bombardments.WorksMy Qu\u00e9bec, 1979, Methuen, 191 pages, ISBN 0-458-93980-3Quotations from Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, 1977, \u00c9ditions H\u00e9ritage, 105 pages ISBN 0-7773-3942-0An Option for Quebec, 1968, McClelland and Stewart, 128 pages\"For an Independent Quebec\", in Foreign Affairs, July 1976) [1]Option Qu\u00e9bec (1968)La passion du Qu\u00e9bec (1978)Oui (1980)Attendez que je me rappelle (1986) (although the title is literally translated as Wait While I Remember, the title of the English-language version was Memoirs.)See alsoList of Gasp\u00e9siensList of premiers of QuebecList of Quebec general electionsPolitician nicknaming in QuebecPolitics of QuebecSeparatismReferencesFurther readingDesbarats, Peter (1976).

Upon completing his primary education in New Carlisle, he pursued his classical education at the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge de Gasp\u00e9 and the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Charles-Garnier in Quebec City. In the fall of 1941 he began studies in law at Laval University, which he did not complete.\n\nHe pursued a career in radio journalism and acted as a liaison agent and war correspondent for the U. S. armed forces in 1944 and 1945. Between 1946 and 1951 he worked for the French-language section of the International Service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After serving as correspondent in Korea in 1951-1952, he created Radio-Canada's news service system and co-produced the program Carrefour (Crossroads). Between 1956 and 1959 he produced and served as animator for a television news program entitled Point de mire (Target). During 1959 he led a bitter campaign for the creation of a union for Radio-Canada's producers. When that goal was accomplished he left Radio-Canada a committed neo-nationalist in search of a new career and a new country.\n\nAttracted by the neo-nationalist platform of the Quebec Liberal Party of Jean Lesage, L\u00e9vesque accepted an invitation to join the party. He quickly became one of the leading forces in Quebec's \"Quiet Revolution\" once the party defeated the longstanding Union Nationale Party in June 1960. As minister of natural resources from March 1961 to January 1966 he was responsible for the campaign which brought about the nationalization of Quebec's private hydro-electric companies by 1964. This development allowed Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, which employs thousands of highly skilled French-speaking Quebe\u00e7ois, to become North America's largest and most successful producer and distributor of electricity.\n\nL\u00e9vesque became one of the strongest proponents of a powerful, neo-nationalist Quebec state, both politically and economically. He was the government's most vociferous critic of the existing Canadian constitution. He advocated, as a minimum, \"special status\" for Quebec which entailed much greater taxing powers, exclusive control over all health and social welfare programs, and significant powers for Quebec in international affairs. When negotiations with Ottawa encountered serious opposition after 1965, he started promoting the concept of associate-state status for Quebec. His views were considered far too radical for the majority in the Liberal Party. After the party's defeat in 1966 he left and created the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association (MSA) in November 1967 which became the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois (PQ) in October 1968.\n\nAs president of the PQ from its formation into the 1980s Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque pursued the party's central goal of achieving a new constitutional arrangement with the rest of Canada; that is, political independence with continued economic association. When L\u00e9vesque and the party agreed to postpone the constitutional question for a referendum, the PQ achieved power in November 1976. The PQ's most significant legislative measure was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which confirmed French as the only official language of the province and set out tough provisions to make French the language of work for all Quebe\u00e7ois.\n\nThe L\u00e9vesque government prepared for the referendum by trying to assure American investors that a politically independent Quebec would remain a friendly ally of the United States and by seeking to assure Quebec citizens that sovereignty and association would be achieved simultaneously, thereby minimizing the socio-economic risks. During the historic 1980 referendum campaign, the Canadian prime minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, declared that the rest of Canada would never agree to political independence with the continued benefit of economic association for Quebec. He also promised to begin the process of reforming the century-old British North America Act to give Canada a renewed federal system. As a result of this dramatic intervention, 60 percent of the voters rejected the PQ's request for a mandate to negotiate sovereignty-association. The PQ strategy of achieving independence democratically and by stages had failed.\n\nUnder L\u00e9vesque's leadership the PQ won the 1981 provincial election, but the disintegration of the independence movement and its political expression, the PQ, set in immediately. Reduced to a mere premier caught in the dilemma of administering a debt ridden province faced with a serious recession and rising unemployment, and confronted with a humiliating defeat on the constitution which was voted down along with an amendment formula in 1982, L\u00e9vesque had to abandon long cherished plans for wide-ranging socio-economic reforms. In fact, he introduced deep cuts in the salaries as well as the quantity of public and para-public employees. The unlimited growth of the Quebec state was over.\n\nThe results were predictable. The PQ lost quite dramatically the widespread public support that had brought it to power in 1976. When L\u00e9vesque decided not to hold the forthcoming election on the issue of independence as promised, he precipitated a major schism in the party. All the leading independentists resigned, leaving his government in a precarious position.\n\nWhile Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque was responsible for many of the socio-economic reforms after 1960, the central goal of the Quiet Revolution\u2014political independence for Quebec\u2014 had been thwarted. The neo-nationalist movement, led with great vigor and sincerity by L\u00e9vesque, would have to await a new leader and a more opportune time in order to re-emerge as a significant force in Quebec society. In 1985 L\u00e9vesque, one of Quebec's most sincere politicians, stepped down as party leader and was replaced by Pierre Marc Johnson, a Montreal lawyer and physician.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThere are two biographies of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque which deal with his career prior to his becoming premier in 1976: Peter Desbarats, Ren\u00e9: A Canadian in Search of Country (1976) and Jean Provencher, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque: Portrait of a Quebecer (1975). On the rise of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois there is Pierre Dupont, How L\u00e9vesque Won: The Story of the PQ's Stunning Election Victory (1977) and Vera Murray, Le Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois: de la fondation \u00e0 la prise du pouvoir (1976). By far the best treatment of L\u00e9vesque is the study by a journalist, Graham Fraser, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque & the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9\u00e7ois in Power (1984). Solid background for understanding the historical context in which L\u00e9vesque operated after World War II can be found in Michael D. Behiels, Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution: Liberalism versus Neo-nationalism, 1945-1960 (1985) and Kenneth McRoberts and Dale Posgate, Quebec: Social and Political Crisis (1980).\n\nAdditional Sources\n\nL\u00e9vesque, Ren\u00e9, Memoirs, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1995. \u25a1"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rene-levesque", "page_content": "\\u00a9 Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hudon.

L\u00e9vesque founded the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, whose main objective was Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty (Canapress). PreviousNext\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, premier of Qu\u00e9bec 1976-85, politician, journalist, nationalist (born 24 Aug 1922 in Campbellton, NB; died 1 November 1987 in Montr\u00e9al, QC). A prominent member of Jean Lesage's Liberal Cabinet during the Quiet Revolution, L\u00e9vesque later founded the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ), eventually bringing it to power in 1976. The PQ's main objective was Qu\u00e9bec independence, and for 15 years L\u00e9vesque was the leading champion of that ideal \u2014 holding and losing the province's first referendum on sovereignty in 1980.\n\nGasp\u00e9 Childhood\n\nL\u00e9vesque grew up in the remote, coastal town of New Carlisle, among the fishermen and farmers of the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula. Because there was no hospital there in 1922, he was born in nearby Campbellton, New Brunswick, the eldest child of Dominique L\u00e9vesque, a prominent lawyer, and Diane Dionne. Although the L\u00e9vesques were well-to-do, poverty was dire in the Gasp\u00e9 at that time. Ren\u00e9 became aware at a young age that most of the French Canadians were poorer, with smaller homes and more wretched schools, than the English Canadian families \u2014 descendants of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution \u2014 who were the self-appointed elites of the region.\n\nA bright student who impressed his Jesuit teachers, L\u00e9vesque resolved early on at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9 that he was destined to be a leader. He idolized his father, who introduced him to politics, and to French and English literature \u2014 giving the boy a bilingual upbringing. When L\u00e9vesque was 14, however, his father died in hospital at the age of 48. His mother quickly remarried, the family relocated to Qu\u00e9bec City, and L\u00e9vesque drifted away from both his family and his studies.\n\nExpelled from the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier for low marks, he finished his formal schooling at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec and enrolled in the law school at Universit\u00e9 Laval, but gave up on his studies before obtaining a degree.\n\nJournalism\n\nL\u00e9vesque had discovered radio journalism in 1938, his last summer in New Carlisle. In Qu\u00e9bec City he worked at CBV, a regional Radio-Canada station. When the Second World War broke out, he was keen to get into the action, not as a soldier but as a war correspondent. Radio-Canada refused to send him, so in 1944 L\u00e9vesque found a position in London with the French section of the United States government service, Voice of America \u2014 thereby avoiding conscription by the Canadian military. He didn't get to the front lines until February 1945, joining the American armies as they crossed the Rhine and swept through the devastated remains of Germany. He was among the first US correspondents to see the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp following its liberation.\n\nThe war instilled in L\u00e9vesque a fondness for Americans (versus English Canadians), and a deep awareness of the barbarism that can flow from the extremes of nationalism. It wasn't enough to erase his own nationalist impulses, but it did temper them; he was committed throughout his life to democracy.\n\nAfter the war L\u00e9vesque returned to Radio-Canada, becoming an announcer for La voix du Canada, a news program broadcast out of Montr\u00e9al to French-speaking countries around the world. He quickly established himself as an engaging and widely-followed foreign newsman, reporting from the Korean War in 1951 and the Soviet Union in 1955. From 1956 he hosted the television series \"Point de mire\" (Focal Point) and became one of Qu\u00e9bec's most influential TV commentators. Short, balding and chain-smoking, L\u00e9vesque lacked the good looks for this emerging visual medium, but his intelligence and wit, and his ability to explain world events to a domestic audience, enabled him to become one of Qu\u00e9bec's first TV stars.\n\nIn 1947, L\u00e9vesque married Louise L'Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e from before the war, with whom he wouldhave two sons and a daughter. Surrounded by admirers in the broadcasting world, L\u00e9vesque wasn't a faithful husband, and the couple would divorce in 1978.\n\nIn 1959, L\u00e9vesque became actively involved in a strike by Radio-Canada producers, who wanted to form a union. He was dismayed by the indifference of the Diefenbaker government in Ottawa, and of his English CBC colleagues, towards the strikers' goals, which only hardened his views towards English Canada and fuelled his political aspirations. He decided journalism wasn't enough \u2014 it was time to stop covering the world, and start changing it instead.\n\nLesage Cabinet\n\nL\u00e9vesque joined Jean Lesage's Liberals in the provincial election of 1960, becoming a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Montr\u00e9al and helping to defeat the old Union nationale government. It was the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, and L\u00e9vesque became one Lesage's most popular and energetic Cabinet ministers \u2014 helping to modernize Qu\u00e9bec, to encourage its French-speaking majority to become \"masters in our own house,\" and to help ease the province away from the oppressive influence of the Roman Catholic clergy.\n\nAfter a brief stint as minister of water resources and public works, in which he fought corruption in the civil service, L\u00e9vesque was appointed minister of natural resources in 1961. He became point-man for the controversial but ultimately successful effort to nationalize the province's private electric utilities and fold them into what became the energy colossus of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. If Francophone Qu\u00e9becers didn't own or control big business interests in their province, L\u00e9vesque insisted, they would at least control its vast natural resources, via their government.\n\nParti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\n\nIn 1966, the Lesage government was defeated and L\u00e9vesque \u2014 increasingly nationalistic, and critical of his party's relations with the federal government \u2014 quit the Liberals the following year to found the Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association, which in October 1968 became the Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The move was hardly surprising. Through the 1960s, even as a Liberal minister, L\u00e9vesque had made his views on independence increasingly clear, telling the Anglophone media in Canada that he wouldn't be upset if Qu\u00e9bec separated. At the 1967 Qu\u00e9bec Liberal Party convention he had even tabled an incendiary resolution, largely unsupported by other delegates, titled \"A sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union.\" Meanwhile, he grew increasingly antagonistic with Pierre Trudeau, who entered federal politics in 1965 advocating a very different vision.\n\nHaving managed to unite the various groups promoting independence and a new political status for Qu\u00e9bec, L\u00e9vesque's party won 23 % of the vote in the 1970 provincial elections \u2014 although he himself failed to win a seat. Then the October Crisis erupted, and Trudeau, now prime minister, invoked the War Measures Act. L\u00e9vesque joined a coalition of prominent Qu\u00e9becers in condemning what they saw as Ottawa's anti-democratic response to the crisis. At the same time, L\u00e9vesque and his friends failed to unequivocally condemn the terror kidnappings of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) and the group's subsequent murder of Pierre Laporte. This allowed the PQ's critics to publicly equate the party with the FLQ, costing the PQ considerable support.\n\nIn the 1973 provincial election the Liberals won a landslide victory, and L\u00e9vesque once again failed to win himself a seat. The PQ, however, managed to become the official Opposition.\n\nPQ Comes to Power\n\nIn the next election, in 1976, L\u00e9vesque and his party faced off against the now-unpopular Liberal regime of Robert Bourassa, weary after years in power and beset by scandal and accusations of nepotism. L\u00e9vesque promised good government. He also downplayed the PQ's essential goal \u2014 sovereignty \u2014 while reassuring Qu\u00e9becers that a PQ government would commit to holding a referendum on the issue first, rather than declaring sovereignty unilaterally. The PQ won a majority of 71 seats, including one for L\u00e9vesque, who became the province's 23rd premier. He headed the first Qu\u00e9bec government committed to breaking up Confederation. The rest of Canada was stunned.\n\nDuring its first term, the new government passed several progressive measures concerning automobile insurance, rezoning of agricultural lands and the abolition of secret electoral funding. One of the most important and controversial pieces of legislation was Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language, which formalized the status of French as the official language of Qu\u00e9bec. Proclaimed lawin 1977, Bill 101 excluded English from the provincial legislature and courts, and restricted access to English schools to anyone other than children whose parents had attended English schools in Qu\u00e9bec. French schooling became compulsory for English-speaking immigrants, even those from other Canadian provinces.\n\nAlthough strongly supported by the public and the PQ, the law triggered an exodus of more than 130,000 Anglophones from the province between 1976 and 1981 . As well, a number of Montr\u00e9al-based companies, including Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, relocated their head offices to Toronto. In the ensuing years, court rulings would strike down many of the law's measures as contrary to the Constitution, including the ban on English in the legislature and courts. Eventually, children whose parents had attended English schools elsewhere in Canada, were allowed into English schools in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n1980 Referendum\n\nIn the fall of 1979, as time was running out on his government's mandate, L\u00e9vesque finally introduced in the National Assembly a plan for sovereignty-association \u2014 a politically independent Qu\u00e9bec, still economically tied to Canada. A referendum on the question was scheduled for 20 May 1980, only months after the defeat of Joe Clark's Conservatives in Ottawa, and the return to power of L\u00e9vesque's nemesis Pierre Trudeau.\n\nAfter an emotional campaign led on the \"non\" side by Liberal Opposition leader Claude Ryan and federal Cabinet minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien (with key support from Trudeau), and on the \"oui\" side by L\u00e9vesque and his ministers, the sovereigntists won only 40 percent of the vote, failing to capture even a majority of the Francophone vote. It was the hardest defeat of L\u00e9vesque's career. If there was any consolation, L\u00e9vesque believed the vote had at least legitimized the right of Qu\u00e9becers to determine their own future regarding Confederation. Ottawa had recognized that fact through its active participation in the campaign.\n\nConstitution Battle\n\nAgainst all expectations, the PQ was re-elected in 1981, with L\u00e9vesque heading his second majority government. The party may have been helped at the polls by the emergence of new battle lines pitting L\u00e9vesque and other provincial premiers against Trudeau, who had announced his intention to repatriate the Constitution from Britain and to proceed unilaterally if the provinces opposed him.\n\nTrudeau had made the vague promise, during the 1980 referendum campaign, of \"renewing\" the Constitution. Now his government was proposing new, centralized federal powers over the economy, a constitutionally-entrenched Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and a new constitutional amending formula. After months of political debate and grandstanding among Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque and the other premiers, the First Ministers, as they were called, assembled in Ottawa in November, 1981, in a final bid to settle their differences.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was one of several powerful and strong-willed premiers (along with Alberta's Peter Lougheed) \u2014 together comprising eight provinces, or the Gang of Eight \u2014 who opposed Trudeau's plans and had fought them through the courts. But huddled together in Ottawa that November, the seven English-speaking premiers in the coalition were won-over by the promise of a \"notwithstanding clause\" in the new Charter \u2014 limiting its power over provincial authority. The compromise was not enough for L\u00e9vesque, who had also insisted on constitutional recognition of Qu\u00e9bec as a \"distinct society,\" and on a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec. He accused his fellow premiers of abandoning \"Qu\u00e9bec at the moment of crisis.\"\n\nWith the agreement of nine provinces, Trudeau pressed ahead. The repatriated Constitution was signed by Queen Elizabeth in the spring of 1982 \u2014 with the support of all the premiers except L\u00e9vesque, whose government represented the second-most populous province in the country. It was a detail that would bedevil the country and its First Ministers for years to come.\n\nFinal Years in Office\n\nL\u00e9vesque returned to the National Assembly to face the hard task of governing. Confronted with economic recession and spiralling provincial deficits, his government met with considerable opposition and public disapproval, including illegal public-sector union strikes, when it attempted to reduce spending to solve its grave financial problems.\n\nThere was also turmoil inside the PQ and growing doubts about L\u00e9vesque's leadership. In 1984, a party crisis erupted when L\u00e9vesque announced his intention of not fighting the next election on the issue of independence, while maintaining sovereignty-association as the party's official raison d'\u00eatre. Several important ministers resigned in protest, but the party reaffirmed L\u00e9vesque's leadership at a special convention in January 1985. Still, exhausted by years of struggle \u2014 and the defeat of his fondest political goals \u2014 L\u00e9vesque, at 62, fell into depression and was even hospitalized against his will. In June 1985 he resigned as premier.\n\nLegacy\n\nL\u00e9vesque enjoyed two years of retirement, before his heart gave out on 1 November, 1987. In that time he wrote his memoirs, which proved hugely popular. Upon his death, he was remembered across the country, by friends and foes alike, as a giant of Canadian politics.\n\nL\u00e9vesque's mark on Qu\u00e9bec, and Canada, is as indelible as any leader that province has produced: as a journalist he opened the minds of Francophone Qu\u00e9becers and awakened them to the wider world; he was a central figure of the Quiet Revolution; a creator of the energy powerhouse that became Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec; founder of the PQ and leader of Qu\u00e9bec's first openly separatist government; the angry, intransigent torch-bearer of the \"distinct society\" ideal, who refused to endorse the 1982 Constitution, leaving an open wound in the federation that festers still.\n\nThrough it all, L\u00e9vesque acknowledged that whatever injustices Qu\u00e9becers suffered inside Confederation, Canada was still a free and decent country. \"Canada's federal system,\" he once said, \"is not excessively oppressive or anything like a gulag.\" He was never the most ardent nationalist or separatist of his time, yet he fanned the flames of nationalist sentiment in pursuit of his aims. His insistence on wanting to break up the nation, in spite of the Canadian virtues he admired, are what made him such a perplexing \u2014 and often hated \u2014 figure in the minds of English-speaking Canadians, both inside Qu\u00e9bec, and elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Levesque", "page_content": "Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, (born August 24, 1922, Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada\u2014died November 1, 1987, Montreal, Quebec), premier of the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec (1976\u201385) and a leading advocate of sovereignty for that province.\n\nL\u00e9vesque went to school in Gasp\u00e9sie and afterward to Laval University, Quebec. Already a part-time journalist while still a student, he broke off his law studies to serve in Europe (1944\u201345) as a reporter and correspondent attached to the U.S. forces. Back in Quebec after the war, he joined the international service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1946, became a war correspondent in Korea in 1952, and from 1956 to 1959 was commentator on a popular TV news program.\n\nL\u00e9vesque entered politics in 1960 and was elected to the Quebec National Assembly as a Liberal member for Gouin, joining Jean Lesage\u2019s government as minister of public works and hydraulic resources (1960\u201361). He then held the newly created portfolio of natural resources (1961\u201365), and in 1966, during the last months of the Lesage government, he was minister of family and social welfare. Meanwhile he had been reelected in the constituency of Laurier in the 1962 and 1966 legislative elections.\n\nIn October 1967 L\u00e9vesque, with others, founded the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association, which the following year combined with other separatist groups to form the left-wing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, with L\u00e9vesque as its first president. He was unsuccessful in the elections of 1970 and 1973 and returned in part to journalism, writing daily political articles in the Journal de Montr\u00e9al and the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec, until 1976, when his party won control of the provincial National Assembly and he became the premier of Quebec. He was reelected premier in April 1981.\n\nThe goal of L\u00e9vesque and his Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government was the independence option termed \u201csovereignty-association.\u201d The concept envisaged Quebec enacting its own laws, collecting taxes from its people, and establishing relations with foreign countries. Simultaneously, it would form an economic union with the rest of Canada based on a common currency.\n\nThis plan was rejected by 59.6 percent of the Quebec electorate in a popular-referendum vote on May 20, 1980, amid one of the highest voter turnouts in Quebec\u2019s history.

Thus the quintessential Quebecer among the province\u2019s premiers uttered his first cries in a hospital in New Brunswick, on the other side of Baie des Chaleurs. By his own account, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque enjoyed a happy childhood in New Carlisle by the sea, with a father he idolized, for whom the word \u201cculture\u201d had meaning, and a mother with a mercurial disposition like his own, which led to a relationship that was difficult, yet full of affection never put into words. He grew up in the unforgettable, remote Gasp\u00e9, with its cod fishers and its villages that ran down to the sea. According to his relatives and close friends, his lifelong marked compassion for the destitute and the common people stemmed from his roots in the Gasp\u00e9 and his early contact with poverty and underdevelopment, even though he himself came from a well-to-do family. This attitude was probably also explained by the example set by the father he admired, of whom he would say that, lawyer though he was, he showed unconditional respect for others.\n\nNew Carlisle at that time had a population of not quite 1,300, of whom a third were French-speaking and subject to the dictates of the great loyalist families who had fled the American revolution and settled there in the 18th century. Two distinct societies, living side by side, they were a perfect symbol of Canada\u2019s \u201ctwo solitudes.\u201d In this world, where English was required for making oneself understood, young Ren\u00e9 lost no time in becoming bilingual. He also discovered that the rich spoke English, lived in homes that looked like castles beside the modest houses of the francophones, and enjoyed a network of modern schools that showed his local one up for what it was: a \u201cmiserable shack more than a kilometre away from home,\u201d as he put it in Attendez que je me rappelle \u2026, the memoirs he was to publish in Montreal in 1986 (translated under the title Memoirs by Philip Stratford and published in Toronto in 1986).\n\nThroughout his life L\u00e9vesque would present himself as a man of the people who would break away from his middle-class origins. His mother, Diane Dionne, was a doctor\u2019s daughter and traced her lineage back to the seigneurs of Tilly, near Quebec City. His father, who came from Saint-Pac\u00f4me, in the Kamouraska region, was a prominent lawyer of the Quebec bar in the Gasp\u00e9. Before settling in New Carlisle and fitting himself into the French Canadian elite, allied to the loyalist \u201cfamily compact\u201d that ruled over the town, Dominique L\u00e9vesque had been a partner of Ernest Lapointe*, whose law office was in Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup and who would become the Quebec lieutenant of Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King*. Young Ren\u00e9\u2019s rebellious streak ran in the family. One of his maternal ancestors, Germain Dionne, a rich farmer and bailiff of the seigneury of La Pocati\u00e8re nostalgic for the French r\u00e9gime, had fought the British army alongside American insurgents during the rebellion in the colonies. On his father\u2019s side, his ancestor Charles Pearson had mutinied when in the Royal Navy; after deserting his ship in the harbour at the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re Ouelle, he had put down roots in the area and become the first miller of the seigneurial mill. In 1817 he married Marguerite Pastourel; their daughter Marcelline married Dominique L\u00e9vesque (Ren\u00e9\u2019s paternal great-grandfather), of the sixth generation of L\u00e9vesques originating in Normandy.\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque realized very early in life that he was born to be a leader. The eldest of four children, he made an impression on everyone, both at the local school in New Carlisle and at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9, where he began his classical studies in September 1933. When he arrived at the seminary, one of the first questions he asked its superior, Father Alphonse Hamel, was whether there was a library. He did not take well to discipline and had a calculating side to his personality, which was offset, however, by his obvious intellectual leadership. Having been introduced by his father to the great masters of French literature and to politics, he was brighter and more cultured than the average student. Conscious of his superiority, he did not make friends easily, preferring the company of such authors as Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas, \u00c9mile Zola, and Victor Hugo, whom he discovered in his father\u2019s well-stocked library. Secretive by nature, he put up a wall against anyone who wanted to lead him into the realm of emotions and sentiments, and secretive he would remain throughout his life. But since he was a gifted student and took all the prizes, he was forgiven everything.\n\nRen\u00e9\u2019s Jesuit teachers, including Charles Dub\u00e9, a cousin of the famous Fran\u00e7ois Hertel [Rodolphe Dub\u00e9], pampered him, while at the same time making him aware of the nationalist ferment and its causes, the economic and social inferiority of French Canadians that was intensified by the grinding poverty of the 1930s. In his memoirs, L\u00e9vesque would acknowledge that he had liked Hertel\u2019s iconoclastic book, Leur inqui\u00e9tude (Montreal, 1936), whose clear conclusion predicted that Quebec would separate from Canada some day. At a public meeting held in the seminary courtyard during the 1935 election campaign, he heard the nationalistic diatribe of Philippe Hamel*, a dentist and popular speaker for the Action Lib\u00e9rale Nationale, against the grip of \u201cforeign trusts\u201d on the lives of French Canadians. At the age of 13, he asked the existential question in the seminary\u2019s newspaper \u201cL\u2019Envol\u201d: Why remain French? His conclusion showed how precise his political thinking had already become and foreshadowed the realistic nationalist politician he would be, while also revealing a vaguely vengeful sentiment: \u201cLet\u2019s demand from the Jews and the Americans, not the insignificant positions that we now hold, but the high positions to which we are entitled. From the day when that is accomplished, we will be able to call ourselves masters in our own house.\u201d\n\nIn June 1937, when Ren\u00e9 was 14 years old, tragedy struck him. His father, whom he would describe in his memoirs as the most important man in his life, died at the age of 48 in a hospital in Quebec City. As the summer of 1938 came to an end, Ren\u00e9 was transplanted from his native Baie des Chaleurs region to that city. He saw his mother\u2019s swift remarriage in January 1939 as a betrayal. Diane Dionne wed Albert Pelletier, a lawyer with connections to the separatist Quebec City weekly La Nation, whose influence on Ren\u00e9 would be significant, despite their troubled relationship. Lacking the strictness of the father he had idolized, and at odds with his mother, he gradually lost interest in his studies. He had shone in the sixth year (Rhetoric) just as he had in the Gasp\u00e9, but at the beginning of 1940, while he was in the first year of the Philosophy program, the authorities of the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier expelled him because he had slipped to wretchedly low marks. He was accepted at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, where he concluded his classical studies with difficulty in 1941. He then enrolled at the law faculty of the Universit\u00e9 Laval, but abandoned his studies in 1943, to the great despair of his mother.\n\nL\u00e9vesque chose a Bohemian lifestyle, chasing girls and playing poker with Jean Marchand and Robert Cliche*, two Universit\u00e9 Laval students destined, as he was, to become famous, and he dreamed of becoming a writer. A budding playwright, he co-authored with Lucien C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u201cPrincesse \u00e0 marier,\u201d a \u201clight-hearted and highly imaginative little piece,\u201d which he had staged at the Palais Montcalm in Quebec City. The play was a monumental flop. This failure did not keep him from making a second and last foray into the world of drama. Probably in 1943 he wrote a piece for radio entitled \u201cAux quatre vents.\u201d The play would not be produced until it was rediscovered half a century later; it would be published in Montreal in 1999. In this work the 20-year-old L\u00e9vesque seems pessimistic about the future of the French Canadians of his time, whom he portrayed as reduced to a people made invisible by history. \u201cAux quatre vents\u201d also foreshadowed the Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque of the years to come. Indeed, what would he do with his life if not spend it all trying to liberate those French Canadians \u2013 who came to regard themselves as Quebecers \u2013 from their invisibility?\n\nIn fact, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s true passion was radio journalism, which he had discovered earlier at CHNC, in New Carlisle, during the summer of 1938, his last in the Gasp\u00e9. While he was gaining experience in Quebec City at the private radio station CKCV on Carr\u00e9 D\u2019Youville, and then at CBV, a regional station of Radio-Canada, the French-language network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, World War II broke out. Like the many Quebecers of his generation who were loath to shed their blood for the commonwealth, L\u00e9vesque was opposed to conscription, an issue that was tearing Canada apart. But General Charles de Gaulle\u2019s appeal to occupied France in June 1940 shook his convictions. The Nazis were threatening freedom and democracy. This was the challenge of his generation; he could not wash his hands of it.\n\nIn the fall of 1943 L\u00e9vesque was 21 years old. He was called up. He was quite willing to go and see the war that he was describing to his listeners on CBV, but with a microphone, not a gun. He pleaded first with his immediate superiors at Radio-Canada, who managed to have his military training postponed until sometime in January 1944. Shortly before that fateful date, he made a vain attempt to persuade the director general of Radio-Canada to find him a job as a war correspondent in one of its overseas teams. It was Uncle Sam who saved him from military service. As it happened, the American Office of War Information was recruiting bilingual information agents like him. And so, in May 1944 he was in London, attached to the French section of Voice of America / La Voix de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique, a program of the American Broadcasting Station in Europe that had been set up by the Americans and was flooding the occupied countries, particularly France, with propaganda. In June, when the Allies landed on French soil, L\u00e9vesque was eager to get to the line of fire, but his wartime odyssey did not really begin until February 1945. Holding the rank of junior lieutenant, he joined General Omar Nelson Bradley\u2019s army, which had liberated part of France and then stopped in Paris. Next came the march to the German border with General George Smith Patton and General Alexander McCarrell Patch, the crossing of the Rhine, and the discovery of a shattered Germany with its great cities, such as Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Munich, devastated. Finally, there was the horror of the Holocaust, which turned his stomach when he entered the concentration camp at Dachau with the first group of American journalists.\n\nWhen L\u00e9vesque went back home in the fall of 1945, a gulf separated him from the apprentice journalist of pre-war years. All his life he would repeatedly utter warnings, insisting that every society has the potential for returning to the jungle and barbarism. He would always be suspicious of the possible blunders of the Quebec nationalism that he himself would nonetheless strongly and rationally personify.\n\nRadio-Canada came to L\u00e9vesque\u2019s rescue by opening its doors to him in late October 1945. Despite the feeble voice he had brought back from the war, he became an announcer on La Voix du Canada, a daily news program produced by the international service of Radio-Canada and broadcast from Montreal to France and other French-speaking countries and territories. L\u00e9vesque presented Canadian current affairs in four parts: news, documentaries, news reports, and cultural events. He would stay at this job for nearly eight years. He also found refuge in marriage, children, and family life. On 3 May 1947 he pledged his loyalty to Louise L\u2019Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e since before the war.\n\nAt Radio-Canada, L\u00e9vesque was not restricted to his work with La Voix du Canada (which was sometimes broadcast in Canada). He could also be heard nationally. After hosting Journalistes au micro (1949\u201350), he would work simultaneously on La Revue de l\u2019actualit\u00e9 (1951\u201354) and La Revue des arts et lettres (1952\u201354), where he gave highly critical film reviews. Within a few years he established himself as one of Radio-Canada\u2019s leading lights. Imaginative but unmethodical, he loved doing on-the-spot reports. Those he wrote from Korea, where he was a war correspondent from July to September 1951, made his reputation as a great international reporter. During these years he worked closely with Judith Jasmin*, with whom he carried on a love affair. Though he did not look the part, he was considered at the time the Don Juan of Radio-Canada. There was something appealing about him. He loved women and they responded to him in kind. In October 1951 he and Jasmin were assigned to cover the visit of Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to Canada. From January 1954 they were co-hosts of Carrefour, a new radio program devoted to news reports. But soon the rising medium of television shunned him. L\u00e9vesque was no Adonis. Short and balding, he had tics and smoked like a chimney. Yet his lively interview with some Russian schoolgirls on Red Square in the fall of 1955 was a sensation on the television news. Radio-Canada had assigned him for radio but also for television \u2013 just this once would not hurt \u2013 to cover the visit of Lester Bowles Pearson*, Canada\u2019s minister of external affairs and future prime minister, to the Soviet Union. When the intransigent Nikita Khrushchev mistreated Pearson in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s presence, the special correspondent for Radio-Canada got his first international scoop. In 1956, though his bosses at Radio-Canada doubted he had the looks for the job, L\u00e9vesque finally made the leap to television and quickly rose to the rank of \u201cgod of the TV screen,\u201d to quote Georges-\u00c9mile Lapalme, leader of the provincial Liberal Party. On Point de mire, a cult program of the late 1950s, he used his passion for teaching and communicating to explain the world\u2019s great dramatic events, such as the Suez crisis and the war in Algeria. It was at this time that the born seducer began a secret love affair with a young actress who, in 1958, bore him a daughter he would never acknowledge. This extramarital paternity prompted Louise L\u2019Heureux to begin divorce proceedings, but she subsequently dropped them.\n\nIn December 1958 the producers at Radio-Canada went on strike for the right to form a union. The strike soon became politicized and foreshadowed the turmoil of the 1960s. This event, in which L\u00e9vesque was deeply involved, marked a turning point in his career. He went into it a journalist and came out a politician. The dispute dragged on for more than two months, with no movement on either side. He was dumbfounded by the indifference of John George Diefenbaker*\u2019s government and of his English-speaking colleagues at the CBC, who boycotted the strike, considering it a revolt against Canada. Many people would say that this strike was a catalyst in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s nationalistic development. Moreover, for the first time he had the experience of addressing large crowds, and became aware of his power over them. Once the dispute was settled, it seemed evident that television had become too small a world for him. Until then, he had asked the questions; from this time on, he would want to give the answers as well.\n\nOn 22 June 1960 L\u00e9vesque took the plunge, entering the political arena as a candidate in the riding of Montr\u00e9al-Laurier, where he won by a narrow margin. Courted by the Liberals since his resignation from Radio-Canada in April, he had finally rallied to the slogan of their new leader, Jean Lesage*, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change!,\u201d which prefigured the Quiet Revolution. The soundness and serious nature of the reforms proposed by the Liberals \u2013 free education, hospitalization insurance, a new direction in the economy, modernization of the state, and war on patronage \u2013 had persuaded him. He would soon assert himself as a star minister in the famous \u201cfireball team,\u201d which intended to bring the province into the modern era. This team, also baptized by the press as the \u201cthree Ls,\u201d combined the three leading figures in the Liberal Party: Lesage, Lapalme, and L\u00e9vesque. The new premier, Lesage, initially gave L\u00e9vesque two portfolios, public works and hydraulic resources. At public works, convinced that it was possible to be a politician and remain honest, L\u00e9vesque attacked corruption, at the request of his leader, who had made it one of his priorities. More specifically, he attacked the system of patronage instituted by the former government of Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis*. Henceforth, all government contracts for more than $25,000 would be tendered.\n\nIn March 1961 two ministries \u2013 hydraulic resources and mines \u2013 merged to become the ministry of natural resources. L\u00e9vesque would hold this portfolio until January 1966, but he left public works to Ren\u00e9 Saint-Pierre. A practical politician, L\u00e9vesque did not let ideology get in his way. If he counted primarily on the state as the lever of economic development, it was because French-speaking Quebecers possessed only one big business: their government. They had no true entrepreneurial class capable of combatting the province\u2019s economic backwardness in certain sectors. He was of the opinion that electricity, which Quebec had in abundance, must become a public monopoly. It had been too hastily let go to foreign capitalists, who charged exorbitant and disparate rates, depending on whether one lived in Montreal or the Gasp\u00e9, and sent the profits out of the province. It must now be entrusted to the Quebec Hydroelectric Commission (or Hydro-Quebec), created in 1944 by the government of Ad\u00e9lard Godbout*, which had nationalized the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company and Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated to form the nucleus of Hydro-Quebec. What was needed for electricity to become the engine of the Quebec economy was the consolidation of its exploitation, which was divided at the time among 11 private companies that the government should nationalize. In 1962 L\u00e9vesque created an uproar by uttering for the first time the taboo word \u201cnationalization.\u201d He finally imposed it, despite the original refusal of Lesage, who was worried about its repercussions on the provincial debt.\n\nThe premier did indeed have a change of heart. He was outraged by the blackmail on the part of the Toronto and Montreal bankers, who not only refused to finance nationalization but threatened to have nothing to do with government loans if the administration took over the Shawinigan Water and Power Company. The argument that increasing the debt would drive the province into bankruptcy, put forward by George Carlyle Marler and other ministers opposed to nationalization, did not hold up. Douglas Henderson Fullerton, an independent financial expert consulted by Lesage, gave him a reassuring report. If Canadian moneylenders did not want to assist in underwriting nationalization, the Americans would be only too glad to do so, since the province\u2019s debt was one of the lowest in the country. L\u00e9vesque got the same assurance from Roland Giroux*, a broker who had close ties to American financial circles. After the election, L\u00e9vesque would send him to New York with his advisers Michel B\u00e9langer* and Jacques Parizeau* to borrow the money required to finance nationalization. As for the electrical companies, they had at last given in, confining their actions to raising the stakes with respect to the monetary compensation that the government planned to pay them. If Lesage finally stopped his shilly-shallying, it was also to reaffirm his leadership, which had been damaged by his indecision. There was no better way to re-establish unity than a surprise election he was certain to win, according to the opinion poll he had secretly commissioned.\n\nOn 14 Nov. 1962, in an election that was almost a referendum, fought under the slogan \u201cMasters in our own house,\u201d the voters gave their consent to the nationalization of the private electrical companies. The total cost, originally estimated at $600 million, would rise to $604 million. The loan negotiated in New York would come to $300 million. The nationalist fervour of the 1960s had worked in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s favour. It had become inconceivable that huge foreign companies should exploit the province\u2019s resources and then send most of their profits abroad. Besides, the advantages of nationalization had finally been made obvious. It was necessary to put an end to the waste caused by the overlapping of power lines and anarchy in the catchment areas, where private companies were stepping on each other, as well as to the varying rates being charged. The government would recover the taxes that companies had been sending to Ottawa. The Quebec economy would also benefit from the creation of a whole range of secondary enterprises in different regions. Last of all, L\u00e9vesque, whose charisma and persuasive powers were far from negligible, had had the support of the people and the press. He had also been able to count on the respect and admiration that Lesage still showed him.\n\nThree years later, on 15 Oct. 1965, L\u00e9vesque would carry out an initial assessment of Hydro-Quebec. It had become the largest industrial enterprise in the province, with 17,000 employees and assets of $2.5 billion. It produced 34 per cent of Canada\u2019s hydroelectric energy. Furthermore, this \u201ccolossus,\u201d as the press called it, spoke French, both on the large construction sites and at its head office, where English had ruled absolutely until that time, even though a majority of the employees were French-speaking. Hydroelectricity became the field for training French-speaking managers and engineers, who had formerly been underestimated at the Shawinigan Water and Power Company.\n\nL\u00e9vesque also discovered that the mining sector was simply a \u201cbranch\u201d of foreign multinationals, which shipped ore to the United States, where factories transformed it into finished products. Since the province was satisfied with royalties that were among the lowest in Canada, the profits also ended up in foreign hands. The management and the expertise came from elsewhere. He also observed that there was no real policy on mining development. Convinced that the state had to play a role in exploring and exploiting its mineral resources, he undertook a radical revision of legislation on mining, which by now was more than 80 years old. Then, by forcing Lesage\u2019s hand while the premier was under pressure from the big companies, he would create in 1965, with the support of his cabinet ally Eric William Kierans*, the Quebec Mining Exploration Company (SOQUEM). To ensure that the concessions would no longer lie dormant for years, the leases became revocable after ten years of inactivity. Last of all, he doubled the mining fees previously paid by the mining companies.\n\nLong before the awakening of the First Nations, L\u00e9vesque was keenly interested in the aboriginal question. The Gasp\u00e9 of his childhood was also the homeland of the Micmac, who were confined to their wretched reserves in Restigouche and Maria (Gesgapegiag), adjacent to New Carlisle. In the summer of 1954, as a reporter for Carrefour, he accompanied Prince Philip on a visit to the Inuit of Ungava Bay, and the discovery of their Third-World conditions left him feeling uneasy. In 1961, during a trip to New Quebec that he undertook as part of his portfolio as minister of natural resources, he rediscovered the almost prisonlike world in which First Nations people and Inuit were living. And he was distressed by the absence of French in the province\u2019s northern latitudes. In the federal schools, neither French nor Inuktitut had any standing. This vast territory had been ceded to Quebec in 1912, but its governments had allowed Ottawa to move in with its schools, its health clinics, and its civil servants, all of which served to anglicize the aboriginals.\n\nDetermined to recover authority over New Quebec and its inhabitants, L\u00e9vesque came up against the refusal of the federal minister of northern affairs and national resources, Arthur Laing, who held back the transfer by claiming that the Inuit did not want to speak French. At the end of May 1964, in Winnipeg, Laing maintained that Ottawa had to keep control of education, health, and welfare, \u201cin order,\u201d according to the Montreal daily Le Devoir (30 May), \u201cto preserve the rights of Eskimos as first-class citizens.\u201d A furious L\u00e9vesque retorted that the minister\u2019s fears \u201cwere inspired by political considerations and hypocrisy.\u201d When Laing told the House of Commons he doubted L\u00e9vesque\u2019s sincerity, the latter reminded him that Quebec was the only province in Canada that had set an example, since confederation, of respect for the linguistic and religious rights of the minority. The Toronto press, for its part, attributed \u201cterritorial ambitions\u201d to L\u00e9vesque, according to the title of an article by Blair Fraser* in Maclean\u2019s on 16 May 1964, and even separatist designs. Nevertheless, the territory in question belonged to Quebec and the Inuit population, who, not being considered \u201cIndian\u201d by the federal government, were not covered by the Indian Act. Even worse, in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s eyes, was the fact that the neighbouring province of Newfoundland had been governing Inuit there since entering confederation in 1949. He was exasperated by this double standard and the words being put into his mouth. According to Fraser\u2019s report, he warned: \u201cThis Ungava issue is a test case of federal-provincial co-operation. If we can\u2019t even settle this, we can\u2019t settle anything.\u201d Common sense would finally prevail, thanks to the direct involvement of Prime Minister Pearson and Premier Lesage. During his term as federal minister of northern affairs and national resources, from 1953 to 1957, Lesage had not concerned himself with the question, but now he fully supported L\u00e9vesque\u2019s claim. Although he occasionally toned down his minister\u2019s aggressive behaviour, he nevertheless suggested to Pearson that he bring Laing into line and demanded, at the federal-provincial conference held in November 1963, that the transfer of jurisdiction be put into effect before 1 April 1964.\n\nA few years later the New Quebec that L\u00e9vesque had known in the 1960s, with its unsanitary shacks lacking electricity and heating, would become unrecognizable. Electricity and heated dwellings would be the norm. But in addition the city of Kuujjuaq would have a hospital, a secondary school, an arena, and an administrative centre. L\u00e9vesque had had a hand in this result. By putting the north under his protection, he had stimulated intergovernmental innovation and competition in the fields of education, health, and the economy.\n\nIn October 1965 there was a surprise cabinet shuffle. The pendulum of Liberal reform swung from the economy to social policies. L\u00e9vesque left the natural resources portfolio for that of family and social welfare. The world of the underprivileged was familiar to him. On Saturday mornings, his riding office was crowded with ordinary individuals asking to see \u201cRen\u00e9.\u201d L\u00e9vesque himself had the natural humility of common people. His first objective was to put through one single law on social assistance, centred on the family. He tackled the problem of adoption, which he wanted to make more humane, got approval for free medical assistance to the poor, increased the allowances for unmarried mothers, and prepared a white paper on handicapped children. At the Ottawa conference held in January 1966, convinced that social security ought to come from the provincial government, he demanded \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 the return of responsibility for family allowances. Thanks to this last trial of strength with Ottawa, and the earlier one that had pitted him against Laing, L\u00e9vesque took the measure of Canadian federalism, which seemed to him to have been hardening with respect to Quebec\u2019s demands since the arrival of Pierre Elliott Trudeau* in Ottawa following the November 1965 election. In February 1969 he would admit, in an interview with Jacques Guay of Le Magazine Maclean (Montr\u00e9al): \u201c[As for] me, I already no longer thought it possible that a federal state would agree to cut off a limb. As I watched the files and the conflicts with Ottawa multiply, I became, without daring to admit it to myself, more and more of a sovereignist.\u201d\n\nOn 5 June 1966 his party\u2019s defeat at the polls forshadowed the end of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s political career as a Liberal. Stripped of power, he had the impression that he was staring into a void and was not too sure what to do with his future. Having been re-elected in his riding, his only immediate certainty was that he would complete his four-year term as a backbencher. After that, he would see \u2013 perhaps he would go back to journalism, but nothing was less sure. L\u00e9vesque rethought his political affiliations in a Quebec caught up in the fever of protest that was sweeping the western world. Pacifists were denouncing the war in Vietnam, students were occupying campuses, partisans of independence were chanting \u201cLe Qu\u00e9bec aux Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois,\u201d supporters of the Union Nationale were demanding \u201c\u00c9galit\u00e9 ou Ind\u00e9pendence\u201d as their leader Daniel Johnson* \u2013 now premier \u2013 had written in his book published in Montreal in 1965. In July 1967 Charles de Gaulle, the president of France, unleashed his famous \u201cVive le Qu\u00e9bec libre!\u201d from the balcony of Montreal\u2019s city hall. And then there was the Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec, which was setting off its bombs.\n\nPreviously, when L\u00e9vesque was asked whether he was a nationalist, he would hesitate, still haunted by his memories of the war. Though he was a nationalist in his own way, the question would always make him uneasy. In 1948 he had written in the staff magazine of Radio-Canada\u2019s international service: \u201cI am for all practical purposes a Quebec nationalist, a perfect Laurentien.\u201d In fact, what left him cold was traditional French Canadian nationalism, with its \u201cFrenchifying gimmicks, bilingual cheques, the flag,\u201d as he would put it in 1969 to Le Magazine Maclean. L\u00e9vesque, who peppered his remarks with tangible examples that inspired confidence, displayed a practical nationalism. If he made a reference to the massive dam on the Rivi\u00e8re Manicouagan, it was to suggest to French-speaking Quebecers that they were capable of great things. He would never be a flag waver, fearing the politics of the street with its ever-present potential for emotionalism and brutality. This was the reason why he was constantly at odds with the Rassemblement pour l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Nationale, whose direct action, verbal violence, and chauvinistic language repelled him. Nevertheless, in the June 1966 election, when that party was running candidates, he was troubled. Since Pierre Bourgault*, then the leader of the RIN, had moderated his words and given a social-democratic flavour to his political position, L\u00e9vesque had the impression that he was fighting against a fraternal party.\n\nEarlier, on 27 February, L\u00e9vesque had made it clear that the aim of nationalism, as he was trying to live it out, was to abolish the privileges, not the rights, of the English-speaking minority. He confirmed in his memoirs: \u201cI am a nationalist \u2026 if that means being for oneself, fiercely for oneself \u2013 or against something \u2026 against a given situation. But never against someone.\u201d He saw this \u201csituation\u201d more clearly after six years of political struggles. The Quiet Revolution was only a beginning. Quebec had to go further to free itself from the economic yoke it had laboured under for too long, and from a federal regime that had hardened after the first years of the decade, when there had been a more obvious willingness on Ottawa\u2019s part to cooperate with the provinces. The acceleration of Quebec nationalism during the 1960s left its mark on L\u00e9vesque. Even though it was not really a question of conversion, he had been throwing around, especially since 1963, incendiary phrases that bore witness to his radicalization. During a stop in Toronto at the end of May 1963, he admitted to television interviewer Pierre Berton* that he would not shed many tears if Quebec separated. On 5 May 1964 Le Devoir\u2019s headline on the report of his visit to Timmins, Ont., stated that, according to L\u00e9vesque, \u201cbetter separation than constant quarrelling.\u201d On 9 May, speaking to the students at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Marie in Montreal, he declared that the only appropriate status for Quebec was that of an associate state, a status which would have to be negotiated with the rest of Canada \u201cwithout rifles and without dynamite as far as possible.\u2026 If Quebec is refused this status, we will have to separate,\u201d Le Devoir noted two days later. According to the Montreal Star of 20 Feb. 1967, he warned his listeners in western Canada: \u201cEither Quebec gets a new deal [with the rest of Canada] or eventually it will get out.\u201d\n\nDuring the summer of 1967, after carefully weighing all the factors, L\u00e9vesque concluded that the country had become a \u201cmadhouse,\u201d and that the future lay somewhere else than in this federal Canada, which he rejected, and of which Trudeau had become the champion ever since his election to the House of Commons in 1965. \u201cWe are Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois,\u201d he declared in the manifesto he issued first to his supporters in the riding of Laurier on 18 Sept. 1967. (A slightly amended version would be published in Montreal the following year.) The title, Option Qu\u00e9bec (published as An option for Quebec, Toronto, 1968), summed up its basic idea. At the age of 45, L\u00e9vesque chose to struggle henceforth for a Quebec homeland. By doing this, he assumed the role of fraternal enemy to Trudeau, his ally of the 1950s, when they and a handful of others comprised the informal opposition to the Duplessis government. When the Quiet Revolution made its first proclamations, they were in agreement on many things: a larger role for the state in education, the economy, and social affairs; the modernization of Quebec; and the democratization of its political life. But the conflict of personalities was never far below the surface. The nationalization of private electrical companies was one of the subjects on which they took opposite stands. Their relationship, never easy, was finally overwhelmed by the flood tide of the new nationalism. Just a few short months later, in April 1968, Trudeau would become prime minister of Canada. A battle of titans broke out between two strong leaders who had irreconcilable visions of their province\u2019s future.\n\nIn October 1967 the convention of the Quebec Liberal Party opened in an atmosphere of hostility, which became contagious as soon as the party\u2019s former star took his seat. The wind had changed. Lesage and Kierans, who had worked closely with L\u00e9vesque during the good years of Liberal reform, sealed his fate by threatening to resign if his ideas were supported by the delegates. Nevertheless, L\u00e9vesque tabled his resolution, \u201cA sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union,\u201d inspired by his manifesto. Quebec would no longer be a province but a sovereign state, levying taxes, passing laws, and dealing with other nations in its own name and its own language, but would associate with Canada at the economic level. Unable to convince his Liberal comrades-in-arms, L\u00e9vesque withdrew his resolution before the show of hands that would take place, nonetheless, after his departure. He announced that he would do his best to promote it elsewhere. Then, followed by a handful of supporters, he left the hall. From then on, the rebel would sit in the Legislative Assembly (renamed National Assembly the following year) as the independent member for Laurier, while preparing to launch his own party.\n\nFor some, L\u00e9vesque was now a heroic figure; for others, he was public enemy number one. With 400 adherents one month after his resignation, the group that would become the sovereignist party had grown to 2,000 by January 1968. On 19 April, at the founding of the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association, from which the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would be born, the membership had climbed to more than 7,000. From the moment the MSA was founded, L\u00e9vesque kept the future party from becoming sidetracked into political marginalization. He had to threaten to go home to win respect for the educational and linguistic rights of the English-speaking minority, which were contested by the faction within the movement that identified with the RIN. L\u00e9vesque gauged the fragility of his leadership and distinguished more clearly the various groups, often opposed to each other, that made up his new political family: former Liberals, the separatist followers of Bourgault (who would himself scupper the RIN), social-credit supporters from the Ralliement National, left-wing trade unionists with socialist leanings, and a multitude of students. Half of the delegates were under the age of 30. The founding convention of the PQ on 11 Oct. 1968, unlike that of the MSA, proceeded harmoniously. The PQ\u2019s program would be similar to the one sketched out in the spring by the delegates of the MSA: French as the only official language, recognition of the rights of the minority, a unilateral declaration of independence, a presidential system, compulsory trade-union membership, an interventionist state that would yet respect free enterprise, territorial integrity, the recovery of Labrador, and withdrawal from military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nBut before reaching the paradise of power, there was the desert to cross. Between 1966 and 1976, L\u00e9vesque led a rather Spartan existence. Until his personal defeat in the election of April 1970, he had drawn his salary as an mna. That summer he left Louise L\u2019Heureux and went to live with Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9, a teacher from Alma. L\u00e9vesque could not rely on his mna pension since he was sending it to his wife, who was raising their three children. Fortunately, he had some income from his work as a journalist. Back in September 1966 the Montreal periodical Dimanche-Matin had commissioned him to write a weekly column, but he gave it up in 1969, shortly before the 1970 election. After his defeat in Laurier, Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al in turn made him an offer of $200 a week. L\u00e9vesque had always refused to take a salary as leader of the PQ, but in February 1976, after the ind\u00e9pendantiste Montreal daily Le Jour ceased publication, depriving him of his income as a columnist, the party paid him $18,000 a year.\n\nThe PQ solicited votes for the first time on 29 April 1970 in a provincial election dominated by the fear of separatism fanned by the new Liberal leader, Robert Bourassa*, and by the intervention of the federal Liberals, who published in Montreal, in their internal newsletter What\u2019s New?, a study purporting to show the benefits of federalism for the people of Quebec. The figures were so far-fetched, however, that Bourassa and Trudeau disowned the study. Bourassa\u2019s promise to create 100,000 jobs, a key theme in Quebec where there was a high level of unemployment, also weighed heavily in the outcome of the voting. Defeated in the riding of Laurier, L\u00e9vesque succeeded in getting only seven members elected, even though his party received 23.1 per cent of the votes. That year the October crisis proved disastrous for his political position. The FLQ had kidnapped James Richard Cross, a British diplomat, and Pierre Laporte*, the provincial minister of labour and manpower, as well as of immigration, who would be found murdered on 17 October. To overcome the FLQ, Trudeau, under pressure from the Bourassa government, toyed with the idea of proclaiming the War Measures Act. On 14 October, in collaboration with Claude Ryan*, the publisher of Le Devoir, L\u00e9vesque brought together leaders from different social spheres, including Louis Laberge*, president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec, Alfred Rouleau, future president of the Desjardins movement, and sociologists Fernand Dumont* and Guy Rocher. The objective of the 16 signatories to a common declaration drawn up by L\u00e9vesque was to encourage the governments to abandon strong-arm tactics and negotiate with the kidnappers to save the lives of the hostages. Their appeal was not heeded, however. On 16 October Ottawa proclaimed the War Measures Act, giving it sweeping emergency powers [see Trudeau]. By the next day some 40 members of the PQ had been arrested. In L\u00e9vesque\u2019s view, this was an extreme and anti-democratic measure that violated the centuries-old British tradition of habeas corpus. Associated with the FLQ by its opponents, the PQ lost 45,000 members who would no longer risk describing themselves as \u201cp\u00e9quistes.\u201d\n\nRepudiated by public opinion, the PQ was a victim of illegal espionage by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. During the night of 8 Jan. 1973 RCMP agents broke into a building and stole the party\u2019s membership list in what has become known as Operation Ham, as would be disclosed in the reports of inquiries by Judge David C. McDonald (1979\u201381) in Ottawa and Commissioner Jean F. Keable (1981) in Quebec City. L\u00e9vesque would accuse the Trudeau government of wanting to take advantage of the extremes of FLQ terrorism to strike a death blow to his party.\n\nL\u00e9vesque\u2019s handicap at the polls was still the same: people were afraid of sovereignty. Having shifted to the PQ in May 1972, Claude Morin, who had been deputy minister of federal-provincial affairs and intergovernmental affairs in the administrations of Lesage, Johnson, Jean-Jacques Bertrand*, and Bourassa, persuaded L\u00e9vesque to hold a referendum before making any declaration of independence. But Premier Bourassa called a snap election before L\u00e9vesque had a chance to get the idea accepted by the followers of economist Jacques Parizeau, who favoured independence with no referendum and no obligatory association with the rest of Canada. On 29 Oct. 1973 the Liberals won a landslide victory. L\u00e9vesque, who ran in the riding of Dorion, suffered personal defeat for the second time and lost one of the seven members elected three years earlier. All was not doom and gloom, however. The sovereignist vote increased from 23.1 to 30.2 per cent, and reached nearly 40 per cent among francophones. Furthermore, the PQ became the official opposition, led by an influential new member, constitutional expert Jacques-Yvan Morin. The Liberal Party elected 102 members, thanks to a not-very-democratic voting system that gave 5.5 per cent of the seats to the party that had won 30.2 per cent of the popular vote.\n\nL\u00e9vesque wondered whether he was still the right man for the situation. He wanted to call it quits and do something else with his life. In Quebec City, his six National Assembly members were left on their own. Soon his lack of interest in the party led to grumbling. As the November 1974 convention drew near, he agreed, at the urgent request of his entourage, to stay at his post, but on his own terms. He was determined to bring to heel those who were eroding his authority by means of the debate on the need to hold a referendum before declaring independence. At the gathering, which has gone down in history as the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d convention (because of the idea of \u201c\u00e9tapisme\u201d attributed to Morin), L\u00e9vesque had the word \u201creferendum\u201d written into the program. In early September 1976 he put down the rebellion of mnas Robert Burns and Claude Charron, who were calling into question his leadership.\n\nWith peace restored, L\u00e9vesque began confidently and calmly to prepare for the fall\u2019s election campaign. He had turned 54 on 24 August. He seemed more relaxed, less aggressive. His love life had become more stable now that he was living with Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. For a pro-independence party, the prospects of coming to power had never been so good. L\u00e9vesque expected to win a minimum of 35 seats and, if luck was with him, to form a minority government. The proposal adopted at the 1974 convention \u2013 to hold a referendum conditional on the attitude of the federal government \u2013 now gave way to a clearer electoral promise: there would be a referendum before the end of the first term of office.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was facing a government worn down by six years in power and discredited by patronage, political interference, and conflicts of interest in the Quebec Liquor Corporation and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Exploitation des Loteries et Courses du Qu\u00e9bec (revealed by the commission of inquiry into organized crime). Bourassa was also facing accusations of nepotism. Moreover, the premier was deluding himself by thinking that he would achieve victory by using Ottawa as a whipping boy. When Trudeau had come to him in the spring seeking support for his plan to repatriate the British North America Act of 1867, Bourassa had refused. Trudeau had then threatened to proceed unilaterally, thereby giving Bourassa a pretext for calling an early election. Last of all, the fragility of the Liberal government was partly due also to the Official Language Act (also known as Bill 22), which, among other things, had proclaimed French as the official language of Quebec, but divided the English-speaking voters who traditionally supported the Liberals. Yet it was not so much the proclamation of French as the official language that had outraged anglophones, but rather the linguistic tests imposed on children who wanted to enrol in an English school. They were afraid that these tests would keep immigrants and francophones out of their schools. L\u00e9vesque, for his part, saw the act as an arbitrary and odious measure that opened the door to discrimination between different ethnic groups. Above all, Bill 22 did not deal realistically with the question of getting immigrants to acquire the French language.\n\nOn 15 November the PQ caucus increased from 6 mnas to 71 and the Liberal Party dropped from 97 to 26. To Claude Morin and some analysts, L\u00e9vesque owed his victory above all to having downplayed sovereignty during the campaign and having promised to hold a referendum. Be that as it may, his determination to introduce political transparency and good government (as the saying goes) also persuaded a majority of voters. L\u00e9vesque had accomplished the tour de force of not only rallying his customary electoral supporters \u2013 trade unionists, students, teachers, intellectuals, young people \u2013 but also making a breakthrough into circles that had previously rejected his message, such as small shopkeepers, mayors of villages and small towns, women, the elderly, farmers, and even military personnel. Unlike anglophones who had revived the moribund Union Nationale rather than cast their votes for the PQ, immigrants had proved much more receptive. History took an abrupt turn. For the first time, a party that proposed to break up confederation would form the government of Quebec. Prime Minister Trudeau, half-heartedly congratulating the winner, warned him that he would never negotiate the partition of Canada.\n\nL\u00e9vesque would hold power for two terms, 1976\u201381 and 1981\u201385. For support, he called on a team of 18 ministers, 5 of whom held two portfolios, with a total of 23 ministries. Some of them had impressive credentials and were graduates of elite schools: Jacques Parizeau (London School of Economics and Political Science), Jacques-Yvan Morin (Harvard University and University of Cambridge), Claude Morin (Columbia University), Yves B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Bernard Landry (Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris). Others, like broadcaster Lise Payette, brought qualities such as celebrity status, vivacity, and charisma that were sometimes missing in those who shone by reason of their education and experience. L\u00e9vesque would need all these abilities to turn around both the financial management of the province and the economy. Public services were more costly in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada. A family of four in Quebec paid $1,000 more in taxes than a comparable family in the other provinces. The economic growth for his first year in power would be lower than that of the country as a whole, while unemployment would rise to 9.5 per cent. Far from being paralysed by these sombre prospects, the new government, on its election, set in motion a huge wave of reform harking back to that of the 1960s. These changes would radically alter Quebec society. First of all, L\u00e9vesque could finally achieve his goal of political transparency; he pushed it to the limit by banning secret electoral funds and replacing them in 1977 with a system of public financing for political parties. As the victim of a system that created an imbalance between a party\u2019s real strength and its representation in parliament, he began to redraw the electoral map, which gave up to six times as much weight to the rural vote as to the urban, and change the electoral system, which similarly created an imbalance between the percentage of votes and the number of seats. He introduced elements of proportional voting, but could not complete this last reform because of the solid opposition of his mnas. Relying on the public\u2019s hostility to proportional representation and feeling threatened by the complexity of proportional voting, most of them also saw such a reform as a source of political instability, which would make it difficult, for instance, to pass controversial bills. On 23 June 1978 L\u00e9vesque would as well put through the Referendum Act, which was to govern the holding of a referendum.\n\nDuring the election campaign, L\u00e9vesque had promised to make Quebec as French as Ontario was English. In his view, however, law and language were not a good match, as he had warned Premier Bourassa when the latter had proclaimed the Official Language Act in 1974. Moreover, he said openly that he found it humiliating to have to resort to legislation, since only a downtrodden and colonized people must brandish the law to impose their language. But the decline of French, especially in Montreal, the massive anglicization of immigrants, and the demographic and linguistic context of North America, where the ratio of French-speaking Quebecers to non-francophones was one to forty, threatened the survival of a French Quebec.\n\nIn L\u00e9vesque\u2019s opinion, it was not a question of scrapping the Official Language Act in order to give birth to a new \u201cMagna Carta\u201d of language for general edification. He simply wanted to modify it in order to give back to francophones a useful enjoyment of their language at work, in signage, in business, and in public administration, and to get immigrants to acquire the French language. But Camille Laurin*, the influential and persuasive minister of state for cultural development, acting on the advice of sociologists Rocher and Dumont, took him further than he wanted to go. Proclaimed and put into force on 26 Aug. 1977, the Charter of the French Language, commonly known as Bill 101, declared Quebec a unilingual society and excluded English from the legislature and courts in violation of article 133 of the Canadian constitution, which guarantees the use of both languages. (This part of the Quebec law would be struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada in December 1979.) Moreover, the law made English schools available only to children whose parents had studied in English in Quebec. This is the \u201cQuebec clause,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cCanada clause\u201d favoured by L\u00e9vesque, which would have opened English schools to the children of all English-speaking Canadians. According to Dr Laurin, on 1 April 1977, the day before he tabled his white paper in parliament, the premier carelessly remarked to him during an emotional t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I like your law, doctor. I have to pass it because we are not free. I can\u2019t prevent immigrants from coming to our province, but if I do nothing, they will become anglicized and dispossess us. I have no choice. If we lived in a normal country, doctor, we wouldn\u2019t need your law.\u201d Though he finally accepted the Quebec clause, he did so also because he was gambling that the English-speaking provinces with a French-speaking minority would adopt the reciprocity he had offered them. Under this arrangement, anglophones from a province that granted its minority the same access to schools as was granted by Quebec to its English-speaking minority could enrol their children in English-language schools in Quebec. If this reciprocity were to be accepted by the English-speaking provinces, it would effectively cancel the Quebec clause. In cabinet, L\u00e9vesque could not oppose the bill\u2019s article on the language of instruction without running the risk of finding himself in the minority. This text \u2013 which would become the law that would have the greatest effect on the face of Quebec and the mentality of its people \u2013 enjoyed solid support among the public, party members and mnas, and in the cabinet. This was far from being the case among anglophones, more than 130,000 of whom would choose to emigrate between 1976 and 1981, mostly to Ontario. Similarly, motivated by the westward shift of their financial activity, a number of large companies, such as the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, a multinational that did 80 per cent of its business outside the province, would move to Toronto, giving Bill 101 as the reason.\n\nTo end Quebec\u2019s first-place standing for the greatest number of road accidents, the lowest compensation for claims, and the highest insurance premiums in Canada, and to correct a situation where one Quebec vehicle in five had no insurance, L\u00e9vesque introduced the system of public and compulsory automobile insurance advocated in 1974 in the Report of the committee of inquiry on automobile insurance. This study had been done under Jean-Louis Gauvin as chair and commissioned by the Bourassa government, which later shelved it. The Act to establish the R\u00e9gie de l\u2019Assurance Automobile du Qu\u00e9bec and the Automobile Insurance Act, both of which took effect in March 1978, were unpopular pieces of legislation. The complicated new system required a driver to carry two forms of insurance, a public one for personal injury regardless of liability (which some ministers complained would absolve drivers of responsibility), and a private one for property damage (which, it was believed, would further increase the cost). Moreover, the reform caused an outcry among lawyers and insurance agents close to the PQ, who saw their livelihood being taken away from them. Under pressure from lawyers, who were well represented in the cabinet, the government was divided. The legislation crossed the finish line only with L\u00e9vesque\u2019s decisive support for Lise Payette, the minister of consumers, cooperatives, and financial institutions.\n\nAccording to L\u00e9vesque and his minister of agriculture, Jean Garon, Ottawa was favouring the big grain and cattle farms in the western provinces, while confining Quebec to dairy farming. This policy stood in the way of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s determination to diversify Quebec agriculture to develop the food-processing industry and agricultural self-sufficiency. On 22 Dec. 1978, to curb financial speculation, he had the Act to preserve agricultural land proclaimed (which in its effects was retroactive to 9 November).\n\nAs well, Quebecers\u2019 entrepreneurship emerged in the economy. In 1978 Parizeau, the finance minister, abolished the eight per cent sales tax on everyday consumer goods to assist low-income families while also helping the vulnerable sectors of the economy \u2013 textiles, furniture, footwear, and clothing. In 1979 he introduced stock-savings plans to initiate Quebecers into the stock market and at the same time create a reserve of local capital for small and medium businesses. Along the same lines, the government set up the Program to Stimulate the Economy and Uphold Employment (1977), adopted a policy of preferential purchasing (1978), and published in 1979 a strategy for economic development, B\u00e2tir le Qu\u00e9bec\u2026.\n\nOn the social front, L\u00e9vesque brought in a long list of measures that showed the social-democratic orientation of his government: free medicine for the elderly (1977), the Youth Protection Act (1977), therapeutic abortion (1977), the Act to secure the handicapped in the exercise of their rights (1978), and the Act respecting child daycare (1979). On the labour front, the government had a law against strike-breaking passed (1977), promoted labour-management dialogue by organizing the economic summit at La Malbaie (1977), and had the Act respecting occupational health and safety given royal assent (1979). In the field of culture, in addition to the Charter of the French Language and the creation of maisons de la culture, the Act to incorporate the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de D\u00e9veloppement des Industries Culturelles was assented to in 1978. Justice minister Marc-Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9dard, for his part, dusted off and democratized the administration of justice, set up the Commission Qu\u00e9becoise des Lib\u00e9rations Conditionnelles, and instituted class-action suits that year. L\u00e9vesque also provided the province with a policy on scientific research (1980). To put an end to the grip of U.S. corporations on Quebec\u2019s asbestos, which was being sent out of the country to be processed, he tabled Bill 121, authorizing the government to nationalize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asbestos Limit\u00e9e in 1978. Protracted judicial skirmishes with the American company began, which would go on until 1982. In the meantime, asbestos fibre would be declared carcinogenic, and the industry collapsed. The beautiful dream would cost the taxpayers $435 million.\n\nIn foreign policy, L\u00e9vesque pursued two main objectives. Following the example of premiers Lesage and Johnson, he sought to maximize Quebec\u2019s visibility in the world by developing more and more contacts with other countries, whose sympathy would be useful if ever the people of Quebec authorized him to form a new country. The second pillar of his foreign policy was based on his determination to deal directly, in his own name and without a federal chaperone, with foreign dignitaries and heads of state. This policy brought him into conflict with Ottawa, which was jealous of its international sovereignty, and occasionally led to embarrassing situations. In January 1977, at the Economic Club of New York, where only the Quebec fleur-de-lys flag was flown beside the star-spangled banner, L\u00e9vesque tried to reassure the 1,600 guests \u2013 mostly American moneylenders and investors \u2013 about the security of their investments in Quebec. Since he spent almost his entire speech drawing a bold parallel between the independence of Quebec and that of the American colonies 200 years earlier, it was a \u201cmonumental flop,\u201d as he would write in his memoirs. He made up for this failure in November of that year, during an equally sensational official visit to Paris. The French president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, and his prime minister, Raymond Barre, welcomed him with all the show of respect due a real head of state, and not like an ordinary provincial premier, as Ottawa had insisted. But Ottawa was less worried about the thickness of the red carpet than about L\u00e9vesque\u2019s determination to give Franco-Quebec dialogue a more political dimension. The creation of an annual summit meeting between the French prime minister and the premier of Quebec confirmed Canada\u2019s fears, especially since the prime ministers of France and Canada did not meet once a year. Besides, placed on the same footing as the prime minister of a sovereign country, with complete authority, L\u00e9vesque, an ordinary provincial leader, might raise topics that went beyond Quebec\u2019s jurisdiction. Ottawa would not rest until it had made Paris back down on the matter. And so, in February 1979, to lessen the impact of the first Franco-Quebec summit, which was held that year in Quebec City, Prime Minister Trudeau insisted that Barre should go to Ottawa first.\n\nThis visit gave L\u00e9vesque the opportunity to make clear his intentions with regard to Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. Their liaison had become public on the night of 5 Feb. 1977, when L\u00e9vesque, with Corinne in his car, had accidentally run over a homeless man lying in the street. In September 1978 he had obtained his divorce from Louise L\u2019Heureux. The presence of the young woman beside the premier of Quebec, on the occasion of a reception in honour of Barre and his wife, annoyed the French couple. In Paris a mistress is not among the invited guests. Power had not changed L\u00e9vesque in the slightest. Rebellious as ever, he sometimes refused to conform to the constraints that protocol placed on his office. He still smoked as much in front of the camera, and he wore short-sleeved shirts and, invariably, sports shoes, the eternal \u201cWallabees\u201d that amused the press. He smoothed things over by confiding to his guests that Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9 was his fianc\u00e9e and they would be married in April \u2013 as indeed they were, at a private ceremony on 12 April 1979.\n\nIn this year preceding the referendum, however, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s greatest challenge was to convince a majority of Quebecers to follow him all the way to independence. It was the battle of his life. During the 1976 election campaign, he had promised to hold a referendum before the end of his first term of office. On 1 Nov. 1979, despite unfavourable polls, he tabled in the National Assembly the white paper on sovereignty-association, which offered the rest of Canada a new agreement between two peoples, politically sovereign, but economically associated: Qu\u00e9bec-Canada, a new deal: the Qu\u00e9bec government proposal for a new partnership between equals, sovereignty-association. The document emphasized both Quebecers\u2019 desire for autonomy and the deadlocked federal system, and it proposed to take back all powers and taxes within the framework of a new association, more economic than political, between two sovereign states. Provincial civil servants, who were more concerned about their working conditions, which they were in the process of negotiating, than about the outcome of the referendum, disrupted the event by singing O Canada before smashing windows and shutting the journalists in the press room. The situation became more complicated at a cabinet meeting on 19 Dec. 1979. The adoption of a complex and rather long referendum question created divisions among the ministers. The question included a request for a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, as well as the idea adopted at a convention the previous June of a second referendum (to consult the people on the results of discussions with the federal government following the first referendum). Some ministers, including Denis Lazure* and Lise Payette, went home early in the evening, convinced that the premier would get what he wanted, even at some cost to Parizeau. The finance minister\u2019s opposition to what he considered the bizarre idea of a second referendum was flagging as time went on. L\u00e9vesque had to use all his authority to bring him into line. At the National Assembly the next day, he seemed to be troubled by the premier\u2019s reading of the question. He hurried out of the room, convinced that the definitive wording was not the one accepted the day before. In fact, L\u00e9vesque had forgotten to inform him of some minor changes introduced afterwards by the lawyers. Being suspicious by nature, Parizeau had had immediate doubts, but revised his position after further consideration.\n\nL\u00e9vesque had foreseen everything but the return of his eternal political rival, Trudeau. The Liberal leader, who had been defeated by Charles Joseph Clark\u2019s Conservatives in the election of 22 May 1979, resurfaced in December after the Conservative government fell. On 18 Feb. 1980 Trudeau was re-elected, just in time for the referendum. On 20 June of the previous year L\u00e9vesque had reached a decision: the referendum would be held in the spring of 1980. He made this decision public the next day, but without specifying the date \u2013 20 May 1980 \u2013 which he would divulge to the National Assembly on 15 April 1980. On 4 March the leading lights of the government had begun a 35-hour parliamentary debate on the referendum question that went on until 20 March. The confrontation, which was won hands down by the government, gave the Yes camp a slight lead. Indeed, for the first and only time, according to an internal poll conducted by the party, the PQ speakers had more than 58 per cent of the votes, and Ryan\u2019s No camp just 12 per cent. Put at a disadvantage by subsequent negative polls, a strategy with no clear direction, an overly bureaucratic organization, and unmotivated party members, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s campaign did not get off the ground. Moreover, Lise Payette, minister of state for the status of women, made women angry when she compared Ryan\u2019s wife, Yvette, to a housewife living in the shadow of her husband. The \u201cYvette\u201d movement in support of the No side caught fire and crippled the sovereignists, who were also hard put to counter the campaign led by the federal minister of justice and attorney general, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, a campaign L\u00e9vesque considered illegal and immoral. The minister, without hesitation, disregarded the law on popular consultation, which, among other things, limited the spending of the two sides, and he had federal cheques being mailed out to Quebecers sent with slogans favourable to the federalist camp. The final blow came from Prime Minister Trudeau, who, in a few sentences and with a few promises, shattered L\u00e9vesque\u2019s dream. Since L\u00e9vesque had stumbled earlier by emphasizing Trudeau\u2019s middle name, \u201cElliott,\u201d which recalled his mother\u2019s Scottish ancestry (just as Trudeau himself had stumbled during the 1976 election by evoking the victory \u201cof the blood brothers\u201d to distinguish the francophones who had voted for the PQ from the anglophones and allophones who had supported the Liberals), the prime minister made a point of shouting out that his \u201cname is a Quebec name.\u201d On 14 May, shortly before the vote, Trudeau promised to resign if federalism was not renewed to the satisfaction of Quebecers. In so doing he gave the undecided voters a reason for voting No.\n\nOn 20 May L\u00e9vesque suffered the bitterest defeat of his political career. The surveys had left him no illusions, but he had hoped to win a majority of the francophone vote. He did not get it and had to be satisfied with a total of 40.4 per cent of the votes. He concluded that the people of Quebec were not yet ready for independence. It was hard for him to understand, however, that it was possible to say no to oneself. He was not asking for a mandate to separate, but for a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with Canada. Those around him would criticize him for having waited too long to hold the referendum, for having given his adversary, doubly decapitated by the departure of Bourassa and the defeat of Trudeau, a chance to recover. In the opinion of former premier Bourassa, the referendum was L\u00e9vesque\u2019s most serious political error, for he had held it knowing that he would lose, thereby opening the way for Trudeau, who was burning with desire to repatriate the constitution without taking account of the province\u2019s demands. In L\u00e9vesque\u2019s view, the referendum had at least given judicial legitimacy to Quebecers\u2019 right to self-determination. By participating in the popular consultation, Ottawa had accepted, at the international level, the idea that it was the people of Quebec who should determine their future, not Ottawa and not English-speaking Canada. Politically weakened and brought back to his role as a provincial premier, L\u00e9vesque put his struggle for a Quebec homeland on the back burner. He got down to the business of patching up the time-worn 1867 document, adopting the demands of his predecessors: equality between francophones and anglophones, constitutional recognition of Quebec\u2019s distinct character, and a new sharing of powers between Ottawa and the provinces.\n\nThe ball was now in the federalists\u2019 court, L\u00e9vesque had declared on the evening of his defeat. Trudeau caught it on the fly and invited him and the other premiers to join him in negotiating a new federalism. At the constitutional conference held in Ottawa in September 1980, the prime minister insisted on repatriating the constitution and enshrining within it a charter of rights and freedoms before really dealing with the actual question of the new sharing of powers demanded by a majority of the provinces. Matters came to an impasse, and to resolve it Trudeau threatened to proceed without the premiers\u2019 agreement. On 6 October he presented a motion in the House of Commons for a unilateral repatriation of the constitution, including in particular an amending formula that gave all provinces the right to oppose any change in the constitution they considered unacceptable. But this veto would be valid for only two years following repatriation, after which the provinces and Ottawa would have to agree on a new formula, to be worked out. On 12 Nov. 1980 L\u00e9vesque presented his own motion in the National Assembly, opposing the federal \u201cpower grab,\u201d which required unanimous agreement to be adopted. The opposition of Liberal leader Claude Ryan led to its defeat. This did not prevent L\u00e9vesque, in the course of the following winter, from building a common front against Ottawa, consisting of eight provinces, excepting only Ontario and New Brunswick, the two declared allies of the federal government. On 12 March 1981, in the midst of these negotiations, he decided to go to the people. His political acumen told him that the people of Quebec, worried by Trudeau\u2019s threats (as L\u00e9vesque\u2019s own polls showed), would elect him rather than Ryan, who had made the mistake of associating himself with the federal government in blocking the adoption of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s motion against unilateral repatriation. His slogan was \u201cWe must remain strong in Quebec.\u201d With the focus of the campaign on the accomplishments of his \u201cgood government,\u201d the election of 13 April 1981 took on the appearance of a plebiscite. The PQ won two-thirds of the seats. On 16 April the eight provinces reached agreement on a plan for constitutional reform, which they intended to submit to Trudeau. To facilitate the agreement, L\u00e9vesque had to give up Quebec\u2019s traditional right to a veto, in favour of the right to opt out and receive financial compensation.\n\nOn 28 September the Supreme Court of Canada, which in April had been called on for its opinion about the legality of unilateral repatriation, ruled partly in favour of Ottawa. Repatriation was legal, but would be un-constitutional in the \u201cconventional sense.\u201d There was an emergency session in Quebec City, where L\u00e9vesque put through, on 2 October, a motion of resistance which this time got Ryan\u2019s support. Early in November, along with cabinet ministers Allan Joseph MacEachen and Jean Chr\u00e9tien, as well as his personal advisers, Trudeau welcomed the provincial premiers to \u201cthe one last time\u201d conference in Ottawa. On his side, L\u00e9vesque was accompanied by Claude Morin, the man in charge of the Quebec strategy, and two ministers, Marc-Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9dard and Claude Charron. There were some who felt that this was not a winning team, that it should have included ministers with a more solid grasp of constitutional matters and federal-provincial relations, such as Jacques-Yvan Morin and Jacques Parizeau. Of the ten or so subjects discussed at the previous constitutional meetings, there were only three left: the repatriation of the constitution, the amending formula, and the charter of rights \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s three priorities. Brilliantly manipulated by Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque fell into the trap of a so-called Quebec-Canada alliance focused on the idea of an all-Canadian referendum on the constitution, something that the English-speaking provinces, who felt betrayed by L\u00e9vesque, wanted nothing to do with. Already showing cracks as a result of the Supreme Court decision and the desire of the premiers of the English-speaking provinces to reach an agreement with Ottawa, the united front of the provinces imploded. On the last morning of the conference, L\u00e9vesque was presented with the text of an agreement negotiated the evening before by three ministers, Chr\u00e9tien (for the federal government), Roy John Romanow (of Saskatchewan), and Roy McMurtry (of Ontario), for which they had previously obtained the approval of the seven other provincial premiers. It was now L\u00e9vesque\u2019s turn to feel betrayed by his former allies of the common front, whose nocturnal secret negotiations would go down in history as the \u201cnight of the long knives.\u201d While resigning himself to the inclusion of a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause that would reduce the scope of the new constitution with respect to freedom of expression, religion, and language, Trudeau achieved his three main objectives. The right of francophones outside Quebec to have their own schools, \u201cwhere the number of those children so warrants,\u201d was stipulated in Article 23 of the new constitution. Anglophones coming to Quebec from other provinces would have access to English schools there, in violation of the Quebec clause of Bill 101, which granted this right only to anglophones from Quebec. But, unlike Ontario \u2013 whose French-speaking minority, while smaller in number than the English-speaking minority in Quebec, was nevertheless substantial \u2013 only Quebec had official bilingualism imposed on its parliament and courts, in keeping with Article 133 of the BNA Act, which was confirmed in the new constitution. To L\u00e9vesque, this was an injustice that would lead him to say that Trudeau had bartered institutional recognition of official bilingualism in Ontario for Premier William Grenville Davis\u2019s support for his plan of repatriation. Lastly, there was no recognition of Quebec as a distinct society in the constitution and no right of veto, but there was a right of opting out with no financial compensation.\n\nFor L\u00e9vesque, it was a total disaster. The text of the new constitution reduced the powers of the only French government in the federation without its consent and fell so far short of the historic demands of Quebec, which was now subject to the law of the strongest, that he refused to sign it. This meant that the second most populous province in Canada did not recognize the fundamental law of the country, despite being bound by it. On 2 Dec. 1981, the day on which the House of Commons passed the motion on the new constitution, L\u00e9vesque had the fleur-de-lys flown at half-mast at the parliament buildings. There were now indeed two Canadas, as Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had just demonstrated.\n\nWorn down by his setbacks with the referendum, L\u00e9vesque found it difficult to come to terms with this new defeat. He became disillusioned and lost his grip in the final three years of his political career, during which he suffered blow after blow. Scarcely had he returned from the Ottawa summit when he learned that Claude Morin, the minister of intergovernmental affairs and the person mainly responsible for negotiations on the constitution, had taken money from the RCMP in exchange for information about the PQ. L\u00e9vesque would carry this secret with him to the grave. In the early 1980s a severe economic recession drove unemployment to new heights, a nasty shock for his government, which was struggling with a deficit of $700 million. He insisted that the unionized workers in the public sector, whose jobs were guaranteed and whose wages were higher than those in the private sector, do their share and give up some of their benefits. In June 1982, faced with the unionists\u2019 refusal, L\u00e9vesque secured royal assent to the Act respecting remuneration in the public sector, which imposed wage cuts. That meant war. In December he promulgated the Act respecting the conditions of employment in the public sector, which imposed retroactive wage cuts of 19.45 per cent. The province was paralyzed by an avalanche of illegal strikes, which was brought to an end in February 1983 by special legislation, the Act to ensure the resumption of services in the schools and colleges of the public sector. He let himself be guided by the general interest, but he thereby attacked his electoral base and divided his party.\n\nIn the summer of 1984 the leader of the federal Conservatives, Martin Brian Mulroney, talked about national reconciliation and promised to bring Quebec to the constitutional table if his party were elected. L\u00e9vesque saw this overture as the longed-for opportunity to get rid of the hated federal Liberals and especially as a chance to recover from his constitutional setback of November 1981. Now that the referendum had been lost, he saw no point in discussing sovereignty, at least for a while. It was still on the horizon, but would not be an issue in the next election, expected to be held in a year. He was ready to take the \u201cbeau risque\u201d (to borrow an expression from the title of a novel by Fran\u00e7ois Hertel) of federalism, about which he made the following comment in November 1984, in D\u00e9fis qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a PQ periodical published in Montreal: \u201cIt must be noted, after all, that we are not in a gulag!\u201d And so L\u00e9vesque accepted the outstretched hand of Mulroney, who had become prime minister on 4 September, and he declared a moratorium on the issue of sovereignty, which tore his government apart. In November 1984 two of the original warhorses, the most influential ministers in the cabinet, Parizeau and Laurin, resigned. Convinced that their leader had lost faith in the cause, five other ministers \u2013 Gilbert Paquette, Denise Leblanc-Bantey, Jacques L\u00e9onard, Louise Harel, and Denis Lazure, and two backbenchers \u2013 Pierre de Bellefeuille and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Proulx \u2013 followed suit.\n\nThese defections undermined L\u00e9vesque\u2019s authority and led him to behave erratically. He fell into a depression. In January 1985, in severe psychological distress, he had to be hospitalized against his will, in the interests of state security. The man was ill. At 62 years of age and worn out, he appeared to the youngest of his ministers and mnas, who spent the entire spring openly challenging his leadership, to be finished. L\u00e9vesque would cling to power until June. On 20 March he took advantage of the spring session to put a motion recognizing the rights of aboriginals through the National Assembly. This issue had been dear to him since the 1960s, and once he became premier he had made it his personal responsibility. Six years earlier, in December 1978, he had created a historic precedent by convening a meeting in Quebec City between the provincial government and the chiefs and representatives of 40 Quebec bands, with a view to initiating a rapprochement between whites and native people.\n\nThe L\u00e9vesque government\u2019s major laws were passed mainly during his first term of office. Among the most important ones from the second term were minister Jean Garon\u2019s Bill 48, which affirmed Quebec\u2019s full sovereignty over the management of fishing in the Gulf of St Lawrence, and Bill 37, which defined a new framework for negotiations in the public sector, so that the province would not be on the brink of the abyss every time government employees renewed their collective agreements. These bills were passed in June 1984 and June 1985 respectively.\n\nOn 20 June 1985, 25 years after his political debut in the Lesage government, L\u00e9vesque made up his mind to write his letter of resignation as leader of the PQ. On the same day he sent out to the media a straightforward communiqu\u00e9 announcing his resignation as premier. On 29 September, two days after the painful farewell celebration the party held for him, he gave up his riding of Taillon. He was now just an ordinary citizen. His young successor, Pierre Marc Johnson, would not have a long career, either as premier or as leader of the PQ. In the election of December 1985 he was defeated by Bourassa. Two years later, isolated within a party that answered more and more to the Parizeau faction, he too would have to step down as leader. Two short years of retirement gave L\u00e9vesque just the time he needed to take up journalism again and to publish his memoirs, whose success was balm to his wounds. On 1 Nov. 1987 his heart, which he had always refused to take care of, suffered a devastating coronary. He was 65 years old. Everywhere in Quebec, and even in English Canada, there was unanimous agreement: a giant of Canadian and Quebec politics had died. From Davis, the former premier of Ontario, who had clashed with him, to Edgar Peter Lougheed, the former premier of Alberta, who admired him, all recognized that his actions and his challenge to federalism had forced English Canada to look at Quebec\u2019s place in the federation in a new light. More than that, as some historians have pointed out, he had contributed, with his rival Trudeau, to a complete redefinition of the Canadian political landscape. But by an irony of history, in shaking up Canada he had also strengthened it, as Romanow, Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s alter ego during the fateful night of the long knives, pointed out.\n\nThe legacy of L\u00e9vesque is diverse and associated with many great moments in the history of Quebec. As a journalist with Radio-Canada, he helped stir the interest of Quebec society in the great international questions, in a way broadening its horizons. Having become a politician during the Quiet Revolution, he was one of the driving forces for the changes that enabled Quebec to modernize and become open to the world. He made new standards an integral part of politics \u2013 honest politics \u2013 not only as a minister in Lesage\u2019s cabinet, but as premier. He rid French-speaking Quebecers of their complexes and gave them confidence in their ability by nationalizing electricity and building Hydro-Quebec.\n\nIn founding the PQ, L\u00e9vesque created a new and different party, fully democratic, unlike most others, and it aroused astonishment outside the province. In doing so, he introduced a concern for democracy into the pro-independence movement, and formulated a definition of Quebec nationalism that was less chauvinistic, less inward looking, as well as more dynamic and aggressive. As an indirect result, he brought about an affirmation of Canadian nationalism that was more open to the reality of Quebec and more coherent. With Bill 101, he gave French the priority in Quebec to which it was entitled, while at the same time protecting the educational rights of the minority. And finally, in the realm of political theory, he conceived the notion of sovereignty-association, which was gradually accepted, bringing a strong political credibility to the idea of Quebec independence.\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque did not achieve his grand dream of giving his compatriots a new homeland. This was no doubt the most striking failure of his political career. He lost the referendum of May 1980, had a constitution forced on him, and gave up the traditional right of veto, three events that weakened Quebec\u2019s political position within confederation. At the time of his death, Quebecers were still Canadians, but the francophone majority no longer saw themselves as the inconsequential people of legend, inward looking and speaking a disparaged and marginalized language. As a journalist, a Liberal cabinet minister, and a sovereignist premier, by his words and deeds he liberated French-speaking Quebecers from their feeling of inferiority and gave them a shot of adrenaline, so that some day, as he predicted on the evening of his defeat in the referendum, they would keep their rendezvous with history. \u201cI never thought I could be so proud to be Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as I am this evening.\u2026 We are not an insignificant people. We are perhaps something like a great people.\u201d These famous words, spoken off the cuff in the euphoria of his victory on 15 Nov. 1976, revealed his political commitment, enabling those at the bottom who spoke French to move up in society, as his relatives and close friends recalled. But at the same time, he noted in his memoirs that Quebecers were probably the only people to have \u201crefused such a chance to acquire full power over themselves peacefully and democratically.\u201d Nonetheless, the epitaph written for him by poet F\u00e9lix Leclerc gives a meaning to his legacy, which is not measured solely in reforms and laws. \u201cThe first page of the true, beautiful history of Quebec has just ended.\u2026 From now on, he belongs on the short list of the liberators of people.\u201d\n\nPierre Godin"}, {"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/laurier-l%C3%A9vesque-24-1whyy71", "page_content": "This database contains family trees submitted to Ancestry by users who have indicated that their tree can be viewed by all Ancestry subscribers.These trees can change over time as users edit, remove, or otherwise modify the data in their trees.

Pictured here, the Queen and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau signing the Constitution. (National Archives of Canada, PA-141503) <! -----------TABLE INSERT1 END---------> \"I have been stabbed in the back during the night by a bunch of carpetbaggers,\" Quebec Premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque later wrote of the events of November 1981. The unfolding of what L\u00e9vesque dubbed \"The Night of Long Knives\" began in spring 1980 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau turned his attention toward a lifelong goal; to bring home the Canadian constitution. The British North America Act, which had brought Canada into being in 1867, was a statute of the British Parliament. Trudeau was determined to bring home a revised constitution so Canadians no longer needed Great Britains approval in order to change it. His vision of the Constitution included a charter of rights and freedoms, which would protect citizens against arbitrary actions by their governments. But Trudeau's dream wasn't shared by all. Most provincial premiers opposed Trudeaus sweeping charter of rights proposal. They feared it would diminish their influence, transferring power from elected politicians to non-elected judges. \"Trudeau represents the centralizing of Canada,\" L\u00e9vesque observed, \"literally crushing provinces into a federal mode. That cannot go for Quebec.\" Only Conservative Premiers Bill Davis of Ontario and Richard Hatfield of New Brunswick supported Trudeau. The others premiers formed an alliance against him, soon known as the Gang of Eight. Without the support of most premiers, Trudeau threatened to take his constitutional case to England alone. \"Im telling you gentlemen,\" Trudeau said to the premiers at an official dinner at the Governor Generals residence on September 7, 1980, \"Ive been warning you since 1976 ... were going to go it alone ... well go to London and we wont even bother asking a premier to come along with us.\" The Gang of Eight mounted a fierce challenge to Trudeau's threat and took it all the way to Supreme Court. The final judgment left almost everyone dissatisfied. The Court ruled Trudeau's constitutional initiative was not illegal but according to Canadian convention there should be a substantial number of the provinces agreeing with the federal government. \"Substantial\" was never defined. In November 1981, Trudeau held a last chance meeting with all the premiers in Ottawa. The Gang of Eight was determined to stick together. But Trudeau was ready for a game of high stakes politics. \"I could either prove to the Canadian public that the eight were being completely unreasonable and then go ahead alone ... or I could break the solidarity among the eight and go .... with the support of a substantial number of premiers, which I supposed would be anywhere between five and nine of them.\" For two days, in closed-door meetings, the Gang of Eight held together. On the third day, with no deal in sight, Trudeau pitched one last proposal. \"Why dont we get patriation first, nobody can object to that-then give ourselves two years to solve our problems over the amending formula and the charter, and failing that, consult the people in a referendum?\" L\u00e9vesque felt the challenge was directed at him.\n\nShortly after the 1980 Quebec sovereignty referendum, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, pictured here with Quebec Premier Ren Lvesque, turned his attention to a lifelong goal: to bring home the Canadian constitution. <! -----------TABLE INSERT1 END---------> \"In an insinuating and provocative tone, Trudeau pushed me to the wall\", L\u00e9vesque wrote in his memoirs. \"You the great democrat', he said 'Dont tell me youre afraid to fight. At the time, he seemed really sincere. All right, ' said.\" The other premiers were horrified. The last thing they wanted was a referendum because they knew Trudeau had Canadians on his side. The unity of the Gang was collapsing. That night, Trudeau went home and the premiers retired to their rooms in Ottawas Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel, except L\u00e9vesque, who was staying across the river in Hull. In his memoirs, L\u00e9vesque recalls telling the others before he left for the hotel, \"If anything new comes up, dont forget to call us.\" They didn't call. Instead there were anxious gatherings in hotel rooms and hallways. After midnight, the minister of Justice, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, who was the point man for the federal government, worked with the attorneys general from Saskatchewan and Ontario, Roy Romanow and Roy McMurtry, to find an acceptable deal. They discussed diluting Trudeaus charter of rights, allowing provinces to override the charter. The \"notwithstanding\" clause\" would allow provinces to declare particular laws exempt from the provisions of the charter. Trudeau had already rejected this watering-down. But during the night, Chretien, Romanow and McMurtry locked in the final agreement that included the override Trudeau hated. But Trudeau's only two allies, premiers Hatfield and Davis, agreed to the compromise position. Then Davis convinced a reluctant Trudeau he had to take it if he wanted a deal. The late-night bargaining included another change: the deal dropped L\u00e9vesques prized opting-out clause, which would have allowed the province to opt out of shared federal-provincial programs but receive equivalent funds to set up its own programs. L\u00e9vesque, across the river in Hull, was not informed of the unfolding events. When he arrived late for a premiers breakfast the next morning, he found that a new deal had been drafted during the night. L\u00e9vesque was incensed. \"We had been betrayed, in secret, by men who hadnt hesitated to tear up their own signatures, and without their even taking the trouble to warn us,\" L\u00e9vesque said, though he, too, had broken their pact by agreeing to a referendum. The new deal was signed by Trudeau and nine of the premiers that morning. Only L\u00e9vesque refused to endorse it. L\u00e9vesque didnt say anything. He just got up from his chair, spun around, and walked out. \"Behind his Oriental impassivity,\" L\u00e9vesque observed, \"One could feel Trudeau literally rejoicing. He had put one over on us.\" There are conflicting interpretations of what had happened. Trudeaus supporters argued that L\u00e9vesque was committed to separation and would not have accepted any agreement to patriate the Constitution. But L\u00e9vesque and his supporters saw the agreement as a betrayal, one in which English politicians had conspired against Quebec. L\u00e9vesque left the conference, denouncing the premiers and their role in what would be characterized as \"The Night of the Long Knives.\" On April 17, 1982, Queen Elizabeth II came to Canada to proclaim the new Constitution Act on Parliament Hill. On that day, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque ordered the Quebec flag to be flown at half-mast."}, {"url": "https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/L%C3%A9vesque,_Ren%C3%A9", "page_content": "Name L\u00e9vesque, Ren\u00e9 Gender: M born on 24 August 1922 at 05:00 (= 05:00 AM ) Place Campbellton, New Brunswick (CAN), 48n0, 66w40 Timezone AST h4w (is standard time) Data source Accuracy in question Rodden Rating C Collector: Steinbrecher Astrology data 00\u00b024' 21\u00b049 Asc. 23\u00b033'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiography\n\nCanadian politician, the 23rd premier of Quebec.

He was knighted in 1897.\n\nEarly life and education Laurier was born of French Canadian parents and studied at the college at l\u2019Assomption, where he received literary training under Catholic priests. He then studied law at McGill University in Montreal and was called to the bar in 1864. His bicultural education, most unusual at the time, may have played a part in his lifelong dedication to Canadian unity. While at McGill, he became a leading member of the Institut Canadien, a political club of advanced liberals (Les Rouges) with anticlerical and republican views. Later he joined the law offices of one of the leading Rouge politicians and contributed a number of articles to radical newspapers, one of which he edited for a few months in the mid-1860s. In 1866, for reasons of health, Laurier moved to Athabaska, where he opened his own law practice. In 1868 he married Zo\u00eb Lafontaine of Montreal, and, despite a long relationship with Emilie Lavergne, his law partner\u2019s wife, his childless marriage seems to have been a happy one. In 1871 he was elected to the opposition benches of the provincial legislature of Quebec, where his first speech, an eloquent plea for educational reform, attracted much attention. In 1874 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, of which he was to be a member until his death.\n\nRise to leadership As Laurier gradually rose to become minister of internal revenue (1877\u201378) and eventually to leadership of the opposition Liberal Party in 1887, he persistently sought to bring together his countrymen on the issues that have since been recognized as the dominant themes of modern Canadian politics: the relations of church and state, the bicultural entente between French- and English-speaking Canadians, and the country\u2019s association with the British Empire and relations with the United States. One of the political highlights of these years for Laurier was his famous speech on Liberalism delivered in 1877 in the city of Quebec. In that speech he set himself against both the Quebec politicians who attempted to form a Catholic party and the extremist elements in his own group who sought to exclude the clergy from all political activity. Because of his skillful statesmanship, the cold antagonism between conservative churchmen and liberal politicians gradually began to thaw; after 1896 no anticlerical ever attained important public office and no cleric officially interfered in politics. In 1885 Laurier became a national figure when he delivered a moving plea of clemency for Louis Riel, who had led a rebellion of the M\u00e9tis (people of mixed French and Indian extraction) in Manitoba and whose death sentence provoked violent outbursts between the French Catholic nationalists in Quebec and the Britannic groups in Ontario. Showing great courage, Laurier, though not condoning Riel\u2019s actions, charged the government with mishandling the rebellion. Although he did not succeed in saving Riel, he established his reputation as a man of principle and high ideals. Throughout his political life, he emphasized moderation and compromise and gradually became recognized as the only leader able to effect a national reconciliation. At the same time, he was turning his personal magnetism into a valuable political weapon. Between 1887 and 1896 he perfected his party\u2019s organization, refined Liberal strategy, made political alliances, assessed local partisans, and judiciously applied his personal charm to winning over Conservative adversaries and dissident Liberals. He infused new life into his party, for instance, by campaigning vigorously for unrestricted reciprocity, the grant of mutual commercial privileges, with the United States. After the policy had served its purpose, however, he dropped it from his platform in 1893. Between 1895 and 1896 he spoke at between 200 and 300 meetings, thus personally reaching some 200,000 voters. In mid-1896, with the Conservative government divided and disorganized, he easily carried the Liberal Party to victory in the general election.

Courtesy Library and Archives Canada, C-001971\n\nEducation and Early Career\n\nWilfrid Laurier studied law at McGill University. While there, he established close ties with radical members of the Parti Rouge. This included one of his professors, Toussaint-Antoine-Rodolphe Laflamme. Laurier also became vice-president (1864\u201366) of the Institut canadien; a literary society with Rouge links.\n\nAfter graduating from McGill in 1864, Laurier briefly practiced law in Montreal. In 1866, he went to live in L\u2019Avenir and then in Arthabaska, Quebec, where he ran the newspaper Le D\u00e9fricheur. Like the Liberals of Canada East (present-day Quebec), Laurier opposed Confederation. He argued that the federal government would have too much power and that French Canadians would be overwhelmed.\n\nIn 1871, the Catholic Church in Quebec, led by Bishop Bourget, was ferociously attacking the Rouges and liberalism. In response, Laurier became the Liberal member for Drummond-Arthabaska in the Quebec legislature. Earlier, he had embraced radical liberalism; but now he became more moderate. He hoped this would be more acceptable to the Catholic clergy. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Parliamentary Debut, 1871.)\n\nLike many other Liberals, Laurier also decided to accept Confederation as a fait accompli and to work within the new system. In 1874, he resigned his provincial seat and ran for election to the House of Commons. He held his seat in Ottawa uninterrupted for some 45 years.\n\nWilfrid Laurier, as an MP in 1874. (courtesy William James Topley/Library and Archives Canada/PA-026430)\n\nFederal Politics\n\nIn October 1877, months after giving a vigorous speech in defence of liberalism, Laurier was appointed minister of inland revenue in Alexander Mackenzie\u2019s Cabinet. Laurier was the most prominent Liberal from his province. He became the recognized leader of the Quebec wing of the party. However, his party\u2019s defeats in the elections of 1878 and 1882 curbed his ambitions. He was re-elected in Qu\u00e9bec-Est; but he took less interest in political debate.\n\nIn 1885, Laurier\u2019s ardour was aroused by the hanging of Louis Riel. He vigorously defended the cause of the M\u00e9tis leader and the need to unite the French and English in Canada. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: In Defence of Louis Riel, 1874.) In 1887, Edward Blake was disappointed by the recent electoral defeat. He chose Laurier to succeed him as leader of the Liberal Party, despite the opposition of various eminent Liberals. They believed Laurier was too easygoing and too physically weak to be an effective leader. (Laurier suffered from chronic bronchitis for much of his life.) They also feared that Ontarians would associate him with Riel, and that Catholic clergy in Quebec still viewed him as a radical.\n\nWilfrid Laurier, 1882. Library and Archives Canada / C-001965 | (courtesy Library and Archives Canada / C-001965)\n\nLeader of the Liberal Party\n\nFrom 1887 on, Laurier devoted himself to building a truly national party and to gradually regaining power. His efforts were divided into two distinct phases. In the first and less successful, 1887\u201391, he pursued the policy of unrestricted reciprocity with the United States. Announced in 1888, the program was rejected in the 1891 general election. Laurier was perceived as a continentalist and as anti-British. He was rejected by the Canadian electorate; but for the first time since 1874, Liberals won a majority of the seats in Quebec.\n\nThe second more fruitful phase took place between 1891 and 1896. This was the period when Laurier, more sure of himself, built a strong national Liberal Party. At the time, the Conservatives were mired in difficulties after the death of Sir John A. Macdonald. In 1893, Laurier organized an impressive political convention in Ottawa; there, the party approved a new program and the basis for a truly national structure.\n\nIn the 1896 election, the education rights of the Catholic minority in Manitoba became an important issue. In 1890, Manitoba Liberals had established a uniform school system in place of the separate school system enjoyed to that point. This prompted protest from the Catholic minority. (See Manitoba Schools Question.) Laurier avoided taking a definite stand; but French Canadians believed he would be more supportive of minority rights than the Conservatives. On 23 June 1896, Canadians chose Laurier over Conservative Charles Tupper to lead the country as prime minister. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: \u201cSunny Ways,\u201d 1895.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister of Canada\n\nContrary to the expectations of many French Canadians, Laurier did not champion the minority rights of Catholics in Manitoba. Instead, his focus as prime minister was on the country\u2019s development and on healing the wounds to national unity. In 1896, he signed the Laurier-Greenway agreement. It decided the fate of educational rights for Manitoba\u2019s Catholic minority. This group would never again have the separate schools it enjoyed prior to 1890; although it would be possible to obtain religious instruction during the last half-hour of the school day and instruction in a language other than English. (See also History of Education; Francophone-Anglophone Relations; Francophones of Manitoba.)\n\nIn the name of national harmony and the politics of the \u201clesser evil,\u201d Laurier launched his policies of compromise. (See Sir Wilfried Laurier: The Politics of Compromise.) This approach kept him in power for many years. But it never completely redressed the wrongs committed against the Catholic minority.\n\nLaurier adopted a similar approach to relations with Britain. Shortly after becoming prime minister, he began to reorganize the immigration system with Clifford Sifton. With William Fielding, he finalized the details of a tariff policy based on imperial preference. In 1897, Laurier went to London, England, to participate in his first colonial conference. He also received a knighthood.\n\nA statue of Sir Wilfrid Laurier (the seventh Prime Minister of Canada from July 11, 1896, to October 7, 1911) shot against the roof of the east wing of the parliament buildings in Ottawa.\n\nGuided by his desire for Canada\u2019s independence, Laurier resisted every effort Britain made toward federation of the empire in political, economic, or military terms. (See also Commonwealth.) Nonetheless, in 1899, he agreed to help defray the costs of transportation and mat\u00e9riel of Canadians wishing to fight for England in the South African War. This conciliatory stance was criticized by French Canadians who were fiercely opposed to any participation. However, Laurier and his Liberals easily won the 1900 election. They were well supported by Quebec; it gave the Liberals 57 of its 65 seats. Laurier\u2019s personal popularity in Quebec likely played a key role in this result.\n\nAfter this victory at the polls, Laurier led his country forcefully. Within cabinet, he directed policy and did not hesitate to push aside dissenters; these included the powerful Isra\u00ebl Tarte, who was forced to resign in 1902. That same year, Laurier also commanded attention outside the country. At the colonial conference in London, he again opposed all proposals to unify the Empire. In 1903, shortly after the failure of the Alaska Boundary discussions with the US, Laurier revealed the most important policy of his second term; the construction of a second transcontinental railway.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier (courtesy Library and Archives Canada / C-015568).\n\nThe Transcontinental Railway\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway would build the section from Winnipeg westward. The federal government would undertake the construction of a line (called the National Transcontinental) from Moncton and Quebec City to Winnipeg. Laurier was so optimistic about the nation\u2019s progress that he allowed the Canadian Northern Railway to build a third transcontinental line. By agreeing to multiple railways, much of it at public expense, Laurier mortgaged the future with a heavy financial burden. At the peak of his prestige, he allowed nothing to check his ambitions. Canadians re-elected him with a comfortable majority on 3 November 1904. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Canada\u2019s Century, 1904.)\n\nThe Creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan\n\nIn 1905, Laurier succeeded in adding two new provinces to the Dominion of Canada: Alberta and Saskatchewan. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Let Them Become Canadians, 1905.) However, the addition of these provinces also meant that a decision had to be made regarding the educational rights of the Catholic minority. Once again, Laurier yielded to pressure from anglophones and Protestants. But in deferring to the status quo of one uniform school system, he deprived a minority group of separate schools. As a result, the last chance to establish genuine cultural duality throughout Canada was lost.\n\nOffended by this retreat, French Canadian nationalists bitterly criticized Laurier. His prestige in Quebec began to fade. This led to the progressive decline of the Laurier government. In the years that followed, Laurier mainly sought to counter accusations of corruption and patronage within his administration and to rebuild his Cabinet.\n\nIn the 1908 general election, Canadians once again entrusted him with their destiny. His party\u2019s majority was somewhat reduced, but it was still quite strong in Quebec. After 1908, Laurier focused his attention primarily on two bills. They ultimately led to his defeat.\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier, campaigning.\n\nControversial Policies and Defeat at the Polls\n\nIn 1910, the Naval Service Act established a Canadian navy of five cruisers and six destroyers. They would be ready to fight with Great Britain anywhere in the world. However, this was insufficient in the eyes of English Canadian imperialists. French Canadian nationalists led by Henri Bourassa, meanwhile, considered it excessive. This moderate measure would cost Laurier precious support, especially in Quebec.\n\nThe second bill concerned reciprocity with the US; the old Liberal dream of 1891. Brought to the Commons early in 1911, it permitted the free trade of most natural products; but only a small number of manufactured products. Despite the attractions of the plan, it raised the ire of Canadian industrialists. As such, it provided a weakness for the Conservative Party under Robert Borden to exploit. They accused the Liberals of disloyalty toward England and of leading the country toward political annexation. To settle the issue, Laurier called a general election. On 21 September 1911, he suffered a bitter defeat.\n\nLaurier ran successful campaigns for prime minister in 1896, 1900, 1904 and 1908. (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-5598)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\n\nLaurier proved to be an energetic and vigilant leader of the Opposition. He failed to adapt his liberalism as progressive Liberals would have wished; but he kept his troops united until at least 1916. He also relentlessly attacked the Borden government\u2019s failure to address problems such as the rising cost of living. (See Standard of Living.)\n\nLaurier achieved some success in rebuilding the Liberal Party. Prior to 1914, he fought mainly against the emergency contribution of $35 million offered to Great Britain to help strengthen its navy. He also opposed the financial assistance given to the Canadian Northern Railway. In 1916, he defended the rights of Franco-Ontarians to bilingual instruction in schools. This increased his popularity among French Canadians. (See also Wilfrid Laurier Speech: Faith Is Better than Doubt and Love Is Better than Hate, 1916.)\n\nOut of personal conviction, Laurier vigorously supported Canadian participation in the First World War. He ardently promoted voluntary enrolment and proposed a political truce. In 1915\u201316, at age 75, he held several recruiting meetings. In 1917, the country was plunged into national crisis following the imposition of military conscription. Laurier again turned to compromise. To save Canada\u2019s threatened unity, he refused to support this measure, which was so repulsive to Quebec; instead, he proposed a referendum and continued voluntary enlistment. This time, however, his proposal was not supported by the majority of English Canadians. The formula collapsed in general bitterness.\n\nLaurier was opposed by English Canadians and idolized by French Canadians; he became a symbol of division within the country. His own party disintegrated when several eminent English Canadian Liberals crossed the floor to join the Union Govenment. Laurier refused to participate. In the general election of December 1917, he was overwhelmingly defeated by Borden\u2019s Unionist Party. The vote was divided along distinctly cultural lines.\n\nAfter the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 and the First World War came to an end, Laurier began his attempts to restructure his party and to rebuild Canadian unity; but he died on 17 February 1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nLegacy\n\nUnder Laurier\u2019s leadership, Canada successfully continued to industrialize and urbanize. It was strengthened by the addition of two provinces and two million inhabitants. A clever and eloquent politician, Laurier was a true legend in his time. He has been judged in a variety of ways. For some, he was the spiritual successor to Sir John A. Macdonald, who pursued and consolidated Confederation. For others, Laurier, in the name of national unity and necessary compromise, too often sacrificed the interests of French-Canadian Catholics to those of the majority. Conversely, some think he too often governed the country with only Quebec\u2019s interests in mind. Support for each of these opinions can be found in Laurier\u2019s actions in Ottawa; but the last view is most open to argument.\n\nSee also Canada\u2019s Century: Sir Wilfrid Laurier\u2019s Bold Prediction; Wilfrid Laurier House National Historic Site of Canada; Collection: Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Timeline: Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Education Guide: Sir Wilfrid Laurier; Timeline: Elections and Prime Ministers.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Laurier-L%C3%A9vesque", "page_content": "Laurier L\u00e9vesque (October 13, 1929 \u2013 September 7, 2005) was a Canadian educator and a politician in the Province of New Brunswick.\n\nA graduate of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook and the New Brunswick Teachers' College in Fredericton, Laurier L\u00e9vesque taught school before entering political life.

Preferring the privacy of his library to the battlefield of politics, he was uncertain. He admitted as much in his letter to Blake, dated 18 June 1887: \u201cI know I have not the aptitude for it,\u201d Laurier admitted, \u201cand I have a sad apprehension that it must end in disaster.\u201d Five days later, the news became public.\n\nWilfrid Laurier, as an MP in 1874\n\nHe had come a long way by that point. A radical in his youth, Laurier had close ties with hardline members of the Parti rouge, and opposed Confederation, a project he described as \u201cthe tomb of the French race and the ruin of Lower Canada\u201d in Le D\u00e9fricheur, a party newspaper he edited. When Confederation became a reality, however, the young lawyer decided to join the cause. Seeing that radical liberalism aroused mistrust, Laurier became a moderate.\n\nParallel Streams\n\nThe 1885 hanging of Louis Riel, and the debate that followed in the House of Commons, completed Laurier\u2019s transformation. In taking up the M\u00e9tis cause, he defined his conception of a Canadian nation built on two founding cultures, English and French. In the following year, he compared the two cultures to two parallel currents of water, those flowing from the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence. The currents meet below the island of Montr\u00e9al, he said, where they remain separate and distinct before spilling into the Atlantic, \u201cbearing the commerce of a nation upon its bosom \u2014 a perfect image of our nation.\u201d He defended this definition of Canada all his life. For him, it was the only guarantee of national unity.\n\nThe Sunny Way\n\nAfter some difficult years in opposition, Laurier finally triumphed. On 23 June 1896, at age 54, he became the first French Canadian prime minister. Laurier would lead the country for 15 years, the longest uninterrupted term for a Canadian prime minister, with a policy of systematic compromise. As historian R\u00e9al B\u00e9langer writes in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Laurier was at once a charmer and a manipulator, a politician who \u201ccultivated the art of ambiguity\u2026 a strategy for achieving his purposes more readily in a dog-eat-dog environment.\u201d\n\nLaurier ran successful campaigns for PM in 1896, 1900, 1904 and 1908 (courtesy Library and Archives Canada/C-5598).\n\nIn truth, Laurier's famous ability to compromise sometimes left everyone dissatisfied. His solution to the thorny issue of Catholic schools in Manitoba pleased the Protestant majority at the cost of the Catholic minority (see Manitoba Schools Question). On the campaign trail in 1896, Laurier proposed his now-famous \u201csunny way,\u201d calling for fairness and generosity towards the Catholic minority and arguing that solutions should be found through negotiation, not by imposition. His later retreat on Catholic education rights in the formation of the new provinces in the North-West (Alberta and Saskatchewan) did not enhance his place in history. In the long term, it ended any hope of Canada becoming an authentically bilingual country.\n\nCanada\u2019s Century\n\nLaurier had more success on economic questions. In 1897, he managed to satisfy the contradictory interests of the country's protectionists and proponents of free trade (see Reciprocity). With the support of Clifford Sifton, minister of the interior, he carried out a vigorous immigration policy (see The Great Western Migration). The West became the most dynamic factor in the economic growth of the country. A sunny optimism prevailed for \u201cCanada's century.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada has been modest in its history, although its history,\u201d said Laurier in 1904, \u201cis only commencing.\u2026 The 19th century was the century of the United States. I think we can claim that Canada will fill the 20th century.\u201d\n\nSir Wilfrid and Lady Laurier in a chauffeur-driven automobile, with an unidentified man and woman\\r\n\n\n\nIn external relations, his objective was to improve Canada's position relative to both the United States and Great Britain. In 1897, he opposed efforts by British authorities to draw Canada into a closer imperial federation. During the South African War (1899\u20131902), he again chose compromise between English Canadians \u2014 who supported military involvement \u2014 and French Canadians \u2014 who vehemently opposed it. By allowing for the recruitment of a contingent of volunteers, partially paid for by Britain, Laurier found the middle ground. When imperialists demanded that Canada assist the British Royal Navy, which was struggling to stay ahead of the German navy, Laurier compromised. In 1910, he helped pass the Naval Service Act, which established the Naval Service of Canada (later, Royal Canadian Navy).\n\nWilfrid Laurier, campaigning in 1910.\n\nIn 1911, Laurier put his foot wrong and campaigned on a policy of free trade with the United States \u2014 a platform that had failed him 20 years earlier, in the election of 1891. The opposition talked about the destruction of the country and made vicious attacks on the old leader. He was defeated.\n\n20th-Century Liberalism\n\nLaurier devoted the last stage of his political career to rebuilding his party. He hounded the new prime minister, Robert Borden, from across the aisle in Parliament. He saw the country torn asunder over Borden's coercion in forcing conscription, and he lost another election in 1917. The cruel defeat did not leave Laurier personally beaten.

He changed Canada forever, and in the process, he touched our souls.\n\nThroughout his nearly 81 years, Pierre Trudeau seemed to live by extremes: he either filled a room with his charisma and energy, or withdrew completely, making his boredom and lack of interest apparent to all. One such time came in the fall of 1979, when Trudeau agreed to meet visiting political-science students from Montreal's Concordia University. His Liberals had lost the election to Joe Clark's Progressive Conservatives in the spring, and he was struggling with the unaccustomed role of leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Shortly before the scheduled 10 a.m. meeting on Parliament Hill, the 20-odd students were squirming nervously in their seats when, one later recalled, \"you could feel him enter before you saw or heard him.\"\n\nIn battered sports jacket and casual pants, Trudeau strode energetically to the front of the room and perched, half-sitting, on a table. Without a hello, he gestured at the group and said, \"What are your hopes? What are your dreams? Who are you, and what do you want to become?\" After a moment's stunned silence, a student asked Trudeau why, as prime minister, he had not used his constitutional power to disallow recent Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois legislation that declared French to be Quebec's only official language. Trudeau's face turned to stone. He gave a stiff, legalistic answer. Shortly after, he looked pointedly at his watch, mumbled an excuse - and left.\n\nFor Canadians, it always seemed that way with Trudeau - there were no half measures, and no telling what he might do or say next. But whether they were enchanted, enraged or rebuffed by the man who was their prime minister for 15 years and five months, they were never indifferent to him. On Sept. 7, when his sons Justin and Sacha issued a statement declaring that their father was \"not well\" and asking for privacy, Canadians instead turned their attention towards Trudeau again. Reporters camped outside his Montreal home, strangers delivered flowers and get-well wishes, and people across the country speculated about his health. Then, the initial fuss subsided - but the burst of media coverage, much of it nostalgic in tone, had once again put him at the forefront of Canadians' thoughts.\n\nIn all, it was the kind of attention once devoted to the passing of royalty. And when the news broke that Trudeau had died of prostate cancer - he had battled pneumonia, compounded by the onset of Parkinson's disease and, perhaps, the depression he felt ever since the 1998 death of his third son, Michel - the tributes came from Canadians of all backgrounds and political persuasions.\n\nShared sorrow - towards a politician whose legacy will still be debated decades from now. Trudeau's economic achievements were, at best, mixed. His other key accomplishments are easy enough to recount - but often draw vastly different reactions. He overhauled the Criminal Code as justice minister to legalize homosexual acts and abortion, and introduced the Official Languages Act. Add to that the decisive 1980 Quebec referendum victory, the patriation of the Constitution and the introduction of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms - along with such lesser initiatives as lowering the voting age to 18 from 21 and introducing television to Parliament. He also brought forward the 1980 legislation establishing the National Energy Program, which the Liberals said was aimed at safeguarding the country's oil supply from foreign domination.\n\nAlmost all of those initiatives have their detractors. Many westerners are still rankled by the memory of the NEP, which lasted until 1984 and was seen as a sign of both unwanted government intervention and, because it established a range of new taxes and price controls over domestically produced oil and natural gas, a symbol of the way in which Central Canada was prepared to siphon money from the West to prop up its own economy. As to the charter, some critics complain that it puts too much power in the hands of judges instead of elected representatives. Others say official bilingualism is artificial and overly expensive. (To that, Trudeau said memorably in 1968: \"Of course, a bilingual state is more expensive than a unilingual one, but it is a richer state.\")\n\nEven on the issue of Quebec, Trudeau may have done as much to stoke the flames of sovereignty in recent years as he once did to try to stamp out the movement. His strong opposition to the Meech Lake constitutional accord in 1990, for one, galvanized anti-Meech forces in English Canada - but the subsequent collapse of the accord gave a strong boost to sovereigntist fortunes. And the incident that drove his poll numbers to their highest levels ever - the October, 1970, imposition of the War Measures Act after the kidnapping of British diplomat James Cross and Quebec labour minister Pierre Laporte - is criticized by some historians as an unnecessary abuse of human rights.\n\nTrudeau, however, was no stranger to debate - or contradiction. Born to a millionaire family whose fortune was made from a chain of service stations, he was a notorious penny-pincher in private life who favoured left-leaning, big-spending policies in government. In 1963, he campaigned on behalf of the NDP, and called the Liberals \"idiots\" for allowing Lester Pearson to permit nuclear warheads in Canada. But two years later, he ran for the Liberals under Pearson, and within two months of his election, became Pearson's parliamentary secretary. And despite his professed disdain for the parish-pump side of elected politics, he eventually became a frequent and adept practitioner of patronage: his departing 1984 round of appointments to old supporters and cabinet colleagues stoked one of the controversies that helped sink successor John Turner.\n\nMuch of Trudeau's early appeal as prime minister came from his dashing, flamboyant style. During his 20s, as author Gordon Donaldson recounted in his 1994 book, The Prime Ministers of Canada, Trudeau \"drifted through occupied Germany on faked papers, was slung in jail for trying to enter Yugoslavia without a visa\" and, in Palestine, \"was arrested as a Zionist spy and thrown into a dungeon where Christ is supposed to have been held. After emerging, he was accosted by bandits, whom he scared off by feigning madness and raving in Montreal slang.\" As a politician, he had no less flair. He sported a green leather jacket, on occasion showed up in the House of Commons wearing sandals, and drove a funky Mercedes 300-SL sports convertible.\n\nSometimes, he walked to his office on Parliament Hill from 24 Sussex Drive. Accosted one day outside Parliament by a 17-year-old girl who asked for a kiss, he responded \"why not, it's spring\" - and bussed her. Although he affected disdain for the media, it never seemed a coincidence that his most colourful acts - such as performing a pirouette at Buckingham Palace - occurred with many cameras close by. And he was often keen to chat or lunch or dine with women reporters - even when he wasn't necessarily trying to date them. Those sessions sometimes evolved into policy discussions. When one young reporter told him how she had just visited a Cape Breton smelter and found that conditions there made it \"the worst place on earth,\" Trudeau, fascinated, launched a long series of questions as to whether that amounted to a good argument for nuclear power.\n\nBut his often flip behaviour masked a character of much greater complexity - although he kept his deeper inner thoughts largely to himself. Even acquaintances who had known him for decades said they found him hard to read emotionally. When Trudeau's old friend G\u00e9rard Pelletier died in 1997, Donald Macdonald, a former cabinet colleague of both men, said Pelletier was \"the last of a small circle of lifelong friends.\" A former aide to Trudeau in the Prime Minister's Office, who saw him on a daily basis for more than two years, remarked years later that \"I'm not sure Mr. Trudeau ever knew my full name.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Trudeau was at his most open with children. In the early 1980s, a senior civil servant working in the Privy Council Office happened to mention to Trudeau that his nine-year-old daughter was a great fan of the Canadian a cappella group the Nylons - who were scheduled to perform on Parliament Hill for Dominion (now Canada) Day festivities that year. On July 1, as the group was coming onstage, Trudeau, from his front-row seat, gestured to the girl to join him at his seat. He bounced her on his knees in time with the music, and at the end, leaped up to dance with her.\n\nTrudeau was capable of forming unlikely enthusiasms for political opponents. Despite their many differences, he was hugely fond of former Tory prime minister John Diefenbaker, and once declared: \"I just love that old guy.\" When the former prime minister fell ill just before Trudeau's departure for a European trip, Trudeau and then-aide Joyce Fairbairn devised a secret code - Daffodil - so he could receive updates on Diefenbaker's health. \"I would message what the weather was - and whether the daffodils were blooming,\" Fairbairn recalled several years ago.\n\nTrudeau's emotions ran deepest over the issue of his native Quebec. His contempt for the nationalist movement was open and undisguised - although it did not necessarily extend to some of its pro-sovereigntist practitioners. Many members of the first PQ government in 1976 were people Trudeau had worked alongside in early years, when progressive Quebecers were united against the authoritarian government of Maurice Duplessis. Once, in the late 1970s, Trudeau gave a news conference in Quebec City. When it was over, reporters were startled to see several PQ cabinet members, led by language hardliner Camille Laurin, rush up to greet Trudeau, who greeted them equally warmly. And while Trudeau fought the Yes side with sometimes scathing mockery during the 1980 referendum, his remarks immediately after the vote were respectful. \"To my fellow Quebecers who have been wounded by defeat,\" he said, \"I wish to say simply that we have all lost a little in this referendum.\"\n\nTrudeau was unapologetic about his preoccupation with Quebec. In 1973, he told CTV's W-Five that his reasons for getting into politics were twofold: \"One, to make sure that Quebec wouldn't leave Canada through separatism, and the other, to make sure that Canada wouldn't shove Quebec out through narrow-mindedness.\" That assertion makes it all the more ironic that, in recent years, Trudeau continued to rise in the esteem of English Canada, while in Quebec - where his Liberals won 74 of 75 seats in his last election - his popularity plummeted. The primary reason was his visceral opposition to the Meech accord, as well as the failed 1992 Charlottetown accord. On both occasions, he argued that any agreement that gave Quebec extra powers over other provinces was \"insulting\" because it implied Quebecers needed extra protection to thrive.\n\nThat argument was bitterly resented by both sovereigntists and many Quebec federalists; Trudeau was alternately described within the province as being out-of-date or anti-Quebec. Michel C. Auger, political columnist for Quebec's largest newspaper, Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, observed several years ago that \"for both federalists and sovereigntists, Trudeau has fallen off the radar screen. His ideas are seen as outdated.\" Still, the former prime minister continued to be treated with respect personally by both friends and opponents. On an international level, said Alain Gagnon, director of McGill University's Quebec studies program, \"francophone Quebecers were always very proud of having Mr. Trudeau as a statesman.\" But, Gagnon said, Trudeau's death caused less emotion among francophone Quebecers because many felt he was antagonistic towards them.\n\nEven within the federal Liberal party, feelings about Trudeau's legacy and policies are sometimes divided. Trudeau's opposition to Meech, something he shared with Jean Chr\u00e9tien, split the party sharply in 1990 because then-Leader Turner and others, including current Finance Minister Paul Martin, supported the accord. Those rifts are still evident - most clearly, some Liberals say, in the coolness that persists between Chr\u00e9tien and Martin. But Chr\u00e9tien's own relationship with his former boss has often been complicated. Although he has always made a point of publicly praising Trudeau, Chr\u00e9tien has many times, with mixed anger and sorrow, told the story of how, when he was finance minister in 1978, Trudeau blindsided him by announcing a $2-billion budget cut without telling him in advance.\n\nAnd Chr\u00e9tien has also struggled to get out from under Trudeau's giant shadow. When the Liberals came to power in 1993, Chr\u00e9tien would call Trudeau about once a month. After a while, the gap between those calls lengthened - and Trudeau, in the wake of the 1995 referendum, publicly complained at a news conference that he \"sat on my hands\" during the campaign because no one asked him to get involved.\n\nBut Trudeau has remained a strong force among rank-and-file Liberals. His name continues to evoke potent memories and images. They are many: the fearless Trudeau who sat unblinking while protesters threw stones during the 1968 St-Jean-Baptiste Day rally in Montreal; the romantic swashbuckler who dated Barbra Streisand, Margot Kidder and Liona Boyd and married Margaret; Trudeau the philosopher, the gunslinger and the devoted father. And, finally, the smooth and sophisticated leader who seemed at home on any stage around the world - so much so that former U.S. vice-president Walter Mondale once called him \"a priceless asset to the industrialized world.\"\n\nIn the end, it was never clear how many of those images were convenient creations he fashioned for himself, and how many reflected his real inner self. For all his time in public life, he was clearly happiest in private, testing his limits in treks and canoe trips either by himself, with his sons or a few friends. He gave a rare look into his thoughts on life in a 1944 essay called \"Exhaustion and Fulfilment: The Ascetic in a Canoe.\" At the age of 25, with the self-assurance of youth, he solemnly and rather ponderously outlined the joys to be had from a canoe trip that lasts \"for days, or weeks, or perhaps months on end.\"\n\nThe attraction, he said, is that \"you return not so much a man who reasons more, but a more reasonable man. For, throughout this time, your mind has learned to exercise itself in the working conditions that nature intended.\" There was something else, he concluded, about the outdoors. \"I know a man whose school could never teach him patriotism,\" Trudeau wrote, \"but who acquired that virtue when he felt in his bones the vastness of his land, and the greatness of those who founded it.\" Reason was Trudeau's watchword, along with passion for his country. Canadians will long remember - and revere - him for both.\n\nA Very Private Politician\n\nThe images are burned into the Canadian imagination. The naughty Pierre Trudeau pirouetting behind the back of the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the gunslinger, the playboy dancing with a fetching beauty half his age, the athletic Trudeau jackknifing into a pool. Despite his age - he was in his late 40s when he burst onto the public stage by winning the Liberal leadership in 1968 - there seemed to be a glow about him, as if pure energy was oozing from his pores. Yet years later, Trudeau would describe solitary nights spent with his three young sons as the source of true contentment. \"Every Saturday night, I would get away from my commitments and read to them,\" he told York University professor B. W. Powe for an essay contained in the 1998 book Trudeau's Shadow. \"It was one of the happiest periods of my life.\"\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau was a contradiction: a man who guarded his privacy jealously while choosing the most public of vocations, a reclusive figure who revelled in acting the showman. But above all, his longtime friend Senator Serge Joyal told Maclean's, he was a family man who doted on his children, Justin, Sacha and the ill-fated Michel, who was swept to his death by an avalanche in British Columbia's Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park two years ago at the age of 23. \"He told me immediately after leaving government in 1984 that the most important thing in his life now was his children and overseeing their education,\" recalls Joyal. Trudeau leaped to the task as single-mindedly as he took to politics, often eschewing social and political engagements so that he could spend time with his sons at the family's country home in the Laurentians, or taking them on experience-broadening trips to France, England, China and Siberia.\n\nTrudeau's devotion may have been partly an attempt to catch up after the years when he was too occupied with the affairs of state. He was 51 in 1971 and still in his first mandate as prime minister when he married Margaret Sinclair, a na\u00efve Vancouver flower child 29 years his junior. The children came in quick succession, and although he often took one or two on foreign trips with him, he lamented in his 1993 Memoirs that the hectic life of a politician necessitated leaving the kids behind with the young Margaret.\n\nShe would later describe the period in terms of claustrophobic torment. She felt abandoned, a prisoner in the gilded cage of 24 Sussex Drive. The fairy-tale marriage began unravelling and the couple separated in 1977. They finally divorced in 1984, three months before Trudeau stepped down as prime minister. He demanded and obtained sole custody of the children.\n\nAs Trudeau adapted to the role of single dad, never publicly speaking of his turbulent breakup, Margaret broke free in spectacular fashion. Even before their split, her escapades famously included drug use and partying with The Rolling Stones. Later, her dalliances included Jack Nicholson, Geraldo Rivera and parties at New York City's celebrated Studio 54 that made headlines around the world and became fodder for the two tell-all books she penned, 1979's Beyond Reason and Consequences in 1982. If Trudeau minded - and who wouldn't - or worried about the effect their mother's extravagant behaviour had on the sons, he never said so. In fact, Trudeau partly blamed himself, writing in Memoirs that he was ill-prepared for the many demands of his public and private life. \"I was a neophyte at both politics and family life,\" Trudeau wrote. \"I married late in life and I was learning about marriage and parenthood at the same time as I was learning about the workings of politics. So perhaps it was a little too much for me and, regrettably, I didn't succeed all that well.\"\n\nHe was determined to make amends to his children - and spend more time with them. It was something he missed with his own father, who died when Trudeau was 15 and was relatively absent during his formative years. Instead, it was his mother, Grace Elliott, who was the constant presence, instilling in him a love of learning and books. Friends say Trudeau was able to pass on to his children his own twin passions for the outdoors and for intellectual pursuits.\n\nMargaret, meanwhile, continued to visit the children regularly at Trudeau's Montreal home, even after she had married Ottawa businessman Fried Kemper and had two children with him. Recently, she still called Trudeau \"the love of my life,\" in spite of the rupture in their relationship. And she was with him when his failing health took a turn for the worse.\n\nPerhaps the strangest chapter of Trudeau's private life was the revelation that he had fathered the daughter of Deborah Coyne, a constitutional adviser to Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells during the Meech Lake saga. While the relationship cooled after the birth of Sarah on May 5, 1991, Trudeau continued to visit his daughter in Toronto, where Coyne lived for a time in the 1990s. According to friends, he also made sure his sons came to regard her as a sister. Typically, Trudeau has never publicly talked about the unconventional relationship.\n\nTrudeau's decline accelerated in 1997 with the death of his old friend G\u00e9rard Pelletier. Along with Trudeau, he was one of Quebec's \"Three Wise Men\" who came to Ottawa in the 1960s (the third, Jean Marchand, died in 1988). Seventeen months later, Michel died tragically. The first loss devastated Trudeau, the second appeared to crush him. He soon fell ill with pneumonia, with which he was hospitalized for 10 days last January. \"He's never really recovered,\" Joyal said.\n\nAt the funeral of Pelletier, Trudeau, a devout Roman Catholic, read a passage from Corinthians, adding his personal postscript: \"Part of my soul has left me - and he's waiting for me.\" The sentiment must have been doubly true with the loss of Michel - for a man who, throughout his life, hid his private pains as adamantly as he showcased his public flamboyance.\n\nThe Star of His Own Movie\n\nThere was Barbra Streisand and Jane Fonda. Liona Boyd and Maggie. Pierre Trudeau also dated actors Margot Kidder and Kim Cattrall, now one of the stars of HBO's sizzling series Sex and the City. Some were lovers, some just friends. But their combined numbers and beauty made one thing clear: Trudeau was more than Canada's Prime Minister - he was also our leading man.\n\nFollowing a generation of dutiful but dour postwar politicians like Lester Pearson, John Diefenbaker and Bob Stanfield, Trudeau arrived like a comet, entering the Canadian atmosphere adorned in black cape and fancy fedoras. Whether playing the role of urban dandy or buckskinned outdoorsman, he was always the star of his own movie, always the remote and rakish sex symbol who made women swoon. And what a range of characters he played. He moved from eligible bachelor to married man, doting dad and cuckolded husband without ever losing his appeal. \"There was a 1940s movie star quality about Trudeau,\" says Linda Griffiths, the Toronto actor and co-creator of the one-woman stage play Maggie and Pierre. \"He had that old-fashioned courtly, gentlemanly thing, where somebody was always on his arm.\"\n\nBut he also had a modern magnetism that the mass media both fed on and magnified. In June, 1968, during his first election campaign as leader of the Liberal party, the country was swept up in Trudeaumania. As if at a Beatles concert, young and not-so-young girls screamed and demanded kisses when the unpredictable 48-year-old politician whistle-stopped into their towns. Trudeau gloried in the adulation. But, according to Christina McCall, it also changed him.\n\nIn her book Grits, McCall says Trudeau was not always the dashing lothario. Before coming to power, he was socially shy and diffident. As an MP (he was first elected to Parliament in 1965), he would slip in and out of official gatherings without anyone noticing but his closest friends. His relationships with women - who were often half his age - were usually brief. But after 1968, McCall says, Trudeau's \"sweet reticence had vanished and was replaced by a display of overweening pride.\" Now, when he entered a room, \"women swarmed to him, mouths moist, eyes translucent.\"\n\nOne of them was Margaret Sinclair, a na\u00efve Vancouver flower child who first met Trudeau on a beach in Tahiti before he became prime minister. In 1971, after a clandestine courtship, they were married in a ceremony kept secret from the public. He was 51, she was 22. Together, they had three sons: Justin, Sacha and Michel (who was killed in 1998 at age 23 in an avalanche in British Columbia). By 1977, the marriage had collapsed when Margaret sought her freedom from what she described as the \"unbearable\" confines of her life with Trudeau at 24 Sussex Drive.\n\nMargaret was the only woman who ever lived with Trudeau. The rest of his celebrity dates seemed at times intended to be little more than glamorous appendages for photo ops, arm candy for this otherwise solitary man. What did these women really mean to Trudeau? We may never know. In his book Memoirs, Trudeau summed up the breakup of his marriage to Margaret briefly and tersely, concluding: \"Anyone who has gone through the breakdown of a marriage - perhaps without three small children, and perhaps not in the glare of the public spotlight - will understand why I choose to write no more about the matter.\" He has said nothing about other relationships. Perhaps for the impermeable Trudeau, silence was the best refuge.\n\nHe Inspired an Entire Generation\n\nWhen the history of our times is written, Pierre Trudeau will be acknowledged as the greatest public figure that Canada produced in the second half of the 20th century. This will not be in recognition of his accomplishments at home, which were considerable, or of his achievements on the international stage, which weren't. It will be because he did what no politician before or since has done: he touched the dreams of an entire generation of Canadians. He made them excited about politics and public affairs. He caused them to believe they could actually change the country and even the world. He inspired them to get personally involved. And many of the idealists who were inspired by Trudeau are still involved - in Parliament and provincial legislatures, the senior levels of the public service, the judiciary, the professions, broadcasting and the arts. He changed their lives. He set them off along paths they might not otherwise have taken. He made them, and the country, better.\n\nTrudeau was lucky, of course. Timing is everything in politics, and he caught the wave perfectly. He appeared on the scene just as the nation, emerging from the high of Expo 67 and the Centennial, was looking for ways to extend the excitement. It was a time of national confidence, when anything seemed possible. The year he won the Liberal leadership, 1968, was a year of turmoil in many parts of the world as students took to the streets in protest over, chiefly, the war in Vietnam. A similar ferment pervaded Canada but instead of resisting it, Trudeau tapped into it, distilled it, channelled the desire for change and reform into the established political process - and, instead of bloody clashes on the barricades, we had Trudeaumania.\n\nHis detractors maintained Trudeau was a creation of the mass media. If that were so, he would have crashed and burned within a year. He soared because he was what the country was ready for at that time - a leader who did not look or sound like a politician and who seemed not to care about personal popularity, a reformer who believed government could be changed, improved and made to serve the people better. He was also smart, very smart, not to mention articulate (in both official languages), athletic, dashing, glamorous, sexy and strong. We all wished we could be just like him.\n\nJournalists and others who travelled with him over the years - as I did to places like India, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia, Cuba and Venezuela - could not help but feel a small thrill of national pride at the interest and curiosity he provoked among the politicians and press in the countries we visited. For perhaps the first time ever, they were genuinely interested in a Canadian leader. He was a star and, because he was, Canada was something of a star, too.\n\nIt didn't last long. Trudeau's weaknesses were managing the domestic economy and foreign policy. True, he recognized Red China (as it was known then), but does anyone remember his \"Third Option\" and his much-vaunted \"contractual link\" with Europe? Stripped to its essentials, his foreign policy amounted to little more than a futile attempt to distance Canada from the United States, whether by cozying up to its enemies, like Fidel Castro, or by negotiating closer ties with Europeans or others.\n\nAt home, his achievements were real: the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, divorce and abortion reform, the Official Languages Act, patriation of the Constitution, and entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. These and other initiatives are Trudeau's legacy to the nation. But what makes him much more than just another prime minister with a superior legislative record who won a few elections and ultimately overstayed his welcome is the transforming effect he had on the generation of Canadians who propelled him into office. Singlehandedly, he increased the public's expectations of political leadership, in the process raising the bar for those who would come after him.\n\nCan you imagine young people today defying their parents to attend a Stockwell Day rally? Pushing and shoving to touch the garments of Joe Clark? Swooning at the sight of Paul Martin? Or girls (and their moms) clawing their way through police lines to plant a big kiss on the lips of Jean Chr\u00e9tien?\n\nYes, bring on the historians.\n\nFarewell to a Titan\n\nEven for Canada's most celebrated political warrior, some battles end in defeat. Last week, after months of failing health, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau succumbed to prostate cancer. The country responded with an outpouring of emotion, more muted perhaps than the tidal wave of Trudeaumania that began his prime ministerial career in 1968, but no less warm. And dignified, as befitted the man who had swashbuckled through Canada's often fractious political life and yet had somehow, always, risen above it.\n\nParliament stood still - tributes flowed even from longtime adversaries. One last time, Trudeau returned to the place he had dominated for 16 years, his body lying in state over the weekend in Parliament's Hall of Honour. Throughout two days and nights, Canadians from all corners came to pay their respects, many with children who were born after he left office. His Art Deco home in Montreal, where he died on Sept. 28 at age 80, surrounded by his ex-wife, Margaret, and their sons, Justin and Sacha, became an impromptu shrine for friends and admirers who laid red roses at the front door. And across Canada, ordinary Canadians - Anglo-Albertans who had been inspired to learn French because of him, immigrants who had come to Canada because of his reputation, matronly women who had once flirted briefly with him at some political function - remembered, and were inspired again.\n\nThe world, too, remembered. Trudeau's death was front-page news in The Times of London and The New York Times, which called him \"a dashing fighter for Canada.\" The United Nations Security Council observed a moment of silence. The Queen and other heads of state and government sent their condolences to the Trudeau family. Other prime ministers have left their mark on the world stage. Trudeau didn't just stride the world stage, he danced upon it, his insatiable curiosity and sophistication carrying the rest of us along in his wake.\n\nFew Canadians realized just how ill Trudeau had been. For at least two years, he suffered from Parkinson's disease, a debilitating nervous system disorder, and prostate cancer. Friends said the death of Michel, his youngest son, swept away by an avalanche while hiking in British Columbia in November, 1998, sent Trudeau into a profound depression. And earlier this summer, after a four-day retreat in rural New Brunswick with his son Sacha and old friend Rom\u00e9o LeBlanc, Trudeau, a celebrated outdoorsman, returned to his Montreal home and suffered a stroke on Aug. 5 that sent him to hospital. \"It was a wonderful four days,\" recalled former governor general LeBlanc, who had been Trudeau's press secretary from 1968 to 1971. \"He was so amazed by the world around him.\"\n\nAfter lying in state on Parliament Hill, Trudeau's body was to be transported to Montreal by train on Monday for last respects and a state funeral on Tuesday at Notre-Dame Basilica. The federal government has created a Web site for Canadians to pass along their memories and condolences, at www.trudeau.gc.ca. He will be buried in Montreal. His legacy will be rooted in the country at large.\n\nThe Fight of a Lifetime\n\nIt was the fight of his life, the upshot of what one biographer would later call Pierre Trudeau's \"magnificent obsession.\" But to achieve what he did in the spring of 1982 - patriation of the Constitution from Britain after 51 years of fruitless attempts, and with a wide-ranging Charter of Rights and Freedoms that entrenched his cherished goal of linguistic guarantees for French- and English-Canadians - required something more than obsession. It took political ruthlessness, a willingness to turn the country almost on its ear.\n\nWas this all about Quebec? Well, yes - and no. It started that way, of course. Trudeau was, after all, a product of the political and intellectual ferment there in the late 1950s and early 1960s, an upheaval that divided Quebec's best and brightest into bitterly opposed camps. Although he was an eager participant in some of the early causes, such as the wrenching strikes of asbestos and Radio-Canada workers, Trudeau would have no truck with the nationalists of Quebec. He saw Quebec nationalism, as he did Maurice Duplessis's repressive postwar regime, as backward and valuing the state above the individual. For Trudeau - \"Citizen of the world,\" said the badge he tacked to his door at Harvard in 1945 - this was definitely not the road to be travelled. What he wanted was a Canada and a Quebec constructed more in his own image: bilingual and bicultural, and above all else, with the freedom to choose. For Trudeau, language was a right, like free speech and individual choice - one of the \"counterweights,\" as he called them in his early essays, to the power of the state.\n\nAchieving these objectives would not be easy. And for Trudeau, his combative personality would set the tone. He was, after all, the rookie justice minister in Lester Pearson's government who made his mark by knocking heads publicly with Quebec premier Daniel Johnson in early 1968 at a federal-provincial conference. He was the fledgling Liberal leader who won the country's respect later that year by sitting, unflinching, in the review stand of Montreal's St-Jean-Baptiste Day parade while bottles thrown by separatist supporters shattered around him. He was the prime minister who invoked the War Measures Act in 1970 and refused to negotiate with terrorists - the strongman who kept his head while others panicked.\n\nBy the time of the first Quebec referendum on sovereignty in May, 1980, the Trudeau legend - French Power in Ottawa, standing up to nationalists in Quebec - was complete. For the first time, the country had a French-Canadian prime minister who was enormously popular in his home province (the federal Liberals had just won 74 of 75 seats in the 1980 election and would go on to win the referendum campaign three months later by 60 per cent to 40 per cent) and willing to take on a Quebec government in a high-stakes game of political poker. Five prime ministers before him had tried and failed to budge the stone sled of constitutional reform. Trudeau himself had spent the best part of 12 years trying to cajole agreement from the provinces. And now he was facing growing demands for more powers from the West, where burgeoning oil revenues were also fuelling provincial ambitions.\n\nTrudeau's home province had consistently refused to accept patriation, let alone linguistic guarantees that might affect education (a provincial jurisdiction) until its demands for greater autonomy were met. And language was proving to be a flash point. Language riots in the suburbs of Montreal contributed hugely to Bourassa's defeat by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque in 1976, and led directly to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois' Bill 101, the Charter of the French Language and the antithesis of everything Trudeau held sacred. And in L\u00e9vesque, Trudeau would confront a leader who was not only a fierce adversary but one who represented the nationalist flip side of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois coin.\n\nThe two men could not have been more different. Judging by his electoral success in the province, Trudeau was widely admired. He was the man who could dance on the broader Canadian and world stages and allow Quebecers to bask in his cosmopolitan glory. But L\u00e9vesque was the one they loved. A rumpled, rubber ball of a man, a former war correspondent who came to host one of the most popular TV shows in the province, L\u00e9vesque was just as engaging as Trudeau. But he also seemed to embody all of the sometimes frustrating, sometimes endearing insecurities of a people struggling to find their place in the sea of Anglo North America.\n\nThe two men had been butting heads since the early 1960s, when L\u00e9vesque was a popular, reform-minded minister in Jean Lesage's Liberal government and Trudeau a sardonic law professor and a member of L\u00e9vesque's informal circle of advisers. L\u00e9vesque was one of only a handful of prominent Quebecers who opposed Trudeau's implementation of the War Measures Act. He paid a price for it at the polls three years later when his upstart PQ was nearly wiped out by Bourassa's Liberals. But by 1979, when Joe Clark's Tories surprised the federal Liberals and won a minority government, L\u00e9vesque thought he would have the last laugh. With Trudeau sidelined, L\u00e9vesque called his long-awaited referendum on sovereignty-association for the spring of 1980. But Clark's government self-destructed after only nine months in power, allowing Trudeau's Liberals to come roaring back with the enthusiasm of the born-again.\n\nIn typical Trudeau fashion, he took the referendum battle right to the enemy's heartland, the Paul Sauv\u00e9 Arena in east-end Montreal, where L\u00e9vesque had celebrated his 1976 election victory, and pledged to change the constitutional order to accommodate Quebec. \"Even I was impressed at the time,\" allowed the PQ's veteran strategist Claude Morin. But this was to be more than a strict Quebec-Ottawa round. The rejuvenated Liberal government took on the West and the growing autonomy of premiers like Alberta's Peter Lougheed by creating the despised National Energy Program. It cut back on transfer payments to the provinces - to howls of protest. Trudeau also hinted that, in the area of constitutional reform, Ottawa might go it alone. And after a desultory meeting of first ministers in September, 1980, he made good on his threat to try to patriate the Constitution unilaterally with a charter of rights - including the minority language rights that were certain to antagonize the West.\n\nTwo decades later, it is difficult to recall the intensity of that period. But for nearly 18 long months, from the emotion-ridden sovereignty referendum to the patriation agreement in November, 1981 - with an angry Quebec on the sidelines - the battle raged with a fierceness that only the fight over conscription in 1942 and, later, free trade in 1988, would match. Court challenges were mounted. Only two provinces, Ontario and New Brunswick, backed Ottawa's initiative. The charter of rights was created by a special parliamentary committee - the first to have its hearings televised - in an extraordinary conclave of one-upmanship and partisan bickering. By the time the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on the legality of the unilateral initiative - it was legal, the court found, but broke with convention, a serious rebuke to Trudeau - the country was exhausted. Only Trudeau seemed calm as he convened what he called \"the one last time\" constitutional conference for Nov. 2, 1981. It almost lived up to its billing.\n\nFor three days, the two sides offered up only half-hearted compromises. The dissident premiers in the so-called Gang of Eight provinces showed some cracks - Saskatchewan's Allan Blakeney, especially, tried to hold out an olive branch to Trudeau. But the coalition seemed to be holding. In fact, on the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 4, after the third day of steadily deteriorating talks, L\u00e9vesque sat in his Hull, Que., hotel room, sipping cognac with close colleagues, confident that he had beaten back all the federal initiatives.\n\nLittle did L\u00e9vesque know that across the river in Ottawa's Ch%teau Laurier Hotel the three most westerly provinces and Newfoundland were cobbling together one final offer. Nor did he realize that, earlier in the day, his flirtation with Trudeau's suggestion of a referendum to decide the fate of the charter had driven a wedge through the dissident coalition. The premiers were fighting arrogance and abuse of process - but did not want to take on the popular charter of rights. The next morning, L\u00e9vesque came face-to-face with the sweaty opportunism of Canadian politics - and with the slightly messy reality that was to become Pierre Trudeau's Canada. \"We have a new proposal, Ren\u00e9,\" Newfoundland's Brian Peckford announced laconically at the regular breakfast meeting of the Gang of Eight. \"It's there by your plate.\"\n\nIt is tempting to say that the formal arrangement reached later that day was a classic Canadian compromise. The dissident provinces, with the exception of Quebec, would accept Trudeau's charter of rights (with a few modifications). Trudeau, in turn, would incorporate their preferred amending formula. But that interpretation would not take into account Trudeau's exercise of an enormous amount of raw prime ministerial willpower. He outfoxed L\u00e9vesque by challenging him mano a mano, playing on their long-standing rivalry. He outmanoeuvred the West by daring its premiers to be the populists they claimed they were and accept the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, language guarantees and all, on the grounds that it reflected the desires of the people. And he left a legacy that is still being debated.\n\nQuebec's anger at being left behind by its allies - \"It's the Canadian way,\" L\u00e9vesque hissed that fateful morning, \"to abandon Quebec at the moment of crisis\" - has reverberated through the decades: Meech Lake, the Charlottetown accord, Lucien Bouchard's sovereignty referendum of 1995. The West's appetite for reform, and its resolve to never again be taken for granted, is unabated. Add to those the welter of new charter-inspired rights and challenges that Canadian courts are constantly grappling with. All of these are part of Trudeau's legacy. They may not have been the counterweights he once wrote about with such enthusiasm. But they have become the true counterweights in the Canada of today, competing passions that propel a society forward and keep it in check at the same time, passions that he fanned with so much style and perhaps even purpose.\n\nNo time for 'weak-kneed people'\n\nJust after 8 o'clock on Monday, Oct. 5, 1970, a brilliant fall morning in Montreal, four members of the so-called Liberation Cell of the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec abducted British trade commissioner James Cross from his home. In exchange for Cross's release, the men made seven demands, among them: $500,000 in gold bullion and the release of 23 \"political prisoners\" - fellow FLQ members in jail for terrorist acts. This was to be the first real test of Canada's new prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, at 50, just two years on the job, and, equally important, of his 37-year-old Quebec counterpart, Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa. The Quebec government wanted to appease the kidnappers by releasing at least some prisoners, but Trudeau convinced Bourassa to offer only safe passage out of the country. Within an hour of the announcement of that offer, on Saturday Oct. 10, provincial labour minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped while playing touch football outside his home on Montreal's South Shore by members of another FLQ cell.\n\nThe kidnappings sparked the implementation of the federal War Measures Act, which sent the police and army into the streets of Montreal to arrest, interrogate and detain more than 400 separatist sympathizers. Two days after its proclamation, Laporte was dead, strangled with his own gold neck chain and stuffed into the trunk of an old car. His murder sparked revulsion against political terrorism in Quebec and across the country. Laporte's murderers were eventually found and convicted. Cross's abductors gave up in December, releasing him and going into exile in Cuba and later France; some of them eventually returned to Quebec. The October Crisis transformed Pierre Trudeau, cementing his reputation for all time as a tough leader who would not back down. \"All I can say is, 'go on and bleed,' \" he told a CBC reporter in a famous interview on Parliament Hill in the midst of the crisis. \"But it is more important to keep law and order in society than to be worried about weak-kneed people.\"\n\nDallying With the Economy\n\nIn the spring of 1984, during his final wistful months as prime minister, Pierre Trudeau had to choose between two strikingly different policies that he could champion. He could continue his quixotic campaign for peace in a Cold War world during his final appearance at the annual meeting of the Western world's seven industrial powers, scheduled for June. Or he could urge his fellow leaders at the lavish London gathering to launch a global trading initiative to lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to secure Canada's future as a trading nation. As pre-summit briefings commenced, Trudeau listened carefully as deputy trade minister Sylvia Ostry warned that protectionism was rising dangerously in industrialized nations because Western manufacturers could not compete with the low prices of Third World imports. Ostry argued that Canada should find ways to counter that protectionist trend while helping its own hard-hit domestic sectors to adjust. The prime minister posed expert questions, nodding thoughtfully. Then, to the frustration of his civil servants and the consternation of his fellow leaders, he flew to the United Kingdom - and talked about disarmament.\n\nIt was always that way. It was not as if Trudeau did not understand economic theories. He did. It was not as though he did not care about the ever-deteriorating condition of the nation's finances. He did. But he lacked the patience to wade through the conflicting economic theories, develop a coherent plan - and stick with it.\n\nInstead, he dallied with one approach after another, reversing his own positions with breathtaking ease. One of those abrupt switches - the controversial decision to impose wage-and-price controls in October, 1975 - provoked the resignation of his respected finance minister, John Turner. Breaking his 25-year silence on Trudeau's most dramatic economic initiative, Turner told Maclean's that he vehemently objected to the imposition of controls - largely because the federal Liberals had romped to a majority government with the promise that they would not impose them. As well, Turner believed that the world was becoming too interconnected to invoke controls: Ottawa might be able to curb wages - but it could do little about the price of imports.\n\nAccording to Turner, Trudeau was far more optimistic about the possibility that controls might succeed. Shortly after the Liberals' July, 1974, election victory, Trudeau began lobbying his finance minister to shift gears. Recalled Turner: \"Trudeau said, 'We are going to put in wage-and-price controls.' I said, 'Not with me around. I campaigned against them.' The unions trusted me. Business trusted me. No. We told people that we wouldn't do it. And we were going to reverse that in three or four months after the election?\"\n\nToday, Turner is still rueful about the private discussion with Trudeau that provoked his September, 1975, resignation. \"The real problem was the issue of wage-and-price controls,\" he told Maclean's on the understanding that the interview would not be published until after Trudeau's death. \"I should have been more explicit when I resigned as to why I resigned. But because of my loyalty to Mr. Trudeau, I went quietly.\"\n\nFor Trudeau, the economy usually took second place to causes, such as national unity, that were dearer to his heart. Ostry's push for freer trade was doomed: those domestic sectors that could not compete against cheaper imports - textiles, footwear and clothing - were largely located in Quebec. Why, in the final months of more than 15 years in power, would Trudeau disrupt the Quebec economy and risk a resurgence of separatist strength? \"He was highly intelligent and intellectual: he read all of his briefing documents, including the footnotes,\" reflected Ostry. \"He just wasn't interested in economics. He listened to everything and understood it. But, in the end, he had one priority: national unity.\"\n\nThe nation paid a steep price for Trudeau's distracted approach to its long-term economic health. It took much of the 1990s to eliminate the breathtaking deficits that first appeared during his tenure. Federal cash transfers to the provinces were slashed - so programs in health, medical services and social assistance were pared to the bone. With public debt charges still consuming more than 25 cents out of every revenue dollar, Ottawa's spending power has been eroded. As a direct consequence, it has lost clout in provincial capitals. Ironically, the strong central government Trudeau fought so valiantly to maintain was undermined by his handling of the economy.\n\nIn 1968, when he swept triumphantly to power, the economy was vibrant - and the traditional economic remedies easily worked. Small shortfalls were the norm: 1968-1969 revenues were $12 billion and the deficit was $670 million. The economy was booming, generating the cash that Ottawa required to fund its ever-expanding social safety net. By 1984, the economic picture was far, far bleaker. The nation was painfully emerging from the worst downturn since the 1930s. Ottawa's annual shortfall was more than half the size of its revenues: in 1983-1984, the deficit was a staggering $33 billion on revenues of $64 billion. Inflation was relatively high, 5.3 per cent in January, 1984, and unemployment soaring at 11.2 per cent. The nation was reeling.\n\nIt was not all Trudeau's fault. It was his ill luck that, during most of his tenure, the global economy was in upheaval. By the early 1970s, the first traces of globalization were apparent: the economies of individual nations were becoming so interwoven that governments could not insulate their citizenry from outside forces. In 1973 and 1979, world oil prices shot up, fuelling inflation and imposing crippling costs on oil-dependent industries and consumers.\n\nWorse, as Trudeau eventually discovered, in this grave new world the old economic remedies didn't work. In the 1950s and 1960s, governments could spend freely when times were tough to curb unemployment - and pare spending when times were good to control inflation. By the mid-1970s, however, Canada was struggling with the new phenomenon of stagflation: high inflation and high unemployment. Economists and politicians groped for solutions. Turner recalled that Trudeau was so desperate for answers that he could be captivated by any persuasive theorist, including the Canadian-born Harvard University economist John Kenneth Galbraith. \"Galbraith used to sneak into 24 Sussex,\" Turner said. \"I would hear about it - and I would tell Galbraith, 'Look, don't feed him this crap.' Galbraith was pretty left of centre. We would hear these theories the next week.\" Turner paused, contemplating Trudeau's record. \"The economy,\" he added sadly, \"was not his main thing.\"\n\nEventually, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that nations should tackle inflation first. Trudeau rejected that approach: he was unwilling to curb inflation by slashing spending as long as unemployment remained high. He did not want to risk further national distress, especially in Quebec. And he was reluctant to pay the price of unpopularity at the polls.\n\nInstead, he kept looking for a made-in-Canada solution. From 1975 to 1984, in his bid to \"wrestle inflation to the ground,\" he tried everything from wage-and-price controls to gimmicks such as the Six & Five campaign of 1982-1984, which created ceilings of six per cent and then five per cent for wage and price rises. Inflation ebbed, but it was only licked in the early 1990s - after industrialized nations, in a concerted attack, curbed their spending and raised interest rates. The price of that onslaught was a deep recession. \"How can you be an inflation fighter and be in favour of social justice?\" mused Trudeau's former principal secretary Tom Axworthy. \"We tried a billion different ways to deal with inflation without necessarily putting millions of people out of work. In the end, there had to be a recession to get out of it. It's really too bad that there isn't another way.\"\n\nWithout firm economic leadership, the crises were endless. Trudeau would occasionally fix his enormous powers of concentration on a problem - and opt for a course. But he rarely followed through. In 1978, after a stern lecture from German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Trudeau abruptly announced immediate spending cuts of $2 billion out of program spending of $43 billion. There was a flurry of paperwork. But program spending kept increasing - and the deficits kept accumulating.\n\nIronically, Trudeau had a frugal personality. \"He would say, 'Where are you going to find the money for that?' \" recalled former cabinet minister David Smith. \"In many ways, he was very conservative.\" But that fiscal rectitude could never withstand other priorities. In 1972, anxious to shore up support for his minority government with the New Democratic Party, he increased spending by 50 per cent over two years: from $18.8 billion to $28.2 billion.\n\nWorse, Trudeau never could accept the central fact of today's economic life: Canada is unable to isolate itself from world forces. He probably should not have tried to protect inefficient industries. He should have worked with global leaders to find a solution to inflation. \"It's easy to say in retrospect,\" says Axworthy, \"but it would have been better to spend a lot more time using organizations such as the Group of Seven rather than looking for a domestic solution, which got less relevant with each succeeding year. We were on the wrong side of history.\"\n\nIn the end, it was the economy that wrestled Pierre Trudeau to the ground. But he bequeathed the solutions to his successors. In 1982, exasperated by problems within the economic union, he appointed a royal commission chaired by former Liberal finance minister Donald Macdonald. That influential report, released in 1985, called for free trade with the United States, greater reliance on market mechanisms - and rapid adjustment to global change.\n\nSo, almost inadvertently, Trudeau did begin the search for a better way. \"In effect, when Trudeau appointed me, he launched a new way of thinking about the Canadian economy,\" Macdonald recalled years later. \"True, that way was despite his instincts. But we had to get out into the world.\" Ironically, Pierre Trudeau's finest economic legacy was to begin the dismantlement of his own policies.\n\nMaclean's October 9, 2000"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/levesque_guillaume_8E.html", "page_content": "L\u00c9VESQUE, GUILLAUME (baptized Louis-Guillaume), office holder, Patriote, lawyer, and author; b. 31 Aug. 1819 in Montreal, son of Marc-Antoine-Louis L\u00e9vesque, a protonotary, and Charlotte-M\u00e9lanie Panet, daughter of Judge Pierre-Louis Panet*; d. unmarried 5 Jan. 1856 at Quebec.\n\nGuillaume L\u00e9vesque was a direct descendant of Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9vesque*, who had been a member of the first Legislative Council in 1775 and who died at Quebec in 1787. Guillaume was six years old when his father, who had been stricken with paralysis, had to take his doctor\u2019s advice to stay in the country for a period and moved with his family to Berthier-en-Haut (Berthierville). In 1830 young Guillaume joined his brother Charles-Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9vesque at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al, where he studied for six years. He had not completed his program there when \u2013 in 1835, it appears \u2013 he was articled to \u00c9douard-\u00c9tienne Rodier*, a Montreal lawyer; he continued his legal studies the following year with Hippolyte Guy. In May 1837 he was appointed a record clerk in the office of the sheriff of Montreal.\n\nCaught up in the rebellion of 1837\u201338, L\u00e9vesque joined the Association des Fr\u00e8res-Chasseurs [see Robert Nelson*]. He also linked up with a group of Patriotes from Napierville. On 9 and 10 Nov. 1838 he took part in the attack on Odelltown, which ended with the defeat of the Patriotes. Arrested on 14 November, he was put in jail at Montreal. At the trial, which began on 24 December, he stood accused with 11 Patriotes, including Pierre-Th\u00e9ophile Decoigne* and Achille-Gabriel Morin*, \u201cof having conspired with others in the parish of Saint-Cyprien to overthrow the legislative government established in Lower Canada,\u201d and was the only one to plead guilty. Witnesses for the prosecution, several of them leading citizens of Napierville, admitted at the court martial that they had recognized him among a group of Patriotes, but swore that he was not armed. Beginning on 29 December witnesses for the defence, in particular Fran\u00e7ois-Roch de Saint-Ours, Jean-Roch Rolland*, and Pierre Rastel* de Rocheblave, testified in court \u201cthat they had known the accused and his family for a long time, that he had been well brought up and had always shown a quiet disposition. That his father, [being] ill, for many years had been unable to attend to the education of his children. That his family was one of the most respectable in the land.\u201d The court martial was unmoved: L\u00e9vesque was found guilty on 2 January and sentenced, like his companions, to death. He was again incarcerated in the Montreal jail, but through the influence of Philippe Panet, a relative who was an eminent supporter of the government, his sentence was commuted in September 1839 on condition that he leave the country, as his letter of thanks to Pierre-J. Beaudry, the clerk of the prison, confirms.\n\nL\u00e9vesque then took refuge in France, initially with his father\u2019s relatives in Normandy, the L\u00e9vesque-Besseli\u00e8res and the L\u00e9vesque-Lema\u00eetres. From there he went to Paris where, under the assumed name of Guillaume d\u2019Ailleboust de Ramesay, he entered the foreign ministry and worked for three years as a translator in the department dealing with Spanish and Portuguese affairs. He also took courses in medicine, anatomy, and law, and in 1843 worked at the Institut d\u2019Afrique and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie de France. It is thought that for the rest of his life he remained a contributor to the annals of the latter learned society, and that some of his articles attracted attention although they went unnoticed in Lower Canada. L\u00e9vesque was pardoned in 1843, and returned to Lower Canada on 21 November of that year. He was called to the bar on 10 May 1844, but gave up practice to take a post as French translator in the Translation Bureau of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada; he soon became its head, and he retained this position until his death.\n\nL\u00e9vesque engaged in a great variety of intellectual activities. On 24 Nov. 1844 he helped found at Montreal the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis, and he served as its president in 1847 and 1848. Its members sought to \u201ceducate themselves and to encourage the arts and the sciences\u201d; they had two meetings a week, and were required, on pain of a fine, to make a creative contribution each month to one of the four designated sections of the society. L\u00e9vesque made such a presentation at least once. On 1 Feb. 1845 he published in L\u2019Album litt\u00e9raire et musical de la Revue canadienne, established to disseminate the studies of the society\u2019s members, a text entitled \u201cDe l\u2019habitude de saluer les passants.\u201d It was subsequently reprinted by James Huston in his R\u00e9pertoire national, along with a speech L\u00e9vesque made on 29 Jan. 1848 to the members of the Institut Canadien in Montreal, \u201cDe l\u2019influence du sol et du climat sur le caract\u00e8re, les \u00e9tablissements et les destin\u00e9es des Canadiens.\u201d Although there is no proof, it would not be surprising if L\u00e9vesque had collaborated with his friend Huston in selecting and compiling the texts in the R\u00e9pertoire national. He published in L\u2019\u00c9cho des campagnes at the end of 1846 and the beginning of 1847 a historical short story, \u201cV\u0153ux accomplis,\u201d set in the American revolution, and then on 18 and 25 Nov. 1847 \u201cLa croix du Grand Calumet,\u201d the first written version of the legend of one Cadieux, a voyageur who was abandoned on an island when his companions escaped from the Iroquois through the intervention of a white woman, and who died on the day he was discovered.\n\nGuillaume L\u00e9vesque passed away suddenly on 5 Jan. 1856 at Quebec, at the age of 36. A funeral liturgy was sung two days later at the cathedral of Notre-Dame in the presence of numerous friends. He was buried on 11 January at Sainte-M\u00e9lanie, where his mother had gone to live on the death of her husband. Le Canadien reported on 7 January that L\u00e9vesque was \u201cone of those men whose death is regretted as much because of their personal merit as by reason of the rare talents and distinguished works which gave lustre to their career.\u201d Le National of 8 January observed that he was \u201cdistinguished as much by his upright character, his talents, and his education, as by the trials amid which he was cast by the destinies of politics, and which he traversed with the dignity befitting courageous souls and generous hearts alike.\u201d If L\u00e9vesque can be reproached for not having written and published more, it must be acknowledged that he had a lively, sustained style, a polished, exact language, and a great love for his country and its inhabitants.\n\nAur\u00e9lien Boivin"}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/l%C3%A9vesque_rene_21F.html", "page_content": "L\u00c9VESQUE, REN\u00c9 (baptized Charles-Ren\u00e9), journalist, politician, and author; b. 24 Aug. 1922 in Campbellton, N.B., and baptized 10 September in New Carlisle, Que., the eldest son of Dominique L\u00e9vesque, a lawyer, and Diane Dionne; m. first 3 May 1947 Louise L\u2019Heureux in Quebec City and they had two sons and a daughter; they divorced in 1978; m. secondly 12 April 1979 Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9 (d. 2005) in Montreal; d. there 1 Nov. 1987 and was buried 5 November in the cemetery of Saint-Michel parish in Sillery (Quebec City).\n\nIn the 1920s the south shore of the Gasp\u00e9, in the province of Quebec, had no hospital worthy of the name. Thus the quintessential Quebecer among the province\u2019s premiers uttered his first cries in a hospital in New Brunswick, on the other side of Baie des Chaleurs. By his own account, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque enjoyed a happy childhood in New Carlisle by the sea, with a father he idolized, for whom the word \u201cculture\u201d had meaning, and a mother with a mercurial disposition like his own, which led to a relationship that was difficult, yet full of affection never put into words. He grew up in the unforgettable, remote Gasp\u00e9, with its cod fishers and its villages that ran down to the sea. According to his relatives and close friends, his lifelong marked compassion for the destitute and the common people stemmed from his roots in the Gasp\u00e9 and his early contact with poverty and underdevelopment, even though he himself came from a well-to-do family. This attitude was probably also explained by the example set by the father he admired, of whom he would say that, lawyer though he was, he showed unconditional respect for others.\n\nNew Carlisle at that time had a population of not quite 1,300, of whom a third were French-speaking and subject to the dictates of the great loyalist families who had fled the American revolution and settled there in the 18th century. Two distinct societies, living side by side, they were a perfect symbol of Canada\u2019s \u201ctwo solitudes.\u201d In this world, where English was required for making oneself understood, young Ren\u00e9 lost no time in becoming bilingual. He also discovered that the rich spoke English, lived in homes that looked like castles beside the modest houses of the francophones, and enjoyed a network of modern schools that showed his local one up for what it was: a \u201cmiserable shack more than a kilometre away from home,\u201d as he put it in Attendez que je me rappelle \u2026, the memoirs he was to publish in Montreal in 1986 (translated under the title Memoirs by Philip Stratford and published in Toronto in 1986).\n\nThroughout his life L\u00e9vesque would present himself as a man of the people who would break away from his middle-class origins. His mother, Diane Dionne, was a doctor\u2019s daughter and traced her lineage back to the seigneurs of Tilly, near Quebec City. His father, who came from Saint-Pac\u00f4me, in the Kamouraska region, was a prominent lawyer of the Quebec bar in the Gasp\u00e9. Before settling in New Carlisle and fitting himself into the French Canadian elite, allied to the loyalist \u201cfamily compact\u201d that ruled over the town, Dominique L\u00e9vesque had been a partner of Ernest Lapointe*, whose law office was in Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup and who would become the Quebec lieutenant of Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King*. Young Ren\u00e9\u2019s rebellious streak ran in the family. One of his maternal ancestors, Germain Dionne, a rich farmer and bailiff of the seigneury of La Pocati\u00e8re nostalgic for the French r\u00e9gime, had fought the British army alongside American insurgents during the rebellion in the colonies. On his father\u2019s side, his ancestor Charles Pearson had mutinied when in the Royal Navy; after deserting his ship in the harbour at the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re Ouelle, he had put down roots in the area and become the first miller of the seigneurial mill. In 1817 he married Marguerite Pastourel; their daughter Marcelline married Dominique L\u00e9vesque (Ren\u00e9\u2019s paternal great-grandfather), of the sixth generation of L\u00e9vesques originating in Normandy.\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque realized very early in life that he was born to be a leader. The eldest of four children, he made an impression on everyone, both at the local school in New Carlisle and at the S\u00e9minaire de Gasp\u00e9, where he began his classical studies in September 1933. When he arrived at the seminary, one of the first questions he asked its superior, Father Alphonse Hamel, was whether there was a library. He did not take well to discipline and had a calculating side to his personality, which was offset, however, by his obvious intellectual leadership. Having been introduced by his father to the great masters of French literature and to politics, he was brighter and more cultured than the average student. Conscious of his superiority, he did not make friends easily, preferring the company of such authors as Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas, \u00c9mile Zola, and Victor Hugo, whom he discovered in his father\u2019s well-stocked library. Secretive by nature, he put up a wall against anyone who wanted to lead him into the realm of emotions and sentiments, and secretive he would remain throughout his life. But since he was a gifted student and took all the prizes, he was forgiven everything.\n\nRen\u00e9\u2019s Jesuit teachers, including Charles Dub\u00e9, a cousin of the famous Fran\u00e7ois Hertel [Rodolphe Dub\u00e9], pampered him, while at the same time making him aware of the nationalist ferment and its causes, the economic and social inferiority of French Canadians that was intensified by the grinding poverty of the 1930s. In his memoirs, L\u00e9vesque would acknowledge that he had liked Hertel\u2019s iconoclastic book, Leur inqui\u00e9tude (Montreal, 1936), whose clear conclusion predicted that Quebec would separate from Canada some day. At a public meeting held in the seminary courtyard during the 1935 election campaign, he heard the nationalistic diatribe of Philippe Hamel*, a dentist and popular speaker for the Action Lib\u00e9rale Nationale, against the grip of \u201cforeign trusts\u201d on the lives of French Canadians. At the age of 13, he asked the existential question in the seminary\u2019s newspaper \u201cL\u2019Envol\u201d: Why remain French? His conclusion showed how precise his political thinking had already become and foreshadowed the realistic nationalist politician he would be, while also revealing a vaguely vengeful sentiment: \u201cLet\u2019s demand from the Jews and the Americans, not the insignificant positions that we now hold, but the high positions to which we are entitled. From the day when that is accomplished, we will be able to call ourselves masters in our own house.\u201d\n\nIn June 1937, when Ren\u00e9 was 14 years old, tragedy struck him. His father, whom he would describe in his memoirs as the most important man in his life, died at the age of 48 in a hospital in Quebec City. As the summer of 1938 came to an end, Ren\u00e9 was transplanted from his native Baie des Chaleurs region to that city. He saw his mother\u2019s swift remarriage in January 1939 as a betrayal. Diane Dionne wed Albert Pelletier, a lawyer with connections to the separatist Quebec City weekly La Nation, whose influence on Ren\u00e9 would be significant, despite their troubled relationship. Lacking the strictness of the father he had idolized, and at odds with his mother, he gradually lost interest in his studies. He had shone in the sixth year (Rhetoric) just as he had in the Gasp\u00e9, but at the beginning of 1940, while he was in the first year of the Philosophy program, the authorities of the Coll\u00e8ge des J\u00e9suites Saint Charles Garnier expelled him because he had slipped to wretchedly low marks. He was accepted at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, where he concluded his classical studies with difficulty in 1941. He then enrolled at the law faculty of the Universit\u00e9 Laval, but abandoned his studies in 1943, to the great despair of his mother.\n\nL\u00e9vesque chose a Bohemian lifestyle, chasing girls and playing poker with Jean Marchand and Robert Cliche*, two Universit\u00e9 Laval students destined, as he was, to become famous, and he dreamed of becoming a writer. A budding playwright, he co-authored with Lucien C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u201cPrincesse \u00e0 marier,\u201d a \u201clight-hearted and highly imaginative little piece,\u201d which he had staged at the Palais Montcalm in Quebec City. The play was a monumental flop. This failure did not keep him from making a second and last foray into the world of drama. Probably in 1943 he wrote a piece for radio entitled \u201cAux quatre vents.\u201d The play would not be produced until it was rediscovered half a century later; it would be published in Montreal in 1999. In this work the 20-year-old L\u00e9vesque seems pessimistic about the future of the French Canadians of his time, whom he portrayed as reduced to a people made invisible by history. \u201cAux quatre vents\u201d also foreshadowed the Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque of the years to come. Indeed, what would he do with his life if not spend it all trying to liberate those French Canadians \u2013 who came to regard themselves as Quebecers \u2013 from their invisibility?\n\nIn fact, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s true passion was radio journalism, which he had discovered earlier at CHNC, in New Carlisle, during the summer of 1938, his last in the Gasp\u00e9. While he was gaining experience in Quebec City at the private radio station CKCV on Carr\u00e9 D\u2019Youville, and then at CBV, a regional station of Radio-Canada, the French-language network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, World War II broke out. Like the many Quebecers of his generation who were loath to shed their blood for the commonwealth, L\u00e9vesque was opposed to conscription, an issue that was tearing Canada apart. But General Charles de Gaulle\u2019s appeal to occupied France in June 1940 shook his convictions. The Nazis were threatening freedom and democracy. This was the challenge of his generation; he could not wash his hands of it.\n\nIn the fall of 1943 L\u00e9vesque was 21 years old. He was called up. He was quite willing to go and see the war that he was describing to his listeners on CBV, but with a microphone, not a gun. He pleaded first with his immediate superiors at Radio-Canada, who managed to have his military training postponed until sometime in January 1944. Shortly before that fateful date, he made a vain attempt to persuade the director general of Radio-Canada to find him a job as a war correspondent in one of its overseas teams. It was Uncle Sam who saved him from military service. As it happened, the American Office of War Information was recruiting bilingual information agents like him. And so, in May 1944 he was in London, attached to the French section of Voice of America / La Voix de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique, a program of the American Broadcasting Station in Europe that had been set up by the Americans and was flooding the occupied countries, particularly France, with propaganda. In June, when the Allies landed on French soil, L\u00e9vesque was eager to get to the line of fire, but his wartime odyssey did not really begin until February 1945. Holding the rank of junior lieutenant, he joined General Omar Nelson Bradley\u2019s army, which had liberated part of France and then stopped in Paris. Next came the march to the German border with General George Smith Patton and General Alexander McCarrell Patch, the crossing of the Rhine, and the discovery of a shattered Germany with its great cities, such as Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Munich, devastated. Finally, there was the horror of the Holocaust, which turned his stomach when he entered the concentration camp at Dachau with the first group of American journalists.\n\nWhen L\u00e9vesque went back home in the fall of 1945, a gulf separated him from the apprentice journalist of pre-war years. All his life he would repeatedly utter warnings, insisting that every society has the potential for returning to the jungle and barbarism. He would always be suspicious of the possible blunders of the Quebec nationalism that he himself would nonetheless strongly and rationally personify.\n\nRadio-Canada came to L\u00e9vesque\u2019s rescue by opening its doors to him in late October 1945. Despite the feeble voice he had brought back from the war, he became an announcer on La Voix du Canada, a daily news program produced by the international service of Radio-Canada and broadcast from Montreal to France and other French-speaking countries and territories. L\u00e9vesque presented Canadian current affairs in four parts: news, documentaries, news reports, and cultural events. He would stay at this job for nearly eight years. He also found refuge in marriage, children, and family life. On 3 May 1947 he pledged his loyalty to Louise L\u2019Heureux, his fianc\u00e9e since before the war.\n\nAt Radio-Canada, L\u00e9vesque was not restricted to his work with La Voix du Canada (which was sometimes broadcast in Canada). He could also be heard nationally. After hosting Journalistes au micro (1949\u201350), he would work simultaneously on La Revue de l\u2019actualit\u00e9 (1951\u201354) and La Revue des arts et lettres (1952\u201354), where he gave highly critical film reviews. Within a few years he established himself as one of Radio-Canada\u2019s leading lights. Imaginative but unmethodical, he loved doing on-the-spot reports. Those he wrote from Korea, where he was a war correspondent from July to September 1951, made his reputation as a great international reporter. During these years he worked closely with Judith Jasmin*, with whom he carried on a love affair. Though he did not look the part, he was considered at the time the Don Juan of Radio-Canada. There was something appealing about him. He loved women and they responded to him in kind. In October 1951 he and Jasmin were assigned to cover the visit of Princess Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to Canada. From January 1954 they were co-hosts of Carrefour, a new radio program devoted to news reports. But soon the rising medium of television shunned him. L\u00e9vesque was no Adonis. Short and balding, he had tics and smoked like a chimney. Yet his lively interview with some Russian schoolgirls on Red Square in the fall of 1955 was a sensation on the television news. Radio-Canada had assigned him for radio but also for television \u2013 just this once would not hurt \u2013 to cover the visit of Lester Bowles Pearson*, Canada\u2019s minister of external affairs and future prime minister, to the Soviet Union. When the intransigent Nikita Khrushchev mistreated Pearson in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s presence, the special correspondent for Radio-Canada got his first international scoop. In 1956, though his bosses at Radio-Canada doubted he had the looks for the job, L\u00e9vesque finally made the leap to television and quickly rose to the rank of \u201cgod of the TV screen,\u201d to quote Georges-\u00c9mile Lapalme, leader of the provincial Liberal Party. On Point de mire, a cult program of the late 1950s, he used his passion for teaching and communicating to explain the world\u2019s great dramatic events, such as the Suez crisis and the war in Algeria. It was at this time that the born seducer began a secret love affair with a young actress who, in 1958, bore him a daughter he would never acknowledge. This extramarital paternity prompted Louise L\u2019Heureux to begin divorce proceedings, but she subsequently dropped them.\n\nIn December 1958 the producers at Radio-Canada went on strike for the right to form a union. The strike soon became politicized and foreshadowed the turmoil of the 1960s. This event, in which L\u00e9vesque was deeply involved, marked a turning point in his career. He went into it a journalist and came out a politician. The dispute dragged on for more than two months, with no movement on either side. He was dumbfounded by the indifference of John George Diefenbaker*\u2019s government and of his English-speaking colleagues at the CBC, who boycotted the strike, considering it a revolt against Canada. Many people would say that this strike was a catalyst in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s nationalistic development. Moreover, for the first time he had the experience of addressing large crowds, and became aware of his power over them. Once the dispute was settled, it seemed evident that television had become too small a world for him. Until then, he had asked the questions; from this time on, he would want to give the answers as well.\n\nOn 22 June 1960 L\u00e9vesque took the plunge, entering the political arena as a candidate in the riding of Montr\u00e9al-Laurier, where he won by a narrow margin. Courted by the Liberals since his resignation from Radio-Canada in April, he had finally rallied to the slogan of their new leader, Jean Lesage*, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change!,\u201d which prefigured the Quiet Revolution. The soundness and serious nature of the reforms proposed by the Liberals \u2013 free education, hospitalization insurance, a new direction in the economy, modernization of the state, and war on patronage \u2013 had persuaded him. He would soon assert himself as a star minister in the famous \u201cfireball team,\u201d which intended to bring the province into the modern era. This team, also baptized by the press as the \u201cthree Ls,\u201d combined the three leading figures in the Liberal Party: Lesage, Lapalme, and L\u00e9vesque. The new premier, Lesage, initially gave L\u00e9vesque two portfolios, public works and hydraulic resources. At public works, convinced that it was possible to be a politician and remain honest, L\u00e9vesque attacked corruption, at the request of his leader, who had made it one of his priorities. More specifically, he attacked the system of patronage instituted by the former government of Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis*. Henceforth, all government contracts for more than $25,000 would be tendered.\n\nIn March 1961 two ministries \u2013 hydraulic resources and mines \u2013 merged to become the ministry of natural resources. L\u00e9vesque would hold this portfolio until January 1966, but he left public works to Ren\u00e9 Saint-Pierre. A practical politician, L\u00e9vesque did not let ideology get in his way. If he counted primarily on the state as the lever of economic development, it was because French-speaking Quebecers possessed only one big business: their government. They had no true entrepreneurial class capable of combatting the province\u2019s economic backwardness in certain sectors. He was of the opinion that electricity, which Quebec had in abundance, must become a public monopoly. It had been too hastily let go to foreign capitalists, who charged exorbitant and disparate rates, depending on whether one lived in Montreal or the Gasp\u00e9, and sent the profits out of the province. It must now be entrusted to the Quebec Hydroelectric Commission (or Hydro-Quebec), created in 1944 by the government of Ad\u00e9lard Godbout*, which had nationalized the Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company and Montreal Light, Heat and Power Consolidated to form the nucleus of Hydro-Quebec. What was needed for electricity to become the engine of the Quebec economy was the consolidation of its exploitation, which was divided at the time among 11 private companies that the government should nationalize. In 1962 L\u00e9vesque created an uproar by uttering for the first time the taboo word \u201cnationalization.\u201d He finally imposed it, despite the original refusal of Lesage, who was worried about its repercussions on the provincial debt.\n\nThe premier did indeed have a change of heart. He was outraged by the blackmail on the part of the Toronto and Montreal bankers, who not only refused to finance nationalization but threatened to have nothing to do with government loans if the administration took over the Shawinigan Water and Power Company. The argument that increasing the debt would drive the province into bankruptcy, put forward by George Carlyle Marler and other ministers opposed to nationalization, did not hold up. Douglas Henderson Fullerton, an independent financial expert consulted by Lesage, gave him a reassuring report. If Canadian moneylenders did not want to assist in underwriting nationalization, the Americans would be only too glad to do so, since the province\u2019s debt was one of the lowest in the country. L\u00e9vesque got the same assurance from Roland Giroux*, a broker who had close ties to American financial circles. After the election, L\u00e9vesque would send him to New York with his advisers Michel B\u00e9langer* and Jacques Parizeau* to borrow the money required to finance nationalization. As for the electrical companies, they had at last given in, confining their actions to raising the stakes with respect to the monetary compensation that the government planned to pay them. If Lesage finally stopped his shilly-shallying, it was also to reaffirm his leadership, which had been damaged by his indecision. There was no better way to re-establish unity than a surprise election he was certain to win, according to the opinion poll he had secretly commissioned.\n\nOn 14 Nov. 1962, in an election that was almost a referendum, fought under the slogan \u201cMasters in our own house,\u201d the voters gave their consent to the nationalization of the private electrical companies. The total cost, originally estimated at $600 million, would rise to $604 million. The loan negotiated in New York would come to $300 million. The nationalist fervour of the 1960s had worked in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s favour. It had become inconceivable that huge foreign companies should exploit the province\u2019s resources and then send most of their profits abroad. Besides, the advantages of nationalization had finally been made obvious. It was necessary to put an end to the waste caused by the overlapping of power lines and anarchy in the catchment areas, where private companies were stepping on each other, as well as to the varying rates being charged. The government would recover the taxes that companies had been sending to Ottawa. The Quebec economy would also benefit from the creation of a whole range of secondary enterprises in different regions. Last of all, L\u00e9vesque, whose charisma and persuasive powers were far from negligible, had had the support of the people and the press. He had also been able to count on the respect and admiration that Lesage still showed him.\n\nThree years later, on 15 Oct. 1965, L\u00e9vesque would carry out an initial assessment of Hydro-Quebec. It had become the largest industrial enterprise in the province, with 17,000 employees and assets of $2.5 billion. It produced 34 per cent of Canada\u2019s hydroelectric energy. Furthermore, this \u201ccolossus,\u201d as the press called it, spoke French, both on the large construction sites and at its head office, where English had ruled absolutely until that time, even though a majority of the employees were French-speaking. Hydroelectricity became the field for training French-speaking managers and engineers, who had formerly been underestimated at the Shawinigan Water and Power Company.\n\nL\u00e9vesque also discovered that the mining sector was simply a \u201cbranch\u201d of foreign multinationals, which shipped ore to the United States, where factories transformed it into finished products. Since the province was satisfied with royalties that were among the lowest in Canada, the profits also ended up in foreign hands. The management and the expertise came from elsewhere. He also observed that there was no real policy on mining development. Convinced that the state had to play a role in exploring and exploiting its mineral resources, he undertook a radical revision of legislation on mining, which by now was more than 80 years old. Then, by forcing Lesage\u2019s hand while the premier was under pressure from the big companies, he would create in 1965, with the support of his cabinet ally Eric William Kierans*, the Quebec Mining Exploration Company (SOQUEM). To ensure that the concessions would no longer lie dormant for years, the leases became revocable after ten years of inactivity. Last of all, he doubled the mining fees previously paid by the mining companies.\n\nLong before the awakening of the First Nations, L\u00e9vesque was keenly interested in the aboriginal question. The Gasp\u00e9 of his childhood was also the homeland of the Micmac, who were confined to their wretched reserves in Restigouche and Maria (Gesgapegiag), adjacent to New Carlisle. In the summer of 1954, as a reporter for Carrefour, he accompanied Prince Philip on a visit to the Inuit of Ungava Bay, and the discovery of their Third-World conditions left him feeling uneasy. In 1961, during a trip to New Quebec that he undertook as part of his portfolio as minister of natural resources, he rediscovered the almost prisonlike world in which First Nations people and Inuit were living. And he was distressed by the absence of French in the province\u2019s northern latitudes. In the federal schools, neither French nor Inuktitut had any standing. This vast territory had been ceded to Quebec in 1912, but its governments had allowed Ottawa to move in with its schools, its health clinics, and its civil servants, all of which served to anglicize the aboriginals.\n\nDetermined to recover authority over New Quebec and its inhabitants, L\u00e9vesque came up against the refusal of the federal minister of northern affairs and national resources, Arthur Laing, who held back the transfer by claiming that the Inuit did not want to speak French. At the end of May 1964, in Winnipeg, Laing maintained that Ottawa had to keep control of education, health, and welfare, \u201cin order,\u201d according to the Montreal daily Le Devoir (30 May), \u201cto preserve the rights of Eskimos as first-class citizens.\u201d A furious L\u00e9vesque retorted that the minister\u2019s fears \u201cwere inspired by political considerations and hypocrisy.\u201d When Laing told the House of Commons he doubted L\u00e9vesque\u2019s sincerity, the latter reminded him that Quebec was the only province in Canada that had set an example, since confederation, of respect for the linguistic and religious rights of the minority. The Toronto press, for its part, attributed \u201cterritorial ambitions\u201d to L\u00e9vesque, according to the title of an article by Blair Fraser* in Maclean\u2019s on 16 May 1964, and even separatist designs. Nevertheless, the territory in question belonged to Quebec and the Inuit population, who, not being considered \u201cIndian\u201d by the federal government, were not covered by the Indian Act. Even worse, in L\u00e9vesque\u2019s eyes, was the fact that the neighbouring province of Newfoundland had been governing Inuit there since entering confederation in 1949. He was exasperated by this double standard and the words being put into his mouth. According to Fraser\u2019s report, he warned: \u201cThis Ungava issue is a test case of federal-provincial co-operation. If we can\u2019t even settle this, we can\u2019t settle anything.\u201d Common sense would finally prevail, thanks to the direct involvement of Prime Minister Pearson and Premier Lesage. During his term as federal minister of northern affairs and national resources, from 1953 to 1957, Lesage had not concerned himself with the question, but now he fully supported L\u00e9vesque\u2019s claim. Although he occasionally toned down his minister\u2019s aggressive behaviour, he nevertheless suggested to Pearson that he bring Laing into line and demanded, at the federal-provincial conference held in November 1963, that the transfer of jurisdiction be put into effect before 1 April 1964.\n\nA few years later the New Quebec that L\u00e9vesque had known in the 1960s, with its unsanitary shacks lacking electricity and heating, would become unrecognizable. Electricity and heated dwellings would be the norm. But in addition the city of Kuujjuaq would have a hospital, a secondary school, an arena, and an administrative centre. L\u00e9vesque had had a hand in this result. By putting the north under his protection, he had stimulated intergovernmental innovation and competition in the fields of education, health, and the economy.\n\nIn October 1965 there was a surprise cabinet shuffle. The pendulum of Liberal reform swung from the economy to social policies. L\u00e9vesque left the natural resources portfolio for that of family and social welfare. The world of the underprivileged was familiar to him. On Saturday mornings, his riding office was crowded with ordinary individuals asking to see \u201cRen\u00e9.\u201d L\u00e9vesque himself had the natural humility of common people. His first objective was to put through one single law on social assistance, centred on the family. He tackled the problem of adoption, which he wanted to make more humane, got approval for free medical assistance to the poor, increased the allowances for unmarried mothers, and prepared a white paper on handicapped children. At the Ottawa conference held in January 1966, convinced that social security ought to come from the provincial government, he demanded \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 the return of responsibility for family allowances. Thanks to this last trial of strength with Ottawa, and the earlier one that had pitted him against Laing, L\u00e9vesque took the measure of Canadian federalism, which seemed to him to have been hardening with respect to Quebec\u2019s demands since the arrival of Pierre Elliott Trudeau* in Ottawa following the November 1965 election. In February 1969 he would admit, in an interview with Jacques Guay of Le Magazine Maclean (Montr\u00e9al): \u201c[As for] me, I already no longer thought it possible that a federal state would agree to cut off a limb. As I watched the files and the conflicts with Ottawa multiply, I became, without daring to admit it to myself, more and more of a sovereignist.\u201d\n\nOn 5 June 1966 his party\u2019s defeat at the polls forshadowed the end of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s political career as a Liberal. Stripped of power, he had the impression that he was staring into a void and was not too sure what to do with his future. Having been re-elected in his riding, his only immediate certainty was that he would complete his four-year term as a backbencher. After that, he would see \u2013 perhaps he would go back to journalism, but nothing was less sure. L\u00e9vesque rethought his political affiliations in a Quebec caught up in the fever of protest that was sweeping the western world. Pacifists were denouncing the war in Vietnam, students were occupying campuses, partisans of independence were chanting \u201cLe Qu\u00e9bec aux Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois,\u201d supporters of the Union Nationale were demanding \u201c\u00c9galit\u00e9 ou Ind\u00e9pendence\u201d as their leader Daniel Johnson* \u2013 now premier \u2013 had written in his book published in Montreal in 1965. In July 1967 Charles de Gaulle, the president of France, unleashed his famous \u201cVive le Qu\u00e9bec libre!\u201d from the balcony of Montreal\u2019s city hall. And then there was the Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec, which was setting off its bombs.\n\nPreviously, when L\u00e9vesque was asked whether he was a nationalist, he would hesitate, still haunted by his memories of the war. Though he was a nationalist in his own way, the question would always make him uneasy. In 1948 he had written in the staff magazine of Radio-Canada\u2019s international service: \u201cI am for all practical purposes a Quebec nationalist, a perfect Laurentien.\u201d In fact, what left him cold was traditional French Canadian nationalism, with its \u201cFrenchifying gimmicks, bilingual cheques, the flag,\u201d as he would put it in 1969 to Le Magazine Maclean. L\u00e9vesque, who peppered his remarks with tangible examples that inspired confidence, displayed a practical nationalism. If he made a reference to the massive dam on the Rivi\u00e8re Manicouagan, it was to suggest to French-speaking Quebecers that they were capable of great things. He would never be a flag waver, fearing the politics of the street with its ever-present potential for emotionalism and brutality. This was the reason why he was constantly at odds with the Rassemblement pour l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Nationale, whose direct action, verbal violence, and chauvinistic language repelled him. Nevertheless, in the June 1966 election, when that party was running candidates, he was troubled. Since Pierre Bourgault*, then the leader of the RIN, had moderated his words and given a social-democratic flavour to his political position, L\u00e9vesque had the impression that he was fighting against a fraternal party.\n\nEarlier, on 27 February, L\u00e9vesque had made it clear that the aim of nationalism, as he was trying to live it out, was to abolish the privileges, not the rights, of the English-speaking minority. He confirmed in his memoirs: \u201cI am a nationalist \u2026 if that means being for oneself, fiercely for oneself \u2013 or against something \u2026 against a given situation. But never against someone.\u201d He saw this \u201csituation\u201d more clearly after six years of political struggles. The Quiet Revolution was only a beginning. Quebec had to go further to free itself from the economic yoke it had laboured under for too long, and from a federal regime that had hardened after the first years of the decade, when there had been a more obvious willingness on Ottawa\u2019s part to cooperate with the provinces. The acceleration of Quebec nationalism during the 1960s left its mark on L\u00e9vesque. Even though it was not really a question of conversion, he had been throwing around, especially since 1963, incendiary phrases that bore witness to his radicalization. During a stop in Toronto at the end of May 1963, he admitted to television interviewer Pierre Berton* that he would not shed many tears if Quebec separated. On 5 May 1964 Le Devoir\u2019s headline on the report of his visit to Timmins, Ont., stated that, according to L\u00e9vesque, \u201cbetter separation than constant quarrelling.\u201d On 9 May, speaking to the students at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Marie in Montreal, he declared that the only appropriate status for Quebec was that of an associate state, a status which would have to be negotiated with the rest of Canada \u201cwithout rifles and without dynamite as far as possible.\u2026 If Quebec is refused this status, we will have to separate,\u201d Le Devoir noted two days later. According to the Montreal Star of 20 Feb. 1967, he warned his listeners in western Canada: \u201cEither Quebec gets a new deal [with the rest of Canada] or eventually it will get out.\u201d\n\nDuring the summer of 1967, after carefully weighing all the factors, L\u00e9vesque concluded that the country had become a \u201cmadhouse,\u201d and that the future lay somewhere else than in this federal Canada, which he rejected, and of which Trudeau had become the champion ever since his election to the House of Commons in 1965. \u201cWe are Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois,\u201d he declared in the manifesto he issued first to his supporters in the riding of Laurier on 18 Sept. 1967. (A slightly amended version would be published in Montreal the following year.) The title, Option Qu\u00e9bec (published as An option for Quebec, Toronto, 1968), summed up its basic idea. At the age of 45, L\u00e9vesque chose to struggle henceforth for a Quebec homeland. By doing this, he assumed the role of fraternal enemy to Trudeau, his ally of the 1950s, when they and a handful of others comprised the informal opposition to the Duplessis government. When the Quiet Revolution made its first proclamations, they were in agreement on many things: a larger role for the state in education, the economy, and social affairs; the modernization of Quebec; and the democratization of its political life. But the conflict of personalities was never far below the surface. The nationalization of private electrical companies was one of the subjects on which they took opposite stands. Their relationship, never easy, was finally overwhelmed by the flood tide of the new nationalism. Just a few short months later, in April 1968, Trudeau would become prime minister of Canada. A battle of titans broke out between two strong leaders who had irreconcilable visions of their province\u2019s future.\n\nIn October 1967 the convention of the Quebec Liberal Party opened in an atmosphere of hostility, which became contagious as soon as the party\u2019s former star took his seat. The wind had changed. Lesage and Kierans, who had worked closely with L\u00e9vesque during the good years of Liberal reform, sealed his fate by threatening to resign if his ideas were supported by the delegates. Nevertheless, L\u00e9vesque tabled his resolution, \u201cA sovereign Quebec within a Canadian economic union,\u201d inspired by his manifesto. Quebec would no longer be a province but a sovereign state, levying taxes, passing laws, and dealing with other nations in its own name and its own language, but would associate with Canada at the economic level. Unable to convince his Liberal comrades-in-arms, L\u00e9vesque withdrew his resolution before the show of hands that would take place, nonetheless, after his departure. He announced that he would do his best to promote it elsewhere. Then, followed by a handful of supporters, he left the hall. From then on, the rebel would sit in the Legislative Assembly (renamed National Assembly the following year) as the independent member for Laurier, while preparing to launch his own party.\n\nFor some, L\u00e9vesque was now a heroic figure; for others, he was public enemy number one. With 400 adherents one month after his resignation, the group that would become the sovereignist party had grown to 2,000 by January 1968. On 19 April, at the founding of the Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association, from which the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would be born, the membership had climbed to more than 7,000. From the moment the MSA was founded, L\u00e9vesque kept the future party from becoming sidetracked into political marginalization. He had to threaten to go home to win respect for the educational and linguistic rights of the English-speaking minority, which were contested by the faction within the movement that identified with the RIN. L\u00e9vesque gauged the fragility of his leadership and distinguished more clearly the various groups, often opposed to each other, that made up his new political family: former Liberals, the separatist followers of Bourgault (who would himself scupper the RIN), social-credit supporters from the Ralliement National, left-wing trade unionists with socialist leanings, and a multitude of students. Half of the delegates were under the age of 30. The founding convention of the PQ on 11 Oct. 1968, unlike that of the MSA, proceeded harmoniously. The PQ\u2019s program would be similar to the one sketched out in the spring by the delegates of the MSA: French as the only official language, recognition of the rights of the minority, a unilateral declaration of independence, a presidential system, compulsory trade-union membership, an interventionist state that would yet respect free enterprise, territorial integrity, the recovery of Labrador, and withdrawal from military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nBut before reaching the paradise of power, there was the desert to cross. Between 1966 and 1976, L\u00e9vesque led a rather Spartan existence. Until his personal defeat in the election of April 1970, he had drawn his salary as an mna. That summer he left Louise L\u2019Heureux and went to live with Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9, a teacher from Alma. L\u00e9vesque could not rely on his mna pension since he was sending it to his wife, who was raising their three children. Fortunately, he had some income from his work as a journalist. Back in September 1966 the Montreal periodical Dimanche-Matin had commissioned him to write a weekly column, but he gave it up in 1969, shortly before the 1970 election. After his defeat in Laurier, Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al in turn made him an offer of $200 a week. L\u00e9vesque had always refused to take a salary as leader of the PQ, but in February 1976, after the ind\u00e9pendantiste Montreal daily Le Jour ceased publication, depriving him of his income as a columnist, the party paid him $18,000 a year.\n\nThe PQ solicited votes for the first time on 29 April 1970 in a provincial election dominated by the fear of separatism fanned by the new Liberal leader, Robert Bourassa*, and by the intervention of the federal Liberals, who published in Montreal, in their internal newsletter What\u2019s New?, a study purporting to show the benefits of federalism for the people of Quebec. The figures were so far-fetched, however, that Bourassa and Trudeau disowned the study. Bourassa\u2019s promise to create 100,000 jobs, a key theme in Quebec where there was a high level of unemployment, also weighed heavily in the outcome of the voting. Defeated in the riding of Laurier, L\u00e9vesque succeeded in getting only seven members elected, even though his party received 23.1 per cent of the votes. That year the October crisis proved disastrous for his political position. The FLQ had kidnapped James Richard Cross, a British diplomat, and Pierre Laporte*, the provincial minister of labour and manpower, as well as of immigration, who would be found murdered on 17 October. To overcome the FLQ, Trudeau, under pressure from the Bourassa government, toyed with the idea of proclaiming the War Measures Act. On 14 October, in collaboration with Claude Ryan*, the publisher of Le Devoir, L\u00e9vesque brought together leaders from different social spheres, including Louis Laberge*, president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec, Alfred Rouleau, future president of the Desjardins movement, and sociologists Fernand Dumont* and Guy Rocher. The objective of the 16 signatories to a common declaration drawn up by L\u00e9vesque was to encourage the governments to abandon strong-arm tactics and negotiate with the kidnappers to save the lives of the hostages. Their appeal was not heeded, however. On 16 October Ottawa proclaimed the War Measures Act, giving it sweeping emergency powers [see Trudeau]. By the next day some 40 members of the PQ had been arrested. In L\u00e9vesque\u2019s view, this was an extreme and anti-democratic measure that violated the centuries-old British tradition of habeas corpus. Associated with the FLQ by its opponents, the PQ lost 45,000 members who would no longer risk describing themselves as \u201cp\u00e9quistes.\u201d\n\nRepudiated by public opinion, the PQ was a victim of illegal espionage by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. During the night of 8 Jan. 1973 RCMP agents broke into a building and stole the party\u2019s membership list in what has become known as Operation Ham, as would be disclosed in the reports of inquiries by Judge David C. McDonald (1979\u201381) in Ottawa and Commissioner Jean F. Keable (1981) in Quebec City. L\u00e9vesque would accuse the Trudeau government of wanting to take advantage of the extremes of FLQ terrorism to strike a death blow to his party.\n\nL\u00e9vesque\u2019s handicap at the polls was still the same: people were afraid of sovereignty. Having shifted to the PQ in May 1972, Claude Morin, who had been deputy minister of federal-provincial affairs and intergovernmental affairs in the administrations of Lesage, Johnson, Jean-Jacques Bertrand*, and Bourassa, persuaded L\u00e9vesque to hold a referendum before making any declaration of independence. But Premier Bourassa called a snap election before L\u00e9vesque had a chance to get the idea accepted by the followers of economist Jacques Parizeau, who favoured independence with no referendum and no obligatory association with the rest of Canada. On 29 Oct. 1973 the Liberals won a landslide victory. L\u00e9vesque, who ran in the riding of Dorion, suffered personal defeat for the second time and lost one of the seven members elected three years earlier. All was not doom and gloom, however. The sovereignist vote increased from 23.1 to 30.2 per cent, and reached nearly 40 per cent among francophones. Furthermore, the PQ became the official opposition, led by an influential new member, constitutional expert Jacques-Yvan Morin. The Liberal Party elected 102 members, thanks to a not-very-democratic voting system that gave 5.5 per cent of the seats to the party that had won 30.2 per cent of the popular vote.\n\nL\u00e9vesque wondered whether he was still the right man for the situation. He wanted to call it quits and do something else with his life. In Quebec City, his six National Assembly members were left on their own. Soon his lack of interest in the party led to grumbling. As the November 1974 convention drew near, he agreed, at the urgent request of his entourage, to stay at his post, but on his own terms. He was determined to bring to heel those who were eroding his authority by means of the debate on the need to hold a referendum before declaring independence. At the gathering, which has gone down in history as the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d convention (because of the idea of \u201c\u00e9tapisme\u201d attributed to Morin), L\u00e9vesque had the word \u201creferendum\u201d written into the program. In early September 1976 he put down the rebellion of mnas Robert Burns and Claude Charron, who were calling into question his leadership.\n\nWith peace restored, L\u00e9vesque began confidently and calmly to prepare for the fall\u2019s election campaign. He had turned 54 on 24 August. He seemed more relaxed, less aggressive. His love life had become more stable now that he was living with Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. For a pro-independence party, the prospects of coming to power had never been so good. L\u00e9vesque expected to win a minimum of 35 seats and, if luck was with him, to form a minority government. The proposal adopted at the 1974 convention \u2013 to hold a referendum conditional on the attitude of the federal government \u2013 now gave way to a clearer electoral promise: there would be a referendum before the end of the first term of office.\n\nL\u00e9vesque was facing a government worn down by six years in power and discredited by patronage, political interference, and conflicts of interest in the Quebec Liquor Corporation and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Exploitation des Loteries et Courses du Qu\u00e9bec (revealed by the commission of inquiry into organized crime). Bourassa was also facing accusations of nepotism. Moreover, the premier was deluding himself by thinking that he would achieve victory by using Ottawa as a whipping boy. When Trudeau had come to him in the spring seeking support for his plan to repatriate the British North America Act of 1867, Bourassa had refused. Trudeau had then threatened to proceed unilaterally, thereby giving Bourassa a pretext for calling an early election. Last of all, the fragility of the Liberal government was partly due also to the Official Language Act (also known as Bill 22), which, among other things, had proclaimed French as the official language of Quebec, but divided the English-speaking voters who traditionally supported the Liberals. Yet it was not so much the proclamation of French as the official language that had outraged anglophones, but rather the linguistic tests imposed on children who wanted to enrol in an English school. They were afraid that these tests would keep immigrants and francophones out of their schools. L\u00e9vesque, for his part, saw the act as an arbitrary and odious measure that opened the door to discrimination between different ethnic groups. Above all, Bill 22 did not deal realistically with the question of getting immigrants to acquire the French language.\n\nOn 15 November the PQ caucus increased from 6 mnas to 71 and the Liberal Party dropped from 97 to 26. To Claude Morin and some analysts, L\u00e9vesque owed his victory above all to having downplayed sovereignty during the campaign and having promised to hold a referendum. Be that as it may, his determination to introduce political transparency and good government (as the saying goes) also persuaded a majority of voters. L\u00e9vesque had accomplished the tour de force of not only rallying his customary electoral supporters \u2013 trade unionists, students, teachers, intellectuals, young people \u2013 but also making a breakthrough into circles that had previously rejected his message, such as small shopkeepers, mayors of villages and small towns, women, the elderly, farmers, and even military personnel. Unlike anglophones who had revived the moribund Union Nationale rather than cast their votes for the PQ, immigrants had proved much more receptive. History took an abrupt turn. For the first time, a party that proposed to break up confederation would form the government of Quebec. Prime Minister Trudeau, half-heartedly congratulating the winner, warned him that he would never negotiate the partition of Canada.\n\nL\u00e9vesque would hold power for two terms, 1976\u201381 and 1981\u201385. For support, he called on a team of 18 ministers, 5 of whom held two portfolios, with a total of 23 ministries. Some of them had impressive credentials and were graduates of elite schools: Jacques Parizeau (London School of Economics and Political Science), Jacques-Yvan Morin (Harvard University and University of Cambridge), Claude Morin (Columbia University), Yves B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Bernard Landry (Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris). Others, like broadcaster Lise Payette, brought qualities such as celebrity status, vivacity, and charisma that were sometimes missing in those who shone by reason of their education and experience. L\u00e9vesque would need all these abilities to turn around both the financial management of the province and the economy. Public services were more costly in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada. A family of four in Quebec paid $1,000 more in taxes than a comparable family in the other provinces. The economic growth for his first year in power would be lower than that of the country as a whole, while unemployment would rise to 9.5 per cent. Far from being paralysed by these sombre prospects, the new government, on its election, set in motion a huge wave of reform harking back to that of the 1960s. These changes would radically alter Quebec society. First of all, L\u00e9vesque could finally achieve his goal of political transparency; he pushed it to the limit by banning secret electoral funds and replacing them in 1977 with a system of public financing for political parties. As the victim of a system that created an imbalance between a party\u2019s real strength and its representation in parliament, he began to redraw the electoral map, which gave up to six times as much weight to the rural vote as to the urban, and change the electoral system, which similarly created an imbalance between the percentage of votes and the number of seats. He introduced elements of proportional voting, but could not complete this last reform because of the solid opposition of his mnas. Relying on the public\u2019s hostility to proportional representation and feeling threatened by the complexity of proportional voting, most of them also saw such a reform as a source of political instability, which would make it difficult, for instance, to pass controversial bills. On 23 June 1978 L\u00e9vesque would as well put through the Referendum Act, which was to govern the holding of a referendum.\n\nDuring the election campaign, L\u00e9vesque had promised to make Quebec as French as Ontario was English. In his view, however, law and language were not a good match, as he had warned Premier Bourassa when the latter had proclaimed the Official Language Act in 1974. Moreover, he said openly that he found it humiliating to have to resort to legislation, since only a downtrodden and colonized people must brandish the law to impose their language. But the decline of French, especially in Montreal, the massive anglicization of immigrants, and the demographic and linguistic context of North America, where the ratio of French-speaking Quebecers to non-francophones was one to forty, threatened the survival of a French Quebec.\n\nIn L\u00e9vesque\u2019s opinion, it was not a question of scrapping the Official Language Act in order to give birth to a new \u201cMagna Carta\u201d of language for general edification. He simply wanted to modify it in order to give back to francophones a useful enjoyment of their language at work, in signage, in business, and in public administration, and to get immigrants to acquire the French language. But Camille Laurin*, the influential and persuasive minister of state for cultural development, acting on the advice of sociologists Rocher and Dumont, took him further than he wanted to go. Proclaimed and put into force on 26 Aug. 1977, the Charter of the French Language, commonly known as Bill 101, declared Quebec a unilingual society and excluded English from the legislature and courts in violation of article 133 of the Canadian constitution, which guarantees the use of both languages. (This part of the Quebec law would be struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada in December 1979.) Moreover, the law made English schools available only to children whose parents had studied in English in Quebec. This is the \u201cQuebec clause,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cCanada clause\u201d favoured by L\u00e9vesque, which would have opened English schools to the children of all English-speaking Canadians. According to Dr Laurin, on 1 April 1977, the day before he tabled his white paper in parliament, the premier carelessly remarked to him during an emotional t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I like your law, doctor. I have to pass it because we are not free. I can\u2019t prevent immigrants from coming to our province, but if I do nothing, they will become anglicized and dispossess us. I have no choice. If we lived in a normal country, doctor, we wouldn\u2019t need your law.\u201d Though he finally accepted the Quebec clause, he did so also because he was gambling that the English-speaking provinces with a French-speaking minority would adopt the reciprocity he had offered them. Under this arrangement, anglophones from a province that granted its minority the same access to schools as was granted by Quebec to its English-speaking minority could enrol their children in English-language schools in Quebec. If this reciprocity were to be accepted by the English-speaking provinces, it would effectively cancel the Quebec clause. In cabinet, L\u00e9vesque could not oppose the bill\u2019s article on the language of instruction without running the risk of finding himself in the minority. This text \u2013 which would become the law that would have the greatest effect on the face of Quebec and the mentality of its people \u2013 enjoyed solid support among the public, party members and mnas, and in the cabinet. This was far from being the case among anglophones, more than 130,000 of whom would choose to emigrate between 1976 and 1981, mostly to Ontario. Similarly, motivated by the westward shift of their financial activity, a number of large companies, such as the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, a multinational that did 80 per cent of its business outside the province, would move to Toronto, giving Bill 101 as the reason.\n\nTo end Quebec\u2019s first-place standing for the greatest number of road accidents, the lowest compensation for claims, and the highest insurance premiums in Canada, and to correct a situation where one Quebec vehicle in five had no insurance, L\u00e9vesque introduced the system of public and compulsory automobile insurance advocated in 1974 in the Report of the committee of inquiry on automobile insurance. This study had been done under Jean-Louis Gauvin as chair and commissioned by the Bourassa government, which later shelved it. The Act to establish the R\u00e9gie de l\u2019Assurance Automobile du Qu\u00e9bec and the Automobile Insurance Act, both of which took effect in March 1978, were unpopular pieces of legislation. The complicated new system required a driver to carry two forms of insurance, a public one for personal injury regardless of liability (which some ministers complained would absolve drivers of responsibility), and a private one for property damage (which, it was believed, would further increase the cost). Moreover, the reform caused an outcry among lawyers and insurance agents close to the PQ, who saw their livelihood being taken away from them. Under pressure from lawyers, who were well represented in the cabinet, the government was divided. The legislation crossed the finish line only with L\u00e9vesque\u2019s decisive support for Lise Payette, the minister of consumers, cooperatives, and financial institutions.\n\nAccording to L\u00e9vesque and his minister of agriculture, Jean Garon, Ottawa was favouring the big grain and cattle farms in the western provinces, while confining Quebec to dairy farming. This policy stood in the way of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s determination to diversify Quebec agriculture to develop the food-processing industry and agricultural self-sufficiency. On 22 Dec. 1978, to curb financial speculation, he had the Act to preserve agricultural land proclaimed (which in its effects was retroactive to 9 November).\n\nAs well, Quebecers\u2019 entrepreneurship emerged in the economy. In 1978 Parizeau, the finance minister, abolished the eight per cent sales tax on everyday consumer goods to assist low-income families while also helping the vulnerable sectors of the economy \u2013 textiles, furniture, footwear, and clothing. In 1979 he introduced stock-savings plans to initiate Quebecers into the stock market and at the same time create a reserve of local capital for small and medium businesses. Along the same lines, the government set up the Program to Stimulate the Economy and Uphold Employment (1977), adopted a policy of preferential purchasing (1978), and published in 1979 a strategy for economic development, B\u00e2tir le Qu\u00e9bec\u2026.\n\nOn the social front, L\u00e9vesque brought in a long list of measures that showed the social-democratic orientation of his government: free medicine for the elderly (1977), the Youth Protection Act (1977), therapeutic abortion (1977), the Act to secure the handicapped in the exercise of their rights (1978), and the Act respecting child daycare (1979). On the labour front, the government had a law against strike-breaking passed (1977), promoted labour-management dialogue by organizing the economic summit at La Malbaie (1977), and had the Act respecting occupational health and safety given royal assent (1979). In the field of culture, in addition to the Charter of the French Language and the creation of maisons de la culture, the Act to incorporate the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de D\u00e9veloppement des Industries Culturelles was assented to in 1978. Justice minister Marc-Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9dard, for his part, dusted off and democratized the administration of justice, set up the Commission Qu\u00e9becoise des Lib\u00e9rations Conditionnelles, and instituted class-action suits that year. L\u00e9vesque also provided the province with a policy on scientific research (1980). To put an end to the grip of U.S. corporations on Quebec\u2019s asbestos, which was being sent out of the country to be processed, he tabled Bill 121, authorizing the government to nationalize the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asbestos Limit\u00e9e in 1978. Protracted judicial skirmishes with the American company began, which would go on until 1982. In the meantime, asbestos fibre would be declared carcinogenic, and the industry collapsed. The beautiful dream would cost the taxpayers $435 million.\n\nIn foreign policy, L\u00e9vesque pursued two main objectives. Following the example of premiers Lesage and Johnson, he sought to maximize Quebec\u2019s visibility in the world by developing more and more contacts with other countries, whose sympathy would be useful if ever the people of Quebec authorized him to form a new country. The second pillar of his foreign policy was based on his determination to deal directly, in his own name and without a federal chaperone, with foreign dignitaries and heads of state. This policy brought him into conflict with Ottawa, which was jealous of its international sovereignty, and occasionally led to embarrassing situations. In January 1977, at the Economic Club of New York, where only the Quebec fleur-de-lys flag was flown beside the star-spangled banner, L\u00e9vesque tried to reassure the 1,600 guests \u2013 mostly American moneylenders and investors \u2013 about the security of their investments in Quebec. Since he spent almost his entire speech drawing a bold parallel between the independence of Quebec and that of the American colonies 200 years earlier, it was a \u201cmonumental flop,\u201d as he would write in his memoirs. He made up for this failure in November of that year, during an equally sensational official visit to Paris. The French president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, and his prime minister, Raymond Barre, welcomed him with all the show of respect due a real head of state, and not like an ordinary provincial premier, as Ottawa had insisted. But Ottawa was less worried about the thickness of the red carpet than about L\u00e9vesque\u2019s determination to give Franco-Quebec dialogue a more political dimension. The creation of an annual summit meeting between the French prime minister and the premier of Quebec confirmed Canada\u2019s fears, especially since the prime ministers of France and Canada did not meet once a year. Besides, placed on the same footing as the prime minister of a sovereign country, with complete authority, L\u00e9vesque, an ordinary provincial leader, might raise topics that went beyond Quebec\u2019s jurisdiction. Ottawa would not rest until it had made Paris back down on the matter. And so, in February 1979, to lessen the impact of the first Franco-Quebec summit, which was held that year in Quebec City, Prime Minister Trudeau insisted that Barre should go to Ottawa first.\n\nThis visit gave L\u00e9vesque the opportunity to make clear his intentions with regard to Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9. Their liaison had become public on the night of 5 Feb. 1977, when L\u00e9vesque, with Corinne in his car, had accidentally run over a homeless man lying in the street. In September 1978 he had obtained his divorce from Louise L\u2019Heureux. The presence of the young woman beside the premier of Quebec, on the occasion of a reception in honour of Barre and his wife, annoyed the French couple. In Paris a mistress is not among the invited guests. Power had not changed L\u00e9vesque in the slightest. Rebellious as ever, he sometimes refused to conform to the constraints that protocol placed on his office. He still smoked as much in front of the camera, and he wore short-sleeved shirts and, invariably, sports shoes, the eternal \u201cWallabees\u201d that amused the press. He smoothed things over by confiding to his guests that Corinne C\u00f4t\u00e9 was his fianc\u00e9e and they would be married in April \u2013 as indeed they were, at a private ceremony on 12 April 1979.\n\nIn this year preceding the referendum, however, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s greatest challenge was to convince a majority of Quebecers to follow him all the way to independence. It was the battle of his life. During the 1976 election campaign, he had promised to hold a referendum before the end of his first term of office. On 1 Nov. 1979, despite unfavourable polls, he tabled in the National Assembly the white paper on sovereignty-association, which offered the rest of Canada a new agreement between two peoples, politically sovereign, but economically associated: Qu\u00e9bec-Canada, a new deal: the Qu\u00e9bec government proposal for a new partnership between equals, sovereignty-association. The document emphasized both Quebecers\u2019 desire for autonomy and the deadlocked federal system, and it proposed to take back all powers and taxes within the framework of a new association, more economic than political, between two sovereign states. Provincial civil servants, who were more concerned about their working conditions, which they were in the process of negotiating, than about the outcome of the referendum, disrupted the event by singing O Canada before smashing windows and shutting the journalists in the press room. The situation became more complicated at a cabinet meeting on 19 Dec. 1979. The adoption of a complex and rather long referendum question created divisions among the ministers. The question included a request for a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with the rest of Canada, as well as the idea adopted at a convention the previous June of a second referendum (to consult the people on the results of discussions with the federal government following the first referendum). Some ministers, including Denis Lazure* and Lise Payette, went home early in the evening, convinced that the premier would get what he wanted, even at some cost to Parizeau. The finance minister\u2019s opposition to what he considered the bizarre idea of a second referendum was flagging as time went on. L\u00e9vesque had to use all his authority to bring him into line. At the National Assembly the next day, he seemed to be troubled by the premier\u2019s reading of the question. He hurried out of the room, convinced that the definitive wording was not the one accepted the day before. In fact, L\u00e9vesque had forgotten to inform him of some minor changes introduced afterwards by the lawyers. Being suspicious by nature, Parizeau had had immediate doubts, but revised his position after further consideration.\n\nL\u00e9vesque had foreseen everything but the return of his eternal political rival, Trudeau. The Liberal leader, who had been defeated by Charles Joseph Clark\u2019s Conservatives in the election of 22 May 1979, resurfaced in December after the Conservative government fell. On 18 Feb. 1980 Trudeau was re-elected, just in time for the referendum. On 20 June of the previous year L\u00e9vesque had reached a decision: the referendum would be held in the spring of 1980. He made this decision public the next day, but without specifying the date \u2013 20 May 1980 \u2013 which he would divulge to the National Assembly on 15 April 1980. On 4 March the leading lights of the government had begun a 35-hour parliamentary debate on the referendum question that went on until 20 March. The confrontation, which was won hands down by the government, gave the Yes camp a slight lead. Indeed, for the first and only time, according to an internal poll conducted by the party, the PQ speakers had more than 58 per cent of the votes, and Ryan\u2019s No camp just 12 per cent. Put at a disadvantage by subsequent negative polls, a strategy with no clear direction, an overly bureaucratic organization, and unmotivated party members, L\u00e9vesque\u2019s campaign did not get off the ground. Moreover, Lise Payette, minister of state for the status of women, made women angry when she compared Ryan\u2019s wife, Yvette, to a housewife living in the shadow of her husband. The \u201cYvette\u201d movement in support of the No side caught fire and crippled the sovereignists, who were also hard put to counter the campaign led by the federal minister of justice and attorney general, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, a campaign L\u00e9vesque considered illegal and immoral. The minister, without hesitation, disregarded the law on popular consultation, which, among other things, limited the spending of the two sides, and he had federal cheques being mailed out to Quebecers sent with slogans favourable to the federalist camp. The final blow came from Prime Minister Trudeau, who, in a few sentences and with a few promises, shattered L\u00e9vesque\u2019s dream. Since L\u00e9vesque had stumbled earlier by emphasizing Trudeau\u2019s middle name, \u201cElliott,\u201d which recalled his mother\u2019s Scottish ancestry (just as Trudeau himself had stumbled during the 1976 election by evoking the victory \u201cof the blood brothers\u201d to distinguish the francophones who had voted for the PQ from the anglophones and allophones who had supported the Liberals), the prime minister made a point of shouting out that his \u201cname is a Quebec name.\u201d On 14 May, shortly before the vote, Trudeau promised to resign if federalism was not renewed to the satisfaction of Quebecers. In so doing he gave the undecided voters a reason for voting No.\n\nOn 20 May L\u00e9vesque suffered the bitterest defeat of his political career. The surveys had left him no illusions, but he had hoped to win a majority of the francophone vote. He did not get it and had to be satisfied with a total of 40.4 per cent of the votes. He concluded that the people of Quebec were not yet ready for independence. It was hard for him to understand, however, that it was possible to say no to oneself. He was not asking for a mandate to separate, but for a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with Canada. Those around him would criticize him for having waited too long to hold the referendum, for having given his adversary, doubly decapitated by the departure of Bourassa and the defeat of Trudeau, a chance to recover. In the opinion of former premier Bourassa, the referendum was L\u00e9vesque\u2019s most serious political error, for he had held it knowing that he would lose, thereby opening the way for Trudeau, who was burning with desire to repatriate the constitution without taking account of the province\u2019s demands. In L\u00e9vesque\u2019s view, the referendum had at least given judicial legitimacy to Quebecers\u2019 right to self-determination. By participating in the popular consultation, Ottawa had accepted, at the international level, the idea that it was the people of Quebec who should determine their future, not Ottawa and not English-speaking Canada. Politically weakened and brought back to his role as a provincial premier, L\u00e9vesque put his struggle for a Quebec homeland on the back burner. He got down to the business of patching up the time-worn 1867 document, adopting the demands of his predecessors: equality between francophones and anglophones, constitutional recognition of Quebec\u2019s distinct character, and a new sharing of powers between Ottawa and the provinces.\n\nThe ball was now in the federalists\u2019 court, L\u00e9vesque had declared on the evening of his defeat. Trudeau caught it on the fly and invited him and the other premiers to join him in negotiating a new federalism. At the constitutional conference held in Ottawa in September 1980, the prime minister insisted on repatriating the constitution and enshrining within it a charter of rights and freedoms before really dealing with the actual question of the new sharing of powers demanded by a majority of the provinces. Matters came to an impasse, and to resolve it Trudeau threatened to proceed without the premiers\u2019 agreement. On 6 October he presented a motion in the House of Commons for a unilateral repatriation of the constitution, including in particular an amending formula that gave all provinces the right to oppose any change in the constitution they considered unacceptable. But this veto would be valid for only two years following repatriation, after which the provinces and Ottawa would have to agree on a new formula, to be worked out. On 12 Nov. 1980 L\u00e9vesque presented his own motion in the National Assembly, opposing the federal \u201cpower grab,\u201d which required unanimous agreement to be adopted. The opposition of Liberal leader Claude Ryan led to its defeat. This did not prevent L\u00e9vesque, in the course of the following winter, from building a common front against Ottawa, consisting of eight provinces, excepting only Ontario and New Brunswick, the two declared allies of the federal government. On 12 March 1981, in the midst of these negotiations, he decided to go to the people. His political acumen told him that the people of Quebec, worried by Trudeau\u2019s threats (as L\u00e9vesque\u2019s own polls showed), would elect him rather than Ryan, who had made the mistake of associating himself with the federal government in blocking the adoption of L\u00e9vesque\u2019s motion against unilateral repatriation. His slogan was \u201cWe must remain strong in Quebec.\u201d With the focus of the campaign on the accomplishments of his \u201cgood government,\u201d the election of 13 April 1981 took on the appearance of a plebiscite. The PQ won two-thirds of the seats. On 16 April the eight provinces reached agreement on a plan for constitutional reform, which they intended to submit to Trudeau. To facilitate the agreement, L\u00e9vesque had to give up Quebec\u2019s traditional right to a veto, in favour of the right to opt out and receive financial compensation.\n\nOn 28 September the Supreme Court of Canada, which in April had been called on for its opinion about the legality of unilateral repatriation, ruled partly in favour of Ottawa. Repatriation was legal, but would be un-constitutional in the \u201cconventional sense.\u201d There was an emergency session in Quebec City, where L\u00e9vesque put through, on 2 October, a motion of resistance which this time got Ryan\u2019s support. Early in November, along with cabinet ministers Allan Joseph MacEachen and Jean Chr\u00e9tien, as well as his personal advisers, Trudeau welcomed the provincial premiers to \u201cthe one last time\u201d conference in Ottawa. On his side, L\u00e9vesque was accompanied by Claude Morin, the man in charge of the Quebec strategy, and two ministers, Marc-Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9dard and Claude Charron. There were some who felt that this was not a winning team, that it should have included ministers with a more solid grasp of constitutional matters and federal-provincial relations, such as Jacques-Yvan Morin and Jacques Parizeau. Of the ten or so subjects discussed at the previous constitutional meetings, there were only three left: the repatriation of the constitution, the amending formula, and the charter of rights \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s three priorities. Brilliantly manipulated by Trudeau, L\u00e9vesque fell into the trap of a so-called Quebec-Canada alliance focused on the idea of an all-Canadian referendum on the constitution, something that the English-speaking provinces, who felt betrayed by L\u00e9vesque, wanted nothing to do with. Already showing cracks as a result of the Supreme Court decision and the desire of the premiers of the English-speaking provinces to reach an agreement with Ottawa, the united front of the provinces imploded. On the last morning of the conference, L\u00e9vesque was presented with the text of an agreement negotiated the evening before by three ministers, Chr\u00e9tien (for the federal government), Roy John Romanow (of Saskatchewan), and Roy McMurtry (of Ontario), for which they had previously obtained the approval of the seven other provincial premiers. It was now L\u00e9vesque\u2019s turn to feel betrayed by his former allies of the common front, whose nocturnal secret negotiations would go down in history as the \u201cnight of the long knives.\u201d While resigning himself to the inclusion of a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause that would reduce the scope of the new constitution with respect to freedom of expression, religion, and language, Trudeau achieved his three main objectives. The right of francophones outside Quebec to have their own schools, \u201cwhere the number of those children so warrants,\u201d was stipulated in Article 23 of the new constitution. Anglophones coming to Quebec from other provinces would have access to English schools there, in violation of the Quebec clause of Bill 101, which granted this right only to anglophones from Quebec. But, unlike Ontario \u2013 whose French-speaking minority, while smaller in number than the English-speaking minority in Quebec, was nevertheless substantial \u2013 only Quebec had official bilingualism imposed on its parliament and courts, in keeping with Article 133 of the BNA Act, which was confirmed in the new constitution. To L\u00e9vesque, this was an injustice that would lead him to say that Trudeau had bartered institutional recognition of official bilingualism in Ontario for Premier William Grenville Davis\u2019s support for his plan of repatriation. Lastly, there was no recognition of Quebec as a distinct society in the constitution and no right of veto, but there was a right of opting out with no financial compensation.\n\nFor L\u00e9vesque, it was a total disaster. The text of the new constitution reduced the powers of the only French government in the federation without its consent and fell so far short of the historic demands of Quebec, which was now subject to the law of the strongest, that he refused to sign it. This meant that the second most populous province in Canada did not recognize the fundamental law of the country, despite being bound by it. On 2 Dec. 1981, the day on which the House of Commons passed the motion on the new constitution, L\u00e9vesque had the fleur-de-lys flown at half-mast at the parliament buildings. There were now indeed two Canadas, as Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had just demonstrated.\n\nWorn down by his setbacks with the referendum, L\u00e9vesque found it difficult to come to terms with this new defeat. He became disillusioned and lost his grip in the final three years of his political career, during which he suffered blow after blow. Scarcely had he returned from the Ottawa summit when he learned that Claude Morin, the minister of intergovernmental affairs and the person mainly responsible for negotiations on the constitution, had taken money from the RCMP in exchange for information about the PQ. L\u00e9vesque would carry this secret with him to the grave. In the early 1980s a severe economic recession drove unemployment to new heights, a nasty shock for his government, which was struggling with a deficit of $700 million. He insisted that the unionized workers in the public sector, whose jobs were guaranteed and whose wages were higher than those in the private sector, do their share and give up some of their benefits. In June 1982, faced with the unionists\u2019 refusal, L\u00e9vesque secured royal assent to the Act respecting remuneration in the public sector, which imposed wage cuts. That meant war. In December he promulgated the Act respecting the conditions of employment in the public sector, which imposed retroactive wage cuts of 19.45 per cent. The province was paralyzed by an avalanche of illegal strikes, which was brought to an end in February 1983 by special legislation, the Act to ensure the resumption of services in the schools and colleges of the public sector. He let himself be guided by the general interest, but he thereby attacked his electoral base and divided his party.\n\nIn the summer of 1984 the leader of the federal Conservatives, Martin Brian Mulroney, talked about national reconciliation and promised to bring Quebec to the constitutional table if his party were elected. L\u00e9vesque saw this overture as the longed-for opportunity to get rid of the hated federal Liberals and especially as a chance to recover from his constitutional setback of November 1981. Now that the referendum had been lost, he saw no point in discussing sovereignty, at least for a while. It was still on the horizon, but would not be an issue in the next election, expected to be held in a year. He was ready to take the \u201cbeau risque\u201d (to borrow an expression from the title of a novel by Fran\u00e7ois Hertel) of federalism, about which he made the following comment in November 1984, in D\u00e9fis qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a PQ periodical published in Montreal: \u201cIt must be noted, after all, that we are not in a gulag!\u201d And so L\u00e9vesque accepted the outstretched hand of Mulroney, who had become prime minister on 4 September, and he declared a moratorium on the issue of sovereignty, which tore his government apart. In November 1984 two of the original warhorses, the most influential ministers in the cabinet, Parizeau and Laurin, resigned. Convinced that their leader had lost faith in the cause, five other ministers \u2013 Gilbert Paquette, Denise Leblanc-Bantey, Jacques L\u00e9onard, Louise Harel, and Denis Lazure, and two backbenchers \u2013 Pierre de Bellefeuille and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Proulx \u2013 followed suit.\n\nThese defections undermined L\u00e9vesque\u2019s authority and led him to behave erratically. He fell into a depression. In January 1985, in severe psychological distress, he had to be hospitalized against his will, in the interests of state security. The man was ill. At 62 years of age and worn out, he appeared to the youngest of his ministers and mnas, who spent the entire spring openly challenging his leadership, to be finished. L\u00e9vesque would cling to power until June. On 20 March he took advantage of the spring session to put a motion recognizing the rights of aboriginals through the National Assembly. This issue had been dear to him since the 1960s, and once he became premier he had made it his personal responsibility. Six years earlier, in December 1978, he had created a historic precedent by convening a meeting in Quebec City between the provincial government and the chiefs and representatives of 40 Quebec bands, with a view to initiating a rapprochement between whites and native people.\n\nThe L\u00e9vesque government\u2019s major laws were passed mainly during his first term of office. Among the most important ones from the second term were minister Jean Garon\u2019s Bill 48, which affirmed Quebec\u2019s full sovereignty over the management of fishing in the Gulf of St Lawrence, and Bill 37, which defined a new framework for negotiations in the public sector, so that the province would not be on the brink of the abyss every time government employees renewed their collective agreements. These bills were passed in June 1984 and June 1985 respectively.\n\nOn 20 June 1985, 25 years after his political debut in the Lesage government, L\u00e9vesque made up his mind to write his letter of resignation as leader of the PQ. On the same day he sent out to the media a straightforward communiqu\u00e9 announcing his resignation as premier. On 29 September, two days after the painful farewell celebration the party held for him, he gave up his riding of Taillon. He was now just an ordinary citizen. His young successor, Pierre Marc Johnson, would not have a long career, either as premier or as leader of the PQ. In the election of December 1985 he was defeated by Bourassa. Two years later, isolated within a party that answered more and more to the Parizeau faction, he too would have to step down as leader. Two short years of retirement gave L\u00e9vesque just the time he needed to take up journalism again and to publish his memoirs, whose success was balm to his wounds. On 1 Nov. 1987 his heart, which he had always refused to take care of, suffered a devastating coronary. He was 65 years old. Everywhere in Quebec, and even in English Canada, there was unanimous agreement: a giant of Canadian and Quebec politics had died. From Davis, the former premier of Ontario, who had clashed with him, to Edgar Peter Lougheed, the former premier of Alberta, who admired him, all recognized that his actions and his challenge to federalism had forced English Canada to look at Quebec\u2019s place in the federation in a new light. More than that, as some historians have pointed out, he had contributed, with his rival Trudeau, to a complete redefinition of the Canadian political landscape. But by an irony of history, in shaking up Canada he had also strengthened it, as Romanow, Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s alter ego during the fateful night of the long knives, pointed out.\n\nThe legacy of L\u00e9vesque is diverse and associated with many great moments in the history of Quebec. As a journalist with Radio-Canada, he helped stir the interest of Quebec society in the great international questions, in a way broadening its horizons. Having become a politician during the Quiet Revolution, he was one of the driving forces for the changes that enabled Quebec to modernize and become open to the world. He made new standards an integral part of politics \u2013 honest politics \u2013 not only as a minister in Lesage\u2019s cabinet, but as premier. He rid French-speaking Quebecers of their complexes and gave them confidence in their ability by nationalizing electricity and building Hydro-Quebec.\n\nIn founding the PQ, L\u00e9vesque created a new and different party, fully democratic, unlike most others, and it aroused astonishment outside the province. In doing so, he introduced a concern for democracy into the pro-independence movement, and formulated a definition of Quebec nationalism that was less chauvinistic, less inward looking, as well as more dynamic and aggressive. As an indirect result, he brought about an affirmation of Canadian nationalism that was more open to the reality of Quebec and more coherent. With Bill 101, he gave French the priority in Quebec to which it was entitled, while at the same time protecting the educational rights of the minority. And finally, in the realm of political theory, he conceived the notion of sovereignty-association, which was gradually accepted, bringing a strong political credibility to the idea of Quebec independence.\n\nRen\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque did not achieve his grand dream of giving his compatriots a new homeland. This was no doubt the most striking failure of his political career. He lost the referendum of May 1980, had a constitution forced on him, and gave up the traditional right of veto, three events that weakened Quebec\u2019s political position within confederation. At the time of his death, Quebecers were still Canadians, but the francophone majority no longer saw themselves as the inconsequential people of legend, inward looking and speaking a disparaged and marginalized language. As a journalist, a Liberal cabinet minister, and a sovereignist premier, by his words and deeds he liberated French-speaking Quebecers from their feeling of inferiority and gave them a shot of adrenaline, so that some day, as he predicted on the evening of his defeat in the referendum, they would keep their rendezvous with history. \u201cI never thought I could be so proud to be Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as I am this evening.\u2026 We are not an insignificant people. We are perhaps something like a great people.\u201d These famous words, spoken off the cuff in the euphoria of his victory on 15 Nov. 1976, revealed his political commitment, enabling those at the bottom who spoke French to move up in society, as his relatives and close friends recalled. But at the same time, he noted in his memoirs that Quebecers were probably the only people to have \u201crefused such a chance to acquire full power over themselves peacefully and democratically.\u201d Nonetheless, the epitaph written for him by poet F\u00e9lix Leclerc gives a meaning to his legacy, which is not measured solely in reforms and laws. \u201cThe first page of the true, beautiful history of Quebec has just ended.\u2026 From now on, he belongs on the short list of the liberators of people.\u201d\n\nPierre Godin"}]}
