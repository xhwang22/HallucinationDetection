Her first book, Family, Dependence, and the Origins of the Welfare State: Britain and France, 1914\u20131945 (Cambridge University Press,1993), showed how welfare states were shaped by and came to promote particular family relations and gender roles. Her more recent work has addressed the involvement of British women in colonial policymaking. In this and other work, Pedersen has sought to specify the complex processes through which political and social change happens.\n\nWhile researching various aspects of British politics between the two world wars, Pedersen often found herself encountering the figure of Eleanor Rathbone, the feminist and social reformer. Rathbone led the movement for family allowances; she also became an important parliamentary defender of women\u2019s interests, a prominent critic of appeasement, and an advocate for refugees from Franco\u2019s Spain and Hitler\u2019s Germany. Pedersen will spend her year at the Institute completing a biography of this visionary feminist thinker and politician.\n\nPedersen earned her BA in social studies and her PhD in history from Harvard University. Her work has received awards from the Social Science History Association, the North American Conference on British Studies, and the Journal of Modern History.

Launched in 2015 by Peter Mandler, Guy Ortolano, and Susan Pedersen the network now encompasses eight faculty members and almost twenty graduate students across the three institutions. The following is a Q&A with Pedersen about the NYCTC, which just launched a new website:\n\nHow did the idea for the NYCTC emerge? What need is this collaborative meeting within the field of British History?\n\nSP: Modern British history is, in any American graduate program, a \u201csmall field.\u201d The Columbia History Department will admit at most one or two such graduate students each year. Courses for PhD students are often, then, thematic or interdisciplinary, which allows for a critical mass. Those courses are great, and we teach a lot of them at Columbia. But students in specific fields like British history do also need to master \u2013 and really get inside \u2013 the rich scholarship and debates within their own field, and to interact with other graduate students working in this area. The British historian at NYU, Guy Ortolano, and I thus began coordinating our teaching some years ago so that students at the two institutions could work with both of us; we then got more ambitious and approached Peter Mandler at Cambridge to ask whether he and his colleagues would like to build a collaboration among his students and ours. We\u2019ve now held three workshops \u2013 two in New York and one in Cambridge \u2013 at which graduate students present their work, discuss common challenges around research or teaching, and just get to know the different academic cultures of the US and the UK a bit better. We\u2019re also now running a common book group, in which some eight Cambridge faculty and students and eight New York faculty and students meet to discuss new works in the field through videoconferencing.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the NYCTC and the North American Conference on British Studies (NACBS)?\n\nSP: NYCTC is just one of a number of really heartening developments in the British history field. Another is that the NACBS \u2013 which is the big annual meeting for the whole field \u2013 has also become both more international (with lots of UK and other participants) and more committed to graduate students. NACBS just started funding pre-dissertation research grants, and it now has two workshops for graduate students and early career scholars and an opening reception for graduate students at each conference. When I first went to NACBS, decades ago, it was frankly a pretty stodgy conference: it\u2019s now much more interesting and open.\n\nHow would you describe the range of research interests that NYCTC faculty and students are engaged in?\n\nSP: There\u2019s quite a range, both among the faculty and the graduate students! Some of us are political or international or imperial historians; some are social historians; some are working on gender or the history of emotions. There are PhD projects on the National Health Service; on British financial policy and on the oil industry; on British ballet as a tool of cultural diplomacy; on gender relations in higher education; on the emergence of nutrition as a field of expertise; on cultural anxieties around urbanism; on the politics of the New Left; and a host of others. You can see some of the projects here: https://nyctc.history.columbia.edu/people/graduate-students/\n\nWhat impact do you hope that the NYCTC will have on the British studies community at Columbia and on the wider community of scholars interested in 20th-Century British History?\n\nSP: We\u2019ve been lucky to have a recent Berkeley PhD, Sam Wetherell, join the Columbia history department as Lecturer in Discipline and a member of this collaboration. He\u2019s already organized a discussion in the History department on Brexit, and is working with the Heyman Center on some other events. We\u2019ve also joined other departments or institutions for an event during each workshop: at the first workshop, it was a discussion with English department faculty and graduate students about different ways to read and use diaries, letters, and other personal sources; at the last workshop, we got together with faculty and students from Rutgers and other institutions to talk about \u201cthe Victorians and the Moderns.\u201d We\u2019re a small operation, but we hope to do more such things.\n\nSusan Pedersen is Gouverneur Morris Professor of British History at Columbia University.

The panel was organized by Carla Hesse and also included talks by Jennifer Morgan and Mrinalini Sinha. This text has been edited but appears very largely as it was given.\n\nI want to thank all of you for coming out at 7:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning of a busy conference. When I see the group gathered here today, I understand why feminist history has accomplished all that it has. And this is because, after we feminists do our share of interviewing and being interviewed, speaking, commenting and debating, schmoozing, hobnobbing, and finding time to see old friends (not to mention sometimes getting up with small children), we wake up at the crack of dawn to talk about the future of feminist history. Confronted by such dedication, I am tempted to propose one possible future for feminist history: let the women sleep in! Next year, let's let the men get up at dawn to discuss gender and history. But they won't and don't, and we will and do\u2014and that is our strength and also our cross.\n\nLet me turn, then, to my task, which is to discuss the future of feminist history. But surely this is an impossible\u2014and almost antifeminist\u2014charge. For the topic seems to invite the kind of magisterial summarizing and confident prediction that women's history\u2014with its attention to the unexpected and contingent, the marginal and suppressed\u2014was virtually developed against. But as I reflected further on this challenge, I began to find it an extraordinarily useful one, for it forced me to think outside my usual range of topics and against the historian's particularist grain. After all, there is a value in magisterial pronouncements and sweeping generalizations, if only because they can serve as stimuli to debate. So, instead of making the true but unhelpful point that the future of feminist history is likely to be messy, unfathomable, contentious and yet productive, let me take advantage of this chance to be magisterial and predictive, and put forward my own singular but considered views. And in this vein, I am drawn to make three main points about our field: one celebratory, one anxious, and one programmatic.\n\nA Transformative Presence\n\nFirst and most fundamentally, I want to acknowledge and celebrate the degree to which feminist history has come to be\u2014and, I believe, will continue to be\u2014a powerful and transformative presence in the academy. Whatever our individual criticisms of various approaches and fields\u2014and there is no more critical and self-critical bunch\u2014I think all of us would agree that feminism has utterly transformed historical writing. If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical processes and are not blindly \"natural,\" we can understand why feminist history has always had a dual mission\u2014on the one hand to recover the lives, experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and workings of gender. Moreover, despite our own endless arguments over which of these approaches and tasks is the more significant, the important point is that we have been true to both. And rightly so, for this argument\u2014the argument between \"women's history\" and \"gender history\"\u2014is an argument in which one side continually produces the case for the opposite stance, an argument neither side should ever win. Women's history isn't a stage that we move through as we struggle toward gender history, for gender history itself sends us endlessly back to women. And both inquiries have transformed our historical work and understanding.\n\nThus, works on women have consistently de-essentialized and historicized groups and issues too often trapped in discourses of degeneracy and difference. From Luise White's determination to see Nairobi's prostitutes as entrepreneurs and not victims, to Margot Badran's recovery of a critical feminist voice in Egyptian nationalism, to Nancy Hunt's creative analysis of the ways in which varied cultural practices around maternity in the Belgian Congo shaped colonial relations and populations more broadly, feminist historians have recovered and asserted the significance of women's voices and choices in the past\u2014an effort that cannot possibly be dismissed as \"compensatory history.\" And the payoffs from the turn to gender history have been equally great. Most of the great narratives of modern history\u2014the narratives of industrialization, of class formation, of the construction of welfare states, of the making of nations and empires, of the emergence of democratic politics and the practices of total war\u2014are now seen to have been framed by, based upon, productive of, and narrated through changes in relations between the sexes. This revisionist impulse has gone very far in some fields\u2014there is, for example, no more flourishing subfield in British history today than that devoted to working out the interconnections between the construction of gender identities and the operations of empire\u2014but we find it in almost every field. Think, for example, of Afsaneh Najmabadi's lovely recent study of the ways in which a national panic over the abduction and selling of girls helped to authorize and legitimate the project of Iranian nation-building, of Kristin Hoganson's reading of the Spanish-American war as a project of cultural masculinization, or of Partha Chatterjee's and Mrinalini Sinha's rival accounts of the gendered bases of British imperialism and Indian nationalism.\n\nInstitutional Achievements\n\nNor need our celebration of the impact of feminism on the academy be measured by the flow of books and articles alone. There are also institutional achievements. Not only do most departments now feel that they must teach women's history and (sometimes) even hire specialist women's historians, but also\u2014and this is a quantum leap\u2014they can increasingly imagine hiring someone who works on women or gender not as a \"women's historian\" but rather, say, as a colonial Americanist. Equally important, department members who are responsible for other areas\u2014whether medieval Europe or modern Japan\u2014increasingly feel driven to incorporate material on women into their teaching. Women's and gender history, in other words, may not have achieved its grandest ambition\u2014the ambition to rewrite all of history from the standpoint of gender\u2014but it has accomplished something that I feel to be even more important: it has established itself as one of a relatively small number of approaches and perspectives that are accepted both as legitimate subfields in their own right and as essential components of all national fields. Nor is this position seriously under threat, for both the intellectual imperatives and the emotional and political passions that underpin it are alive and well. Our search to find \"where the women were,\" and to reinterpret the world from their standpoint, will sustain and enrich our profession for a long time to come.\n\nIs all, then, sweetness and light? Here, I want to stop and spend a few minutes voicing an anxiety about two trends within feminist history that I find both exciting and disquieting. I speak, on the one hand, of the increasing attention paid to questions of identity in the study of the formation of individuals and collectivities, and, second, of the turn to what we might call an epistemological approach to the study of relations of power.\n\nContesting Identities\n\nOf course, there are good reasons for both of these moves. The study of women led us ineluctably to the discovery of differences and antagonisms between women, to an awareness of the fact that women often saw other affiliations as more meaningful than those of sex. From this study of division arose, inevitably, the study of contestation among identities, and of the processes through which particular affiliations come to be privileged or powerfully felt. Likewise, the study of gender as a cultural and symbolic system led us inevitably to what Mary Poovey and others have called historical epistemology\u2014that is, to the attempt to understand the production of all those fundamental assumptions and categories that underwrite and sustain particular cultural formations. And if these moves were logical, so too have they had their benefits. The turn to identity, for example, has forced a critical reexamination of\u2014and a moral attention to\u2014a history that feminism has sometimes been slow to acknowledge. Rather than assuming the power of the identity of \"woman,\" we spend more time these days acknowledging and studying women's investment in other cultural practices or markers of difference\u2014in ethnic and racial identities, in relational or family roles, in religious faith and observance. Thus, for example, Susan Grayzel's recent study of women's identities in Britain and France during World War I explores not only the emergence of a feminist pacifism but equally the ways in which many women sought to craft a gendered rhetoric of patriotism and to align the cause of feminism with the cause of war. Likewise, works by feminist historians show us what can be gained by integrating the insights of cultural analysis into studies of social relations: one has only to think of Leora Auslander's brilliant account of the ways in which aesthetic tastes and styles, gender and labor relations, and political forms coalesced and reinforced one another in 18th- and 19th-century France. And one could proliferate such examples.\n\nHistory without Politics?\n\nAnd yet, in spite of the manifest excellence of such work, the turn to identity in the context of a parallel turn toward what we might call a neo-Foucauldian or discursive theory of power has left me somewhat uneasy\u2014or, rather, with the nagging feeling that something has been left out. What might that be? Let me take an example from my own field of British history. At the last annual meeting of the North American Conference on British Studies, there were 25 panels devoted to the modern period. Of these, 11 (or nearly a half) either employed gender as a central analytic concept or were explicitly on men, women, or the family. By contrast, 8 of these 25 panels (or about a third of the total) were on imperial questions. There was, however, an overlap of six between these two groups: six panels, in other words, were on gender and empire. These were, very largely, on identity\u2014on \"imperial masculinity\" or on women's self-understandings and expression in different imperial contexts. They were, I hasten to add, often fascinating presentations: through an enterprising investigation of new sources, they revealed much about their subjects' mental worlds. But this focus on identity and subjectivity seemed to have come at some cost (if only in terms of alternatives foresworn), for what struck me at the time was that, among all these papers on sailors and settlers, missionaries and migrants, I was scarcely able to find one directly concerned with the political processes or social relations of empire\u2014with conquest and governance, population policy, and labor control\u2014all of which, I might add, have everything to do with gender. If a nonhistorian were to have come to this conference, then, she might conclude that the British Empire was nothing more than a great staging ground for the elaboration of \"Britishness,\" in which groups of rather self-absorbed British men and women could experiment with different identities without doing much harm to anyone\u2014a bizarre vision, profoundly one-sided, and oddly reminiscent of an old imperial history also intensely focused on the self-justifications and self-understandings of the colonizing power.\n\nWhy, I wondered, did the conference look this way? Why had politics dropped out? There are, of course, many possible answers to this question, some of which would simply stress shifts in intellectual fashion and the lure of new sources, but one part of any answer must surely focus on the difficulties of studying politics in the context of our preoccupation with systemic cultural analysis. The problem is that the insights that have proven so productive for cultural analysis\u2014insights about the multivalent, collaborative, and web-like nature of power\u2014tend to be less useful for the study of narrower political processes. For, once we assume power is everywhere, it usually turns out to be nowhere very much; if it is analytically directionless, it scarcely needs to be taken into account. Our acceptance, in other words, of the truth that power is everywhere and that the weak, like the strong, play the game of power, has led us away from grasping the other truth that the players are not equal, that even multivalent systems can have internal movements preponderantly in one direction or another, that there are degrees of power, that a middle ground exists between an assumption of total agency and an assumption of total fixity\u2014and that it is on this crucial middle ground that most interesting questions are found and much interesting history happens.\n\nWhat Is to Be Done?\n\nWhat is to be done? I think the problem itself dictates the solution. Let me then argue\u2014and this is my third point\u2014that feminist historians need to bring politics back in, and by this I mean politics less in the broad sense of systemic relations of power than in the narrower sense of that set of negotiations and institutions through which rights and goods are claimed, distributed, and contested. Bringing politics back in will give some much-needed precision to some of the work on identity\u2014allowing us to see, for example, the conditions under which particular racialized or gendered identities can be captured by political movements and mobilized for particular ends. The narrow study of politics also reawakens us to the truth that questions about the degree and form of power are crucial and consequential historical questions, that there is a big difference between the sticks and stones that break our bones and the words that hurt but don't quite kill us. The study of politics, in other words, forces us constantly, and almost against our will, to shift the unit of analysis away from the system and toward the component parts, and to ask questions about processes and outcomes as well as about meanings. Partial such an approach may well be, but it strikes me as a necessary corrective at a moment when systemic analysis and \"thick description,\" rather than causal analysis and the study of change has so much the intellectual upper hand.\n\nBut I want to argue for bringing politics back in for two other reasons as well. We should pay attention to politics, I think, because political history has been one of the last intellectual strongholds of antifeminism, and is only now undergoing a real revision. Thus, in British history, a field in which virtually every worthwhile topic has been done many times over, crucial topics relating to women and politics and gendered studies of politics are still relatively underdeveloped. There is, for example, no book-length study of women's activism in the League of Nations, even though this is where many social reformers cut their teeth; only one recent scholarly work (by Kim Reynolds) on the activities of the political wife, even though political hostesses were crucial power brokers in the era before the emergence of mass parties; and until quite recently relatively little work on the reasons for the long-standing (if now overcome) gender gap in British politics, whereby women disproportionately favor conservatism. Only in the last few years, in work by Alison Light on the affinity between appeasement and domesticity, by Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska and Fiona Grigg on the gendered appeal of conservative penal and economic policies, and by Martin Pugh and David Jarvis on the party's women's organizations, do we get the beginnings of such a gendered history of conservatism. Subjects like these are not trivial, for they help us to understand how some of the core political changes of our time\u2014changes that affected the lives and life chances of millions\u2014happened. These processes, too, were gendered, and they need our attention.\n\nBut there is one final reason I want to argue for attention to politics, and that is because it will help us with our own institutional work and practice. As we trace the historical significance of the partial reform, of the awkward coalition, of the indifferent outcome chosen to preclude the worse, we learn some lessons that may actually help us in the world in which we find ourselves. For\u2014and this brings me back to my first point\u2014as feminist history has swollen into a big and successful wave, it has lifted a lot of individual historian boats. Feminist historians are now on the committees and Council of the American Historical Association, they are deans and university presidents, heads of major granting agencies, tenured professors and department chairs. This group is making or helping to make the decisions about hiring, promotion, and publishing that will affect our profession through the next generation. I don't wish to belittle in any way the struggles of the first generations of feminist historians, who often pursued their visions from marginal positions and against difficult odds, but for a younger generation\u2014my generation\u2014I think it is important to acknowledge that the world has changed. It is no good, anymore, pretending that we are brave outsiders valiantly challenging patriarchal institutions: that is, the institutions may still be patriarchal, but we are right in the middle of them. When we make such claims or play such a role, then, we look\u2014to our graduate students, to younger faculty, to adjuncts sweating it out in poorly paid holding tanks\u2014not merely ridiculous but irresponsible, indulging in some fantasy of romantic opposition at their expense. For, I would argue, there is no power more despotic than the power that hides its face, that operates personally and erratically, that despises process, that will not acknowledge its own place in the hierarchy, that takes refuge\u2014to cite a feminist classic\u2014in the \"tyranny of structurelessness.\" Theories that stress the fluidity and multivalence of power fit too comfortably with such practice to make our attraction to them entirely innocent. My last point, then, is to ask that as we, as feminist historians, take on ever more important roles in the academy, we understand our place in fixed and directional hierarchies of power, and use our position well. This means, among other things, that we think about whether we can place our graduate students before we ask them to carry out our own intellectual agendas; that we diversify our curriculum without operating our own thought police; that we are gracious to those colleagues who don't quite understand what we do but want to be on our side; and, finally, that we not act like hurt parents when a younger generation decides\u2014as it assuredly will\u2014that we got it all wrong, and comes along to chastise and correct us."}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/susan-jane-pedersen", "page_content": "Biography\n\nSue Pederson won a gold medal in both relays at the Mexico Games as the U.S. set a new Olympic record in each.

Reynolds, Aristocratic Women and Political Society in Victorian Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998). The suffrage and feminist movements have their own very large literatures, but women\u2019s involvement in the realm of formal politics has been less well studied.\n\nFor women in local government, the gold standard remains Patricia Hollis, Ladies Elect: Women in English Local Government, 1865\u20131914 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), but there is also a burgeoning literature on women in twentieth-century parliamentary and international politics. \u2018Gendered\u2019 interpretations of British national politics remain exceptional, but for the period of the First World War Women\u2019s Identities at War\n\nand Susan Kingsley Kent, Making Peace: The Reconstruction of Gender in Interwar Britain (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993).\n\nMaurice Cowling, The Impact of Labour, 1920\u20131924: The Beginning of Modern British Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971), p. 3.\n\n\u2018It was closed to those outside, in terms of direct access and influence: it was closed also in that politicians were bound to see more significance in the definite structure of relationships at Westminster, than in their contacts with the world outside.\u2019 Cooke and Vincent , The Governing Passion: Cabinet Government and Party Politics in Britain, 1885\u201386 (Brighton: Harvester Press, 1974), p. 21.\n\nMichael Bentley, \u2018Politics, Doctrine, and Thought\u2019, in Michael Bentley and John Stevenson (eds), High and Low Politics in Modern Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), p. 130.\n\nSee, notably, the festschrift edited by Michael Bentley, Public and Private Doctrine: Essays in British History presented to Maurice Cowling (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), and Bentley\u2019s exemplary, almost anthropological, Lord Salisbury\u2019s World: Conservative Environments in Late-Victorian Britain (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001).\n\nJonathan Parry, Democracy and Religion: Gladstone and the Liberal Party, 1867\u20131875 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 3.\n\nProbably the major difference being the \u2018new\u2019 political historians\u2019 continued, probing engagement with both Marxism and linguistic theory. In a recent essay, for example, Stedman Jones defends his claim that \u2018politics occurs wholly within discourse\u2019 while also offering a trenchant critique of Foucault\u2019s genealogy of modernity as a \u2018bleak dystopian inversion of liberal optimism\u2019 whose appeal can only be explained in light of the twentieth century\u2019s horrors.

Fluttering in front of it (next to the gate for UN employees passing into the complex) are the 193 flags of all members of the United Nations, from founding members like the United States, Great Britain, or France, to newer member-states like South Sudan or Kosovo\u2013all flying at equal heights and equally spaced out along four grand rows.\n\nAnd yet this current arrangement of things in Geneva\u2013and international order writ large\u2013is quite new. The Palais des Nations, today home to meetings for UN organizations, was originally built as the headquarters for the now-defunct League of Nations, the interwar system of international governance that today (where it is remembered) is probably most associated with failing to keep the peace of Versailles and not having the United States of America as a member. Had one flown the flags of the nation-states of the day in front of the Palais following its opening, however, the number of flags would have been much, much smaller, with Africa and Asia barely represented. And as the maps that hang in the elegant Reading Room of the League's Archives (themselves in a wing of the Palais) remind us, most of the world's population then who was not Chinese lived not in nation-states, but in empires\u2013in the British and French Empires, to be specific.\n\nDuring our brief stroll around Geneva and the Palais des Nations, in short, we find traces of two very different international systems of statehood\u2013empires and nation-states\u2013that nonetheless intersect at this particular piece of very pricey real estate above the waves of Lake Geneva. But how could one tell this story in a more specific way? What was the processual glue between the world of empires that the League of Nations belonged to, and the world of normative statehood, political decolonization, and nation-states that we inhabit today? More than that, to what extent was the League of Nations not only captive to, or affected by these shifts in international order, but actually facilitative of those shifts themselves?\n\nThese are just some of the questions treated in Susan Pedersen's recent book, The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015). In it, Pedersen, the James B. Shenton Professor of the Core Curriculum at Columbia University, explores the history of the League of Nation's Permanent Mandates Commission, the body assigned to oversee and monitor territories from Burundi to Baghdad and from Tanganyika to Togo.\n\nWhile most readers' perceptions of the League of Nations may still center around the presumptive \"failure\" of that international organization to prevent war in Europe, Pedersen takes a different tack in The Guardians, focusing on the League of Nations mandates system and its effects on international order during the interwar period. As she shows, following the First World War, new international norms of Wilsonian self-determination\u2013and the Bolsheviks' critique of capitalist war\u2013made it difficult for the victorious British and French Empires simply to swallow territories like ex-Ottoman Iraq, Syria or Palestine, or ex-German territories in Africa or Oceania. Given \"the strenuous conditions of the modern world,\" as Article 22 of the League of Nations' Covenant explained, less developed peoples needed tutelage from the more advanced European powers. Captured German or Ottoman territories would have to be governed according to international and humanitarian norms: managed by the powers that were occupying them at the end of the War, but subject to international oversight in the form of a Permanent Mandates Commission in Geneva (itself staffed mostly by white men from imperialist powers).Mandated territories could be treated as provisionally independent nations (Class A\u2013the Middle Eastern territories), in need of more tutelage but not to be administered as part of the Mandating Powers' colonial territories (Class B\u2013German Africa, other than South West Africa), and territories \"best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory\" (Class C\u2013South West Africa, plus postcolonial Oceania).\n\nYet the question of what, exactly the difference was between a mandated territory and a colony would haunt the system throughout the interwar period. If the Mandates were explicitly something other than colonies, when, exactly, would they be ready for independent statehood, or at the very least open to international competition for goods and services? As the British and French violently suppressed revolts in the Middle East, and the South Africans treated South West Africa more or less like a colony, the legitimacy of the system grew shakier. And when Germany was admitted into the League of Nations in 1926, Berlin joined a chorus of protestors and petitioners from around the world who claimed self-government as preferable to trusteeship. In some cases, like that of Iraq, the Mandating Powers found that the \"internationalization\" of their administration of these post-colonial territories so burdensome that declaring them fit for statehood (as happened to Iraq in 1932) and \"merely\" contenting oneself with economic and military hegemony over a pliant client state was preferable to facing nagging charges in Geneva.\n\nDecolonization avant la lettre it was not: the French and British Empires remained in control of their colonial holdings, and the entrance of states like Iraq into the League of Nations on British terms was an affair quite different from the mass entry of former British and French colonies into the UN's General Assembly decades later. But the mandates system\u2013designed as an alternative to cutthroat imperialistic competition and expansion\u2013had ironically opened up new concepts of normative statehood that would take on a life of their own. A system originally designed to help colonial empire collaborate over the spoils of war became the site of new kinds of claims for government after empire. Replete with both conservative defenders of norms of civilization and tutelage, like Frederick Lugard, and the thousands of petitioners from Samoa to Palestine who sought to claim some version of self-government for themselves, The Guardians presents not only a rich tableau of the new kinds of international actors that sprung up during the interwar years; more than that, it uncovers a hitherto-hidden story of the battle over international norms about sovereignty and statehood that continue, from South Sudan to Kosovo to Ukraine, to play a fundamental role in international politics today.\n\nThe Toynbee Prize Foundation's Executive Director, Timothy Nunan, was fortunate to have the chance to sit down with Professor Pedersen during a very hot summer day in Berlin and to discuss her path to writing The Guardians, some of the key findings of her work, and her intellectual plans for the near future.\n\n\u2022\n\nTN: Typically in these interviews, we begin with discussing your road to the project, before going more substantively into some of the arguments you present. If I might ask, then, how did you become interested in the League of Nations?\n\nSP: It's true that looking back on it now, I'm struck by what a huge project it was. So how did I come to take on something of this size? I had gotten interested in the League of Nations' archives out of my last project, which was a biography of the British social reformer and feminist Eleanor Rathbone. Among many causes, Rathbone was involved with the Social Section of the League, which dealt with child welfare and trafficking, and which was headed by Dame Rachel Crowdy, who oversaw British voluntary nursing in the First World War. Crowdy was the only woman appointed head of a League section in the Secretariat in Geneva. And she was very clever, in the way that she set up her section.\n\nTN: At a time that we still have this very bourgeois, gentlemanly, and, obviously, male-dominated Geneva, though, right?\n\nSP: That's right. Crowdy did want to integrate women into the apparatus of the League, but she understood it would be hard to do so. A lot of people working in the Secretariat came from the diplomatic services, which did not admit women, and committees also tended to be composed of government representatives, largely men. But Crowdy very imaginatively gave voluntary organizations working in particular fields the right to appoint experts or \"assessors\" for various committees. This gave a statutory role to what we would now call NGOs, and also brought in women, including Rathbone. So I first went to Geneva, ages and ages ago, tracking Eleanor Rathbone.\n\nEven at that stage, I found the League of Nations' archive itself fascinating. You could see the conflicts between international activists and governments. You could see how governments were forced into negotiation. You could see how issues raised in Geneva became more public and visible.\n\nDame Rachel Crowdy, one of the figures who brought Susan Pederson tothe League of Nations Archives in the first place\n\nTN: So you had some familiarity with the archives out of your earlier work. Yet child welfare and mandates seem to be rather different. What was it that took you to mandates and these questions of international order more generally?\n\nSP: As I was writing the Rathbone book, I was also researching a set of humanitarian crises in the British Empire. These issues were also taken up by the League. So I went to Geneva, I think for the second time, tracking how governments and humanitarian organizations came into conflict over child slavery in Hong Kong. I discovered, reading the League records and the British colonial office records side by side, that League actions were genuinely affecting British policy. Not that the Colonial Office was simply acceding to League norms; it's more that it was trying protect its own right to set policy. So partly for propaganda reasons, partly to fend off League interference, the British moved to introduce legislation on child slavery.\n\nUncovering that trajectory made me really interested in the dynamic of the League. I wanted to see what impact internationalism had on imperial politics, and I chose to work on mandates as a good place to examine that. I wrote a first piece on three British Mandates for a book I co-edited with Caroline Elkins, and returned to the Geneva archives, I think for the third time, when working on that. I found the research really gripping, but I also knew that the kinds of questions I was asking couldn't really be addressed only through one empire. That's when I decided to take on the whole thing!\n\nTN: Which is a huge territory. Syria and Iraq, Palestine, the islands in Oceania, much of Africa.\n\nSP: Yes, that was the tough decision. But, having started to read quite deeply on different territories under mandate, it became clear to me that while there was a rich historiography on many of them, that work rarely paid much attention to the role of the League. On the other hand, works that did look at the mandates system tended to treat either the African or the Middle East mandates, not both, and rarely the Pacific at all: even Michael Callahan's two very good and detailed books treat only the B African Mandates. But, simply on methodological grounds, it seems clear that to make generalizations about a system as a whole, one has to look at the whole thing. A comparative approach wouldn't work: the territories are too different; there are too many variables.\n\nThat meant I had to write about the whole thing \u2013 all of the Mandated Territories (and there are fourteen of them), and all of the Mandatory Powers (and there are seven of them). To do this work properly, I also thought I would have to look at three levels: the territories, the mandatory power, and the apparatus in Geneva. So that's what I decided to do, but I had to make it manageable in some way. I needed a selection principle. Because I wanted to figure out what difference international oversight made, I \"selected\" those issues involving mandated territories that became of interest to, or blew up in, Geneva.\n\nSo, the heart of the book is a history of how imperialism was made subject to international contestation and international oversight. The work of the Permanent Mandates Commission \u2013 the League body that examined reports, received petitions and investigated crises in the territories \u2013 is really the red thread. The book starts and ends with the members of the Mandates Commission and the issues they dealt with. The driving question of the book is, always, \"what difference did the mandates system make\"?\n\nTN: Perhaps we ought to specify on this phrase of \"what difference did it make\"\u2013when we say this, what difference are we talking about, and to whom?\n\nSP: Right. I should be clear about this. At the time, and even to some extent in scholarly literature, the assumption has been that the system did or should make a difference to the well-being of the people living under mandate. Obviously that's what it claimed to do, but I concluded that was not the central \"difference\". Mandates were not governed as a rule differently or better than colonies; there was much variation. Instead, the real \"difference\" the system made was that it shifted aspects of governance into the international realm \u2013 and that, in turn, had an impact on the international legitimacy of the imperial order and on international norms. We need to understand those international dynamics themselves, and not think of them only in terms of their impact within individual states or territories.\n\nTN: You know, as you mention in the acknowledgments of people like Patricia Clavin, the entire subfield of League studies has really blossomed in the last ten years or so. When you were beginning to spend time in Geneva and meeting other scholars in this field, can you describe how this field of League of Nations studies re-emerged? What were other people's journeys like to the League of Nations as a subject of study? What were the sorts of conversations you had after the day at the archive?\n\nSP: The real answer is that when I started out there weren't many people in the archives! Being kind of nosy by nature, what I did first was just flip back through the register where you signed in to see who was spending serious amounts of time in those archives and what they were working on. I realized scholars were working very hard on the history of international and European regulatory mechanisms \u2013 economics, communications, air traffic, banking, and so forth; there were also lots of people working on international humanitarianism or on the League's handling of particular issues.\n\nHow I did I get to know those people? Well, in 2005 and 2006 I spent a year's leave reading about the League in general, and about mandates in particular. I first thought I might write a single, one-volume, new study of the League as a whole, but that project seemed too enormous. It also wasn't the right time to do it, since so much new work was just coming out.\n\nTN: So, not writing the general history of the League of Nations\u2013you had decided that. What were your initial pieces on, then?\n\nSP: The first piece was \"The Meaning of the Mandate System.\" I published that in Geschichte und Gesellschaft because I thought it was a really good journal and wanted to establish contact with European scholars working on similar questions. So I published that piece, and it sort of died for five years, but then at some point, Geschichte und Gesellschaft starting digitizing, and then I suddenly saw that piece cited everywhere. The second piece was a review essay, \"Back to the League of Nations,\" that I published in the American Historical Review. I wrote this piece because, while I had decided against writing a new history of the League, I wanted to draw attention to the wonderful new work being written on the League. The piece just grew: the AHR had wanted about 5,000 words, and it ended up being 13,000.\n\nTN: 13,000 words?\n\nSP: I know. So I cut and cut, but it was really hard to shorten it. In the end, the AHR published what was, for them, a very long review essay. But that piece was the other vehicle \u2013 besides just reading, and spending time at the League archives \u2013 by which I came into contact with lots of other scholars. There was a weird side to this, because for a while my email inbox became the Meet and Greet space for League researchers. People would write to me asking for practical advice about doing research at the League Archives or about hotels in Geneva. But one of the great benefits was meeting Professor Patricia Clavin at Oxford, who started working on her book on the Economics Section around the same time I started working on mandates. Patricia had also written a piece on transnational government, and some people clearly picked up those two pieces, hers and mine, to discover what was happening in this new field. Patricia was already embedded in a network of scholars of international organizations, among them some wonderful students of Zara Steiner; we also both joined a network of international historians working on the League, the ILO, international development, humanitarianism, scholarly and legal networks. I had the good fortune to meet Corinna Unger, Amalia Ribi, Katharina Rietzler, Daniel Maul, Anne-Isabelle Richard and a whole host of other young international historians.\n\nTN: Corinna will be our next interview for the Global History Forum.\n\nSP: So this little band of us met each summer in Oslo or Bergen or Trondheim, some half dozen so-called \"senior scholars\" and perhaps thirty younger ones. But this was only one of a number of such ventures going on. Patricia, Davide Rodogno at the Geneva Institute, Corinne Pernet and I then began talking about bringing people together for a conference on new work on the League. We held a workshop at Oxford in the summer of 2010 and then the conference itself in Geneva in 2011.\n\nThat's when I realized that something was really happened to this field. We had invited people we knew were working on the League, but then all these other people got in touch with us. People we had never heard of. People who said, \"Here's my paper, I'm working on this, too.\"\n\nSo it ended up being this really big thing. We had as many supplementary papers posted to the website as we had on the actual program, and so many graduate students wanted to come that we ended up organizing a graduate workshop the day before. The Mellon Foundation kindly gave me a small grant to fund American students' participation and give them a bit of time in the League archives, so ten US graduate students working on great projects came. This group included Ananda Burra working on the transition from mandates to trusteeship, Natasha Wheatley working on petitions and international law, Steffen Rimner working on international opium control, Stephen Wertheim working on US internationalism and the League, and a great many others; there were dozens of students from different UK and European institutions as well. Doing that conference was a lot of work, although Davide heroically bore the brunt of it. It was wonderful to see all that energy and particular all those younger scholars, but after that was over, I thought, \"oh my god, I just have to get my book written.\"\n\nSo then I concentrated on writing. Whatever was happening was well and truly launched by then. Now, it seems that every time I turn around, there's another conference on the League or on mandates. There was one on the League's social work shortly after ours, and then one on the League and the UN at the European University Institute, run by graduate students, some of whom had been at the Geneva conference. Just this spring, I went to one on expertise and the mandates in Paris and another on internationalism in Lisbon; I think there was just another in Jerusalem on law and the League \u2013 and that's just a few.\n\nI'm astonished by the speed with which this field has developed; it's also made me feel quite old, since this is really a young person's field. If you pause and think about it, it's obvious why it took off. The League was the predecessor to the United Nations, but it was also the predecessor to the European Union; it was also the incubator of a lot of intergovernmental organizations of crucial importance right now \u2013 the bodies dealing with everything from child trafficking to international public health to refugees to arms. So it makes sense that historians are looking back to recover a kind of genealogy of international negotiation, international regulation, and international activism.\n\nTN: For someone who's come to this subject with the impression of the League as, as primarily a security failure, how would you make the case, or what is the strongest case to be made for important linkages between the League of then and our institutions today?\n\nSP: I personally think the strongest continuity is institutional. The League proliferated international regulatory bodies and non-governmental organizations and networks, and that has changed decisively how we \"work\" globally. There's an obvious diplomatic thread from the League to the European Union too in that the first United States of Europe proposal comes from Aristide Briand in the late 1920s and is worked on at the League, even though it doesn't go very far at this stage. But, as Patricia's book explains, one can see how people in, say, the Economics or Transit and Communications sections are already developing a much more expansive idea of security \u2013 one that includes fostering economic security through economic integration. There are obvious continuities in personnel, too: after all, Jean Monnet is the first French Under Secretary-General of the League. He leaves, of course \u2013 ostensibly to run the family wine business but quite possibly because he was disappointed in the way the organization was developing.\n\nBut the continuity is absolutely there. This is not the way that we think about the League. We do think about it as a security arrangement. But the League took on many other issues, partly because there wasn't another apparatus that had similar capacity. The crucial point isn't that it did so successfully; it is that how it dealt with them ended up setting norms and institutional practices for the future. States and NGOs start orienting their work toward Geneva; a bureaucratic apparatus emerged to facilitate that work.\n\nTN: More broadly, one thing we focus on in these interviews is for graduate students and post-doctoral fellowship, is\u2013when you look back to when you were starting the project, starting the experience, would you have advice for people starting a new project? Obviously, you don't want to pick something that's already a fad, but as you look at your own experience moving from European history to something more explicitly global, was there anything more than a gut feeling, or the archives that gave you the confidence to begin this work and start the movement at the right time?\n\nSP: You know, I've been asked this a few times, and it's a tough question because this book took me ten years and it also required a great deal of travel and, frankly, financial support. It was supported by a lot of research fellowships from different places. I'm very aware of how privileged I was, since I had both the financial support and (having tenure) the time to do this project properly. I don't think this is a practical model for everyone, much less for a dissertation.\n\nBut if I had to offer a bit of advice, I guess I would urge people to pick projects that can be explored through multiple source bases, so as to develop arguments that can withstand what one might call \"perspectival pressure\". Think of the task as not just to dig out the gems a particular archive has to offer, but also to find another source base that throws the biases or character of that first source base into relief. All I'm saying, in a way, is to be aware of the constructed nature of the source base, something postcolonial historians have been telling imperial historians for a long time. But this applies to international history as well.\n\nTake the League Archives, for example. The League Archives are rich, but they're also deceptive, and I don't think that they're a good foundation for a project unless you constantly force them up against other sources. Why is this? Well, first because they're often unrevealing about the internal politics of the organization. With European government archives, you tap into a culture of officials working together, more or less all committed to the national interest, and able to maintain secrecy. The League, however, wasn't like that. Secretariat members were supposed to be loyal to the League alone, but the institution was much too \"leaky\" \u2013 and officials under too much pressure to share information with their own governments \u2013 to keep secrets well.\n\nAs a result, the records have some strategic silences. There's a lot of documentation of public debates, but you don't see much of the kind of internal strategizing about how to handle issues that you see all the time in government archives. I'm speaking of marginalia, right? Marginalia are your best friend in the British Archives: you can see civil servants figuring out how they're going to manage a particular issue. That is very hard to shake down in the Geneva archives. Those conversations happen, but often off the record, and you might be more likely to find traces of them in private papers or national archives than in Geneva.\n\nTN: But what does it mean when you do come back to the Geneva Archives? And what does it mean when one is planning a project?\n\nSP: Well, this means you need some other source base to get some perspective on what you're finding in Geneva. If you don't do that, you'll just mirror the deceptions of the archive. So I always think it's best to pick an issue and then make sure to find what might be called competing archival narratives: state records to check organizational records; personal papers to check the official line; voluntary bodies to see what the officials miss. If one does that, you can take a more circumscribed subject and really open it up.\n\nTN: So, with a project like that, your value-added is not purely in Geneva. It's in this archival grind, the cogs and the gears of, say, Rhodes House, the Bodleian Library, the National Archives, and then Geneva, too.\n\nSP: That's right. And I guess the other important point is to be very careful about what \"the international\" is that you're talking about. It can't be just your particular corner of the world with large claims attached. I don't mean that you can't work on the international effect of local groups, or the way local history is international. That's all great. But you can't let your subject's own self-understanding of the project become your own understanding. This was, for me, why it was so important to capture critical perspectives \u2013 the criticism from nationalists, or the German position \u2013 on the mandates regime: because it kept me from simply replicating Anglo-American or Anglo-French understandings.\n\nTN: Yeah, I wanted to come to this. I agree that narratively, it does work in getting out of this bind of \"the British Empire was international, therefore British history is global history.\" So, thus far our discussion has revolved around the 2000s-era scene. When you were doing the research, was the role of Germany here visible? Not as a wrecker of the system in the 1930s, but as a party that plays a creative role, this kind of creative elasticity?\n\nSP: No, I don't think it was. Patricia was aware of this thread, since she is partly a German historian. For her, and for anyone researching the economic side, Germany comes in all the time. German absence from Geneva doesn't mean that Germany doesn't matter in Geneva: as with the Americans, even their absence structures the debate in the room. When it came to imperial questions, however, people were less aware how important Germany was to the story. One of my main aims in the book was, then, to bridge this divide between a historiography about European security focused on the German problem and a historiography of empire that treats Germany as marginal. I wanted to say: this incredible focus that we've had and continue to have on the German problem is not something separate from this question about imperial order, which is always seen as a Franco-British imperial thing. These two questions come together.\n\nTN: So how did the German focus come into play for you, then?\n\nSP: I think a lot of life is fortuitous. I love doing research, trying to see what's out there by tackling new archives. It was clear to me \u2013 and Michael Callahan rightly picked up on the significance before me \u2013 that Germany was very resentful about the loss of its colonies. Now, I was living in Berlin every summer, essentially because my husband runs the summer program for NYU in Berlin; we also spent a couple of years here with him running the NYU Berlin program and me at the Wissenschaftskolleg or the American Academy. All of a sudden I thought, you know, I'm here: I should start using German archives. My German isn't great, but I can manage [laughs].\n\nTN: This was very much my adventure in Swedish\u2013doing interviews, thank God, in English, but then sifting through NGO archives in Swedish. I remember speaking with Ken Weisbrode last week, whom you cite as one of your early research assistants in the acknowledgements. He was recalling a conversation with [Harvard Professor] Ernest May. Ken said he wished he had a year or two more in some language; Ken would complain he didn't know, say, Italian well enough. And May would ask: \"Have you ever tried?\" And as I think you've accomplished here, you do have to try. You do.\n\nSP: Sure! I mean, we were living here in Mitte, a ten-minute bike ride from the Foreign Ministry Archives. So I thought: I'll just try. It's true that you do need some amount of determination, but even archives where people have said the archivists are unfriendly and unhelpful, that has not been my experience. The archival staff at the German Foreign Ministry was very helpful, and that at the Belgian Colonial Archives, the Archives Africaines, was helpful too. I had been told that the Belgian archives were hard to deal with, but when I told them I'd already seen all the published material they had pulled out for me, and just asked, \"Can I just look at your index and I'll tell you what I want and you can bring it to me,\" they agreed. The chapter in the book on Belgian rule in Rwanda was only possible because they let me see those files. Of course, I made sure not to go into specialist archives, like the Belgian or Namibian archives, until I knew that I knew more about a specific subject than the archivists were likely to know. Usually, I worked up the basic story of some issue that reached Geneva (famine in Rwanda, the Arab Revolt in Palestine, the Bondelswarts rebellion in Namibia, indentured labour in New Guinea, whatever) and then did a deep dive into national or private records.\n\nMaking sense of the German involvement was a bit more complicated than that. There has been good work on Nazi planning for Africa and on German global economic strategies in the interwar period by Dirk van Laak and others. I had begun reading that work, and working my way through the German Foreign Ministry files on the Mandates Commission (which they followed obsessively), and some things fell into place. I started realizing the real difficulty Germany's absence, entrance, exit, and then sniping from outside posed for this organization on every level. It became clear to me that the twin geopolitical struggles of the interwar years, that is the struggle to manage Germany and the struggle to manage imperial relations, were not separate stories. That may be the most significant argument or finding of my work. People have not paid enough attention to how sharp a shock German entry was for the League of Nations and what Berlin's presence meant.\n\nHaving lost its colonies (pictured here in light blue) as a result of the Great War, Berlin proved to be a disruptive and creative influence on the League of Nations Mandates System\n\nTN: There are two separate directions I'd like to go in from this point. One is perhaps more selfish in that it fits with my own interests in Russian and Soviet history. Looking through these files, we've talked about the German entry. But do you see much interest in the Soviet Union, in the Soviet model of national republics and federation? And the second question is, is American hegemony in the Caribbean or Latin America a reference point to these discussions about the imperial framework?\n\nSP: First, I should be honest and say that I'm not sure if I can answer this. There are things I wanted to do but couldn't, given the already excessive size of this project. So, I didn't really look at this. The Soviet line was always that the Mandates were just a fig leaf for imperialism and they didn't want to be involved. The Soviets never wanted a member on the Mandates Commission, for example, unlike Germany. That said, the mandatory powers did worry about Communist subversion all the time, and both Communists and anti-imperialists launched powerful criticisms of the League system and helped build up nationalist or independence movements. The Pan-Africanists, though, were probably more influential than the Communists, although of course groups overlapped.\n\nLet's not forget, though, that for this last period of the League, the period when the USSR joins, the institution is really hobbled. After the German exit and even more after the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, the oversight regime was on autopilot. Until 1934, the reports of the Mandates Commission were discussed in the full League Assembly, which made for a lot of press coverage and debate. But once the Germans left, the PMC's work was kept out of the Assembly and just reviewed by the Council. Some issues exploded anyway. British handling of the Arab Revolt in Palestine, for example, and the PMC's criticisms of that, couldn't be contained.\n\nThe American issue is different. To say that the US was not a member of the League is, well, not quite accurate. It's more that the Americans could act like a member state when they felt like it and not when they didn't. But the Americans were never absent. There were prominent American members of the Secretariat; Prentiss Gilbert, who was US Consul in Geneva, was kept appraised on sensitive issues. American liberals, intellectuals, and philanthropic organizations were also closely involved with League bodies and policies \u2013 David Ekbladh and Katharina Rietzler have written on this. Those ostensible \"non-state\" actors sustained a kind of alternative US foreign policy, with close relations to the League. The Health Section of the League was dependent on American foundations for a good chunk of its budget.\n\nThrough this combination of philanthropy from Carnegie and Rockefeller, and involvement by lawyers, reformers, intellectuals and NGOs, the Americans played an important role in Geneva \u2013 in the committees on drug trafficking, child welfare, economics. The Americans also had a huge influence on the mandates system \u2013 which was, after all, set up on Wilson's insistence. Wilson's colonial advisor George Louis Beer was actually supposed to be the first Director of the Mandates Section in the Secretariat, and the man who took the job when the Americans failed to join, William Rappard, was actually a dual Swiss-US national. Rappard had spent some time as an Instructor in the Government Department at Harvard and kept in close touch with a large US network.\n\nMoreover, when Rappard left the Secretariat to return to academia in 1924, another American policy wonk, Huntington Gilchrist, was brought into the Mandates Section. Gilchrist wasn't formally the Director of the Section \u2013 that went to an Italian for various political reasons \u2013 but Gilchrist played a large role shaping policy and also kept in close touch with American supporters. This was important, because the League leadership was obsessed with the effort to bring the US in. Drummond didn't succeed, but he kept channels very much open, including by sending American secretariat members on speaking tours across the US. Even a fairly low-ranking secretariat member like Mary McGeachy (about whom there's a good biography) ended up meeting and briefing important politicians on trips to the US.\n\nTN: I suppose that I just have one more substantive question about the book, then we'll transition out at the end. We have the Germans, we have this sense of the Mandates being problematic, let's say. But this isn't the same vision of self-determination that we find in the United Nations of, say, the 1960s, of total independence.\n\nSP: Right.\n\nTN: So I was curious: a major focus of the book is an entry point to the visions of self-determination on offer during this period. And reading this book, the figure of Leopoldo Palacios comes up, someone whom you mention as offering a more maximalist vision of where nation-states will be in this world that's still imperial. Could you talk more about his specific vision, or how the maximalist positions of the 1920s and 1930s differ from those of the 1960s or 1970s?\n\nSP: Palacios was the Spanish member of the Mandates Commission, with a background in academia and social reform. He really did think of the mandates system as a vehicle for promoting self-determination. It's important, though, to realize how unusual that was: he was the only member of the Commission, except possibly William Ormsby-Gore, who thought like that. Palacios found the ubiquitous dismissal of nationalists as ungentlemanly and seditious ridiculous. He tended to think \"agitators\" would turn into ordinary politicians if you just put them in office. He had a pragmatic and capacious understanding of politics.\n\nOrmsby-Gore, too, deserves another look. He was the British member of the Mandates Commission before Lugard, and while he served only briefly, he and Rappard really shaped the system. He didn't leave many papers, though, and they're in Aberystwyth, worse luck. When I was at Oxford a couple of years ago, though, I tracked down his correspondence with Lugard and some international reformers, and concluded that he too was quite unusual for his time. He was another rare person among white European politicians who saw the League regime as a roadmap for self-government. He was with the Arab Bureau during the war, and was the British liaison for the Zionist Commission's visit to Palestine in 1918, and was sympathetic to both Jewish and Arab national aspirations. He thought there would be a Jewish state, and would be Arab states, and that all that would happen sooner rather than later.\n\nTN: Regardless of, or because of, British aims?\n\nSP: Well, he thought the British should use the mandates system to build states. Ormsby-Gore wanted an independent Iraqi state, even if it were in some senses a British client state, set up immediately after the war; he also saw no reason why Tanganyika couldn't be an independent African state.\n\nBut he's unusual. For it is impossible to discount how absolutely central racial thought was during this period. That's why Ormsby-Gore was unusual. For whatever reason, and I honestly don't know why, he just pulled back when confronted by arguments \u2013 and they're ubiquitous \u2013 that basically boiled down to: \"these people aren't ready for self-government because they're African.\"\n\nTN: Sure.\n\nSP: He was very interested in development while at the Colonial Office, and thought there was a lot of educational and infrastructural work to be done. But if you look at his speeches, when faced with claims about Africans' inability to govern themselves, he tended to say, \"How do you know?\" He's interesting, he's odd, he's out of sync with his time. Because, commonly, when it came to the Middle East, African and Pacific Mandates, racial language came up over and over. Western Samoa, for example, had a representative structure, a functional economy, near universal literacy: this was clearly a place that could govern itself. It might not be Luxembourg, but still.\n\nBut the Mandates Commission couldn't imagine that. Ormsby-Gore was off the Commission by then, and Palacios was the only member able to see that the Samoan Mau movement wasn't much different from national movements in, say, the Baltic states or the Balkans. Why couldn't the others see this? Why did they insist that the Samoans were simple people led astray by agitators? It's because of race. Take Lugard. He was obsessed with the mixed-race population and thought it inherently degenerate. Only when that racial language is discredited are new possibilities opened up. If anything, I didn't give enough space to the centrality of racial thinking in the book. I have since read Robert Vitalis' book on race and international relations.\n\nTN: On Aramco? The book about Saudi Arabia?\n\nSP: No, this is a book he's writing \u2013 I read it in manuscript \u2013 on the history of the field of international relations in the US (White World Order, Black Power Politics: The Birth of American International Relations, forthcoming from Cornell). He argues, very persuasively, that the field's understandings and purposes were racial and racist from the start. From the outset, the aim was less to manage relations between nations than to manage relations between \u2013 and preserve hierarchies among \u2013 races.\n\nIt also recovers the centrality and importance of the African-American scholars at Howard University as the main critics of this frankly racist field. I found the book really illuminating, because Howard's political scientists and historians are involved in my story from the beginning. Rayford Logan, Alain Locke, and Ralph Bunche all researched and wrote on the mandates system. It's so revealing that as a young man studying political science at Harvard, Bunche chose to write his dissertation on the mandates system \u2013 that is, to compare French colonies with French mandates in order to pin down what difference the League regime made. Locke went to Geneva to research mandates; Bunche went to Europe and West Africa. Of course, Raymond Leslie Buell opened up this question: he was the first to try to see how the mandates system worked on the ground; no-one undertook more ambitious research travels. But Buell was \"Lugardian\" in that he really was most interested in stable and humane imperial government. The African-American scholars kept their eyes fixed on the road to independence.\n\nRalph Bunche\n\nTN: Well, to begin to transition to the end of the interview. Other than trying to stay well-hydrated, what's on your agenda?\n\nSP: What am I doing?\n\nTN: What are you reading, what are you researching. This is obviously a major research project, but are you thinking of what's next? A couple of smaller one-off projects, or something big?\n\nSP: That's a hard question. I've been going back and forth. I'm committed to writing a few small pieces related to this project for conferences, handbooks and so forth, but after that I'm not going to do any more specifically League-related writing. I like to do projects that are really absorbing and new, and this is beginning to feel like a rather crowded field.\n\nSo, what's the next big project? There are some possibilities that did arise out of this book. I've become very interested in Anglo-German scholarly and intellectual contacts between the wars. I'm also drawn to study the Italo-Ethiopian War, because that encapsulates some of the issues about the relationship between the European order and the imperial order that I've dealt with here. And then, you know, I do still think that there should be a new history of the League, although that would need to be a multi-volume collective project. But I don't know if I'll do any of those things.\n\nInstead, I'd like to write a book on the Balfour family and the women's suffrage movement. I think this would be really, really, fun. I'm conceiving of this as, in rough terms, a book about the shift away from dynastic politics to a different kind of politics \u2013 a shift that is seen really well through the women's suffrage movement. There were a lot of women whom I would think of as \"dynastic women\", highly involved in politics because they were born and married into political families; the Balfour women fit into this perfectly. Several of them \u2013 Frances Balfour, Betty Balfour \u2013 were intensely involved in various political causes, including suffrage. Because this was a tight-knit group, they wrote to one another all the time, so it's possible to tell the story of the argument over women's suffrage from the inside. I'm attracted to this subject, too, because I'm interested in history as a craft, and this book would be full of vivid personalities. So that's a possibility. I'd quite like to go back to British history, which is my main field. I'm not really an international historian for life.\n\nTN: Comparative, in other words, but with a strong focus on the British material.\n\nSP: Yes. I'm on leave in the spring [of 2016], and am going to spend part of that time in Edinburgh, with the Balfour papers.\n\nTN: A final quick question. What books are currently on your nightstand, or what are the books that you've read in the last three or four months that have made the biggest impression on you? Especially in the fields of international or global history.\n\nSP: I've actually been returning to British history. I just read Philip Murphy's good book on the use of the monarchy within the British Commonwealth (Monarchy and the End of Empire), and right now I'm reading William Whyte's Redbrick, a history of the civic universities from their founding to today. But in terms of international history, I think the book I found most intellectually stimulating recently is Isabel Hull's A Scrap of Paper: Breaking and Making International Law in the Great War, which I reviewed for the London Review of Books. I think that's a really excellent book. It makes the case for the centrality of international law to arguments and policies during the war, and for the exceptional nature of German doctrines and practices. Hull argues that historians were too quick to adopt the position that everybody trampled on international law during the First World War, all states were culpable, and that we can't therefore make distinctions.\n\nShe says, \"Actually, it's possible to write seriously and comparatively about that question,\" and looks at arguments within Foreign Ministries about international law. She is asking, basically, whether law was treated only as something to be used instrumentally when it suited, or was treated as the context determining what was politically possible. There were, she says, sharp differences among states. All broke international law at some point, but not to the same extent and with the same level of eagerness and comfort. It's an important book.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor the moment, however, the book that both we at the Toynbee Prize Foundation and other audiences are enjoying reading is Susan Pedersen's The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire, out with Oxford University Press.

The Gap in the Bride by Leonard Raven-Hill (1919), from Punch Magazine via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nBooked is a monthly series of Q&As with authors by Dissent contributing editor Timothy Shenk. For this interview, he spoke with Susan Pedersen about her new book The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire (Oxford University Press, 2015).\n\nWorld domination is reserved for supervillains, but global governance is the terrain of bureaucrats. That has been the case since the aftermath of the First World War, when the League of Nations was born. Though little remembered today, the history of the League is now being recovered by a new generation of scholars. The Guardians is the latest, and most impressive, product of this turn. Joining a global scope to deep archival research, Susan Pedersen reveals the process by which a group of supposedly apolitical technocrats at the League helped to create a new kind of international politics and to destroy the imperial order they had set out to protect. But the collapse of empires left behind a world of entrenched inequalities\u2014and that, too, is part of Pedersen\u2019s story.\n\n\u2014Timothy Shenk\n\nTimothy Shenk: If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that most people think of the League\u2019s history (when they think about it at all) as somewhere between tragedy and farce. For a long time, historians tended to share that perspective. But your book is part of a trend in recent scholarship that has taken us, as you put it in an article for the American Historical Review, \u201cBack to the League of Nations.\u201d What has encouraged historians to return to the League, and how has this new work changed our understanding of the organization?\n\nSusan Pedersen: There are lots of reasons why the League is coming back into focus, but I think two are most important. The first is that the uncertainties of our present time rather mirror those of the interwar period. We live in a world that is no longer bipolar, in which the major global power is, frankly, in relative decline, but in which the role that will be played by the coming powers isn\u2019t terribly clear. That\u2019s rather like 1918\u201339. The League was set up to manage the settlement of 1919, but it was too partial, too linked to the victorious allied powers, too tied to the imperial order, and too harmed by the U.S. decision not to join to do that effectively.\n\nThe second reason the League is coming back into focus is that it was the incubator of a lot of the institutions and practices of global governance we live with now. The World Health Organization grew out of the League of Nations Health Organization, UNESCO out of the League\u2019s Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, ECOSOC out of the Economic and Financial Section of the League, and the list goes on. The quiet work of League bureaucrats set many of the frameworks and protocols for today\u2019s global governance.\n\nShenk: You describe The Guardians as a \u201ccomprehensive history of the mandates system\u2014that is, of the League\u2019s effort to manage the imperial order.\u201d What territories was the League called upon to \u201cmanage,\u201d and how did the League end up with this responsibility in the first place?\n\nPedersen: The League didn\u2019t actually govern any territories: it oversaw the administration by the Allied powers of the African and Pacific territories seized from Germany and the formerly Ottoman Middle East. In the Pacific, Japan seized the Caroline, Marshall, and Mariana Islands from Germany, New Zealand took over Western Samoa, and Australia occupied German New Guinea; in Africa, Britain and France occupied and partitioned German Togo and Cameroon, South Africa occupied South West Africa (present-day Namibia), Belgian forces took over Rwanda and Burundi and the British tried, without much success, to subdue German forces in East Africa. At Versailles, Germany had to surrender those territories. All the occupying powers wanted to annex those German colonies, but American opposition and a genuine international revolt against colonial rule across the world made that impossible. Various humanitarian lobbies in Britain had been pressing during the war for new international agreements over colonial rule; Arab nationalists in the Middle East were determined to achieve independence.\n\nSo the mandates system was hammered out in Paris as a compromise from the start. It was designed to grant actual administrative control to the powers who had conquered these territories while affirming a measure of international control. The mandated territories were supposed to be governed in the interests of the local population, so there were various stipulations outlawing slavery and limiting forced labor and other abuses; they were also supposed to be \u201cdeveloped\u201d in the interests of the world as a whole, so all League states were granted equal rights to enter and do business. A Permanent Mandates Commission comprised of so-called \u201cexperts\u201d\u2014most were former colonial officials\u2014was set up to receive reports from the powers administering mandates and was supposed to alert the League Council to any abuses. It took years to set the system up, though. The imperial powers had agreed to League oversight to placate the Americans, and when the United States didn\u2019t join, most transparently hoped the whole plan would just go away. Only some hard work by the League\u2019s officials, and an outcry over South African repression of an uprising in South West Africa, forced the imperial powers to finally agree to comply with the requirements to begin reporting to Geneva.\n\nShenk: The leaders of the mandates system, you write, became \u201cinadvertent architects of a world they had not imagined,\u201d and this question of unintended consequences is one of the book\u2019s preoccupations. What purpose was the mandates system designed to serve, and why did that goal prove so difficult to achieve?\n\nPedersen: The mandates system was clearly set up to stabilize the settlement reached in Paris, and to win agreement to Allied administration of these territories. The oversight regime was supposed to set standards for imperial rule and\u2014through the publicity inherent in the Geneva system\u2014show the world how well the Allies were governing. But publicity cuts two ways. In the system\u2019s early years, populations in South West Africa, Syria, and Western Samoa rose up against their new governors, and the fact that the League had to investigate those uprisings meant that these populations\u2019 grievances were broadcast around the world. Instead of stabilizing the imperial order, the system turned into a mechanism for challenging it.\n\nShenk: The Guardians is filled with memorable figures, but one of the most remarkable is a Samoan named Olaf Nelson. Who was Nelson, and what did his experience reveal about the mandates system?\n\nPedersen: Nelson was the son of a Swedish trader and a high-rank Samoan mother, which meant he was classed as a \u201cEuropean\u201d by Samoa\u2019s German rulers and then by the New Zealanders who took over under League mandate. He was also the main copra trader in Samoa, and one of the islands\u2019 richest men. Nelson identified with both the European and the Samoan population and helped bring the two together in a movement known as the \u201cMau\u201d to demand self-government. Nelson argued, reasonably enough, that the Samoans were perfectly capable of running their own administration, and he also objected to the argument that \u201cEuropeans\u201d and \u201cSamoans\u201d were distinct groups and had to be governed differently.\n\nOne of the most shameful episodes in the history of the mandates regime is the treatment of Nelson. Essentially, the League\u2019s Mandates Commission colluded with the New Zealand administration to paint Nelson as an opportunistic schemer; he was condemned by the Commission and banished from Samoa by the New Zealand administrator. I think this episode shows how profoundly racial thought structured the League system. The members of the Mandates Commission genuinely thought the Samoans\u2014those 90 percent of Samoan men who signed petitions calling for self-government\u2014needed protection and not rights. They were completely bewildered when the Samoans continued to petition the League for self-government after Nelson\u2019s banishment, and even more nonplussed when Samoan women took over running the movement when the male population went into hiding. I think it is this episode that shows most starkly the way a commitment to \u201cprotect\u201d a native population can slide into efforts to make sure it is sufficiently subjected and disempowered to require \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nShenk: Most of the territories the League superintended were former colonies of Germany, but Germany itself did not become a member of the League until 1926. How did Germany\u2019s entry change the League\u2019s approach to international governance?\n\nPedersen: Nothing had a greater impact on the League\u2019s effort to legitimate imperial order than Germany\u2019s entry into the League. This was because Germany ended up playing a completely unexpected role. Everyone knew Germany wanted its colonies back. But in the Weimar period the German Foreign Ministry concluded that goal was unrealistic, and instead decided to insist that the promises made at Versailles\u2014that all the mandated territories should be governed in the interests of the international community and open to all League states\u2014be strictly adhered to. So, entirely unexpectedly, it was Weimar Germany that insisted most strenuously that the imperial powers were not sovereign in the mandated territories, that those territories had to be economically open to all League states, and that they should be made independent as soon as possible. Germany didn\u2019t do this because they were sympathetic to independence movements; in fact, Foreign Ministry officials admitted privately that if they still had colonies they would argue differently. Their view was: if Germany couldn\u2019t have its colonies back, it was in Germany\u2019s interest to make sure that no one else benefited from them either. Even more than the United States, in the Weimar period Germany played the role of the \u201canti-colonial\u201d Great Power.\n\nShenk: As that suggests, debates over sovereignty\u2014that is, over who had ultimate authority\u2014provoked the fiercest disputes in the Mandates Commission. By the end of the 1920s, you write, these clashes had helped produce a new model\u2014a \u201cdecoupling of legal sovereignty and economic control\u201d that prepared the way for our own \u201cworld of normative state sovereignty, even when accompanied by diminished state capacity.\u201d The supposed emancipation of Iraq in 1932, which you say was more like \u201cthe creation of a client state,\u201d provided one template for this approach. What does that history tell us about the shifting meaning of sovereignty?\n\nPedersen: Sovereignty matters: I\u2019m not arguing that it doesn\u2019t. But, as Antony Anghie argued before me, what the League helped to create was a kind of \u201cdamaged\u201d sovereignty: a sovereignty that could be extended to Third World states while preserving significant imperial economic control. The mandates system was far from the only arena in which these unequal bargains were worked out\u2014but the Iraq case is, I think, especially illuminating. The Mandates Commission really didn\u2019t want to approve Britain\u2019s plan for the independence of Iraq in 1932 precisely because they felt that\u2014with British-dominated international conglomerates still controlling Iraq\u2019s oil fields and the RAF controlling its airfields\u2014Iraq couldn\u2019t be said to be \u201ctruly\u201d independent. But Iraqi elites and Iraqi nationalists understood that this was the only \u201cindependence\u201d on offer, and collaborated with the British to induce international agreement. The French and Italians agreed when their share of oil was confirmed. This is a particularly stark example of the neocolonial bargain in formation.\n\nShenk: While I was reading The Guardians, there was another book that kept on popping into my head: Recasting Bourgeois Europe, Charles Maier\u2019s classic study of France, Germany, and Italy in the 1920s. It was published forty years ago, but it\u2019s a masterpiece that\u2019s still very much worth reading today, and it makes a persuasive case for the enduring significance of that period for the world after 1945. Was Recasting a model you had in mind, and, even if not, do you think the comparison tells us something about where historians have moved since that book appeared in 1975?\n\nPedersen: Maier was one of my two dissertation supervisors, and Recasting Bourgeois Europe had a huge influence on my early work on the European welfare state. His influence on The Guardians is less direct, but his commitment to constructing complex models of causation is one I completely share. I think Recasting is prescient, too, in its awareness of the way models of governance spill across national lines and have to be studied in an international context. Economic stabilization after the First World War was a transnational project, and so was imperial stabilization. It\u2019s true that, forty years on, we tend to see different things: anti-colonial activism and protest play a major role in my book; I\u2019m interested in how conflicts outside Europe affect the European order. But Maier too was trying to understand how the global order changed after 1918, and this book is also part of that effort.\n\nShenk: You don\u2019t spend a lot of time on it, but it\u2019s clear that a theory about politics motivates your analysis, and that one of the major influences is Max Weber. The Guardians could even be described as an extended reflection on how legitimation works (or doesn\u2019t). What does seeing the history of the League with this question of legitimacy in mind reveal?\n\nPedersen: It\u2019s true that the mandates system really was an effort at legitimation. But what the system hoped to legitimate was imperial rule\u2014and what I hope to have shown is that the world had so decisively changed by 1918 that that effort was bound to fail. The mandates system legitimated the Versailles settlement in the eyes of Western publics, but most populations under mandate\u2014especially in the Middle East\u2014never accepted that claim.\n\nMax Weber also, of course, offered us a perceptive theory of political leadership, contrasting the \u201cpolitician of ultimate ends\u201d\u2014that is, a politician who is driven exclusively by a particular ethical imperative and refuses to calculate costs\u2014with a \u201cpolitician of responsibility\u201d who understands his or her obligation to think through the consequences of any action in a real-world context. I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t think anyone in the book really lives up to Weber\u2019s quite strenuous ideal of the \u201cpolitician of responsibility,\u201d although some of the League\u2019s officials\u2014notably the Swiss professor William Rappard, who was the first Director of the Mandates Section in the Secretariat and then a member of the Mandates Commission until its demise\u2014comes close. To find such a person, you\u2019d have to go back to my last book and learn about Eleanor Rathbone, Britain\u2019s most effective interwar female politician.\n\nShenk: Another major theme of the book is the importance of bureaucrats. They\u2019re \u201cunglamorous historical actors,\u201d as you note, but they had considerable influence at the League and, through the League, over much of the world. \u201cBureaucracy, more than idealism,\u201d you write, \u201ctamed the demons of power.\u201d What does focusing on the bureaucrats let us see that histories of movements at the grassroots leave out?\n\nPedersen: International bureaucrats are a pretty unusual species of bureaucrat. In national administrations, you have a public sphere of electors and civic organizations and lobbies, and then a realm of government, of which bureaucrats are a part. But in the international arena, bureaucrats are supposed to be loyal to internationally agreed norms and covenants, even though political capacity and power, and to an extent civic activism as well, still reside largely in nation-states. This means bureaucrats play an especially important role in the international arena: they are middlemen, mediating between international ideals and national interests. Most are pragmatists, not idealists; they also are citizens of individual states and always subject to pressure by their governments. But insofar as anyone represents \u201cthe international\u201d in the interwar period, they do. Privately, they have quite a lot of influence, and very occasionally they step outside their supposed \u201cnon-political\u201d role and take public stands.\n\nShenk: The mandates system, of course, eventually collapsed, along with the League of Nations. The assumption of global leadership by the United States, the rise of the Soviet Union as a major power, and the wave of decolonization that swept across the postwar world\u2014all of that marked a profound break from the world the League sought to manage. But you argue that there was more continuity than this picture suggests. What, ultimately, was the legacy of the history you tell here?\n\nPedersen: What I think the mandates system did was establish an arena of debate and struggle over the question of what \u201cindependence\u201d would mean. The norms the League tried to enforce\u2014of the \u201copen door,\u201d of free labor and free trade, of the \u201cnon-sovereignty\u201d of imperial governments\u2014prefigure the implicit contract made during decolonization and help us to understand the world that emerged after 1945. But I think the mandates system shaped not only the content of that postcolonial bargain but also the practices of global politics after 1945. During the League period, both imperial powers and nationalist movements learned to orient their claims toward an international public and international organizations in Geneva. Today, those battles are fought out at the UN. During the League period, a number of imperial powers learned that they could \u201cwin\u201d militarily\u2014in Syria, in South West Africa, in Palestine\u2014but \u201close\u201d diplomatically; they discovered that \u201cstaying on\u201d wasn\u2019t worth the cost. That\u2019s a pattern that was played out on a global scale after 1945. I tend to think the battle for imperial legitimacy was lost in the League period\u2014even if it took the war, and a lot of anti-colonial postwar struggles, to finally bring those lessons home."}, {"url": "https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/people/susan-pedersen", "page_content": "This information is accurate as of the fellowship year indicated for each fellow.\n\nAs a historian, Susan Pedersen has sought to incorporate the insights of gender analysis into the study of European politics.

Fluttering in front of it (next to the gate for UN employees passing into the complex) are the 193 flags of all members of the United Nations, from founding members like the United States, Great Britain, or France, to newer member-states like South Sudan or Kosovo\u2013all flying at equal heights and equally spaced out along four grand rows.\n\nAnd yet this current arrangement of things in Geneva\u2013and international order writ large\u2013is quite new. The Palais des Nations, today home to meetings for UN organizations, was originally built as the headquarters for the now-defunct League of Nations, the interwar system of international governance that today (where it is remembered) is probably most associated with failing to keep the peace of Versailles and not having the United States of America as a member. Had one flown the flags of the nation-states of the day in front of the Palais following its opening, however, the number of flags would have been much, much smaller, with Africa and Asia barely represented. And as the maps that hang in the elegant Reading Room of the League's Archives (themselves in a wing of the Palais) remind us, most of the world's population then who was not Chinese lived not in nation-states, but in empires\u2013in the British and French Empires, to be specific.\n\nDuring our brief stroll around Geneva and the Palais des Nations, in short, we find traces of two very different international systems of statehood\u2013empires and nation-states\u2013that nonetheless intersect at this particular piece of very pricey real estate above the waves of Lake Geneva. But how could one tell this story in a more specific way? What was the processual glue between the world of empires that the League of Nations belonged to, and the world of normative statehood, political decolonization, and nation-states that we inhabit today? More than that, to what extent was the League of Nations not only captive to, or affected by these shifts in international order, but actually facilitative of those shifts themselves?\n\nThese are just some of the questions treated in Susan Pedersen's recent book, The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015). In it, Pedersen, the James B. Shenton Professor of the Core Curriculum at Columbia University, explores the history of the League of Nation's Permanent Mandates Commission, the body assigned to oversee and monitor territories from Burundi to Baghdad and from Tanganyika to Togo.\n\nWhile most readers' perceptions of the League of Nations may still center around the presumptive \"failure\" of that international organization to prevent war in Europe, Pedersen takes a different tack in The Guardians, focusing on the League of Nations mandates system and its effects on international order during the interwar period. As she shows, following the First World War, new international norms of Wilsonian self-determination\u2013and the Bolsheviks' critique of capitalist war\u2013made it difficult for the victorious British and French Empires simply to swallow territories like ex-Ottoman Iraq, Syria or Palestine, or ex-German territories in Africa or Oceania. Given \"the strenuous conditions of the modern world,\" as Article 22 of the League of Nations' Covenant explained, less developed peoples needed tutelage from the more advanced European powers. Captured German or Ottoman territories would have to be governed according to international and humanitarian norms: managed by the powers that were occupying them at the end of the War, but subject to international oversight in the form of a Permanent Mandates Commission in Geneva (itself staffed mostly by white men from imperialist powers).Mandated territories could be treated as provisionally independent nations (Class A\u2013the Middle Eastern territories), in need of more tutelage but not to be administered as part of the Mandating Powers' colonial territories (Class B\u2013German Africa, other than South West Africa), and territories \"best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory\" (Class C\u2013South West Africa, plus postcolonial Oceania).\n\nYet the question of what, exactly the difference was between a mandated territory and a colony would haunt the system throughout the interwar period. If the Mandates were explicitly something other than colonies, when, exactly, would they be ready for independent statehood, or at the very least open to international competition for goods and services? As the British and French violently suppressed revolts in the Middle East, and the South Africans treated South West Africa more or less like a colony, the legitimacy of the system grew shakier. And when Germany was admitted into the League of Nations in 1926, Berlin joined a chorus of protestors and petitioners from around the world who claimed self-government as preferable to trusteeship. In some cases, like that of Iraq, the Mandating Powers found that the \"internationalization\" of their administration of these post-colonial territories so burdensome that declaring them fit for statehood (as happened to Iraq in 1932) and \"merely\" contenting oneself with economic and military hegemony over a pliant client state was preferable to facing nagging charges in Geneva.\n\nDecolonization avant la lettre it was not: the French and British Empires remained in control of their colonial holdings, and the entrance of states like Iraq into the League of Nations on British terms was an affair quite different from the mass entry of former British and French colonies into the UN's General Assembly decades later. But the mandates system\u2013designed as an alternative to cutthroat imperialistic competition and expansion\u2013had ironically opened up new concepts of normative statehood that would take on a life of their own. A system originally designed to help colonial empire collaborate over the spoils of war became the site of new kinds of claims for government after empire. Replete with both conservative defenders of norms of civilization and tutelage, like Frederick Lugard, and the thousands of petitioners from Samoa to Palestine who sought to claim some version of self-government for themselves, The Guardians presents not only a rich tableau of the new kinds of international actors that sprung up during the interwar years; more than that, it uncovers a hitherto-hidden story of the battle over international norms about sovereignty and statehood that continue, from South Sudan to Kosovo to Ukraine, to play a fundamental role in international politics today.\n\nThe Toynbee Prize Foundation's Executive Director, Timothy Nunan, was fortunate to have the chance to sit down with Professor Pedersen during a very hot summer day in Berlin and to discuss her path to writing The Guardians, some of the key findings of her work, and her intellectual plans for the near future.\n\n\u2022\n\nTN: Typically in these interviews, we begin with discussing your road to the project, before going more substantively into some of the arguments you present. If I might ask, then, how did you become interested in the League of Nations?\n\nSP: It's true that looking back on it now, I'm struck by what a huge project it was. So how did I come to take on something of this size? I had gotten interested in the League of Nations' archives out of my last project, which was a biography of the British social reformer and feminist Eleanor Rathbone. Among many causes, Rathbone was involved with the Social Section of the League, which dealt with child welfare and trafficking, and which was headed by Dame Rachel Crowdy, who oversaw British voluntary nursing in the First World War. Crowdy was the only woman appointed head of a League section in the Secretariat in Geneva. And she was very clever, in the way that she set up her section.\n\nTN: At a time that we still have this very bourgeois, gentlemanly, and, obviously, male-dominated Geneva, though, right?\n\nSP: That's right. Crowdy did want to integrate women into the apparatus of the League, but she understood it would be hard to do so. A lot of people working in the Secretariat came from the diplomatic services, which did not admit women, and committees also tended to be composed of government representatives, largely men. But Crowdy very imaginatively gave voluntary organizations working in particular fields the right to appoint experts or \"assessors\" for various committees. This gave a statutory role to what we would now call NGOs, and also brought in women, including Rathbone. So I first went to Geneva, ages and ages ago, tracking Eleanor Rathbone.\n\nEven at that stage, I found the League of Nations' archive itself fascinating. You could see the conflicts between international activists and governments. You could see how governments were forced into negotiation. You could see how issues raised in Geneva became more public and visible.\n\nDame Rachel Crowdy, one of the figures who brought Susan Pederson tothe League of Nations Archives in the first place\n\nTN: So you had some familiarity with the archives out of your earlier work. Yet child welfare and mandates seem to be rather different. What was it that took you to mandates and these questions of international order more generally?\n\nSP: As I was writing the Rathbone book, I was also researching a set of humanitarian crises in the British Empire. These issues were also taken up by the League. So I went to Geneva, I think for the second time, tracking how governments and humanitarian organizations came into conflict over child slavery in Hong Kong. I discovered, reading the League records and the British colonial office records side by side, that League actions were genuinely affecting British policy. Not that the Colonial Office was simply acceding to League norms; it's more that it was trying protect its own right to set policy. So partly for propaganda reasons, partly to fend off League interference, the British moved to introduce legislation on child slavery.\n\nUncovering that trajectory made me really interested in the dynamic of the League. I wanted to see what impact internationalism had on imperial politics, and I chose to work on mandates as a good place to examine that. I wrote a first piece on three British Mandates for a book I co-edited with Caroline Elkins, and returned to the Geneva archives, I think for the third time, when working on that. I found the research really gripping, but I also knew that the kinds of questions I was asking couldn't really be addressed only through one empire. That's when I decided to take on the whole thing!\n\nTN: Which is a huge territory. Syria and Iraq, Palestine, the islands in Oceania, much of Africa.\n\nSP: Yes, that was the tough decision. But, having started to read quite deeply on different territories under mandate, it became clear to me that while there was a rich historiography on many of them, that work rarely paid much attention to the role of the League. On the other hand, works that did look at the mandates system tended to treat either the African or the Middle East mandates, not both, and rarely the Pacific at all: even Michael Callahan's two very good and detailed books treat only the B African Mandates. But, simply on methodological grounds, it seems clear that to make generalizations about a system as a whole, one has to look at the whole thing. A comparative approach wouldn't work: the territories are too different; there are too many variables.\n\nThat meant I had to write about the whole thing \u2013 all of the Mandated Territories (and there are fourteen of them), and all of the Mandatory Powers (and there are seven of them). To do this work properly, I also thought I would have to look at three levels: the territories, the mandatory power, and the apparatus in Geneva. So that's what I decided to do, but I had to make it manageable in some way. I needed a selection principle. Because I wanted to figure out what difference international oversight made, I \"selected\" those issues involving mandated territories that became of interest to, or blew up in, Geneva.\n\nSo, the heart of the book is a history of how imperialism was made subject to international contestation and international oversight. The work of the Permanent Mandates Commission \u2013 the League body that examined reports, received petitions and investigated crises in the territories \u2013 is really the red thread. The book starts and ends with the members of the Mandates Commission and the issues they dealt with. The driving question of the book is, always, \"what difference did the mandates system make\"?\n\nTN: Perhaps we ought to specify on this phrase of \"what difference did it make\"\u2013when we say this, what difference are we talking about, and to whom?\n\nSP: Right. I should be clear about this. At the time, and even to some extent in scholarly literature, the assumption has been that the system did or should make a difference to the well-being of the people living under mandate. Obviously that's what it claimed to do, but I concluded that was not the central \"difference\". Mandates were not governed as a rule differently or better than colonies; there was much variation. Instead, the real \"difference\" the system made was that it shifted aspects of governance into the international realm \u2013 and that, in turn, had an impact on the international legitimacy of the imperial order and on international norms. We need to understand those international dynamics themselves, and not think of them only in terms of their impact within individual states or territories.\n\nTN: You know, as you mention in the acknowledgments of people like Patricia Clavin, the entire subfield of League studies has really blossomed in the last ten years or so. When you were beginning to spend time in Geneva and meeting other scholars in this field, can you describe how this field of League of Nations studies re-emerged? What were other people's journeys like to the League of Nations as a subject of study? What were the sorts of conversations you had after the day at the archive?\n\nSP: The real answer is that when I started out there weren't many people in the archives! Being kind of nosy by nature, what I did first was just flip back through the register where you signed in to see who was spending serious amounts of time in those archives and what they were working on. I realized scholars were working very hard on the history of international and European regulatory mechanisms \u2013 economics, communications, air traffic, banking, and so forth; there were also lots of people working on international humanitarianism or on the League's handling of particular issues.\n\nHow I did I get to know those people? Well, in 2005 and 2006 I spent a year's leave reading about the League in general, and about mandates in particular. I first thought I might write a single, one-volume, new study of the League as a whole, but that project seemed too enormous. It also wasn't the right time to do it, since so much new work was just coming out.\n\nTN: So, not writing the general history of the League of Nations\u2013you had decided that. What were your initial pieces on, then?\n\nSP: The first piece was \"The Meaning of the Mandate System.\" I published that in Geschichte und Gesellschaft because I thought it was a really good journal and wanted to establish contact with European scholars working on similar questions. So I published that piece, and it sort of died for five years, but then at some point, Geschichte und Gesellschaft starting digitizing, and then I suddenly saw that piece cited everywhere. The second piece was a review essay, \"Back to the League of Nations,\" that I published in the American Historical Review. I wrote this piece because, while I had decided against writing a new history of the League, I wanted to draw attention to the wonderful new work being written on the League. The piece just grew: the AHR had wanted about 5,000 words, and it ended up being 13,000.\n\nTN: 13,000 words?\n\nSP: I know. So I cut and cut, but it was really hard to shorten it. In the end, the AHR published what was, for them, a very long review essay. But that piece was the other vehicle \u2013 besides just reading, and spending time at the League archives \u2013 by which I came into contact with lots of other scholars. There was a weird side to this, because for a while my email inbox became the Meet and Greet space for League researchers. People would write to me asking for practical advice about doing research at the League Archives or about hotels in Geneva. But one of the great benefits was meeting Professor Patricia Clavin at Oxford, who started working on her book on the Economics Section around the same time I started working on mandates. Patricia had also written a piece on transnational government, and some people clearly picked up those two pieces, hers and mine, to discover what was happening in this new field. Patricia was already embedded in a network of scholars of international organizations, among them some wonderful students of Zara Steiner; we also both joined a network of international historians working on the League, the ILO, international development, humanitarianism, scholarly and legal networks. I had the good fortune to meet Corinna Unger, Amalia Ribi, Katharina Rietzler, Daniel Maul, Anne-Isabelle Richard and a whole host of other young international historians.\n\nTN: Corinna will be our next interview for the Global History Forum.\n\nSP: So this little band of us met each summer in Oslo or Bergen or Trondheim, some half dozen so-called \"senior scholars\" and perhaps thirty younger ones. But this was only one of a number of such ventures going on. Patricia, Davide Rodogno at the Geneva Institute, Corinne Pernet and I then began talking about bringing people together for a conference on new work on the League. We held a workshop at Oxford in the summer of 2010 and then the conference itself in Geneva in 2011.\n\nThat's when I realized that something was really happened to this field. We had invited people we knew were working on the League, but then all these other people got in touch with us. People we had never heard of. People who said, \"Here's my paper, I'm working on this, too.\"\n\nSo it ended up being this really big thing. We had as many supplementary papers posted to the website as we had on the actual program, and so many graduate students wanted to come that we ended up organizing a graduate workshop the day before. The Mellon Foundation kindly gave me a small grant to fund American students' participation and give them a bit of time in the League archives, so ten US graduate students working on great projects came. This group included Ananda Burra working on the transition from mandates to trusteeship, Natasha Wheatley working on petitions and international law, Steffen Rimner working on international opium control, Stephen Wertheim working on US internationalism and the League, and a great many others; there were dozens of students from different UK and European institutions as well. Doing that conference was a lot of work, although Davide heroically bore the brunt of it. It was wonderful to see all that energy and particular all those younger scholars, but after that was over, I thought, \"oh my god, I just have to get my book written.\"\n\nSo then I concentrated on writing. Whatever was happening was well and truly launched by then. Now, it seems that every time I turn around, there's another conference on the League or on mandates. There was one on the League's social work shortly after ours, and then one on the League and the UN at the European University Institute, run by graduate students, some of whom had been at the Geneva conference. Just this spring, I went to one on expertise and the mandates in Paris and another on internationalism in Lisbon; I think there was just another in Jerusalem on law and the League \u2013 and that's just a few.\n\nI'm astonished by the speed with which this field has developed; it's also made me feel quite old, since this is really a young person's field. If you pause and think about it, it's obvious why it took off. The League was the predecessor to the United Nations, but it was also the predecessor to the European Union; it was also the incubator of a lot of intergovernmental organizations of crucial importance right now \u2013 the bodies dealing with everything from child trafficking to international public health to refugees to arms. So it makes sense that historians are looking back to recover a kind of genealogy of international negotiation, international regulation, and international activism.\n\nTN: For someone who's come to this subject with the impression of the League as, as primarily a security failure, how would you make the case, or what is the strongest case to be made for important linkages between the League of then and our institutions today?\n\nSP: I personally think the strongest continuity is institutional. The League proliferated international regulatory bodies and non-governmental organizations and networks, and that has changed decisively how we \"work\" globally. There's an obvious diplomatic thread from the League to the European Union too in that the first United States of Europe proposal comes from Aristide Briand in the late 1920s and is worked on at the League, even though it doesn't go very far at this stage. But, as Patricia's book explains, one can see how people in, say, the Economics or Transit and Communications sections are already developing a much more expansive idea of security \u2013 one that includes fostering economic security through economic integration. There are obvious continuities in personnel, too: after all, Jean Monnet is the first French Under Secretary-General of the League. He leaves, of course \u2013 ostensibly to run the family wine business but quite possibly because he was disappointed in the way the organization was developing.\n\nBut the continuity is absolutely there. This is not the way that we think about the League. We do think about it as a security arrangement. But the League took on many other issues, partly because there wasn't another apparatus that had similar capacity. The crucial point isn't that it did so successfully; it is that how it dealt with them ended up setting norms and institutional practices for the future. States and NGOs start orienting their work toward Geneva; a bureaucratic apparatus emerged to facilitate that work.\n\nTN: More broadly, one thing we focus on in these interviews is for graduate students and post-doctoral fellowship, is\u2013when you look back to when you were starting the project, starting the experience, would you have advice for people starting a new project? Obviously, you don't want to pick something that's already a fad, but as you look at your own experience moving from European history to something more explicitly global, was there anything more than a gut feeling, or the archives that gave you the confidence to begin this work and start the movement at the right time?\n\nSP: You know, I've been asked this a few times, and it's a tough question because this book took me ten years and it also required a great deal of travel and, frankly, financial support. It was supported by a lot of research fellowships from different places. I'm very aware of how privileged I was, since I had both the financial support and (having tenure) the time to do this project properly. I don't think this is a practical model for everyone, much less for a dissertation.\n\nBut if I had to offer a bit of advice, I guess I would urge people to pick projects that can be explored through multiple source bases, so as to develop arguments that can withstand what one might call \"perspectival pressure\". Think of the task as not just to dig out the gems a particular archive has to offer, but also to find another source base that throws the biases or character of that first source base into relief. All I'm saying, in a way, is to be aware of the constructed nature of the source base, something postcolonial historians have been telling imperial historians for a long time. But this applies to international history as well.\n\nTake the League Archives, for example. The League Archives are rich, but they're also deceptive, and I don't think that they're a good foundation for a project unless you constantly force them up against other sources. Why is this? Well, first because they're often unrevealing about the internal politics of the organization. With European government archives, you tap into a culture of officials working together, more or less all committed to the national interest, and able to maintain secrecy. The League, however, wasn't like that. Secretariat members were supposed to be loyal to the League alone, but the institution was much too \"leaky\" \u2013 and officials under too much pressure to share information with their own governments \u2013 to keep secrets well.\n\nAs a result, the records have some strategic silences. There's a lot of documentation of public debates, but you don't see much of the kind of internal strategizing about how to handle issues that you see all the time in government archives. I'm speaking of marginalia, right? Marginalia are your best friend in the British Archives: you can see civil servants figuring out how they're going to manage a particular issue. That is very hard to shake down in the Geneva archives. Those conversations happen, but often off the record, and you might be more likely to find traces of them in private papers or national archives than in Geneva.\n\nTN: But what does it mean when you do come back to the Geneva Archives? And what does it mean when one is planning a project?\n\nSP: Well, this means you need some other source base to get some perspective on what you're finding in Geneva. If you don't do that, you'll just mirror the deceptions of the archive. So I always think it's best to pick an issue and then make sure to find what might be called competing archival narratives: state records to check organizational records; personal papers to check the official line; voluntary bodies to see what the officials miss. If one does that, you can take a more circumscribed subject and really open it up.\n\nTN: So, with a project like that, your value-added is not purely in Geneva. It's in this archival grind, the cogs and the gears of, say, Rhodes House, the Bodleian Library, the National Archives, and then Geneva, too.\n\nSP: That's right. And I guess the other important point is to be very careful about what \"the international\" is that you're talking about. It can't be just your particular corner of the world with large claims attached. I don't mean that you can't work on the international effect of local groups, or the way local history is international. That's all great. But you can't let your subject's own self-understanding of the project become your own understanding. This was, for me, why it was so important to capture critical perspectives \u2013 the criticism from nationalists, or the German position \u2013 on the mandates regime: because it kept me from simply replicating Anglo-American or Anglo-French understandings.\n\nTN: Yeah, I wanted to come to this. I agree that narratively, it does work in getting out of this bind of \"the British Empire was international, therefore British history is global history.\" So, thus far our discussion has revolved around the 2000s-era scene. When you were doing the research, was the role of Germany here visible? Not as a wrecker of the system in the 1930s, but as a party that plays a creative role, this kind of creative elasticity?\n\nSP: No, I don't think it was. Patricia was aware of this thread, since she is partly a German historian. For her, and for anyone researching the economic side, Germany comes in all the time. German absence from Geneva doesn't mean that Germany doesn't matter in Geneva: as with the Americans, even their absence structures the debate in the room. When it came to imperial questions, however, people were less aware how important Germany was to the story. One of my main aims in the book was, then, to bridge this divide between a historiography about European security focused on the German problem and a historiography of empire that treats Germany as marginal. I wanted to say: this incredible focus that we've had and continue to have on the German problem is not something separate from this question about imperial order, which is always seen as a Franco-British imperial thing. These two questions come together.\n\nTN: So how did the German focus come into play for you, then?\n\nSP: I think a lot of life is fortuitous. I love doing research, trying to see what's out there by tackling new archives. It was clear to me \u2013 and Michael Callahan rightly picked up on the significance before me \u2013 that Germany was very resentful about the loss of its colonies. Now, I was living in Berlin every summer, essentially because my husband runs the summer program for NYU in Berlin; we also spent a couple of years here with him running the NYU Berlin program and me at the Wissenschaftskolleg or the American Academy. All of a sudden I thought, you know, I'm here: I should start using German archives. My German isn't great, but I can manage [laughs].\n\nTN: This was very much my adventure in Swedish\u2013doing interviews, thank God, in English, but then sifting through NGO archives in Swedish. I remember speaking with Ken Weisbrode last week, whom you cite as one of your early research assistants in the acknowledgements. He was recalling a conversation with [Harvard Professor] Ernest May. Ken said he wished he had a year or two more in some language; Ken would complain he didn't know, say, Italian well enough. And May would ask: \"Have you ever tried?\" And as I think you've accomplished here, you do have to try. You do.\n\nSP: Sure! I mean, we were living here in Mitte, a ten-minute bike ride from the Foreign Ministry Archives. So I thought: I'll just try. It's true that you do need some amount of determination, but even archives where people have said the archivists are unfriendly and unhelpful, that has not been my experience. The archival staff at the German Foreign Ministry was very helpful, and that at the Belgian Colonial Archives, the Archives Africaines, was helpful too. I had been told that the Belgian archives were hard to deal with, but when I told them I'd already seen all the published material they had pulled out for me, and just asked, \"Can I just look at your index and I'll tell you what I want and you can bring it to me,\" they agreed. The chapter in the book on Belgian rule in Rwanda was only possible because they let me see those files. Of course, I made sure not to go into specialist archives, like the Belgian or Namibian archives, until I knew that I knew more about a specific subject than the archivists were likely to know. Usually, I worked up the basic story of some issue that reached Geneva (famine in Rwanda, the Arab Revolt in Palestine, the Bondelswarts rebellion in Namibia, indentured labour in New Guinea, whatever) and then did a deep dive into national or private records.\n\nMaking sense of the German involvement was a bit more complicated than that. There has been good work on Nazi planning for Africa and on German global economic strategies in the interwar period by Dirk van Laak and others. I had begun reading that work, and working my way through the German Foreign Ministry files on the Mandates Commission (which they followed obsessively), and some things fell into place. I started realizing the real difficulty Germany's absence, entrance, exit, and then sniping from outside posed for this organization on every level. It became clear to me that the twin geopolitical struggles of the interwar years, that is the struggle to manage Germany and the struggle to manage imperial relations, were not separate stories. That may be the most significant argument or finding of my work. People have not paid enough attention to how sharp a shock German entry was for the League of Nations and what Berlin's presence meant.\n\nHaving lost its colonies (pictured here in light blue) as a result of the Great War, Berlin proved to be a disruptive and creative influence on the League of Nations Mandates System\n\nTN: There are two separate directions I'd like to go in from this point. One is perhaps more selfish in that it fits with my own interests in Russian and Soviet history. Looking through these files, we've talked about the German entry. But do you see much interest in the Soviet Union, in the Soviet model of national republics and federation? And the second question is, is American hegemony in the Caribbean or Latin America a reference point to these discussions about the imperial framework?\n\nSP: First, I should be honest and say that I'm not sure if I can answer this. There are things I wanted to do but couldn't, given the already excessive size of this project. So, I didn't really look at this. The Soviet line was always that the Mandates were just a fig leaf for imperialism and they didn't want to be involved. The Soviets never wanted a member on the Mandates Commission, for example, unlike Germany. That said, the mandatory powers did worry about Communist subversion all the time, and both Communists and anti-imperialists launched powerful criticisms of the League system and helped build up nationalist or independence movements. The Pan-Africanists, though, were probably more influential than the Communists, although of course groups overlapped.\n\nLet's not forget, though, that for this last period of the League, the period when the USSR joins, the institution is really hobbled. After the German exit and even more after the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, the oversight regime was on autopilot. Until 1934, the reports of the Mandates Commission were discussed in the full League Assembly, which made for a lot of press coverage and debate. But once the Germans left, the PMC's work was kept out of the Assembly and just reviewed by the Council. Some issues exploded anyway. British handling of the Arab Revolt in Palestine, for example, and the PMC's criticisms of that, couldn't be contained.\n\nThe American issue is different. To say that the US was not a member of the League is, well, not quite accurate. It's more that the Americans could act like a member state when they felt like it and not when they didn't. But the Americans were never absent. There were prominent American members of the Secretariat; Prentiss Gilbert, who was US Consul in Geneva, was kept appraised on sensitive issues. American liberals, intellectuals, and philanthropic organizations were also closely involved with League bodies and policies \u2013 David Ekbladh and Katharina Rietzler have written on this. Those ostensible \"non-state\" actors sustained a kind of alternative US foreign policy, with close relations to the League. The Health Section of the League was dependent on American foundations for a good chunk of its budget.\n\nThrough this combination of philanthropy from Carnegie and Rockefeller, and involvement by lawyers, reformers, intellectuals and NGOs, the Americans played an important role in Geneva \u2013 in the committees on drug trafficking, child welfare, economics. The Americans also had a huge influence on the mandates system \u2013 which was, after all, set up on Wilson's insistence. Wilson's colonial advisor George Louis Beer was actually supposed to be the first Director of the Mandates Section in the Secretariat, and the man who took the job when the Americans failed to join, William Rappard, was actually a dual Swiss-US national. Rappard had spent some time as an Instructor in the Government Department at Harvard and kept in close touch with a large US network.\n\nMoreover, when Rappard left the Secretariat to return to academia in 1924, another American policy wonk, Huntington Gilchrist, was brought into the Mandates Section. Gilchrist wasn't formally the Director of the Section \u2013 that went to an Italian for various political reasons \u2013 but Gilchrist played a large role shaping policy and also kept in close touch with American supporters. This was important, because the League leadership was obsessed with the effort to bring the US in. Drummond didn't succeed, but he kept channels very much open, including by sending American secretariat members on speaking tours across the US. Even a fairly low-ranking secretariat member like Mary McGeachy (about whom there's a good biography) ended up meeting and briefing important politicians on trips to the US.\n\nTN: I suppose that I just have one more substantive question about the book, then we'll transition out at the end. We have the Germans, we have this sense of the Mandates being problematic, let's say. But this isn't the same vision of self-determination that we find in the United Nations of, say, the 1960s, of total independence.\n\nSP: Right.\n\nTN: So I was curious: a major focus of the book is an entry point to the visions of self-determination on offer during this period. And reading this book, the figure of Leopoldo Palacios comes up, someone whom you mention as offering a more maximalist vision of where nation-states will be in this world that's still imperial. Could you talk more about his specific vision, or how the maximalist positions of the 1920s and 1930s differ from those of the 1960s or 1970s?\n\nSP: Palacios was the Spanish member of the Mandates Commission, with a background in academia and social reform. He really did think of the mandates system as a vehicle for promoting self-determination. It's important, though, to realize how unusual that was: he was the only member of the Commission, except possibly William Ormsby-Gore, who thought like that. Palacios found the ubiquitous dismissal of nationalists as ungentlemanly and seditious ridiculous. He tended to think \"agitators\" would turn into ordinary politicians if you just put them in office. He had a pragmatic and capacious understanding of politics.\n\nOrmsby-Gore, too, deserves another look. He was the British member of the Mandates Commission before Lugard, and while he served only briefly, he and Rappard really shaped the system. He didn't leave many papers, though, and they're in Aberystwyth, worse luck. When I was at Oxford a couple of years ago, though, I tracked down his correspondence with Lugard and some international reformers, and concluded that he too was quite unusual for his time. He was another rare person among white European politicians who saw the League regime as a roadmap for self-government. He was with the Arab Bureau during the war, and was the British liaison for the Zionist Commission's visit to Palestine in 1918, and was sympathetic to both Jewish and Arab national aspirations. He thought there would be a Jewish state, and would be Arab states, and that all that would happen sooner rather than later.\n\nTN: Regardless of, or because of, British aims?\n\nSP: Well, he thought the British should use the mandates system to build states. Ormsby-Gore wanted an independent Iraqi state, even if it were in some senses a British client state, set up immediately after the war; he also saw no reason why Tanganyika couldn't be an independent African state.\n\nBut he's unusual. For it is impossible to discount how absolutely central racial thought was during this period. That's why Ormsby-Gore was unusual. For whatever reason, and I honestly don't know why, he just pulled back when confronted by arguments \u2013 and they're ubiquitous \u2013 that basically boiled down to: \"these people aren't ready for self-government because they're African.\"\n\nTN: Sure.\n\nSP: He was very interested in development while at the Colonial Office, and thought there was a lot of educational and infrastructural work to be done. But if you look at his speeches, when faced with claims about Africans' inability to govern themselves, he tended to say, \"How do you know?\" He's interesting, he's odd, he's out of sync with his time. Because, commonly, when it came to the Middle East, African and Pacific Mandates, racial language came up over and over. Western Samoa, for example, had a representative structure, a functional economy, near universal literacy: this was clearly a place that could govern itself. It might not be Luxembourg, but still.\n\nBut the Mandates Commission couldn't imagine that. Ormsby-Gore was off the Commission by then, and Palacios was the only member able to see that the Samoan Mau movement wasn't much different from national movements in, say, the Baltic states or the Balkans. Why couldn't the others see this? Why did they insist that the Samoans were simple people led astray by agitators? It's because of race. Take Lugard. He was obsessed with the mixed-race population and thought it inherently degenerate. Only when that racial language is discredited are new possibilities opened up. If anything, I didn't give enough space to the centrality of racial thinking in the book. I have since read Robert Vitalis' book on race and international relations.\n\nTN: On Aramco? The book about Saudi Arabia?\n\nSP: No, this is a book he's writing \u2013 I read it in manuscript \u2013 on the history of the field of international relations in the US (White World Order, Black Power Politics: The Birth of American International Relations, forthcoming from Cornell). He argues, very persuasively, that the field's understandings and purposes were racial and racist from the start. From the outset, the aim was less to manage relations between nations than to manage relations between \u2013 and preserve hierarchies among \u2013 races.\n\nIt also recovers the centrality and importance of the African-American scholars at Howard University as the main critics of this frankly racist field. I found the book really illuminating, because Howard's political scientists and historians are involved in my story from the beginning. Rayford Logan, Alain Locke, and Ralph Bunche all researched and wrote on the mandates system. It's so revealing that as a young man studying political science at Harvard, Bunche chose to write his dissertation on the mandates system \u2013 that is, to compare French colonies with French mandates in order to pin down what difference the League regime made. Locke went to Geneva to research mandates; Bunche went to Europe and West Africa. Of course, Raymond Leslie Buell opened up this question: he was the first to try to see how the mandates system worked on the ground; no-one undertook more ambitious research travels. But Buell was \"Lugardian\" in that he really was most interested in stable and humane imperial government. The African-American scholars kept their eyes fixed on the road to independence.\n\nRalph Bunche\n\nTN: Well, to begin to transition to the end of the interview. Other than trying to stay well-hydrated, what's on your agenda?\n\nSP: What am I doing?\n\nTN: What are you reading, what are you researching. This is obviously a major research project, but are you thinking of what's next? A couple of smaller one-off projects, or something big?\n\nSP: That's a hard question. I've been going back and forth. I'm committed to writing a few small pieces related to this project for conferences, handbooks and so forth, but after that I'm not going to do any more specifically League-related writing. I like to do projects that are really absorbing and new, and this is beginning to feel like a rather crowded field.\n\nSo, what's the next big project? There are some possibilities that did arise out of this book. I've become very interested in Anglo-German scholarly and intellectual contacts between the wars. I'm also drawn to study the Italo-Ethiopian War, because that encapsulates some of the issues about the relationship between the European order and the imperial order that I've dealt with here. And then, you know, I do still think that there should be a new history of the League, although that would need to be a multi-volume collective project. But I don't know if I'll do any of those things.\n\nInstead, I'd like to write a book on the Balfour family and the women's suffrage movement. I think this would be really, really, fun. I'm conceiving of this as, in rough terms, a book about the shift away from dynastic politics to a different kind of politics \u2013 a shift that is seen really well through the women's suffrage movement. There were a lot of women whom I would think of as \"dynastic women\", highly involved in politics because they were born and married into political families; the Balfour women fit into this perfectly. Several of them \u2013 Frances Balfour, Betty Balfour \u2013 were intensely involved in various political causes, including suffrage. Because this was a tight-knit group, they wrote to one another all the time, so it's possible to tell the story of the argument over women's suffrage from the inside. I'm attracted to this subject, too, because I'm interested in history as a craft, and this book would be full of vivid personalities. So that's a possibility. I'd quite like to go back to British history, which is my main field. I'm not really an international historian for life.\n\nTN: Comparative, in other words, but with a strong focus on the British material.\n\nSP: Yes. I'm on leave in the spring [of 2016], and am going to spend part of that time in Edinburgh, with the Balfour papers.\n\nTN: A final quick question. What books are currently on your nightstand, or what are the books that you've read in the last three or four months that have made the biggest impression on you? Especially in the fields of international or global history.\n\nSP: I've actually been returning to British history. I just read Philip Murphy's good book on the use of the monarchy within the British Commonwealth (Monarchy and the End of Empire), and right now I'm reading William Whyte's Redbrick, a history of the civic universities from their founding to today. But in terms of international history, I think the book I found most intellectually stimulating recently is Isabel Hull's A Scrap of Paper: Breaking and Making International Law in the Great War, which I reviewed for the London Review of Books. I think that's a really excellent book. It makes the case for the centrality of international law to arguments and policies during the war, and for the exceptional nature of German doctrines and practices. Hull argues that historians were too quick to adopt the position that everybody trampled on international law during the First World War, all states were culpable, and that we can't therefore make distinctions.\n\nShe says, \"Actually, it's possible to write seriously and comparatively about that question,\" and looks at arguments within Foreign Ministries about international law. She is asking, basically, whether law was treated only as something to be used instrumentally when it suited, or was treated as the context determining what was politically possible. There were, she says, sharp differences among states. All broke international law at some point, but not to the same extent and with the same level of eagerness and comfort. It's an important book.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor the moment, however, the book that both we at the Toynbee Prize Foundation and other audiences are enjoying reading is Susan Pedersen's The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire, out with Oxford University Press. We would like to thank Professor Pedersen for joining this installment of the Global History Forum and wish her the best of luck in her future research projects."}, {"url": "https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/booked-league-of-nations-susan-pedersen", "page_content": "Booked: How the League of Nations Shaped International Politics Booked: How the League of Nations Shaped International Politics Tim Shenk talks to historian Susan Pedersen about The Guardians, and how the bureaucrats of the League of Nations helped to destroy the imperial order they had set out to protect. The Gap in the Bride by Leonard Raven-Hill (1919), from Punch Magazine via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nBooked is a monthly series of Q&As with authors by Dissent contributing editor Timothy Shenk. For this interview, he spoke with Susan Pedersen about her new book The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire (Oxford University Press, 2015).\n\nWorld domination is reserved for supervillains, but global governance is the terrain of bureaucrats. That has been the case since the aftermath of the First World War, when the League of Nations was born. Though little remembered today, the history of the League is now being recovered by a new generation of scholars. The Guardians is the latest, and most impressive, product of this turn. Joining a global scope to deep archival research, Susan Pedersen reveals the process by which a group of supposedly apolitical technocrats at the League helped to create a new kind of international politics and to destroy the imperial order they had set out to protect. But the collapse of empires left behind a world of entrenched inequalities\u2014and that, too, is part of Pedersen\u2019s story.\n\n\u2014Timothy Shenk\n\nTimothy Shenk: If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that most people think of the League\u2019s history (when they think about it at all) as somewhere between tragedy and farce. For a long time, historians tended to share that perspective. But your book is part of a trend in recent scholarship that has taken us, as you put it in an article for the American Historical Review, \u201cBack to the League of Nations.\u201d What has encouraged historians to return to the League, and how has this new work changed our understanding of the organization?\n\nSusan Pedersen: There are lots of reasons why the League is coming back into focus, but I think two are most important. The first is that the uncertainties of our present time rather mirror those of the interwar period. We live in a world that is no longer bipolar, in which the major global power is, frankly, in relative decline, but in which the role that will be played by the coming powers isn\u2019t terribly clear. That\u2019s rather like 1918\u201339. The League was set up to manage the settlement of 1919, but it was too partial, too linked to the victorious allied powers, too tied to the imperial order, and too harmed by the U.S. decision not to join to do that effectively.\n\nThe second reason the League is coming back into focus is that it was the incubator of a lot of the institutions and practices of global governance we live with now. The World Health Organization grew out of the League of Nations Health Organization, UNESCO out of the League\u2019s Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, ECOSOC out of the Economic and Financial Section of the League, and the list goes on. The quiet work of League bureaucrats set many of the frameworks and protocols for today\u2019s global governance.\n\nShenk: You describe The Guardians as a \u201ccomprehensive history of the mandates system\u2014that is, of the League\u2019s effort to manage the imperial order.\u201d What territories was the League called upon to \u201cmanage,\u201d and how did the League end up with this responsibility in the first place?\n\nPedersen: The League didn\u2019t actually govern any territories: it oversaw the administration by the Allied powers of the African and Pacific territories seized from Germany and the formerly Ottoman Middle East. In the Pacific, Japan seized the Caroline, Marshall, and Mariana Islands from Germany, New Zealand took over Western Samoa, and Australia occupied German New Guinea; in Africa, Britain and France occupied and partitioned German Togo and Cameroon, South Africa occupied South West Africa (present-day Namibia), Belgian forces took over Rwanda and Burundi and the British tried, without much success, to subdue German forces in East Africa. At Versailles, Germany had to surrender those territories. All the occupying powers wanted to annex those German colonies, but American opposition and a genuine international revolt against colonial rule across the world made that impossible. Various humanitarian lobbies in Britain had been pressing during the war for new international agreements over colonial rule; Arab nationalists in the Middle East were determined to achieve independence.\n\nSo the mandates system was hammered out in Paris as a compromise from the start. It was designed to grant actual administrative control to the powers who had conquered these territories while affirming a measure of international control. The mandated territories were supposed to be governed in the interests of the local population, so there were various stipulations outlawing slavery and limiting forced labor and other abuses; they were also supposed to be \u201cdeveloped\u201d in the interests of the world as a whole, so all League states were granted equal rights to enter and do business. A Permanent Mandates Commission comprised of so-called \u201cexperts\u201d\u2014most were former colonial officials\u2014was set up to receive reports from the powers administering mandates and was supposed to alert the League Council to any abuses. It took years to set the system up, though. The imperial powers had agreed to League oversight to placate the Americans, and when the United States didn\u2019t join, most transparently hoped the whole plan would just go away. Only some hard work by the League\u2019s officials, and an outcry over South African repression of an uprising in South West Africa, forced the imperial powers to finally agree to comply with the requirements to begin reporting to Geneva.\n\nShenk: The leaders of the mandates system, you write, became \u201cinadvertent architects of a world they had not imagined,\u201d and this question of unintended consequences is one of the book\u2019s preoccupations. What purpose was the mandates system designed to serve, and why did that goal prove so difficult to achieve?\n\nPedersen: The mandates system was clearly set up to stabilize the settlement reached in Paris, and to win agreement to Allied administration of these territories. The oversight regime was supposed to set standards for imperial rule and\u2014through the publicity inherent in the Geneva system\u2014show the world how well the Allies were governing. But publicity cuts two ways. In the system\u2019s early years, populations in South West Africa, Syria, and Western Samoa rose up against their new governors, and the fact that the League had to investigate those uprisings meant that these populations\u2019 grievances were broadcast around the world. Instead of stabilizing the imperial order, the system turned into a mechanism for challenging it.\n\nShenk: The Guardians is filled with memorable figures, but one of the most remarkable is a Samoan named Olaf Nelson. Who was Nelson, and what did his experience reveal about the mandates system?\n\nPedersen: Nelson was the son of a Swedish trader and a high-rank Samoan mother, which meant he was classed as a \u201cEuropean\u201d by Samoa\u2019s German rulers and then by the New Zealanders who took over under League mandate. He was also the main copra trader in Samoa, and one of the islands\u2019 richest men. Nelson identified with both the European and the Samoan population and helped bring the two together in a movement known as the \u201cMau\u201d to demand self-government. Nelson argued, reasonably enough, that the Samoans were perfectly capable of running their own administration, and he also objected to the argument that \u201cEuropeans\u201d and \u201cSamoans\u201d were distinct groups and had to be governed differently.\n\nOne of the most shameful episodes in the history of the mandates regime is the treatment of Nelson. Essentially, the League\u2019s Mandates Commission colluded with the New Zealand administration to paint Nelson as an opportunistic schemer; he was condemned by the Commission and banished from Samoa by the New Zealand administrator. I think this episode shows how profoundly racial thought structured the League system. The members of the Mandates Commission genuinely thought the Samoans\u2014those 90 percent of Samoan men who signed petitions calling for self-government\u2014needed protection and not rights. They were completely bewildered when the Samoans continued to petition the League for self-government after Nelson\u2019s banishment, and even more nonplussed when Samoan women took over running the movement when the male population went into hiding. I think it is this episode that shows most starkly the way a commitment to \u201cprotect\u201d a native population can slide into efforts to make sure it is sufficiently subjected and disempowered to require \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nShenk: Most of the territories the League superintended were former colonies of Germany, but Germany itself did not become a member of the League until 1926. How did Germany\u2019s entry change the League\u2019s approach to international governance?\n\nPedersen: Nothing had a greater impact on the League\u2019s effort to legitimate imperial order than Germany\u2019s entry into the League. This was because Germany ended up playing a completely unexpected role. Everyone knew Germany wanted its colonies back. But in the Weimar period the German Foreign Ministry concluded that goal was unrealistic, and instead decided to insist that the promises made at Versailles\u2014that all the mandated territories should be governed in the interests of the international community and open to all League states\u2014be strictly adhered to. So, entirely unexpectedly, it was Weimar Germany that insisted most strenuously that the imperial powers were not sovereign in the mandated territories, that those territories had to be economically open to all League states, and that they should be made independent as soon as possible. Germany didn\u2019t do this because they were sympathetic to independence movements; in fact, Foreign Ministry officials admitted privately that if they still had colonies they would argue differently. Their view was: if Germany couldn\u2019t have its colonies back, it was in Germany\u2019s interest to make sure that no one else benefited from them either. Even more than the United States, in the Weimar period Germany played the role of the \u201canti-colonial\u201d Great Power.\n\nShenk: As that suggests, debates over sovereignty\u2014that is, over who had ultimate authority\u2014provoked the fiercest disputes in the Mandates Commission. By the end of the 1920s, you write, these clashes had helped produce a new model\u2014a \u201cdecoupling of legal sovereignty and economic control\u201d that prepared the way for our own \u201cworld of normative state sovereignty, even when accompanied by diminished state capacity.\u201d The supposed emancipation of Iraq in 1932, which you say was more like \u201cthe creation of a client state,\u201d provided one template for this approach. What does that history tell us about the shifting meaning of sovereignty?\n\nPedersen: Sovereignty matters: I\u2019m not arguing that it doesn\u2019t. But, as Antony Anghie argued before me, what the League helped to create was a kind of \u201cdamaged\u201d sovereignty: a sovereignty that could be extended to Third World states while preserving significant imperial economic control. The mandates system was far from the only arena in which these unequal bargains were worked out\u2014but the Iraq case is, I think, especially illuminating. The Mandates Commission really didn\u2019t want to approve Britain\u2019s plan for the independence of Iraq in 1932 precisely because they felt that\u2014with British-dominated international conglomerates still controlling Iraq\u2019s oil fields and the RAF controlling its airfields\u2014Iraq couldn\u2019t be said to be \u201ctruly\u201d independent. But Iraqi elites and Iraqi nationalists understood that this was the only \u201cindependence\u201d on offer, and collaborated with the British to induce international agreement. The French and Italians agreed when their share of oil was confirmed. This is a particularly stark example of the neocolonial bargain in formation.\n\nShenk: While I was reading The Guardians, there was another book that kept on popping into my head: Recasting Bourgeois Europe, Charles Maier\u2019s classic study of France, Germany, and Italy in the 1920s. It was published forty years ago, but it\u2019s a masterpiece that\u2019s still very much worth reading today, and it makes a persuasive case for the enduring significance of that period for the world after 1945. Was Recasting a model you had in mind, and, even if not, do you think the comparison tells us something about where historians have moved since that book appeared in 1975?\n\nPedersen: Maier was one of my two dissertation supervisors, and Recasting Bourgeois Europe had a huge influence on my early work on the European welfare state. His influence on The Guardians is less direct, but his commitment to constructing complex models of causation is one I completely share. I think Recasting is prescient, too, in its awareness of the way models of governance spill across national lines and have to be studied in an international context. Economic stabilization after the First World War was a transnational project, and so was imperial stabilization. It\u2019s true that, forty years on, we tend to see different things: anti-colonial activism and protest play a major role in my book; I\u2019m interested in how conflicts outside Europe affect the European order. But Maier too was trying to understand how the global order changed after 1918, and this book is also part of that effort.\n\nShenk: You don\u2019t spend a lot of time on it, but it\u2019s clear that a theory about politics motivates your analysis, and that one of the major influences is Max Weber. The Guardians could even be described as an extended reflection on how legitimation works (or doesn\u2019t). What does seeing the history of the League with this question of legitimacy in mind reveal?\n\nPedersen: It\u2019s true that the mandates system really was an effort at legitimation. But what the system hoped to legitimate was imperial rule\u2014and what I hope to have shown is that the world had so decisively changed by 1918 that that effort was bound to fail. The mandates system legitimated the Versailles settlement in the eyes of Western publics, but most populations under mandate\u2014especially in the Middle East\u2014never accepted that claim.\n\nMax Weber also, of course, offered us a perceptive theory of political leadership, contrasting the \u201cpolitician of ultimate ends\u201d\u2014that is, a politician who is driven exclusively by a particular ethical imperative and refuses to calculate costs\u2014with a \u201cpolitician of responsibility\u201d who understands his or her obligation to think through the consequences of any action in a real-world context. I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t think anyone in the book really lives up to Weber\u2019s quite strenuous ideal of the \u201cpolitician of responsibility,\u201d although some of the League\u2019s officials\u2014notably the Swiss professor William Rappard, who was the first Director of the Mandates Section in the Secretariat and then a member of the Mandates Commission until its demise\u2014comes close. To find such a person, you\u2019d have to go back to my last book and learn about Eleanor Rathbone, Britain\u2019s most effective interwar female politician.\n\nShenk: Another major theme of the book is the importance of bureaucrats. They\u2019re \u201cunglamorous historical actors,\u201d as you note, but they had considerable influence at the League and, through the League, over much of the world. \u201cBureaucracy, more than idealism,\u201d you write, \u201ctamed the demons of power.\u201d What does focusing on the bureaucrats let us see that histories of movements at the grassroots leave out?\n\nPedersen: International bureaucrats are a pretty unusual species of bureaucrat. In national administrations, you have a public sphere of electors and civic organizations and lobbies, and then a realm of government, of which bureaucrats are a part. But in the international arena, bureaucrats are supposed to be loyal to internationally agreed norms and covenants, even though political capacity and power, and to an extent civic activism as well, still reside largely in nation-states. This means bureaucrats play an especially important role in the international arena: they are middlemen, mediating between international ideals and national interests. Most are pragmatists, not idealists; they also are citizens of individual states and always subject to pressure by their governments. But insofar as anyone represents \u201cthe international\u201d in the interwar period, they do. Privately, they have quite a lot of influence, and very occasionally they step outside their supposed \u201cnon-political\u201d role and take public stands.\n\nShenk: The mandates system, of course, eventually collapsed, along with the League of Nations. The assumption of global leadership by the United States, the rise of the Soviet Union as a major power, and the wave of decolonization that swept across the postwar world\u2014all of that marked a profound break from the world the League sought to manage. But you argue that there was more continuity than this picture suggests. What, ultimately, was the legacy of the history you tell here?\n\nPedersen: What I think the mandates system did was establish an arena of debate and struggle over the question of what \u201cindependence\u201d would mean. The norms the League tried to enforce\u2014of the \u201copen door,\u201d of free labor and free trade, of the \u201cnon-sovereignty\u201d of imperial governments\u2014prefigure the implicit contract made during decolonization and help us to understand the world that emerged after 1945. But I think the mandates system shaped not only the content of that postcolonial bargain but also the practices of global politics after 1945. During the League period, both imperial powers and nationalist movements learned to orient their claims toward an international public and international organizations in Geneva. Today, those battles are fought out at the UN. During the League period, a number of imperial powers learned that they could \u201cwin\u201d militarily\u2014in Syria, in South West Africa, in Palestine\u2014but \u201close\u201d diplomatically; they discovered that \u201cstaying on\u201d wasn\u2019t worth the cost. That\u2019s a pattern that was played out on a global scale after 1945. I tend to think the battle for imperial legitimacy was lost in the League period\u2014even if it took the war, and a lot of anti-colonial postwar struggles, to finally bring those lessons home."}]}
