It was established in January 1909 in Edmonton as an amalgamation of the Canadian Society of Equity and the Alberta Farmers' Association. The UFA was interested in rural economic, social and political issues. In 1913 it prompted the provincial Liberal government to organize the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Co., which in 1917 joined with the Grain Growers' Grain Co. to form the United Grain Growers. (See also Co-Operative Movement.)\n\nPolitics\n\nIn 1916 the Non-Partisan League came to the province and encouraged direct political action by farmers. Close ties developed between the league and the UFA, which entered politics amid postwar unrest. The UFA was provincially elected in 1921 and remained in office until 1935. It formed a cautious, pragmatic government which advanced educational and health services and tried to meet the financial and marketing needs of farmers, but it did not cope well with the Great Depression .\n\nThe most powerful early force in the UFA was Henry Wise Wood, a charismatic farmer of Carstairs, Alberta. He supported group government, but refused to lead the UFA when it was elected in 1921. Alberta\u2019s first UFA premier was Herbert Greenfield (1921-25), followed by John Edward Brownlee (1925-34) and Richard Gavin Reid. Reid held office until the 1935 provincial victory of the Social Credit political party. After 1935 the UFA avoided direct political involvement and by 1939 ended its political functions.\n\nAfter ceasing its political activities, the UFA continued to provide supplies to members through local co-operatives. In 1948 it became the United Farmers of Alberta Co-operative Ltd, one of the strongest farmer-owned organizations in Alberta."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Cameron_(Alberta_politician)", "page_content": "John Cameron (May 28, 1846 \u2013 October 6, 1919) was a merchant and politician in Alberta, Canada and a municipal councillor in Edmonton.

Balbuthie has remained the family's home ever since, buying the farm back following it\u2019s sale by John\u2019s great grandfather to local land owners \u2013 Lord and Lady Lindsay \u2013 in order to pay for the cost of a loss within his shipping business.\n\nBorn and brought up in Malawi, in Africa, Margaret lived with her mother and father, James and Queenie Clapperton. Schooled in what was then known as Rhodesia, Margaret attended boarding school before then travelling to Cape Town to study nursing at university.\n\nFollowing her qualification and working in an African hospital, Margaret \u2013 along with her fellow colleagues \u2013 travelled to Scotland to work in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in her early 20s, where she then undertook a course in midwifery and passed.\n\nShe met John in the Royal Infirmary walking through theatre, before courting and eventually marrying in 1964, out in Malawi. Following her midwifery course, Margaret gave up practicing to be more involved with the farm, which is where her passion for Hereford cattle was born.\n\nWhat got you into breeding Herefords?\n\n\u201cSimply that they are the predominant breed in southern Africa. It was Margaret\u2019s interest to have a pedigree herd, as she played a very active hand in the running of the farms.\n\n\"She was keen to have a pedigree herd and I have to say I was switched into the breed too as I wanted to work with a progressive breed at that time. Due to Margaret\u2019s experience with the breed, I backed her decision and that was before an influx of continentals entered the country,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s mother was still alive at this time and had retired down to Elie. The name of her house was called Baldinnie and when we got the herd, we used that name as the prefix,\" added Margaret.\n\n\"We bought the first pedigree in the mid-1960s in the form of some locally sourced females. One of John\u2019s mentors, Sandy Campbell, from Kinellar, in Aberdeenshire, gave us a lot of advice about putting together a herd,\" she said.\n\nJohn pointed out: \u201cWe were also building up the commercial beef herd at the time, with around 800 Luing cross Simmentals and I decided we would use the Hereford as a terminal sire.\n\n\"Eventually, we formed a contract with Waitrose and one of the requirements which had to be met was that the stock had to be sired by a pedigree Hereford bull, in order to meet the scheme.\n\n\u201cSo, we used home-bred bulls from Margaret\u2019s herd on the commercial cattle and I had the unenviable task of having to buy my pedigree Hereford bulls from my wife and this was not an easy task!\u201d\n\nQualities you like about the Hereford?\n\nTheir docile nature and that they are clean and easy to handle. We have never really had to intervene at calving, but if we do, they are very calm.\n\nFirst big breed sale or show?\n\nThe first local show would have been East Fife Agricultural Show, followed by Perth, where we enjoyed a few successes. The first sale was through Bosomworth's, in Edinburgh, at the Scottish Hereford Society\u2019s annual breed sale.\n\nBest animal ever bred?\n\nIt has to be Baldinnie Cathy. A daughter of the original purchase from Canada, Wilgor Cathy, she had all the female traits you would expect for a show cow. She knew how to show herself off and had a breeding performance that was exceptional \u2013 if she was not winning herself, her progeny were.\n\nBest animal ever seen?\n\nWe have seen so many, however, the animal that has left the biggest impression would certainly be the supreme Hereford champion we once saw at the Agribition annual show, held in Calgary, Alberta, in Canada.\n\nBest animal you\u2019ve been out-bidded on or lost?\n\nAgain, we have to say Cathy when she died, as she was hugely influential within our herd.\n\nBiggest disappointment?\n\nYou get a lot of disappointments in life and they were a regular feature of our lifetime\u2019s experience, but we never dwelled on them.\n\nMost influential person in your careers?\n\nThe late Sandy Campbell and on an equal footing, the late Wilbur Donaldson, who was probably the most noted Canadian Hereford breeder of all time, and originally from Scotland.\n\nFavourite sale over the years and why?\n\n\u201cThe society\u2019s annual national sale, at Hereford,\u201d stated Margaret.\n\n\u201cThe first pedigree bull that we ever bought at Hereford, my good friend, Sandy Campbell, was sitting next to me. I bought the bull he advised me to buy and the auctioneer didn\u2019t recognise me as I was a new face, but it was a big price so the bull was knocked down to 'the man sat next to Sandy Campbell' as I was referred to back then!\u201d said John.\n\nAbiding memory?\n\n\u201cThere are two that come to me, the first being able to re-purchase the family farm at Balbuthie. The second would be being appointed president of the NFUS followed by my appointment of chairman of the EEC sheep meat committee,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cI used to get my leg pulled by my EEC colleagues about being the biggest sheep producer in Europe, to which my reply was that I also had the biggest overdraft!\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe other great interest in my career has been railways and following my spell as NFUS president \u2013 which would have been the greatest honour I\u2019ve accorded \u2013 would be to be appointed chairman of Scotrail and then to the Nationalised British Railway Board, in London.\n\n\"I enjoyed both these appointments enormously, and in particular, enjoyed the company of the people I was working with, both at headquarters and out on the railway.\u201d\n\nInterests outwith farming?\n\n\u201cThe livestock were my main hobby, I spent a lot of time with them,\u201d said Margaret.\n\n\u201cOutwith farming, I was chairman of the board of governors of Dollar Academy for 30 years. I\u2019m very conscious of what the school did for me \u2013 the school matured me out of all recognition and I\u2019ll always be grateful. I enjoyed putting anything I could back into the school,\u201d added John.\n\nBest breeder ever?\n\nThe late Edward Lewis, of the Haven herd.\n\nBest advice?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not sure keep your mouth shut, it seems to have worked for me,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do what your husband tells you to do!\u201d added Margaret.\n\nBiggest achievement?\n\n\u201cFor me it would be winning supreme champion at Perth Show,\u201d Margaret commented.\n\n\u201cWinning the Burke Trophy at the Royal Show presented by HM The Queen was a very prestigious thing as it represented the champion of champions, the best male and female of the breeds with Baldinnie involved,\u201d added John.\n\n\u201cAnother agricultural highlight for myself would be the appointment as president of the NFUS. I was also chairman of the National Safety Committee for the British Railway Board.\n\n\"In order to do that job justice, I approached the chairman, Sir Bob Reid, from Cupar, and asked him if I could be passed out as a driver and know what I was talking about.\n\n\u201cEventually, I was permitted to drive and this led me to my greatest accomplishment in that the day of the official opening of the restored line to the Borders, in 2018, one of my own locomotives was selected to haul the Royal train with myself as the driver that took the Queen and other members of the Royal Family to Tweedbank for the official opening ceremony,\u201d explained John.\n\nFuture of the Hereford?\n\n\u201cTrends come and go, but it does appear now that there is a swing to favour lighter weighted, finished carcases and from a financial point of view, there\u2019s a tendency to finish cattle at a younger age and I think the Hereford breed is admirably suited to achieve both of these objectives.\n\n\"The overarching role that the native breeds at one time had I think will gradually return to achieve a role in beef finishing, such as they haven\u2019t experienced the past few decades, however, the continentals will still play an important role,\u201d explained John.\n\n\u201cThat means they aren\u2019t going to carry excess fat, which is not a desirable trait in todays world and this will help them secure a place within both the pedigree and commercial market,\u201d added Margaret.\n\nBiggest fear for the future?\n\n\u201cThe trade deal with Australia. It worries me as I\u2019m aware that the cost of production in these countries is much less than it could ever be over here, but at the same time I\u2019m also concerned that the quality of imported meat may not be up to the same standards as we have been accustomed to in this country,\u201d John stated.\n\n\u201cThe most worrying outcome of that is the future level of meat consumption in this country, which could have a detrimental effect on our industry,\u201d concluded\n\nMargaret."}, {"url": "https://everything.explained.today/John_Cameron_(farmer)/", "page_content": "John Cameron (farmer) explained\n\nJohn Bell Cameron FRAgS is a Scottish farmer based in Balbuthie, Fife, with significant interest in railways.\n\nFarming\n\nWidely credited as the one-time largest sheep farmer in Europe, Cameron owned seven farms in Fife and West Perthshire.

He is also the President of the Gresley Society.\n\nCameron has a personal interest in steam railways, and owns two former LNER locomotives:\n\nLNER Class A4 - 60009 Union of South Africa\n\nLNER Class K4 - 3442 The Great Marquess\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarried to South African-born Margaret, the couple live at the 400-acre (1.6 km2) Balbuthie Farm in St Monans, Fife and maintain a cottage on the shores of Lake Malawi.\n\nIn 2007, Cameron and his wife set up the Cameron Travel Scholarship Trust, to allow both Scottish agricultural students and those studying at the Dollar Academy in Dollar, Clackmannanshire, to travel abroad for the purpose of broadening their education and understanding of the\n\nworld.\" He was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the school, where he himself was educated, until relinquishing office in 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.fwi.co.uk/farm-life/farming-stalwarts-john-cameron", "page_content": "John Cameron is probably one of the few farmers who is universally known across Scotland.\n\nThe farming champion is widely respected for a 40-year career in roles which included a five-year presidency of NFU Scotland, chairmanship of the Scottish Beef Cattle Association and an eight-year stint as chairman of the European Sheepmeat Advisory Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn association with WareingBuildings\n\nFor much of that time he was referred to as Europe\u2019s biggest sheep farmer, and when he wasn\u2019t busy with politics, running eight different farming units or commuting to Brussels, he chaired British Rail\u2019s Scottish Regional Board and often drove the company trains.\n\nJohn Cameron is a man with sharp political instinct, the charisma to get grassroots producers on board and while at one time he farmed 37,000 acres with beef, sheep and arable interests, his focus has never left the beleaguered hill producer in the less favoured areas where his father\u2019s family farmed for generations.\n\nHis political career was launched when he was appointed NFUS Hill Farming Committee chairman in the 1970s and the rise to the role of national president was fast.\n\nWhat marked him out was his insistence that the civil servants, rule-writers and great and good of Westminster and Brussels should all experience the practical implementation of their policies and edicts. And so he would transport them by tractor and trailer eight miles into the hills of north-west Scotland then deliver his demands, always ending with the question: \u201cDo you understand now what I want? If not you can walk home\u201d.\n\nIt was a performance which consistently achieved results, not least an exceptionally advantageous EU Sheepmeat Regime and Less Favoured Area payments which underpinned production on some of Scotland\u2019s most challenging terrain.\n\nBut not every victim survived unscathed. A former Secretary General of COPA, the international farmers\u2019 pressure group in Brussels, lost a leather buckled shoe in the mud on one of Mr Cameron\u2019s day-long expeditions, and was reportedly seen hobbling back to a trailer sobbing and wet. The subsequent large drams of whisky and generous hospitality tended to soften the physical discomfort and end the experience on a high note.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of the rabble-rouser in John Cameron, too. It was he who came out of semi-retirement to lead 1000 Scottish farmers in a protest at Stranraer docks when imports of Irish beef threatened their livelihoods, and he who successfully negotiated the return of six containers of beef back home across the Irish Sea that same evening.\n\nBut just as his call to arms could inspire some of the smallest livestock producers in the country, so did he negotiate with the most formidable politicians of his generation. He had several spats with Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister, and found they shared some common values.\n\n\u201cYou had to stand up for yourself, and she\u2019d respect you if you contradicted her,\u201d he remembers. \u201cShe certainly wasn\u2019t a push-over, but once we had won our argument her government was a strong supporter of the less favoured areas.\u201d Indeed, letters from the former prime minister are among his most treasured possessions.\n\nThese days John has downsized his farming operation, selling off five of the units which were scattered across Scotland, and setting aside a \u00a31m fund for the Cameron Travel Scholarship Trust for the benefit of young agricultural students and pupils of Dollar Academy.\n\nAfter an entire lifetime managing stock, he says the decision to semi-retire was a surprisingly quick and easy one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been gathering sheep on a freezing wet day and was soaked to my backside in the truck coming off the hill and suddenly thought: Why am I here?\u201d he recalls.\n\nBut he is still left running the substantial Fife farm of Balbuthie and a neighbouring unit. And he continues to buy lambs every year from Oban Mart where he is still given a hero\u2019s welcome.\n\nThe scrapbooks he occasionally pores over offer an insight into his dominating role on Scottish farming over four decades, but while John may now be 70, he\u2019s adamant the pages are not yet complete. It\u2019s not so long, after all, since NFU Scotland was plunged into crisis with the resignation of a president and chief executive and a poll of farmers for a national farming magazine voted overwhelmingly for John Cameron to take the helm. On that occasion he graciously declined, but that twinkle in his eye and his restless energy and passion for the industry means we haven\u2019t heard the last of the Grand Old Man of Scottish farming.
