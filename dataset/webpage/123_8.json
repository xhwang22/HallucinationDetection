{"After The Rascals' breakup in 1972, Ron Meagher pursued a solo career, releasing two albums in the 1970s.": [{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-08-18-ca-835-story.html", "page_content": "Times Staff Writer\n\n\u201cGood Lovin\u2019 \u201d is one of the hits that is likely to please nostalgic fans the most when a reformed version of the Rascals plays Southern California starting this weekend.\n\nBut there is no good lovin,\u2019 and little good will, between the two principal Rascals, Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1970, Cavaliere and Brigati were the partners who keyed the Rascals\u2019 success. Cavaliere wrote the music and Brigati supplied the lyrics for such hits as \u201cGroovin,\u2019 \u201d \u201cHow Can I Be Sure\u201d and the transcendent \u201cPeople Got to Be Free.\u201d (\u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d the band\u2019s first No. 1 hit, was a remake of a song by the Olympics.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCavaliere usually took the vocal leads in a husky, impassioned voice patterned after Ray Charles. Brigati sang lead on some of the hits, but his airier voice was usually part of the Rascals\u2019 rich harmony blend.\n\nCavaliere, 45, is back on the road in a Rascals reunion tour that includes Dino Danelli and Gene Cornish, the band\u2019s original drummer and guitarist. They wind up a two-month national tour playing Friday at the California Theatre in San Diego, Sunday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim and Tuesday at the Universal Amphitheatre. Brigati, 42, remains in New Jersey.\n\nIn separate phone interviews, the two former partners laid out their grievances: Cavaliere depicted Brigati as a man who inexplicably resigned from the Rascals in 1970 and has since resisted promoters\u2019 efforts to put the former band members together for a reunion tour. Brigati cast Cavaliere as an opportunist who turned a band that had been organized as an equal collective into his own vehicle.\n\n\u201cI went personally to his home and asked him to come,\u201d Cavaliere said. \u201cI fulfilled my obligation as a friend. You can only ask someone for so long. From a business viewpoint, we don\u2019t need him.\u201d\n\nBrigati said he never received a formal touring proposal from Cavaliere and the promoters behind the Rascals reunion. He said he would be interested in rejoining his old band mates only if the group were to record and not just be an oldies touring outfit, and with an assurance that the members would be on an equal footing.\n\nOtherwise, he said, he is content to continue a low-key musical career that includes songwriting and occasional live shows with his older brother, David, who sang harmony on most Rascals\u2019 hits.\n\n\u201cI am at least an equal share member in the Rascals legacy,\u201d Brigati said. \u201cFelix has an attitude that we\u2019re his sidemen. Twenty years later, I can\u2019t be his sideman.\u201d\n\nCavaliere said he took a leadership role out of necessity.\n\n\u201cI was hoping (Brigati) would grow into a person who took on more of the work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen, and I felt I was doing more than I was getting credit for as an equal partner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to have a psychologist tell me what happened to him, to be part of a successful group and then retreat from the world.\u201d\n\nBrigati said frustration over the band\u2019s business arrangements led him to quit the Rascals in 1970. His only output since then has been one obscure album released with his brother in the mid-\u201970s.\n\nThe Rascals broke up in 1972 after failing to approach their earlier success. Cavaliere continued as a solo performer until 1980, then dropped out of sight.\n\n\u201cI decided there are ways to make a living in the music industry without having to feel the pain,\u201d Cavaliere said. He resurfaced last year with a band that played a mix of Rascals songs and new material.\n\nWhen the current tour is over, Cavaliere said, he\u2019ll settle in Nashville and try to blend into the city\u2019s musical community as a songwriter and producer.\n\n\u201cI still want to do new music. To earn a living being a Rascal is not what I want to do.\u201d\n\nAs for the possibility of future Rascals reunions, Cavaliere said: \u201cIt can be brought back for another special occasion. For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say Eddie wanted to join us next year. That\u2019s a reason to go out.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether such a rapprochement is possible.\n\n\u201cThe person I want to see come back would also be a person that\u2019s changed in many other ways,\u201d Cavaliere said. \u201cI know he still sings and still sounds great. We get reports. (The Brigati brothers) will always sound good. They had natural ability. But you also have to have desire and ambition.\u201d\n\nDespite what Brigati sees as Cavaliere\u2019s \u201cconcerted effort to discredit us\u201d during past negotiations for a Rascals reunion, he says he hasn\u2019t closed the door.\n\n\u201cWe must go beyond it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m alive, you don\u2019t give up.\u201d For now, there is still a gulf of resentment between former friends who, at their creative peak, shared an apartment while turning out hit songs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing to feel after all we\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d Brigati said."}, {"url": "https://performerlife.com/what-happened-to-outkast/", "page_content": "Performer Life is supported by its readers. If you buy something with our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nKnown for being a major force in the revolutionizing of hip-hop music, the duo, OutKast remains one of the most respected hip-hop groups to emerge from not just Atlanta, Georgia, but also from the United States.\n\nThe rap duo was made up of rappers, Andr\u00e9 \u201c3000\u201d Benjamin (who was formerly known as Dr\u00e9) and Antwan \u201cBig Boi\u201d Patton.\n\nTogether, they achieved critical and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. They helped popularize Southern hip-hop.\n\nWith a unique and gritty sound that synergized funk, gospel, rock, ragtime, rave, and every other style and idiom, OutKast revolutionized the 1990s hip-hop and cemented their names on both the sands of time and the hearts of hip-hop lovers.\n\nUndoubtedly, the duo was on top of their game and were known for doing what other rappers at the time could never imagine.\n\nOutKast normalized the use of live instrumentation in hip-hop music. Their sounds were not just \u201cfunky,\u201d it was also real.\n\nThe recurring question of what happened to the duo OutKast has a simple answer, which is that OutKast broke up in the year 2006. For some reason, they seized to exist as a duo.\n\nMaybe they outgrew each other or maybe not. In this article, we will look further into why they broke up.\n\nWhat happened to Outkast?\n\nOutKast was an American hip-hop duo formed in 1992 in East Point, Georgia, consisting of Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi.\n\nThey released their debut album \u201cSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik\u201d in 1994, which received critical acclaim and helped to establish them as one of the most innovative and influential hip-hop acts of the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nHowever, in 2007, the duo announced an indefinite hiatus, and they have not released any new music as OutKast since then.\n\nThere are several reasons why OutKast split up, although the exact details of their breakup are not entirely clear. One of the main reasons cited by both Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi is \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in 2014, Andr\u00e9 3000 said, \u201cAs we started getting older and going in different directions, I think we just naturally started to evolve into different artists.\u201d Big Boi has also spoken about how their different musical interests led them to pursue solo projects.\n\nIn an interview with NPR in 2017, he said, \u201cI\u2019m just a little bit more aggressive with the music. Andr\u00e9 likes to take his time and paint pictures.\u201d Another factor in OutKast\u2019s breakup was reportedly tension between Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with Rick Rubin, Andr\u00e9 3000 said that he and Big Boi \u201cwere brothers, but there were times that we were at odds.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke about how he felt trapped by OutKast\u2019s success and wanted to explore different musical genres and styles.\n\nDespite their split, both Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi have continued to have successful careers in music. Andr\u00e9 3000 has collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Frank Ocean, Kanye West, and Travis Scott.\n\nHe has also pursued acting, appearing in films such as \u201cFour Brothers\u201d and \u201cHigh Life.\u201d Big Boi has released several solo albums and has collaborated with artists such as Sleepy Brown and Phantogram.\n\nAndr\u00e9 3000 Talks Outkast, Acting and More on The Breakfast Club:\n\nWhy did Outkast break up?\n\nOutKast\u2019s breakup was due to a combination of factors, including creative differences, personal tensions, and a desire to pursue individual artistic paths.\n\nCreative differences played a significant role in the duo\u2019s split. In interviews, both Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi have spoken about how their different musical interests and approaches led them to pursue solo projects.\n\nAndr\u00e9 3000 has said that they \u201cnaturally started to evolve into different artists,\u201d while Big Boi has described himself as \u201cmore aggressive with the music\u201d than Andr\u00e9.\n\nThis divergence in musical direction led to a creative stalemate that eventually culminated in their hiatus.\n\nPersonal tensions may have also contributed to OutKast\u2019s breakup. In a 2019 interview with Rick Rubin, Andr\u00e9 3000 revealed that he and Big Boi \u201cwere brothers, but there were times that we were at odds.\u201d\n\nThe intense creative process, combined with the pressures of fame and fortune, may have taken a toll on their relationship.\n\nLastly, Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s desire to explore different musical genres and styles may have been a significant factor in their split.\n\nIn an interview with The Fader, he said that he felt trapped by OutKast\u2019s success and wanted to break out of the box that they had created for themselves.\n\nThis desire to pursue individual artistic paths led to Andr\u00e9 3000 collaborating with a wide range of artists and pursuing acting, while Big Boi released several solo albums and collaborated with other musicians.\n\nAbout Andre 3000 \u2013 Brief Bio\n\nAndr\u00e9 3000, whose real name is Andr\u00e9 Lauren Benjamin, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, and producer.

The latest evidence for this comes in his long overdue autobiography, Felix Cavaliere: Memoir of A Rascal.\n\n\u00a91967 Paul McCartney / Photographer Linda McCartney\n\nAs founder, principal songwriter and lead singer of The Rascals, Felix was the force behind nine of the greatest Top 20 hits of the mid-1960s. The roster includes the #1s \u201cGood Lovin\u2019,\u201d\u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d and \u201cPeople Gotta Be Free\u201d and the still-ubiquitous \u201cA Beautiful Morning,\u201d a #3 hit in 1968 that remains one of the most licensed tracks in movies, television and breakfast cereal adverts! As the first white act signed to the R&B-centric Atlantic Records, Felix was in the thick of the drive for civil rights. His band refused to play concerts that didn\u2019t feature a black act on the bill and crafted the aforementioned \u201cPeople Gotta Be Free\u201d and \u201cRay of Hope,\u201d two anthems of the civil rights and anti-war movements. Like his friend Beatle George, Felix\u2019s work and life were forever changed by his encounter and lifelong commitment to a guru, Swami Satchidananda. And while Cavaliere\u2019s forceful, Ray Charles-influenced vocals are often namechecked in \u201cBest Of\u201d lists, his massive chops as an instrumentalist on the Hammond Organ and as an arranger/producer are largely overlooked.\n\nCavaliere\u2019s story begins in Pelham, New York. He was the son of two Italian-American professionals, a dentist dad and pharmacist mom, who wanted him to become a doctor. While his family was solidly middle class, there was still prejudice towards them in their suburban hometown, something that would forever inform his advocacy for equal rights. His love of music began early, with eight years of thrice-weekly lessons absorbing Bach, Beethoven and Chopin. With the death of his mother when he was 13, Cavaliere changed course and channeled his grief and full energies into music. He combined his love of the classics with his new-found passion for Boogie Woogie, Fats Domino and, especially, Ray Charles, who would prove his most profound vocal and instrumental influence.\n\nIn high school, Felix would join his first band, an integrated vocal group called The Swingin\u2019 Six. He would also commence his habit of scrounging in record shops to find obscure tunes for his band to cover. This is something that would lead to his first smash hit with The Young Rascals, The Olympics\u2019 tune \u201cGood Lovin\u2019.\u201d His musical aspirations really solidified while at Syracuse University when he founded the band Felix and The Escorts. His combo would compete for gigs at frat parties with another led by a \u201cbeatnik\u201d classmate, Lou Reed. While playing a summer gig at a resort in the Catskills, Cavaliere would meet Joey Dee, leader of the Starliters of \u201cPeppermint Twist\u201d fame. Dee would soon ask him to join his band on a tour of Germany where the opening act was the pre-fame Fab Four.\n\nShortly after his return and a continued stint with the Starliters, 20-year-old Cavaliere ventured to create his own band. His began by enlisting \u201crockabilly crazy\u201d Canadian guitarist Gene Cornish, whom he had played with in the Starliters. He then found his \u201ccocky\u201d co-songwriter and co-lead vocalist Eddie Brigati at the Choo Club in Garfield. The band was completed with the stick-twirling Dino Danelli, who Cavaliere found playing at the Metropole Jazz Club in Times Square.\n\nThe band\u2019s big break came when they were discovered while playing a summer residency at The Barge in the Hamptons by Sid Bernstein, the man who brought The Beatles to Shea Stadium. Unlike many managers of the era, Bernstein and his partner Walter Hyman proved to be both fair and savvy. They set the young musicians up with their own publishing company, pension plans and also a contract with Atlantic Records, one that gave them free unlimited studio time and full creative control, right down to album cover art. It also gave them access to superlative session musicians like bassists Chuck Rainey and Ron Carter and saxman King Curtis, engineering by the renowned Tom Dowd on the world\u2019s first 8-track recorder and the arranging talents of the peerless Arif Mardin, the man behind a boatload of classics from Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack to The Bee Gees and Nora Jones.\n\nAs for their band name, Felix believes it was suggested by TV kiddie show host Soupy Sales when they went to see him to pitch themselves as his backing band. Drummer Danelli asserts he came up with it after watching The Little Rascals on TV. Either way, they at first got tagged The Young Rascals by Atlantic to avoid confusion with another very different act, The Harmonica Rascals.\n\nFelix and his band\u2019s ascent was supersonic \u2013\u201csix months from rehearsing in my parent\u2019s basement to the top of the charts with \u2018Good Lovin\u2019\u201d according to Cavaliere. Luckily for us, he devotes a good deal of the book to the writing and recording of his classic hits, many composed with Brigati.\n\nFelix would generally come up with the titles, choruses and music and leave the verses to Brigati. Atlantic only began to have confidence in their writing with the Cavaliere-penned \u201c(I\u2019ve Been) Lonely Too Long,\u201d a Top 20 from their second album, 1967\u2019s Collections. With his recollection of \u201cA Beautiful Morning,\u201d Felix discusses how it was inspired by and written in Hawaii, a locale that had a special reverence for his band. According to Felix, the #1s \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d and \u201cPeople Gotta Be Free\u201d almost weren\u2019t released. The first because of its overtly laid back Latin feel and lack of drums. This track, which spent five weeks at the top of the Top 40, was only released after the powerful DJ, Murray the K, made an appeal to label A&R chieftain Jerry Wexler. At first \u201cPeople Gotta Be Free\u201d was thought to be too controversial for release during the turbulent summer of 1968, but it was eventually issued and raced to the top of the charts.\n\nCavaliere notes The Beatles and Sgt. Pepper as influence on albums like their psychedelic Once Upon A Dream and the double-disc Freedom Suite. But at the height of their popularity, there was a mutiny in the ranks when an exhausted Cavaliere headed to Mexico for a couple of months of R&R. In his words, he went there to chill and protest the war and paying taxes to fund it. The rest of the band went into the studio to record an album without him; something that proved a dismal failure.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9Bl-x_2wzM&t=139s\n\nIn his memoir, Cavaliere shares many interesting anecdotes about life on the road and The Rascals\u2019 many TV performances, especially the grueling six-day rehearsals for each of their performances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Due to Brigati and Cornish\u2019s fear of flying, the band largely drove from gig to gig, with Felix behind the wheel. He talks about weird gigs playing a bullfighting ring in Puerto Rico, co-headlining the Fillmore West with a \u201cvery unpleasant\u201d Van Morrison, taking the stage at Shea Stadium in 1971 and his many tours to Hawaii, where he would bring along his whole family and guru. He talks of his admiration for other Italian-American stars before him, Dion and Frankie Valli, and his contemporary NYC-born hitmaker, John Sebastian of the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful. He also recalls Jimi Hendrix, whom he knew from his own time with Joey Dee and the Starliters and his efforts to try and get the guitarist away from drugs.\n\nA pivotal point in his life and art came with his meeting Swami Satchidananda through Steve Paul, owner of the famous Scene Club. Before becoming a guru, Satchidananda was a businessman who ran a company that made cars that ran on wood! After the death of his wife, Swami took to the path, something which Cavaliere did eagerly himself by becoming a vegetarian and practicing Hatha Yoga and meditation daily. His guru would give Felix the name \u201cPaalitha,\u201d for protector, and tell him that \u201cMusic and bringing joy from it was his karma.\u201d Felix\u2019s Swami would go on to open the Woodstock Festival, found a large teaching ashram called Yogaville and number among his devotees Carole King, Jeff Goldblum, model Lauren Hutton and other boldfaced names.\n\nCavaliere spends a good deal of time speaking about discrimination and his lifelong efforts to counter it. He recalls how his parents were not allowed to join the country club in Pelham due to their Italian heritage and how one of his high school classmates, Michael Schwerner, was among the three volunteers killed while registering black voters in Mississippi in 1964. He estimates he and his bandmates lost millions by having in their concert contracts the necessity of having black acts on the bill.\n\nCavaliere goes on to discuss the breakup of the band and their move from Atlantic to Columbia Records, where they made two ambitious albums in an increasing jazzy/gospel vein, Peaceful World and The Island of Real, collections whose stature has only grown with the passage of time. According to Cavaliere, Atlantic wanted to resign but only Felix as a solo artist. But he wanted to keep the band together, hence the move to Columbia. He also bemoans the premature decision by the band to sell its publishing.\n\nFelix describes his post-Rascal years with pride, from his first stint as producer for Laura Nyro to his underrated solo albums and his duo disc with Stax guitar/songwriting legend Steve Cropper. He also waxes poetic about his love of Nashville, his home for several decades and its vibrant music scene, and also the fun of touring with Ringo Starr\u2019s All-Star band. And, like any good Italian boy, he talks with deep love about the sacrifices and support of his parents and his love for partners and daughters.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for The Rascals, Steve Van Zandt may never have gotten his role as Silvio Dante in The Sopranos.

Cavaliere laments that The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream, the multimedia show/concert event Van Zandt created for the band, had such a limited Broadway run and in a subsequent tour.

He came to prominence in the early 1980s as co-founder and co-lead singer of the synthpop band Landscape, which released a top 10 hit in 1981 with the single \"Einstein a Go-Go\". Burgess is one of the main composers of Landscape's music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. After the band's break-up, he pursued a brief, moderately successful solo career releasing one mini-album, Richard James Burgess in 1984.\n\nHe launched his career as a producer with Spandau Ballet's debut UK hit \"To Cut a Long Story Short\", the first commercial success for the hitherto underground New Romantic movement.\n\nBurgess currently serves as the CEO of A2IM: American Association of Independent Music.\n\nRichard Burgess was born in London, England, and his family emigrated to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1959. He showed an early interest in music, especially drums, and bought his first drum set at the age of 14. As a drummer, he gained experience in local bands including Fred Henry, Orange, Easy Street, The Lordships and Barry Saunders. Burgess also showed an early interest in recording production, buying a portable Tandberg tape recorder when he was sixteen to make amateur recordings.\n\n\n\nBurgess studied electronics at college before turning to studies in music. In 1972, he left New Zealand to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston, and in 1973 moved to London to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He holds a PhD in musicology from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales)."}, {"url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/paul-mccartney/reassessing-paul-mccartneys-solo-career-successful", "page_content": "The release of more new music by Paul McCartney again puts his solo work into the spotlight, nearly a half century after the breakup of the Beatles. The conventional wisdom is that McCartney\u2019s AM-radio-centric solo career is disappointing and even embarrassing in comparison to his seminal work with the Fab Four. But there\u2019s also a compelling case that it can be fairly categorized as the crowning achievement of the greatest artistic career of our time.\n\nMcCartney did not do his solo legacy any favors by providing detractors with ammo by saying in a recent interview that Wings was a \u201cterrible\u201d band. They weren\u2019t, unless, of course, you\u2019re comparing them to the Beatles.\n\nBut his former partner is largely to blame for framing the perception of McCartney\u2019s solo career right from the start. In his scathing 1971 song \u201cHow Do You Sleep?\u201d John Lennon sings:\n\n\u201cA pretty face may last a year or two\n\nBut pretty soon they\u2019ll see what you can do\n\nThe sound you make is muzak to my ears\n\nYou must have learned something in all those years\u201d\n\nLennon later said he regretted that broadside, arguing (rather unconvincingly) that the song was really about himself. But the die was cast. McCartney was merely a pop creature and not a true artist.\n\nThe cruelty of Lennon\u2019s insult (or, perhaps, its genius) is that it turned McCartney\u2019s strength as a songwriter\u2014his gift for dramatic yet infectious melody\u2014into artistic baggage. This jujitsu made McCartney\u2019s historic pace of piling up No. 1 hits into an ever-expanding indictment of his rock bonafides. Lennon could win the battle for Beatles supremacy without really having to lift a finger, which he actually did not do at all for the back-half of the 1970s while McCartney dominated the charts.\n\nBut commercial success is actually an important measure of artistic achievement. No one sets out to make unpopular art. So let\u2019s dispense with the insanity of counting broad appeal as a black mark against Sir Paul.\n\nYes, artistic credibility beyond the popularity of your work is, of course, important, too. Can any of McCartney\u2019s solo work can stand alongside the work of the Beatles? Given that the Beatles set a bar higher than any band, just reaching it even intermittently is an irrefutable measure of excellence.\n\nAnd finally there is the matter of time \u2014 how long was McCartney at or near the top of his powers. Was his peak relatively short given he hasn\u2019t had a hit for over 30 years? If McCartney can check all these boxes affirmatively, there\u2019s can be no doubt his solo career counts as a smash.\n\nCommercial Success\n\nMcCartney\u2019s popularity as a solo artist is matched by only a handful of artists in rock history. He topped the charts post-Beatles nine times, a mark surpassed by just 10 artists, including the Beatles. Among solo artists that can be classified as rock, McCartney\u2019s total of No. 1 songs is surpassed by just Elvis Presley (18) and Stevie Wonder, whose 10 include \u201cThat\u2019s What Friends Are For.\u201d That charity effort for AIDS research also counts as a chart topper for Elton John, who otherwise has one less No. 1 hit than McCartney. And McCartney also has 23 top 10 hits, comparable to the totals compiled by Wonder (28) and John (27).\n\nSo McCartney followed up his time in the biggest commercial musical act in history with basically the solo career of Elton John or Stevie Wonder.\n\n\u201cTo think of all the hits and amazing music that he has achieved since, with that amount of pressure on him constantly, is truly amazing,\u201d says musician/producer Ben Rowling. \u201cExpectations were exceptionally high. At the time, the public thought that John had gone mad shacking up with Yoko and therefore were expecting crazy stuff from him, and George was always thought of as a sideman who only had a couple of tunes per album. The public was unaware that George had been stockpiling fantastic songs. This left Paul, the showman, with the unenviable task of basically carrying on the Beatles sound and legacy, which was a no-win situation.\u201d\n\nArtistic Success\n\nMcCartney\u2019s solo career is most identified with AM radio during a time when rock\u2019s coolness was quantified by its presence on FM, a format that he and the Beatles helped create.\n\n\u201cPaul\u2019s solo career is defined by his crowd-pleasing: it\u2019s what he is good at and where his heart lies,\u201d notes Robert Rodriguez, Beatles author and host of the Something About The Beatles podcast. \u201cThe guy who wanted to innovate during the 1960s evaporated in a haze of weed by the \u201970s.\u201d\n\nSeptember\u2019s Egypt Station will be McCartney\u2019s 25th solo album. He has been relentless, in stark contrast to both Lennon and Harrison before their deaths. Not only did Lennon not release anything between 1975 and 1980 (an unheard of amount of time for the era) but Harrison did not release an album in the 14 years preceding his 2001 death.\n\nYet it\u2019s fair to say that McCartney has just one widely recognized album that can stand with the Beatles\u2014Band on the Run.\n\n\u201cArtistically, (that\u2019s his) one pretty great album,\u201d says rock critic and journalist Bill Wyman, who notes the absence of other major works compared to Elton John and Wonder. \u201cHe didn\u2019t engage to explain the albums or put how he was feeling into words. He just did what he wanted to do. So it\u2019s admirable in that sense. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s predictable at all, save for the Venus and Mars/Speed of Sound period.\u201d\n\nSays Rodriguez, \u201cBand on the Run and Tug of War are the most universally regarded highlights of Paul\u2019s solo career. Runners up would include Venus and Mars, McCartney I, Flowers in the Dirt and Flaming Pie. Again, if you are a McCartney fan, these are solid releases.\u201d But, Rodriguez says, none are comparable to The Beatles.\n\n\u201cMy personal favorite is Ram\u2014his second and, in a way, the natural successor to Abbey Road. In terms of musical invention, stylistic diversity and as a showcase for Paul\u2019s skills as a writer, arranger, producer, singer and musician, it\u2019s hard to see where this one can be bested.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the other point about Paul solo\u2014he took it quite literally initially by becoming a one-man band.\n\nCould a best-of McCartney stand beside his Beatles work? A McCartney top 10 irrespective of what was released as a single could look something like this:\n\nMaybe I\u2019m Amazed\n\nJet\n\nJunk\n\nAnother Day\n\nBand On the Run\n\nComing Up\n\nNineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five\n\nLet Me Roll It\n\nLive And Let Die\n\nSilly Love Songs\n\n\u201cHow many songs in the 1970s did McCartney do that were as good as \u2018Hey Jude\u2019 or \u2018Let It Be\u2019 or \u2018Get Back,\u2019 much less \u2018Penny Lane\u2019 or \u2018Lady Madonna\u2019? None!,\u201d argues Wyman. \u201cBut despite all that he was still probably the biggest act of the 1970s. Ha!\u201d\n\nOther critics, it should be noted, count \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed\u201d is one of the best songs McCartney ever wrote, including McCartney, who said he wanted to be remembered for it.\n\nTime\n\nSharp readers will notice that none of the songs listed as McCartney\u2019s best were released after 1980\u2019s \u201cComing Up,\u201d which reportedly inspired Lennon to record music again. There have been some gems more recently but there\u2019s no denying the many misses, too.\n\nYet the arc of the careers of Wonder and Elton John are very similar. And that\u2019s no surprise. \u201cThe expectation for anybody to sustain pushing the paradigm of rock\u2019n\u2019roll in their 30s like they had in their 20s is virtually unheard of and unreasonable,\u201d notes Rodriguez, whose Beatles books include Solo In The 70s: John, Paul, George, Ringo 1970-1980.\n\nTime is the arch nemesis of all musicians. Mental prowess begins to decline age 27, according to recent research. While there is a belief that creativity peaks later, at age 42, rock musicians were not specifically studied. If you look at Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s consensus top 10 rock albums of all time, the average age of the main creators upon release was 26 and just one artist \u2014 Marvin Gaye \u2014 was over 30 (he was 32 when What\u2019s Going On was released).\n\nAnd note the reason of later peak creative development in literature and more classical forms of music is believed to be related to the amount of study and practice required before one can begin to innovate. But McCartney was a pioneer and thus blossomed at a very young age. So he\u2019s more like Albert Einstein in science, who had his \u201cmiracle year\u201d of 1905 at age 26\u2014perhaps because he had the field to himself. So McCartney had less genius left to mine as he aged. Yet he carried his peak into at least his late 30s. Wonder in comparison was 28 when the last of a similar list of his top songs was released.\n\nVerdict\n\nCommercial success is a gigantic win for McCartney. And like the inner-circle Hall of Fame baseball player, he maintained his artistic peak for much longer than could reasonably be expected, a fact obscured by his many subsequent releases (most of which have their moments up to and including his latest single).\n\nThe only controversial measure of McCartney\u2019s solo greatness is artistic success, almost hopelesly subjective. Viewing McCartney so seriously cuts against his gift of bringing as much joy as possible into the world through his music. He expressed this most movingly in the coda to his first career, \u201cAnd in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\u201d A long-ago review of \u201cSilly Love Songs\u201d sums this up best and with it McCartney himself: \u201cAn exemplary piece of pop production and a pure pleasure.\u201d If that isn\u2019t artistic success, what is it?"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rod-Stewart", "page_content": "Rod Stewart, in full Roderick David Stewart, (born January 10, 1945, London, England), British singer and songwriter whose soulful, raspy voice graced rock and pop hits beginning in the late 1960s. Stewart became an international star following the extraordinary commercial success of his landmark album Every Picture Tells a Story (1971).\n\nAlthough best known as a solo artist, Stewart achieved his first exposure and success as a member of several popular groups. After taking an early interest in folk music and rhythm and blues, he was a member of two relatively obscure London-based bands (Steampacket and Shotgun Express) in the mid-1960s before teaming with the influential guitarist Jeff Beck and future Rolling Stone Ron Wood in the Jeff Beck Group. Stewart\u2019s collaboration with Beck ended in 1969 when, after two albums, he was persuaded by Wood (who had been fired by Beck) to join the Faces. Formerly the Small Faces, the band\u2014also comprising Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones\u2014played bluesy rock that appealed to Stewart\u2019s long-standing interest in rhythm and blues. During the early 1970s the raucous Faces were among Britain\u2019s most popular live performers, and their album A Nod\u2019s as Good as a Wink\u2026to a Blind Horse (1971) remains highly regarded. Nonetheless, Stewart, determined not to be constrained by the group format, pursued a parallel solo career during his tenure with the Faces (1969\u201375).\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nReleased in 1969, his first solo album, An Old Raincoat Won\u2019t Ever Let You Down (also released as The Rod Stewart Album), was commercially disappointing, but its mixture of original and cover songs would prove to be a successful formula for Stewart. Gasoline Alley (1970) sold better and was well received by critics, but it hardly suggested what would happen in 1971. Every Picture Tells a Story charted at number one in Britain and the United States simultaneously; the single \u201cMaggie May\u201d repeated the feat; and Rolling Stone magazine named Stewart \u201crock star of the year.\u201d His next album, Never a Dull Moment (1972), and its single \u201cYou Wear It Well\u201d were also hits, as Stewart\u2019s solo work eclipsed his efforts with the Faces. Among other subsequent hits were \u201cTonight\u2019s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)\u201d and Stewart\u2019s version of Cat Stevens\u2019s \u201cThe First Cut Is the Deepest,\u201d both from the album A Night on the Town (1976); however, the critical success that Stewart had enjoyed was fast approaching an end.\n\nFor the next two decades, the hits continued to come\u2014the disco-inflected \u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy\u201d (1978), for instance, topped charts in multiple countries\u2014but much of Stewart\u2019s output was dismissed as uninspired. His cover of the 1985 Tom Waits song \u201cDowntown Train\u201d (1989) was the high point of a midcareer period generally considered inconsistent. For a time in the early 21st century, Stewart abandoned songwriting and focused solely on interpreting others\u2019 work. Beginning in 2002 he released several collections of traditional-pop standards, as well as album-length takes on rock and soul classics, that received mixed reviews but found a wide audience. For Stardust\u2026: The Great American Songbook Volume III (2004), Stewart received his first Grammy Award. He returned to writing his own material for Time (2013), a smoothly diverse set of songs that found him in a nostalgic mood, and the appealing yet uneven Another Country (2015). His 30th studio album, Blood Red Roses (2018), yielded the minor hit song \u201cDidn\u2019t I.\u201d He later released You\u2019re in My Heart: Rod Stewart with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (2019).\n\nStewart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 1994 and as a member of the Faces in 2012. He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2007. An autobiography, Rod, was published in 2012."}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/no-doubt/", "page_content": "Photo: Patrick Ford/Redferns\n\nEnduring ska-popsters No Doubt have regularly shaken hands with success over the past 20 years. Fronted by the high-profile Gwen Stefani (ranked at No.13 on VHI\u2019s \u201c100 Greatest Women In Music\u201d list in 2012), they have assembled a truly astonishing CV that includes multiple Grammy Awards and 1995\u2019s diamond-selling LP, Tragic Kingdom, while Tom Daly, the then-mayor of their hometown of Anaheim, California, even gave them the key to the city in 2002.\n\nHaving sold over 30 million albums and counting, No Doubt have enjoyed a stratospheric career and they remain a going concern; their most recent studio LP, 2012\u2019s Push And Shove, peaked at No.3 on North America\u2019s Billboard 200. However, they had to fight hard to gain a foothold on the career ladder and they initially lived through a decade of blood, sweat and tears before they gained promotion into rock\u2019s premier league.\n\nNo Doubt will forever be associated with their glamorous, ultra-photogenic vocalist Gwen Stefani, yet it was her keyboard-playing elder brother Eric who originally started the band during the mid-80s. Influenced primarily by bands such as Madness, The Beat and The Specials, who released music through Jerry Dammers\u2019 influential 2-Tone imprint on the cusp of that same decade, Eric assembled a band keen to work up their own brand of bouncy, ska-inflected party music.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn time-honoured tradition, the fledgeling band rehearsed in the Stefanis\u2019 parents\u2019 garage, their initial line-up also including vocalist John Spence, bassist Chris Leal and guitarist Jerry McMahon. By 1986, Eric had also drafted in his kid sister Gwen (who, at this stage, was just 17 and still attending nearby Fullerton College) and, by 1987, bassist Tony Kanal joined after attending one of the band\u2019s early gigs.\n\nThe band barely survived an early tragedy when John Spence committed suicide a few days before No Doubt were scheduled to play a showcase gig for industry employees at Los Angeles\u2019 renowned Roxy Theatre in December 1987. Though devastated, the band vowed to continue, with the core of their \u201cclassic\u201d line-up eventually falling into place by 1989, after the Stefanis and Kanal recruited guitarist Tom Dumont and drummer Adrian Young.\n\nNo Doubt built their reputation the old-fashioned way: gigging relentlessly in and around LA where they frequently turned in high-octane sets at venues such as The Whisky-A-Go-Go, Fender\u2019s Grand Ballroom and The Roxy, where they could often be found propping up bills for luminaries such as Fishbone and fellow SoCal ska-popsters The Untouchables. Thanks to Gwen Stefani\u2019s increasingly alluring stage presence and the band\u2019s energetic set of hooky, ska-flavoured punk-pop songs, record companies began to take note and, in 1990, No Doubt landed a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope imprint.\n\nThough they\u2019d pulled off a coup signing with the upwardly mobile and highly respected label, mainstream success initially eluded No Doubt. Their self-titled debut LP was released in 1992, but while it sold a decent 30,000 copies, it appeared at a time when grunge was still in vogue and the industry was reeling from the shockwaves emanating from Seattle. No Doubt\u2019s bright, horn-laden ska-pop was anathema at a time when bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam were shifting serious units; they doggedly toured the US in support of their self-titled debut, No Doubt struggled to attract a sizeable audience outside of their Southern Californian stomping ground.\n\nFurther problems loomed when the band were paired with producer Matthew Wilder for their second LP. Wilder had a track record \u2013 he\u2019d enjoyed a US Top 5 hit with the infectious \u2018Break My Stride\u2019 in 1984 \u2013 but Eric Stefani, especially, was unhappy about relinquishing control to an outside producer and Interscope thus sublicensed the release of the band\u2019s second LP to the small Trauma imprint.\n\nAgainst the tide, however, No Doubt\u2019s second LP, the punkier and markedly more aggressive The Beacon Street Collection, performed well in the marketplace, eventually chalking up sales of around 100,000. Heartened by the album\u2019s reception, Interscope financed No Doubt\u2019s make or break third LP, Tragic Kingdom. The creation of this pivotal record came at a price for the band, as Eric Stefani \u2013 who had been withdrawing from No Doubt since the making of The Beacon Street Collection \u2013 left the group and began working as an animator for the hit TV series The Simpsons.\n\nThis blow aside, however, Tragic Kingdom catapulted No Doubt into rock\u2019s big league. Still arguably their finest achievement, it was a wondrous collection of hooky, Blondie-esque pop spiced up by the band\u2019s hallmark, 2-Tone-esque ska inflections, and its appeal went right across the board. With help from its infectious first single \u2018Just A Girl\u2019 (which climbed to No.23 on the US Billboard chart), the LP went supernova. The world tour surrounding the album\u2019s release eventually stretched over two years and, after the LP\u2019s arguable stand-out track, the classy ballad \u2018Don\u2019t Speak\u2019, went to No.1 in America and stayed there for 16 weeks, Tragic Kingdom sold over 10 million copies in the US alone.\n\nThe album eventually went on to exceed even the most optimistic record company executive\u2019s hopes and dreams, notching up a massive 16 million sales worldwide and gaining a diamond certification in North America. A slew of industry awards followed, with the band receiving nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards, while No Doubt\u2019s earlier catalogue also took off (their previously neglected debut LP had racked up sales of over 250,000 copies by 1999).\n\nPerhaps understandably a little dazzled by such astronomical success, No Doubt embarked on a series of protracted sessions for the follow-up to Tragic Kingdom. When their fourth album was finally released, in April 2000, it struggled to replicate the success of its illustrious predecessor.\n\nNot that Return Of Saturn was inferior by any stretch of the imagination, though it was darker in hue and also featured a clutch of down-tempo ballads. It did, however, also include a couple of striking singles in the flamenco-flecked \u2018Ex-Girlfriend\u2019 and the understated, but powerful \u2018Simple Kind Of Life\u2019, which peaked at No.38 on the US Billboard 100. Return Of Saturn also charted highly in North America, where it peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 and sold 1.5 million copies, earning a platinum certification. The album\u2019s performance was perhaps modest compared with Tragic Kingdom, but it made a strong showing internationally, climbing into the Top 40 in 12 additional territories.\n\nNo Doubt\u2019s profile remained high in the new millennium and they quickly bounced back with 2001\u2019s Rock Steady: a confident, upbeat affair recorded primarily in Jamaica. Influenced by dub and Jamaican dancehall styles, the LP yielded two Grammy-winning singles, \u2018Hey Baby\u2019 (which featured Bounty Killer) and \u2018Underneath It All\u2019, which included contributions from the first lady of dancehall, Lady Saw. A star-studded affair, Rock Steady also featured input from both crack Jamaican rhythm section Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, while the legendary Prince co-wrote, produced and performed on one of the album\u2019s stand-out tracks, \u2018Waiting Room\u2019.\n\nRock Steady spawned four hit singles, with both the funky, electro-enhanced \u2018Hella Good\u2019 and Thompson Twins-esque synth-pop ballad \u2018Running\u2019 following \u2018Hey Baby\u2019 and \u2018Underneath It All\u2019 into the US Billboard Hot 100. Critically, the album was well received and it won back some of the ground the band lost with Return Of Saturn, eventually selling over 3 million copies worldwide and earning No Doubt a double-platinum certification in North America and a gold disc in the UK.\n\nWith the band\u2019s star again in the ascendant, Interscope capitalised, releasing the self-explanatory The Singles 1992-2003 in November 2003. As the title suggests, it was an entertaining hit-stuffed anthology, featuring all No Doubt\u2019s chart smashes plus one freshly recorded track, an emotive cover of Talk Talk\u2019s 1984 hit \u2018It\u2019s My Life\u2019. Another solid commercial success, the record again earned Gwen Stefani and co double-platinum certifications in both North America and Canada.\n\nNo Doubt went on an indefinite hiatus after an enthusiastically received North American tour with blink-182 in the early summer of 2004. Gwen Stefani then launched her highly successful solo career, releasing two multi-platinum-selling albums Love.Angel.Music.Baby and The Sweet Escape, which won critical plaudits galore and ensured she remained in the limelight from 2004-07.\n\nTom Dumont, Tony Kanal and Adrian Young, meanwhile, all remained busy while No Doubt remained on ice. Dumont released a downloadable LP, The Living Album, with his alt.rock side project, Invincible Overlord; Young played with the reformed Bow Wow Wow on their 2004 tour and Kanal collaborated with Pink, co-producing and co-writing two tracks on her 2008 LP Funhouse. He also found the time to reconnect with Gwen Stefani, co-writing the stately ballad \u20184 In The Morning\u2019 for her second solo LP, The Sweet Escape.\n\nAn all-new No Doubt LP was rumoured to be in the works from 2008 on, and the band played their first North American tour in five years during 2009, bringing along special guests including Bedouin Soundclash, Katy Perry and Panic! At The Disco. Interscope then released an updated singles compilation, Icon, in 2010, before the band\u2019s comeback LP, Push And Shove, finally landed in 2012. A highly credible comeback, Push And Shove was greeted with mixed reviews, but it remains one of the band\u2019s most satisfying collections, its ebullient contents veering from the Jamaican patois-imbued titular song to infectious, new wave-style tunes (\u2018Gravity\u2019; \u2018Undercover\u2019) and the tongue-in-cheek, synth-driven \u2018Looking Hot\u2019, wherein the 40-something Stefani ponders how much longer she can get away with sporting skin-tight clothes.\n\nThough a far cry from the diamond-selling Tragic Kingdom, Push And Shove also reacquainted the band with the upper echelons of the North American charts, peaking at No.3 on the US Billboard 200 upon its release in September 2012. Spurred on by the US Top 40 success of its trailer single, the Caribbean-flavoured \u2018Settle Down\u2019, it sold an impressive 115,000 copies during its first week of release in North America and also climbed to No.16 on the UK Top 40.\n\nGwen Stefani recently released a critically acclaimed new solo single, \u2018Used To Love You\u2019, through Interscope, and fans are already waiting patiently for her third solo LP, which is reputedly liable to arrive in 2016. At the time of writing, this activity is likely to take precedence over a new album from No Doubt, but rapturously received contemporary shows at 2015 festivals such as Napa Valley\u2019s Bottlerock and Chicago\u2019s Riot Fest & Carnival have made it abundantly clear that this exuberant Californian ska-pop quartet are far from taking the chequered flag as yet.\n\nWords: Tim Peacock"}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/musicians-with-the-longest-careers-2020-6", "page_content": "Tony Bennett signed his first record deal 70 years ago.\n\nTony Bennett.

During that time, he changed his name to Tony Bennett.\n\nIn 1951, his first hit single was \"Because of You.\" As he transitioned into jazz music, Bennett released his most popular song in 1962, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\" which earned him his first Grammy Award.\n\nBennett struggled to find a place for himself in the '60s and '70s as younger people became interested in rock music. But he jumped back on the scene in the '80s and '90s, creating albums like \"The Art of Excellence\" and \"Perfectly Frank.\"\n\nLater in life, Bennett became successful at producing albums made up entirely of duets with other famous artists. Most notably, he created a successful album with Lady Gaga called \"Cheek to Cheek\" in 2014, earning him another Grammy Award. He continues making duet albums today."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2Rkfd89pCW34QdPKL8wg6Ps/20-albums-that-define-1992", "page_content": "Forming in Essex, The Prodigy burst onto the scene in the early 90s and changed the direction of electronic music forever. Their acclaimed debut Experience was the brainchild of Liam Howlett, his flair for constructing energetic rave tracks across the record made for an immersive, exhilarating listening experience which redefined dance music and was central in bringing rave culture into the mainstream. Peaking at No.12 in the UK Albums Chart, the album went onto achieve platinum status in the UK. If you want to be transported to the early 90s rave scene, this is the record to listen to - perfectly capturing the energy and spirit of the time.\n\nLiam Howlett tells 6 Music about Experience: \"I was so submerged in the rave culture from 1990 leading up to this first album and that sound was just in me. To me, that whole album is like a snapshot of the sound of that period and what we were about at the time. It's a more 1992 sound, you can tell by the speed of the tunes, everything started to get faster from 1991 to 92.\"\n\n30 years on, the group are one of the most successful electronic groups of all time, spawning countless hits and earning titles such as 'the premiere dance act for the alternative masses' and 'the Godfathers of Rave'."}, {"url": "https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/music/info-2019/musicians-who-performed-at-woodstock.html", "page_content": "Hulton Deutsch/Redferns/Getty Images\n\n\"I hope I die before I get old,\u201d The Who bellowed in teen anthem \u201cMy Generation\u201d on day three of the massive gathering Aug. 15-18 in Bethel, N.Y.\n\nDrummer Keith Moon did just that.
