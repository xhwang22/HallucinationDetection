Under the direction of Lowengrund and Eichenberg, the Center opened in 1956 as the Pratt-Contemporaries Graphic Art Centre on 1343 Third Avenue in Manhattan. It moved to various locations throughout its lifespan, including 831 Broadway and then 160 Lexington Avenue in 1979. The Center was in operation through 1986 and offered workshop facilities, professional printing for artists, classes in printmaking media and exhibitions that featured students and guest artists from around the world. Some names that passed through include Andrew Stasik, who also served as Assistant Director and then Director, Ben Berns, Al Blaustein, Michael Ponce De Leon, Arnold Singer and many others.\n\n\n\nThe Pratt Adlib Press published several artists\u2019 books, including Adlib, Keepsake, Artist\u2019s Proof and Print Review. Adlib was started in 1953, three years before the Center\u2019s opening by the Illustration Department\u2019s Graphic Arts workshop. The annual publication featured distinct themes, such as \u201cModern Man\u201d and \u201cOn Brooklyn,\u201d that were mostly expressed through etchings and wood-and-linoleum cuts. It later became a project for the Art of the Book course in the Department of Graphic Arts at Pratt Institute up until its ending in 1968. Keepsake began in 1960 as an annual artist book and combined pre-published text with wood-cut and lithographic prints. Each edition arose from a collaboration of students, artists, designers, printers and authors. Artist\u2019s Proof began in 1961 as a biannual magazine that collected news and reports on artists and activities within the contemporary printmaking world. It later switched to an annual publication in 1967. Print Review was a semi-annual and fully illustrated journal in publication from 1972 to 1985. It featured articles pertaining to graphic arts and printmaking for an audience of students, teachers, scholars, artists and collectors interested in current trends within the industry."}, {"url": "https://www.archdaily.com/tag/pratt-institute", "page_content": "via Harvard GSD\n\nWith schools around the country starting back up again, it\u2019s time for the latest edition of DesignIntelligence\u2019s yearly rankings of the Top Architecture Schools in the US for both undergraduate and graduate programs.

He taught full time until his retirement in 2008, and then returned to teach part time from 2010 through 2016. From fall 1982 to fall 1984, he also served as chair of the graduate art therapy program.\n\nRobbins is remembered as a forceful and highly creative leader, author of several books and numerous articles. As a licensed psychologist and certified psychoanalyst, he was also the founder of the Institute of Expressive Analysis.\n\nRobert Wolf, BID \u201968; MPS Art Therapy and Creativity Development \u201973, shared this remembrance:\n\n\u201cArt was my teacher at Pratt when I went through the program in 1971, and later a colleague when we both taught at the Pratt New Hampshire summer institute [now referred to as the Creative Arts Therapy Low Residency Program], where we both created art together during the 1980s; he made welded metal art and I worked on stone carving, often stopping to critique each other\u2019s work. After that, he asked me to replace him as president of the Institute for Expressive Analysis when he decided to retire in the mid \u201990s. He became a dear friend during the many years since. As artists and clinicians, we shared a unique view of the world and often enjoyed long talks on the state of the world and other issues. He was always available as a source of wisdom and grounding.\u201d\n\nFormer creative arts therapy faculty member Claudia Bader, MPS Art Therapy and Creativity Development \u201977, wrote a tribute to her teacher and colleague, excerpted here:\n\n\u201cI have known Art Robbins since 1973, when I started Pratt Institute\u2019s graduate Art Therapy and Creativity Development program. . . . In 1978, he started the Institute for Expressive Analysis (IEA), from which I graduated and became director of education and then executive director of the Institute. I was the first IEA graduate to become executive director. I had been in a countertransference-oriented supervision group with him since the mid-\u201990s. He is the biggest single influence on my psychotherapeutic work.\n\n\u201cA great empowerer of women, Art was a champion of people\u2019s individuality and creativity. He continued to evolve himself, always learning and integrating new knowledge in his own creative way. I certainly benefited from this.\n\n\u201cSignificantly, in a discussion with him in 1974, I \u2018came out\u2019 to him as an astrologer. He was curious, not condemning, and asked me if I knew what sign he was. I am not someone who can guess people\u2019s sun signs. I can identify planets that are strong in people\u2019s charts; however, I stopped, breathed, and then took note of what images came to mind with him. Dark, penetrating . . . I said, I think you are a Scorpio, a sign known for its dark and penetrating energy. I was right. We were both impressed.\n\n\u201cHis openness and acceptance validated me and that supported my years of integrating astrology, creative arts, and depth psychotherapies. I remember well how in 1995, before the first day I taught art diagnosis, never having taught in a university before, having created the class in six weeks, majorly anxious, that he processed with me what my fears were about teaching. As many know, I went on to successfully teach art diagnosis, creating a technique of my own for moving into artwork at Pratt (and then in addition the New School and the School of Visual Arts) until 2021, when I decided to retire from teaching in graduate programs.\n\n\u201cThank you, Art, for it all.\u201d\n\nFormer faculty member Briana MacWilliam, MPS Art Therapy and Creativity Development \u201906, also offered this remembrance:\n\n\u201cWhen I was a student at Pratt, we were talking about the role of projection, and how to use our own projections and countertransference to become increasingly aware about the unconscious dialogue that exists in the transitional space with a client. Art asked a dance therapy student, \u2018What kind of dance do you think I would dance?\u2019 She replied, \u2018A waltz.\u2019 I thought to myself, \u2018Oh no, definitely a Lindy Hopper.\u2019 Sixteen years later, and three weeks ago, I shared that story with Art in supervision. He chuckled (without confirming my assumptions) and asked, \u2018What kind of dance would you dance with me now?\u2019 I got tearful and said, \u2018A waltz.\u2019 He said, \u2018Huh. So I\u2019ve evolved.\u2019 It\u2019s been a pleasure and a blessing to witness such an evolution.\u201d\n\nFuneral services took place on May 11, 2022, at Plaza Jewish Chapel in New York City.

As part of their time at Pratt Institute, students have the opportunity to engage with this resource through their campus experience.\n\nThis year, Pratt Foundation is piloting a new program called Foundation RAD (Research Across Disciplines), which includes a focus on getting first-year students out and about in New York City.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important aspects of RAD is the idea of an expanded teaching environment and of the city as the classroom,\u201d said Juan Jofre Lora, assistant professor in the Foundation Department. \u201cWe purposefully don\u2019t have a designated classroom space for our meetings and instead meet in a different location every week. As a result, the students are not only exposed to traditional cultural spaces in the city but to all kinds of places that are significant in one way or another. We have been to multiple parks, different neighborhoods, water treatment centers, fabrication facilities, artist studios, and maker spaces, as well as galleries and museum spaces.\u201d\n\nThe year-long immersive experience concentrates on six thematic areas\u2014community, sustainability, research, technology, social engagement, and synthesis\u2014that complement what they are learning in their studio classes.\n\n\u201cAs a non-native to this state, the field trips to sites all across the city are both educational and show another side of the city,\u201d said Hannah Wong Nakata, BID \u201926. \u201cFor example, our trip to Roosevelt Island accentuated how different neighborhoods work in harmony with each other.

They had the chance to meet Gates in the gallery, and he joined them in a conversation about his art and broader ideas of visual culture, something that resonated with the class\u2019s involvement in photography as part of literature, global events, personal issues, and technology.\n\n\u201cI always try to include photography in the broader spectrum of all art mediums,\u201d Savini said. \u201cThe students were able to talk with Theaster Gates and especially listen to the artist not only talk about his work but about art in general, social activism, and educational issues.\u201d\n\nFinn Evans, AOS Graphic Design \u201924, was impressed by Gates\u2019s insights on being intentional with creating artwork: \u201cIn the Associate Degree Programs, we are constantly encouraged to think about how we will apply the skills we learn in class to come up with creative solutions to the challenges we will face later in life. Theaster Gates thinks big, using a lot of different mediums, all while having the same message and goal in mind. Getting to meet him, see his intention, and view his work among many other talented artists was a refreshing and much-needed dose of inspiration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a student from the Southside of Chicago, the same as Theaster Gates,\u201d added Crystal Chen, AOS Graphic Design \u201924. \u201cMeeting Gates was amazing because in Chicago, there isn\u2019t a lot of room for people of color to thrive in the fields of art. He was so open to us and it meant a lot to me to see one of the heroes of my city in the flesh.

Jay Lemire, director of production/labs and material research, led the visit.\n\n\u201cThe acoustics are brilliant, and I thought the materials and the way they flowed and integrated would be interesting for this class,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThey got to see that it was a remarkable change in so many ways. The concert hall was transformed, and there is now a sense of the audience as a community.\u201d\n\nThe Artist As Curator class visiting the F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, BFA Photography \u201983, exhibition at David Zwirner (courtesy Steven Sergiovanni)\n\nIn the Artist As Curator graduate course led by Steven Sergiovanni, visiting assistant professor of fine arts, students curate an exhibition in a campus gallery for their final project. To learn about curation firsthand, they recently visited several galleries in Chelsea, including Ryan Lee Gallery and David Zwirner, which was presenting four major installations by artist and Pratt alumnus F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, BFA Photography \u201983. Two of the installations were realized for the first time after his death in 1996.\n\n\u201cOne of the wonderful things about attending school in New York is that you have the opportunity to visit galleries and museums for free,\u201d Sergiovanni said. \u201cVeronique Ansorge, the senior director at David Zwirner, gave us a tour of the exhibition and answered questions. Some of the questions she answered related to the site-specific nature of the large-scale works and how they were installed.\u201d\n\nNoormah Jamal, MFA Fine Arts (Painting and Drawing) \u201923, agreed on the importance of visiting galleries as a class group as part of an artistic education: \u201cNot only does it charge and generate meaningful discourse, a class like Artist As Curator functions to show artists another aspect of exhibition making. The gallerists during these visits make us privy to their decision-making and behind-the-scenes insight or possible limitations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge expansion of your art studies to be in the world-class, art-based city of New York,\u201d said Victoria Arthur, MFA Fine Arts (Painting) \u201923. \u201cThis was an example of how attending Pratt provides invaluable art experiences and helps emerging artists learn about the inner workings of the art world. My friend and I have also made a weekly practice of visiting new gallery shows and art museums, as well as attending show openings. Much of my inspiration as an artist comes from being exposed to all of this creativity.\u201d\n\nPratt students with Sameera Chukkapalli Holmes, visiting associate professor of interior design, at the United Nations (courtesy Sameera Chukkapalli Holmes)\n\nSameera Chukkapalli Holmes, visiting associate professor of interior design, brought her design class to the United Nations (UN) headquarters in Manhattan. The field trip was part of a studio called Space as Mirror of Life and expanded on their classroom dialogues about the meaningful potential of design.\n\n\u201cThis year, I am taking my students on a journey to understand how design can be used to both hurt and heal,\u201d Chukkapalli Holmes said. \u201cDesign has wronged us in many ways. It has failed to make us feel included at one point or another. Our visit to the United Nations headquarters in New York continued that conversation and the students\u2019 work towards designing a more just and inclusive community.\u201d\n\nChukkapalli Holmes is an Obama Leader and the founder of Needlab, a nonprofit research organization based in Barcelona that works on helping communities solve sustainability issues. Her work focuses on how design can uplift and provide dignity, with the studio engaging students in a discussion on the power of design and designers to heal and harm. This has included conversations around the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, something furthered by their visit to the UN headquarters.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to visit the place that I had just read and studied about in class felt insightful,\u201d said Priyashi Mehta, MFA Interior Design \u201924. \u201cThe interiors of the UN resonate with the idea of peace, unity, oneness, inclusivity, and equality. It makes you feel that your voice is heard, be it a small country or a large one.\u201d\n\nGCPE students at the Lefferts Historic House in Prospect Park (photo by Katie Kwok, BArch \u201923)\n\nStudents in a Graduate Center for Planning and the Environment (GCPE) advanced studio led by Adjunct Associate Professor Beth Bingham, MS City and Regional Planning \u201910, and Adjunct Professor of Interior Design Jack Travis have been working with the Prospect Park Alliance on examining the history of the 18th-century Lefferts Historic House in Prospect Park.\n\nAlong with researching and analyzing a history that spans early Dutch settlement, slaveholding, community space, and a relocation of the house from its original location to the park, they visited the site throughout the fall semester to consider its context going back to the precolonial era. The Lefferts House is currently being reimagined to center Indigenous and Black heritage in a more inclusive story about Brooklyn\u2019s past.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky to work closely with the Prospect Park Alliance staff as a new role for the Lefferts House is being considered,\u201d Bingham said. \u201cThe students were very eager to engage residents and park users as part of their research. Those local voices formed the foundation of the students\u2019 project and carried through to their final plan for the historic site.\u201d\n\nPratt students at the Hedda Sterne Foundation in the Brooklyn Navy Yard (courtesy Greg Lindquist)\n\nA visit to the Hedda Sterne Foundation in the Brooklyn Navy Yard brought together a painting class led by Visiting Instructor Theresa Daddezio in Fine Arts and a History of Art and Design class\u2014Art Since the 60s\u2014led by Greg Lindquist, visiting assistant professor of history of art and design. The students explored a chronological survey of work, publications, and archival material related to the late Romanian-born artist who engaged in Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, and the New York School after arriving in the city during World War II.\n\n\u201cVisiting the Hedda Sterne Foundation was a very inspiring experience,\u201d said Jordan Ramsey, BFA Fine Arts (Drawing) \u201925. \u201cSeeing an artist contribute so many decades of work is motivating for my future as an artist.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director Shaina Larrivee also provided a kaleidoscopic introductory narrative of Hedda Sterne\u2019s storied life and relationships with other Abstract Expressionists, as well as a portrait of how Sterne thought about painting and the role of the artist over the almost eight decades of her working life.\n\nAll of these explorations and visits enrich the Pratt student experience, where every level of learning is enhanced by the vibrant and inspiring setting of New York City."}, {"url": "https://www.pratt.edu/news/students-explore-new-ways-of-living-in-2023-nycxdesign/", "page_content": "The recent NYCxDesign festival, held from May 18 to 25 across New York City, featured members of the Pratt community presenting their innovative design work. Their projects range from modern habitats for animals to the visibility of water in public space, all proposing new ideas for 21st-century life.\n\nPratt Shows: Design, held in the ARC Building on the Pratt Brooklyn campus, was the major showcase of student work during NYCxDesign, bringing in members of the public, alumni, design professionals, and media to explore projects by hundreds of graduating students from the School of Design, School of Architecture, and School of Art. The celebration of the students\u2019 accomplishments included an energizing professional and alumni reception on May 11 to kick off the diverse presentation of what is next in design. From architectural models and jewelry designs to interactive games and prototypes for furniture, the projects reflected how students are rethinking every aspect of creation, from the design process to the final product. Major themes like confronting and communicating global climate change, social justice and community healing, and the importance of presence in making in the wake of the pandemic resonated across disciplines.\n\n\u201cThe work of our students reveals a sensitivity not only to the problems of people, but especially of the planet, while navigating creative processes with high academic rigor,\u201d said Ignacio Urbina Polo, chair of industrial design, of this year\u2019s Pratt Shows: Design.\n\nOn May 18, the NYCxDesign Student Showcase Night was held in Pratt\u2019s Higgins Hall to further highlight the forward-thinking work of the next generation of designers studying in New York City, including presentations from students at Pratt, the Cooper Union, the Fashion Institute of Technology, the Parsons School of Design, and the School of Visual Arts. The students shared their work around the theme of \u201cAdapt!,\u201d such as Haiwen Yang, MID \u201923, who presented the project Older Connections: Positive Mobility for Senior Citizens in New York City that involved interviews and co-design workshops to explore how the waiting experience for public transportation could be improved for aging populations.\n\nSpotted Lanternfly Trap and Bird Feeder by Kinako Miyake, BID \u201923, exhibited in the Pratt Industrial Design Department booth at ICFF + WantedDesign Manhattan (courtesy Ignacio Urbina Polo)\n\nAt the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) + WantedDesign Manhattan event held in the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, 14 projects by Pratt undergraduate and graduate industrial design students were featured. They included projects engaging with ideas of facilitating connection, promoting care, empowering individuals, and creating adaptive environments.\n\nFor instance, Mary Lempres, BFA Fine Arts (Painting) \u201918; MID \u201923, presented the Reef Rocket, which is an oyster reef structure grown from biocement, while Kinako Miyake, BID \u201923, exhibited a trap for the invasive spotted lanternfly that doubles as a bird feeder and Myles Chisholm, BID \u201923, presented a cooling collar designed for extreme heat.\n\nA jewelry table by Rose Moon, BID \u201923, exhibited at ICFF + WantedDesign Manhattan (courtesy Rose Moon)\n\n\u201cI enjoyed seeing my work relative to the work of other designers,\u201d said Rose Moon, BID \u201923, who exhibited a jewelry table made of wood and multicolored ceramic boxes that can be flipped and reorganized to create visual patterns. \u201cMy piece took on a new character as it contrasted with the furniture around it. In this context, I could see the influences that characterize my work clearly, as well as learn about what defined the work of others.\u201d\n\nSeveral Pratt students were recognized for their work at the NYCxDESIGN Awards, which honor products and projects in different areas of design. The winners in the Student Design category, which were published in Interior Design magazine, include Anushritha Sunil, MID \u201922, Meiqing Tian, MID \u201924, and Siyu Xiao, BID \u201924.\n\nDelta by Siyu Xiao, BID \u201924, which received an NYCxDESIGN Award (courtesy Siyu Xiao)\n\nSunil was honored for Momi, a piece that uses lights and a sensory movement rug to encourage children to learn and connect with their bodies. It was developed while Sunil was a student at Pratt in partnership with teachers at Brooklyn\u2019s PS 270 Johann Dekalb School. Tian was honored for the Clip Chair, which is a seating design that is named for its evocation of a paper clip in its shape and can be used either outside or indoors. Xiao was honored for Delta, which is an intelligent campus street lamp with solar panels that provide and store clean energy.\n\nThe WantedDesign Schools Workshop (courtesy Maseo Velasquez)\n\nPratt students Paul Lagasse, MFA Interior Design \u201925, Chieh \u201cJenny\u201d Lee, MFA Interior Design \u201925, Maseo Velasquez, BID \u201924, Nicole Yuen, MID \u201925, participated in the WantedDesign Schools Workshop held during NYCxDesign at Industry City in Brooklyn. Pratt has been involved in the initiative, which brings together international design students to develop creative solutions, since 2014. The 2023 theme was Water Matter(s), and the students from six schools in the United States, Mexico, France, and El Salvador spent four days creating projects that consider water access and visibility in New York City in the context of climate change.\n\nMockup for the Urban Flow project (courtesy Maseo Velasquez)\n\n\u201cMy greatest takeaway was learning how to work with designers with different skill sets, backgrounds, and methodologies,\u201d said Maseo Velasquez, BID \u201924, who was part of a team that won the Best of Workshop award for Urban Flow. The project proposes using the New York City subway I-beams for fountains and creating an ad campaign that would promote water accessibility and make the stations more inviting. \u201cOur group consisted of industrial, fashion, interior, and strategic designers from Mexico, France, and the USA. Everyone had different perspectives and ways of working, and everyone came up with more ideas for our project than anyone could do alone. It ended up making our concept much more far-reaching and relevant.\u201d\n\nPratt faculty also presented their work during NYCxDesign, including Constantin Boym, professor of industrial design, who exhibited his Ecophilia series of modern habitats for plants and animals in the courtyard of the Penny Williamsburg hotel. His work, presented in collaboration with the Available Items gallery in the Hudson Valley, was highlighted by the New York Times and is featured in a new publication. The habitats, ranging from a home for bats to worm towers, are intended to be accessible for anyone to build, promoting a more ecologically friendly world.\n\nAt the Juliana Curran Terian Gallery on the Brooklyn campus, Amanda Huynh, assistant professor of industrial design, and Ranee Lee, associate professor of industrial design at OCAD University in Toronto, presented One Lovely Hour. The research project involves an exhibition and a plate design. All of these elements engage with how to serve a meal in a care-home setting to encourage conversations on memory and dignity for older adults, particularly those with dementia. The One Lovely Hour panel discussion for NYCxDesign was held alongside Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month and centered on a conversation about the need to care for aging people through considerations of culture and design.\n\nAlso honoring AAPI Heritage Month was an event with A Rising Tide and AAPI Design hosted by the Pratt School of Architecture at Pratt Manhattan Gallery. The celebration recognized Asian and Pacific Islanders in design through presentations by emerging design firms and a networking hour.\n\nThrough conversations, presentations, exhibitions, and collaborations, the events of NYCxDesign celebrated the inspiring work taking place across the city and recognized how emerging designers are transforming their fields."}]}
