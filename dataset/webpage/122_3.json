He joined the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI) in the early 1970s and went on to act as its general secretary (1974-82). In addition he was to represent the party on Belfast City Council (1977-85) and in October 1982 was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the constituency of North Down (1982-86). Then in 1984 Cushnahan succeeded Oliver Napier as leader of the APNI (1984-87) and in this role attempted to strengthen his party's ties with the British Liberals. The biggest test of his leadership however came with the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) and he went on to ensure that the APNI largely supported its implementation. Frustrated with the lack of any immediate indication of devolved powers being returned to Northern Ireland, he then decided to resign as party leader in 1987. In 1989, after having moved to the Republic of Ireland, Cushnahan joined Fine Gael (FG) and succeeded in being elected in 1989 as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the constituency of Munster (1989-2004).

In my email, I drew their attention to the forthcoming anniversary, providing them with a link to the details of it \u2014 in which the IRA attempted to murder 14 Protestant workers 16 miles from Omagh.\n\nThis was a naked sectarian act. Eight of them died in the bombing of their vehicle, and the remainder suffered horrific injuries.\n\nOn this Sunday and Monday, the event of 30 years ago was given widespread coverage in the daily newspapers in the North, and the BBC and UTV. Here, I only saw two reports of the anniversary of the Teebane slaughter, and the Examiner was the only paper to contact me directly and asked me to write an opinion piece on the subject, which you are now reading.\n\nMy purpose in sending the email was hoping to encourage them to report on this atrocity, because I have become increasingly frustrated and annoyed at the imbalance in the coverage of the atrocities that occurred during the Northern Ireland Troubles.\n\nMy perception is that there appears to be a concentration in the Irish media primarily on atrocities that involved collusion between loyalist paramilitary organisations and a small number of corrupt members of Northern Ireland\u2019s security forces, and also on the British Parachute Regiment who murdered innocents, particularly Catholics in Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday in Derry, but not only there.\n\nLet me state unequivocally that I totally support the exposure of proven instances of collusion and murder by the security forces and the prosecution of those responsible.\n\nAtrocities analysis\n\nHowever, my perception is that the media in this part of Ireland in recent times rarely broadcasts documentaries or publishes analytical articles detailing the scale and sectarian nature of IRA atrocities that happened during the Troubles, particularly when the Provisional IRA was responsible for the murders of 52% of the 3,523 victims that were killed.\n\nFive other republican terrorist groups were responsible for another 7%; 1,020 (20%) were attributed to loyalist paramilitary groups; 368 (10%) to security forces (and many of these were killed in firefights between the security forces and either loyalist or republican terrorists).\n\nWhen these figures are analysed further, it emerges that victims consisted of 1,855 civilians; 1,123 members of the security forces; 394 members of republican terrorist groups, and 151 members of loyalist paramilitary groups.\n\nI pose this question to our media; if you were to analyse the recent publication and broadcasting of the major and controversial incidents of the Troubles, would you not agree that it does not accurately reflect where the true responsibility lies for the suffering and heartbreak and pain that was callously inflicted on the families of the victims?\n\nI am not claiming that there is any bias or deliberate misleading by journalists here.\n\nAs a leading politician in the North during the worst of the Troubles, I worked very closely with Belfast- and Dublin-based journalists of RT\u00c9, the Irish Times, the Irish Independent, the Irish Press and the Examiner. The quality, integrity, and courage of their reporting was beyond reproach.\n\nI would say the same about their successors in their present-day reporting of Northern Ireland matters. A particular example of this is the recently retired northern editor of RT\u00c9, Tommie Gorman.\n\nHowever, I still maintain my main point \u2014 the recent reporting of those\n\nresponsible for violence in the North prior to the Good Friday Agreement is unbalanced\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that too many of our journalists (and voters) are too young to remember what happened in the northeastern part of our country in the years between 1970 and 2000.\n\nBut no matter what the reason, I hope that my comments will provide cause for reflection, not least of all because, in my opinion, there are significant consequences that flow from the current imbalance. I know my view on this is shared by many people, not only across the political divide here in the Republic, but also across the traditional divide in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nI believe it influences young people in the Republic of Ireland to believe that the IRA campaign was justified. It feeds the Sinn F\u00e9in narrative, and encourages them to continue to glorify and excuse the murders that the IRA committed; and to continue to refuse to offer any apologies for what happened and therefore prolong the suffering and pain which continues to be experienced by the families whose fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters they callously murdered.\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former leader of the Alliance Party and a former Fine Gael MEP"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/john_wall.cushnahan/942638", "page_content": "John Wall Cushnahan Edit Profile\n\nMember of the European Parliament\n\nJohn Walls Cushnahan is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael.\n\nBackground CUSHNAHAN, John Wall was born on July 23, 1948.\n\nEducation Queen\u2019s University, Belfast.

This has produced centrifugal tendencies in Northern Irish politics, benefiting Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP at the expense of the political centre, and failing to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of first ministers.\n\nThere is still no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the nationalist and unionist traditions, and \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of republican and loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. He calls for public apologies from those who perpetrated and supported paramilitary violence, greater efforts on integrated housing and education, action plans to remove peace walls (the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, actually entrenching division), and more reciprocal, mutual respect, criticising for instance Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s veto of a monument to commemorate the Northern Ireland Centenary at Stormont.\n\nIn the case of a border poll, Cushnahan wants to avoid the pitfalls of Brexit, where voters had minimal information on the realistic options and consequences after a Leave victory. He calls for the British and Irish governments to fund a multi-university research project, to explore in detail the options for Irish unification. This work should examine different state models for a united Ireland \u2013 a \u201cunitary, federal or confederal\u201d state \u2013 as well as possible \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, \u201cgovernment culture and citizenship\u201d, and how contingencies such as Scottish independence would affect unification. This research would provide \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d, without recommending a particular course of action. The ultimate decision would lie with the electorate, but they should be as well informed as possible.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former student Civil Rights activist and General Secretary of the Alliance Party (1974-82) when he was the party\u2019s only full-time politician. John was a Councillor for North Belfast 1977-85 and in 1982, was elected as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the staunchly unionist constituency of North Down. John was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was Alliance Party Chief Whip (1982-4 ) and party leader 1984-7. When the Unionist parties used the Assembly's procedures to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in December 1985, John called on the British Government to dissolve the Assembly. This terminated his income as a full-time politician. Despite this, he led the Alliance Party into the June 1987 Westminster Election where the party doubled its share of the vote from 5-10% (this tally was not exceeded until 2019). He retired as Alliance Leader in September 1987. In 1989, he was invited by Fine Gael to contest the European Parliament (EP) election in the strongly nationalist Munster constituency. After being re-elected twice, he retired in 2004. During this period, John was elected Vice President of the EP Regional Policy and Foreign Affairs Committees and was EP rapporteur on Interreg, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kashmir. John was also appointed by the EU Council as Head of Mission to lead multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams in South Asia on five occasions, the objective of which was to strengthen Democracy and Human Rights in the region.\n\nWatch the conversation\n\nWhat was said?\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d, says John Cushnahan, but it has fallen far short of its aspirations. After the Agreement was ratified, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. Cushnahan paints a bleak picture of the peace process and democracy\u2019s success in post-conflict Northern Ireland. There is no bill of rights, no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in education and housing. The \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of Republican and Loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. The biggest failure for Cushnahan, however, is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political institutions\u201d. He notes how the Stormont Executive has collapsed at least six times since 1999 (nine according some academics), and hasn\u2019t sat for ten out of twenty two years since power-sharing was installed. But Cushnahan is still convinced and determined that the Good Friday Agreement can be amended to finally meet aspirations.\n\nJohn Cushnahan was born in 1948 to a working-class Catholic family in the lower Falls, Belfast. He was involved in student civil rights activism before entering elected politics. He became General Secretary of the Alliance Party in 1974, at the time the party\u2019s only full time employee, and sat on the Belfast City Council from 1977-85. He served as Alliance Party leader from 1984-7, a difficult period in which Alliance backed the Anglo-Irish Agreement against concerted Unionist opposition. When Unionists blocked the Agreement, which would give the Irish Republic a consultative role in governing Northern Ireland, Cushnahan called on the British Government to prorogue Stormont. Stormont was dissolved in 1986, and Cushnahan soon after resigned his position in Alliance and moved to the Republic. Joining Fine Gael, he served as a member of the European Parliament from 1989-2004. Barry Colfer commends him for having \u201cdone more than most to build bridges North-South and East-West in British and Irish politics\u201d. Long retired from elected office, Cushnahan is still deeply engaged with politics, brimming with analysis and suggestions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should just discard the Good Friday Agreement\u201d, Cushnahan says. We should \u201creview it, see where it\u2019s defective and make corrective decisions\u201d. He particularly wants revisions to the power-sharing system established by Good Friday and the subsequent St Andrew's Agreement (2006), in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership. Cushnahan argues that this system has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. These centrifugal tendencies have weakened the political centre in Northern Ireland \u2013 the UUP, Alliance and SDLP \u2013 and have failed to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of the first minister roles.\n\nCushnahan also wants greater efforts towards reconciliation, to meet the unfulfilled aspirations of Good Friday. Audience member, former Alliance Chairman, Phillip McGarry, asks whether Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d defence of IRA violence serves to \u201cundermine\u201d reconciliation, while Fergal McCarthy enquires about possible policies for reconciliation? Cushnahan offers some solutions. He calls for a roadmap to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in cities such as Belfast \u2013 they are the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, and only entrench segregation. He also calls for greater efforts at integrating education and housing. With regards to housing, he suggests removing all paramilitary murals as a productive first step. Cushnahan is scathing about all attempts to defend paramilitary violence. \u201cHow can anyone expect reconciliation in Northern Ireland when paramilitaries on both sides continue to glorify their actions?\u201d They should publicly apologise and commit to peaceful, democratic methods in future. Apologies would \u201cgive some comfort to the 3000 families whose relatives were slaughtered in the Troubles. And that would be an important psychological first step.\u201d\n\nCushnahan also addresses the framework for a border poll. Noting the ambiguities of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland Act of 1998 on how a poll should be initiated, Cushnahan argues that two thirds of Assembly votes should be required to schedule one. If a poll is scheduled, Cushnahan is determined to avoid the pitfalls of the Brexit referendum, where voters had minimal information on the realistic consequences of a Leave vote. He criticises Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s campaigns for reunification as \u201csloganizing\u201d and insubstantial, and draws parallels between the party and Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories \u2013 both are \u201ccynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage\u201d.\n\nCushnahan wants voters to be as informed as possible before a border poll, and calls for the British and Irish governments to fund multi-university research projects with \u201cdetailed analysis of the options\u201d for Irish unification. This research, \u201ccoordinated under a single organisational umbrella\u201d, would explore diverse aspects of unification. It would cover potential state models (unitary, federal and confederal), \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, government and citizenship in a united Ireland, and the effects of \u201cpossible shocks\u201d such as Scottish independence.

Furthermore, the fact they have shown little respect for the unionist tradition or British identity is totally counterproductive,\" he said.\n\n\"This is all the more worrying when, if as the opinion polls are predicting that after the next elections in both parts of Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in will be the largest political party on the island of Ireland.\"\n\nThe former Alliance leader said the Sinn F\u00e9in's new-found status would \"place on them an important responsibility to unequivocally prove that they will actually support the principle that the unionist tradition will be treated respectfully and equally in any future al Ireland arrangement\".\n\n\"However, my fear is that Sinn F\u00e9in are merely replicating the Boris Johnson campaign on Brexit where both are cynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage,\" he said.\n\nMr Cushnahan said the debate about Irish unity needed to be \"inclusive and informed\", a role he believes would be best fulfilled by the academic community.\n\nHe said the British and Irish governments should fund an inter-university project involving institutions in the north, the Republic and Britain.\n\n\"Their task should be to provide a detailed analysis of the options without coming to conclusions about any particular one of them,\" he said.\n\nThe former MEP said the research should examine various political/institutional/constitutional options, including a consideration of the current constitutional structure with proposals to strengthen all -Ireland co-operation in education, health and the economy.\n\nHowever, he said the main area of consideration should be an all-Ireland constitutional arrangement, where governance options such as a unitary state, federal state, confederal state should be discussed, alongside proposals on funding for areas like pensions and defence.\n\nHe also advocates the \"continued monitoring of further possible shocks\" such as Scottish independence.\n\n\"All of these actions would be intended to inform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll that might take place,\" Mr Cushnahan said."}, {"url": "https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/biography/Cushnahan_John_1998.html", "page_content": "Brief Biography: John Cushnahan was born in Belfast and later graduated from Queen's University Belfast with a degree in Education before going to work as teacher. He joined the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI) in the early 1970s and went on to act as its general secretary (1974-82). In addition he was to represent the party on Belfast City Council (1977-85) and in October 1982 was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the constituency of North Down (1982-86). Then in 1984 Cushnahan succeeded Oliver Napier as leader of the APNI (1984-87) and in this role attempted to strengthen his party's ties with the British Liberals. The biggest test of his leadership however came with the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) and he went on to ensure that the APNI largely supported its implementation. Frustrated with the lack of any immediate indication of devolved powers being returned to Northern Ireland, he then decided to resign as party leader in 1987. In 1989, after having moved to the Republic of Ireland, Cushnahan joined Fine Gael (FG) and succeeded in being elected in 1989 as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the constituency of Munster (1989-2004). He announced early in 2004 his intention to stand down as an MEP.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1700035", "page_content": "John Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael .\n\nCushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics.

In my email, I drew their attention to the forthcoming anniversary, providing them with a link to the details of it \u2014 in which the IRA attempted to murder 14 Protestant workers 16 miles from Omagh.\n\nThis was a naked sectarian act. Eight of them died in the bombing of their vehicle, and the remainder suffered horrific injuries.\n\nOn this Sunday and Monday, the event of 30 years ago was given widespread coverage in the daily newspapers in the North, and the BBC and UTV. Here, I only saw two reports of the anniversary of the Teebane slaughter, and the Examiner was the only paper to contact me directly and asked me to write an opinion piece on the subject, which you are now reading.\n\nMy purpose in sending the email was hoping to encourage them to report on this atrocity, because I have become increasingly frustrated and annoyed at the imbalance in the coverage of the atrocities that occurred during the Northern Ireland Troubles.\n\nMy perception is that there appears to be a concentration in the Irish media primarily on atrocities that involved collusion between loyalist paramilitary organisations and a small number of corrupt members of Northern Ireland\u2019s security forces, and also on the British Parachute Regiment who murdered innocents, particularly Catholics in Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday in Derry, but not only there.\n\nLet me state unequivocally that I totally support the exposure of proven instances of collusion and murder by the security forces and the prosecution of those responsible.\n\nAtrocities analysis\n\nHowever, my perception is that the media in this part of Ireland in recent times rarely broadcasts documentaries or publishes analytical articles detailing the scale and sectarian nature of IRA atrocities that happened during the Troubles, particularly when the Provisional IRA was responsible for the murders of 52% of the 3,523 victims that were killed.\n\nFive other republican terrorist groups were responsible for another 7%; 1,020 (20%) were attributed to loyalist paramilitary groups; 368 (10%) to security forces (and many of these were killed in firefights between the security forces and either loyalist or republican terrorists).\n\nWhen these figures are analysed further, it emerges that victims consisted of 1,855 civilians; 1,123 members of the security forces; 394 members of republican terrorist groups, and 151 members of loyalist paramilitary groups.\n\nI pose this question to our media; if you were to analyse the recent publication and broadcasting of the major and controversial incidents of the Troubles, would you not agree that it does not accurately reflect where the true responsibility lies for the suffering and heartbreak and pain that was callously inflicted on the families of the victims?\n\nI am not claiming that there is any bias or deliberate misleading by journalists here.\n\nAs a leading politician in the North during the worst of the Troubles, I worked very closely with Belfast- and Dublin-based journalists of RT\u00c9, the Irish Times, the Irish Independent, the Irish Press and the Examiner. The quality, integrity, and courage of their reporting was beyond reproach.\n\nI would say the same about their successors in their present-day reporting of Northern Ireland matters. A particular example of this is the recently retired northern editor of RT\u00c9, Tommie Gorman.\n\nHowever, I still maintain my main point \u2014 the recent reporting of those\n\nresponsible for violence in the North prior to the Good Friday Agreement is unbalanced\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that too many of our journalists (and voters) are too young to remember what happened in the northeastern part of our country in the years between 1970 and 2000.\n\nBut no matter what the reason, I hope that my comments will provide cause for reflection, not least of all because, in my opinion, there are significant consequences that flow from the current imbalance. I know my view on this is shared by many people, not only across the political divide here in the Republic, but also across the traditional divide in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nI believe it influences young people in the Republic of Ireland to believe that the IRA campaign was justified. It feeds the Sinn F\u00e9in narrative, and encourages them to continue to glorify and excuse the murders that the IRA committed; and to continue to refuse to offer any apologies for what happened and therefore prolong the suffering and pain which continues to be experienced by the families whose fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters they callously murdered.\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former leader of the Alliance Party and a former Fine Gael MEP"}]}
