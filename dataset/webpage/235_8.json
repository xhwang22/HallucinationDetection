But decades earlier at a U.S. Open at Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio, they had been young men playing their way into golf history . . . and playing . . . and playing . . . and playing.\n\nFive days.\n\nFour regulation rounds.\n\nOne 36-hole playoff. And then, for good measure, one more.\n\nOne-hundred-forty-four holes total.\n\nA combined 1,179 strokes.\n\nAnd when on July 6, 1931, this epic national open had come to a merciful end, the final score was tilted in Burke\u2019s favor, 589 to Von Elm\u2019s 590.\n\nOne meager swing. After all that work in 90-degree heat, that is all that separated the two, and it was all Burke, then 28, could do to stand up and lift the U.S. Open trophy handed to him by U.S. Golf Association President Herbert H. Ramsay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry it had to end this way,\u201d Burke said, looking directly at Von Elm.\n\nThe 30-year-old Von Elm nodded his head. He, too, was sorry it had ended the way it had.\n\nChances are, however, everyone \u2013 Burke and Von Elm included \u2013 was happy that it simply had ended, because at so many times it appeared as if it never would.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThough for duration it is No. 1 in a line of 110 U.S. Opens, the 1931 edition hardly stirs the emotions \u2013 certainly not like 1913, 1950-51, 1960, 1962, 1982 or 2000. Oh, and 1930, which remains a U.S. Open that unlocks a big part of the mystery as to why 1931 has never been warmly embraced.\n\nIn 1930, Bobby Jones commanded the golf stage.\n\nIn 1931, he sat in the audience.\n\nIt was a reality that William Richardson of The New York Times could not overlook.\n\n\u201cThe hold that Jones had on golf galleries,\u201d Richardson wrote, \u201cwas clearly reflected by the smallness of the Toledo gallery. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd as if he were laying a foundation for the Tiger Woods cliched storyline that is popular 80 years later, Richardson bemoaned Jones\u2019 absence by opining, \u201cThere is no single outstanding figure in the game today.\u201d\n\nOne year earlier, Jones had won his fourth U.S. Open as part of golf\u2019s greatest feat, the vaunted \u201cGrand Slam,\u201d so his retirement had shaken the sport.\n\nYet even in retirement, Jones attracted the most attention, fans swarming him as he left Toledo\u2019s posh Commodore Perry Hotel, paying little attention to what Burke, Von Elm and others were doing over an Inverness layout that was a severe challenge, despite being only 6,529 yards.\n\nVon Elm, at least, had been here before. A suave and talented player out of Utah who had become a celebrity of sorts in Los Angeles, Von Elm may have been regarded as the premier player in the golden age of amateur golf \u2013 if not for Jones. Von Elm lost in the 1924 U.S. Amateur final against Jones, then in the semifinals a year later. But in 1926, Von Elm gained revenge, beating Jones for the title.\n\nSouring on amateur golf \u2013 he said it had cost him $50,000 in the 1920s to chase amateur titles in France and Britain \u2013 Von Elm, at the same time Jones retired, declared himself a \u201cbusinessman golfer.\u201d Thus, Von Elm was no surprise when he fired the only sub-70 score at the 1931 U.S. Open, a second-round 69, and seized the 36-hole lead at 2-over 144. Burke was a stroke back, though dispatches focused on the marquee names well behind: Gene Sarazen, Walter Hagen and Tommy Armour.\n\nPlay the Golfweek Major Challenge\n\nClick here to enter our fantasy contest for the U.S. Open and win great prizes! Free to enter!\n\nWhat an 80-year view provides, however, is perspective on Burke\u2019s brilliant stretch of golf that summer.\n\nThe Connecticut native played in a 72-hole competition June 18-21 at Scioto Country Club in Columbus, Ohio, for 14 invited professionals and earned one of three spots onto the U.S. Ryder Cup team. The next week, again at Scioto, Burke twice was sent out first by Hagen in the Ryder Cup \u2013 teaming with Wiffy Cox for a foursomes victory, then crushing Archie Compston, 7 and 6, in singles. In Toledo, a second-round 72 set up a head-to-head, 36-hole regulation final on the only July Fourth in U.S. Open history.\n\nLittle did anyone know the sort of historic ordeal that was about to unfold.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nSidelights to the 1931 U.S. Open were plentiful, from it being the first one to be broadcast on radio (O.B. Keeler described the action), to Burke being the first winner to use steel shafts (Von Elm employed hickory), to the one-year trial with the \u201cballoon ball,\u201d which measured 1.68 inches in diameter and weighed 1.55 ounces.\n\nHenry Cotton, then 24, made the first of his two U.S. Open appearances, but shot 80-82 and missed the cut, while another Brit, Compston, was disqualified for missing a 10:45 a.m. tee time. Jones drew a crowd as he left Toledo on Friday to attend the Max Schmeling-Young Stribling fight in Cleveland, but was on hand for the 36-hole regulation finale.\n\nWhat Jones saw that July Fourth Saturday was the cigarette-smoking Von Elm shooting a third-round 73 for 217 total to go up by two over the cigar-chomping Burke, who posted 74. Burke hung tough, however, and pulled ahead late in Round 4 when Von Elm bogeyed 15 and 16. With a birdie at 18, though, Von Elm pulled even with Burke, both at 8-over 292.\n\nFor the 13th time in 35 U.S. Opens, a playoff would be needed. The first 10 had been decided by 18 extra holes, but that format had been changed in spring 1928 to 36 holes. With Jones involved in 1928 (he lost to Johnny Farrell) and \u201929 (he beat Al Espinosa), the longer session was favorably accepted, but 1931 would change USGA thinking yet again.\n\nFor good reason, too. It hardly was captivating golf, save for one flurry of drama in Monday\u2019s first 36-hole playoff. Burke had shot 73 in the morning to take a two-stroke lead, built it to four, but Von Elm stormed back with four consecutive birdies to move back in front. Burke then rallied to go a stroke ahead, but Von Elm, as he had done the day before, made a clutch birdie at 18 to force another 36-hole playoff.\n\n\u201cNeither professional nor amateur (Von Elm) is in a classification all his own \u2013 namely that of businessman golfer,\u201d Richard wrote in the Times.\n\nPerhaps Von Elm was that good. Perhaps, too, Burke was a worthy foe. But USGA officials were disappointed so few came out to watch. Some blamed the scorching heat. Others criticized the whopping $3 admission (about $44 in today\u2019s money). But, wrote Richardson: \u201cYou can bet\n\ndollars to doughnuts, had Jones been a contestant, neither heat nor price could have kept people away.\u201d\n\nFor the second 36-hole playoff, on July 6, admission was cut to $2; it was reduced to $1 for the final 18.\n\nIt worked, too, because thousands more watched as the longest U.S. Open came to an end. Trailing by one after a morning 77, Burke pulled even, then went ahead when Von Elm drove wildly and bogeyed 14. Then, at 16, the former amateur champ missed a 2-foot putt for par and fell two down.\n\nBut it had gone this long because neither man had seized momentum nor quit scrapping. Huffing away on his cigars \u2013 \u201cI had to see how the wind was blowing,\u201d he quipped \u2013 the man who had been born Billy Burkowski and had worked as a puddler in a foundry saw his lead reduced to one at 17, which brought the players to the 18th hole for an eighth time. Von Elm had birdied it four times previously \u2013 twice to force an extra 36 holes \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t do it again. His long putt came up just short, leaving Burke to finally draw the curtain down with\n\nhis 589th stroke, a short putt for par.\n\nFor their five days, eight rounds, 144 holes and unyielding patience, Burke was rewarded with $1,000, Von Elm with $750. USGA officials, meanwhile, had been served a dose of reality. In January 1932, Ramsay announced that U.S. Open playoffs would be 18 holes, not 36.\n\nNo one disagreed with the decision, but writing about the infamous 1931 playoff that would never end, John Kieran of the Times imagined how it might have played out had Von Elm for a third consecutive day made birdie at 18 to force a third 36-hole playoff.\n\n\u201cThey would have gone out the next day \u2013 on horseback,\u201d Kieran wrote. \u201cThey were a footsore pair at the finish.\u201d\n\nExhausting and historic as it may have been, the 1931 U.S. Open did not thrust Burke nor Von Elm to everlasting fame. Burke played in the 1933 Ryder Cup, but soon settled into a lengthy career as head professional at Cleveland Country Club before retiring to Clearwater, Fla. Von Elm was legendary in Southern California golf circles, reportedly counted Bob Hope and Bing Crosby among his students, then moved to Idaho, where he built and designed courses.\n\nTheir paths rarely crossed after 1931, which is perhaps fitting.\n\nThey had seen each other plenty at Inverness all those torrid days.\n\n2011 U.S. Open: Tournament preview\n\n\u2022 Play the Golfweek Major Challenge: Click here to enter our fantasy contest for the U.S. Open and win great prizes!

He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.liveabout.com/british-amateur-championship-1562637", "page_content": "The British Am, whose official title is simply The Amateur Championship, is one of the two most important amateur men's tournaments each year (the other being the U.S. Amateur Championship).

The Amateur Championship is played a month earlier than the Open Championship each year.\n\nTournament format: After two days of stroke play, 288 golfers are cut to the 64 who continue to match play.

The R&A began running the tournament in 1921.\n\nJohn Ball won the most titles with eight, the first in 1888 and the last in 1912. Despite all those wins, Ball never claimed back-to-back championships.\n\nSince World War II, the player with the most wins is Sir Michael Bonallack with five.\n\nThree of Bonallack's victories were consecutive, 1968-70. Bonallack is the only golfer to win the British Am three straight years.\n\nOnly three golfers have won both the British Amateur and the British Open in their careers: Ball, Harold Hilton and Bobby Jones.\n\nJones' lone win in the British Am was in 1930, his Grand Slam year. The British Am was the first of the four major tournaments Jones won that year, followed by the British Open, the U.S. Open, and finally the U.S. Amateur.\n\nThe first American golfer to win the British Amateur was Walter Travis in 1904, but Travis emigrated to the U.S. after being born in Australia. The first golfer born in the U.S. to win the British Am was Jess Sweetser in 1926.\n\nSweetser's victory in 1926 followed a remarkable act of sportsmanship on his part. His opponent in the final, A.F. Simpson, missed the tee time after his car broke down en route to the course. The R&A was set to declare Sweetser the winner by forfeit, but Sweetser insisted they wait for Simpson to arrive. Simpson showed up an hour late (on bicycle), and Sweetser then won the championship match 6 and 5.\n\nLawson Little won both the U.S. and British amateur championships in 1934, and did it again in 1935. He's the only golfer to sweep both events in back-to-back years.\n\nThe first golfer to win both the British Amateur and U.S. Amateur in the same year was Harold Hilton, in 1911.\n\nBritish Amateur Championship Winners\n\nHere are recent winners of the British Amateur (full list here):\n\n2019 - James Sugrue def.

This feat would later be called the Grand Slam, although the modern professional version includes the U.S. Open, British Open, Masters and PGA Championship.\n\nIn 1930, the Masters was four years from its inception and Jones could not compete in the fledgling PGA Championship because of his amateur status.\n\nSo the Atlanta native set out to accomplish the rarest of feats, win the four preeminent golf championships of his era: the U.S. Open, British Open, U.S. Amateur and British Amateur.\n\nEighty years ago, on Sept. 22, Jones defeated Eugene Homans, 8 and 7, before a crowd estimated at 18,000 to complete the quest. A scorecard of that scheduled 36-hole final is on display at the USGA Museum in Far Hills, N.J.\n\nWhile most of the U.S. \u2013 and the world for that matter \u2013 was in the throes of the Great Depression, Jones gave the public something to feel good about. No one has since been able to claim all four of golf\u2019s major championships in a calendar year, although Tiger Woods captured four consecutive majors in 2000-2001. Ben Hogan also won three majors in 1953, but he was unable to compete in the PGA Championship due to a scheduling conflict with the British Open.\n\nJones figured 1930 was the right time to make a run at history. He had quietly thought of retiring from competitive golf to focus more on his family and law practice in Atlanta. With the biennial Walker Cup Match scheduled for the spring of 1930, Jones set sail that April as the USA\u2019s playing captain.\n\nA USA victory at Royal St. George\u2019s in Sandwich, England, preceded the British Amateur, which was being conducted on the Old Course at St. Andrews. This was the only major championship missing from Jones\u2019 impressive resume. It was also one of the toughest to win because of the grueling format. The bracket featured eight rounds, although Jones was given a first-round bye, and all the matches were 18 holes until the final. Jones always felt he could beat anyone over 36 holes, but 18-hole matches offered more of a chance for an upset.\n\nJones survived a tough fourth-round match with Cyril Tolley, winning in 19 holes. He rallied from a 2-down deficit with five to play to beat George Voigt in the semifinals, 1 up. The crucial point came at the famous Road Hole, No. 17, where Jones holed a 12-foot par putt to halve the hole. He won the match at No. 18.\n\nOnce he reached the 36-hole final, he had little trouble defeating 1923 British Amateur champion Roger Wethered of England, who happened to be the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup captain. Jones prevailed, 7 and 6, and headed to the British Open at Royal Liverpool (Hoylake).\n\nJones spent a week in Paris with his wife to get rested for the second leg of his Grand Slam quest. He struggled in the qualifying rounds, shooting 73-77, but eventually won the title by two shots over Macdonald Smith and Leo Diegel en route to breaking Walter Hagen\u2019s championship record by 10 shots. Jones had become the first man to win the British Amateur and Open championships in the same year since John Ball 40 years earlier.\n\nA ticker-tape parade awaited Jones when he returned to New York on the SS Europa. It was the second time Jones had received such an honor, the first coming four years earlier when he became the only amateur to have won the U.S. and British Open titles in the same year. Jones remains the only athlete and one of two individuals \u2013 astronaut John Glenn is the other \u2013 to have received two ticker-tape parades down Broadway.\n\nBut celebration aside, Jones still had plenty of work remaining. He would head to Interlachen Country Club outside of Minneapolis seeking a fourth U.S. Open title. Only Willie Anderson had managed to win four U.S. Open titles and Jones wanted to join that select fraternity.\n\nDespite sweltering heat \u2013 temperatures soared into the 100s \u2013 Jones managed to fight through the pressure and enormous expectations that were now on his shoulders. With his muscles quivering, Jones eventually held off Smith again by two strokes, holing a 40-foot birdie putt at the 72nd hole to cement the championship.\n\nNow the U.S. Amateur was the only obstacle in Jones\u2019 path to history.\n\nFittingly, the championship was being conducted at Merion Golf Club, where Jones had first burst onto the national scene as a raw 14-year-old talent. Merion was also the site of his first U.S. Amateur title in 1924.\n\nJones preferred the format that called for 36-hole matches from the third round onward. After easily claiming medalist honors, Jones cruised through his first two 18-hole matches, defeating Canadians Ross Somerville and F.G. Hoblitzel by 5-and-4 margins. With 36-hole matches set for the quarterfinals, semis and final, Jones now was in his comfort zone.\n\nFay Coleman fell 6 and 4 in the quarterfinals, followed by a 9-and-8 romp over 1922 champion Jess Sweetser.\n\nIn the final against Homan, Jones carded the equivalent of 33 on the second nine and held a commanding 7-up lead at the break.

On a wet track, Mills kept pace with the leaders until the final lap, when Clarke and Mohamed Gammoudi of Tunisia forced him to the outside of a crowded field. As Clarke and Gammoudi fought for the lead, Mills, in a frantic final sprint, surged past them to win an electrifying victory by just three yards. His success continued in 1965, when he set an outdoor world record (27 minutes 11.6 seconds) in the six-mile run and set U.S. records in the 10,000-metre and indoor three-mile races. The film Running Brave (1984) was based on his Olympic victory.\n\nIn 1986 Mills cofounded Running Strong for American Indian Youth, which provides health and shelter assistance while also supporting traditional cultures and languages.
