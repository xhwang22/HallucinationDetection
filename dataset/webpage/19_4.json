If you are interested in applying to the Bachelor of Arts degree program and would like an estimate of the amount of transfer credit you would receive, you can request an unofficial transfer evaluation by emailing a copy of your transcript(s) to the Berklee Online Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu . Be sure to include your name, major of interest, and any additional questions you may have. You can expect to receive your assessment within 7-10 business days.\n\nI didn\u2019t receive credit on my Official Evaluation for all of the courses that I thought I would. What should I do? The earlier you contact us with questions or concerns regarding your evaluation, the easier it will be for us to address any issues. Therefore, it is very important when you first receive your official transfer evaluation that you review the information carefully.\n\n\n\nIf you notice a remaining requirement that you believe you\u2019ve already fulfilled, first consult our document on Common Reasons Credit Does Not Transfer. It\u2019s possible that the course you are thinking of didn\u2019t meet our eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\nIf none of those exclusions apply, please fill out a Transfer Credit Equivalency Re-evaluation form for the courses you wish to have reconsidered.\n\n\n\nSometimes, we are not able to locate specific information for a course online and we are not able to determine an equivalency, but we are always happy to review additional material which will help us make that determination.\n\nDo my Berklee Online, Berklee campus, or Prior Learning Credit coursework count towards the 60 transfer credit limit? No, credits completed at Berklee or through the prior learning process do not count towards the 60 transfer credit limit. This maximum is for credit-bearing exams and undergraduate-level coursework completed externally.\n\nWhat is a credit deficiency and why do I need to make up credit? Credit deficiencies are caused by transferring a course that is less than three (3) credits to fulfill a three (3) credit Berklee Online requirement. Students with a credit deficiency will be short of the minimum number of credits required to graduate once they have completed their program requirements. In order to be eligible to graduate, you will need to make up the credits you are deficient in.\n\n\n\nWhile the Transfer Team does their best to avoid giving students credit deficiencies, it is not always possible. You can make up the credits you are deficient in by completing additional Berklee Online coursework, by applying for prior learning credit, or by completing additional external coursework in the area in which you are deficient.\n\n\n\nNote all external courses will first need to be approved by the Transfer Team.\n\nCan transfer credit fulfill prerequisites? It depends. Generally, transfer credit cannot be used to fulfill prerequisites unless we determine that the course you completed is a direct equivalent to one of the courses we offer at Berklee Online. Keep in mind that there are some courses which require you to pass a placement exam. For these you will need to achieve a passing grade on the test to fulfill the prerequisite, otherwise you will need to complete the appropriate Berklee Online course.\n\nCan I transfer credits to Berklee Online after I have started the degree program? Yes, you can. To determine if the coursework you already completed or are considering taking is eligible to fulfill your remaining degree requirements, contact the Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu\n\nI am a Berklee campus student. Can I transfer courses from Berklee Online to my campus-based program?\n\n\n\nFor additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at View a list of transferable courses to Berklee\u2019s campus programs.For additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at transfercredits@berklee.edu\n\nAre Berklee Online courses transferable to other institutions?

Rod is a professor, teaching percussion at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Massachusetts. Recently offering, Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum-set playing. He is also a columnist for Modern Drummer magazine.\n\nThe beginning of the Dregs started in 1973, when he attended the University of Miami in Florida. There he met Steve Morse, Andy West, and Allen Sloan, playing under the official Studio Music and curriculum title of, Rock Ensemble II. At the university, The Dregs recorded their first album in 1975, The Great Spectacular, as a class project.\n\nThe Dregs had a rough time getting signed and were turned down and told their music was difficult to market because they were a jazz fusion band had no vocals, odd timing, and that their music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and classical influences. The group was finally signed to Capricorn in 1977, and recorded several albums before they temporarily disbanded in 1983. Rod then joined Steve Morse\u2019s new band and stayed for two albums before wanting a musical change to try something both new and challenging. The Dregs last reunion was a tour in 2018.\n\nWinger and Other Projects\n\nRod moved back to New York City and began auditioning for jobs, one of them turned out to be a band that Kip Winger was forming. Two months later, Rod received a call from the band, and they were off to record their self-titled, debut album, Winger, in 1988. It went double platinum. Winger followed up in 1990 with In the Heart of the Young. In 1993, they released the album, Pull, as grunge came in and changed the music scene. The band decided to take a break, but got back together in 2002, and have had sporadic reunions since, and continue to do so as time permits. Winger will be releasing a new album in 2021.\n\nRod\u2019s other projects include the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire, Jordan Rudess, with two albums to their credit. Rod is is involved with jam band, Jazz Is Dead, which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Another project is, Platypus, whose two recordings feature: John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X), and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor, and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, \u20182\u2019 was released in 2004.\n\nInterview with Rod Morgenstein (Part 1)"}, {"url": "https://dreamtheater.net/band/", "page_content": "In 1990, LaBrie learned that Dream Theater was looking for a new singer, so he submitted a tape and was quickly flown to New York for a full audition. The trial went well, and he was chosen ahead of 200 other hopefuls to fill the full-time vocalist position in the band.\n\nLaBrie has since had a significant impact on the vocal melodies on each Dream Theater album, but until recently has had little input on the instrumentation of Dream Theater's music - 2011's A Dramatic Turn of Events features LaBrie in the music credits on three songs. To date he has written or co-written lyrics for at least one song on eight of the twelve albums Dream Theater has released with him in the band, Images and Words, Black Clouds & Silver Linings, Dream Theater and The Astonishing containing none of them.\n\nAsked by Prog-Sphere.com what is his favourite Dream Theater song to play live, James said \"The favourite song for me is Scarred, I love performing that live. And... well, Octavarium, that whole freakin\u2019 thing.\""}, {"url": "https://www.berklee.edu/berklee-today/spring-2000/The-Dregs-MTV", "page_content": "Every student wants to study with a teacher who has \"been there\" in the music business. Having seen the view from the top at two very different ends of the musical spectrum, Associate Professor of Drums Rod Morgenstein brings a lot to the table for his students. He became a poll-winning drummer as a result of his work with the legendary progressive rock instrumental group the Dixie Dregs (a.k.a. the Dregs), and later became known to teenage fans and millions of MTV viewers for his membership in the platinum-selling metal band Winger.\n\nAmong musicians, Morgenstein is widely known for his work with the Dregs. The band, led by guitarist Steve Morse, formed in the middle 1970s while Morgenstein and the rest of the band were students at the University of Miami. With virtually no radio support, but a great word-of-mouth reputation, the band became a force to be reckoned with. The Dregs received Grammy nominations for each of their last six recordings and much coverage in music trade magazines throughout the 1980s. Modern Drummer magazine named Morgenstein Best Progressive Rock Drummer for five consecutive years. He was recently voted Best All-Around Drummer in their 1999 reader's poll.\n\nHe has warm feelings for that era in his career and for the people that he met in the early days. \"I have this incredible feeling for Dregs fans,\" Morgenstein said. \"Some 25 years later, I still run into people who were behind us before we even had a record out. When we started out, we were in a car pulling a trailer and setting up our own gear after driving several hundred miles to a club. There would be 10 people in the audience, and five would leave screaming after the first song because they hated it. The other five would become fanatical fans for life who would invite us to stay at their homes--many times giving up their own beds so we could sleep in them. We established those types of relationships all around the country. Playing the Dregs reunion tour this past summer and running into longtime fans again reminded me of the influence that band had on some people.\"\n\nAfter the Dregs disbanded, Morgenstein continued touring and recording with the three-piece Steve Morse Band until 1986, when Morse took a gig with the group Kansas. Out of work for the first time since college, Morgenstein struggled a bit before surfacing as a member of the soon-to-be platinum-selling pop metal band Winger. Some progressive rock fans and critics were horrified. They claimed Morgenstein had sold out and joined a corporate rock band.\n\n\"I found that fascinating,\" said Morgenstein. \"How can you sell out in the music business? Nothing is a given. As hard as it was for the Dregs to get the message out playing instrumental music, for every band like that, there are probably a thousand rock bands. How many rock bands are lucky enough to even get signed--never mind sell some records?\n\n\"I didn't join Winger for the money, because when I started, we were only making about two hundred bucks a week. I went out with the band because my heart was in the music, and I was willing to give it a shot.\"\n\nWinger's success came after lead man Kip Winger and guitarist Reb Beach had struggled for years to get signed. As a favor, a producer helped them to get a small budget from Atlantic Records. The company pressed 13,000 copies of the first record. \"That's not the sign of a label getting behind a band expecting to make them huge,\" Morgenstein noted.\n\nAfter MTV started playing Winger's first video, the initial 13,000 records sold immediately. Within the year, the band's eponymous debut disc had sold nearly two million copies. Unfortunately, as the band became more popular, they started to become the butt of jokes as the heavy metal movement waned. Even the writers for the television series Beavis and Buttheadtook shots at the band.\n\n\"I don't want to name other bands and say why was it us and not them,\" said Morgenstein, \"but I consider myself to be a decent drummer, Reb Beach is a phenomenal guitar player, and Kip Winger is a serious musician who studied classical composition with teachers from Juilliard. If people would just listen to the songs on the record, I feel they would find some depth there.\"\n\nSince Winger, Morgenstein has worked with progressive rock groups like Platypus, featuring John Myung and Derek Sherinian of Dream Theater fame, and Ty Tabor, the guitarist for King's X. He is also part of Jazz Is Dead with bassist Alfonso Johnson, keyboard player T. Lavitz, and guitarist Jimmy Herring. The latter is an instrumental jam band that uses the music of the Grateful Dead as a launching pad for its exploratory improvisations. The project that is presently closest to Morgenstein's heart is the Rudess Morgenstein Project, a keyboard/drums power duo for which he has written half of the music. \"I have never written 50 percent of the material for any group,\" he said. \"This is new to me and is my proudest achievement.\"\n\nAs a teacher at Berklee, Morgenstein's reputation precedes him. \"A lot of the students who come to me are fans of the groups I've been in,\" he said. \"Some want to study the heavy metal style I played with Winger and others are interested in the fusion style that I played with the Dregs. I have written over 200 columns for drum magazines, and will soon have a book of drum set warm-ups published by Berklee Press, so there is always plenty to work on.\n\n\"Playing with Jazz Is Dead has brought a period of self-discovery. I have been pushed to find new sounds, new ways to hit the drums, and new grooves and fills. I pass that stuff on to my students. I like variety in life and in music. Doing all of these different things is keeping me young.\""}, {"url": "http://rodmorgenstein.com/about.html", "page_content": "ABOUT ROD\n\nRod\u0092s professional music career began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan. The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u0092s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u0092s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u0092s Reader\u0092s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u0092s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u0093The Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u0094\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u0093One of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u0094\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u0093I was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u0094\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u0093Kip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u0092d be interested in doing the record.\u0094\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u0092s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u0092s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u0093small in numbers yet mighty in sound\u0094 band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u0092s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups , touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years."}, {"url": "https://musicxplorer.com/artists/rod-morgenstein-part-two/", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein\n\nHighlights From Part One\n\nIn Part One, we discussed how Rod met guitarist Steve Morse when he attended the University of Miami in Florida.

Along with my dad, Mel, her soulmate for 84 years, my mom lived a truly happy, content, and fulfilling life. Making it to the tender young age of 97 is a gift unto itself. Clearly, I got my musical abilities from her, as my dad was a clap-on-beats 1 and 3 kind of guy, but she was, instinctively, a backbeat girl, feeling the groove on where it\u2019s supposed to be experienced - beats 2 and 4!

Three of the major items I am parting with are drum sets from\u2013 The Dixie Dregs, \u2018Bring \u2018Em Back Alive\u2019, live recording (from The Center Stage in Atlanta, GA in early \u201992) and tour, including an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in December 1992 The 2002 \u2018Hollyweird Summer Tour\u2019 featuring Poison, Cinderella, Winger and Faster Pussycat, plus a Winger tour that followed in the fall of \u201802 The drum set used on several Dixie Dregs tours from the late \u201890\u2019s through 2007\n\nRod It has been an amazing trip down memory lane sorting through hundreds of possessions, each one triggering a smile, a story, or an unforgettable memory I will cherish forever. If you are interested in checking out some of these items, you can contact my friend and fellow drummer, Ed Tucker, at Studio 3T studio3t@icloud.com Or join Ed\u2019s Facebook group: Vintage Drum Collectors & Players. Type in \u201cRod Mo\u201d in the question to join the group.It\u2019s gonna take awhile before each and every item is listed, so make sure to check in over the coming weeks to see what new things have been added.Thanks for all the great years. It has been, and continues to be, an incredible ride.Rock On!Rod 6-6-2020\n\n\n\nI was shocked and saddened this week to learn that my friend and Dixie Dregs drum tech and monitor ace, Skoots Lyndon, passed away. Skoots was the consummate band mate, always seeking perfection in everything he did. He was an extremely kind and generous human being, periodically checking in on me to see how my parents are doing and how life, in general is faring. He also happened to be one of the best storytellers who ever graced our planet. His years of touring the globe with Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, and numerous other acts, created a vast library of colorful stories; truly amazing stories that only a wordsmith like Skoots could impart to an audience lucky enough to be in his presence. My memory is filled with moments like these, where I would be hanging on every word, completely engrossed, often in stitches, for hours on end. RIP Skoots. Your memory will live on in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate to have you in our live 4-26-2020 WINGER - Better Days Comin' - All-Star\n\n4-12-2020 \u2018Hi, this is Mel, how can I help you?\u2019 For years, these were the first words my dad would speak upon answering the phone. I think this phrase pretty much sums up the kind of person he was; always wanting to lend a helping hand in any way he could. My dad passed away yesterday and, almost immediately, the memories of an extraordinary life began flooding my brain. He was a professor by trade, having taught at a handful of colleges and universities in New York, including Columbia University. He would often comment that he never felt like he worked a day in his life, as his love of teaching and being among young, talented, motivated students inspired him to no end. At the age of 10, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show along with my parents and sister, Carol, I knew then and there what I wanted to be when I grew up. From that day on, and continuing to this day, my parents have been my most ardent supporters, having attended nearly every single New York area concert I have played since 1976, be it with Winger, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, Rudess Morgenstein Project, The Jelly Jam, Jazz Is Dead, drum clinics and festivals, you name it. The last show they attended was the Dixie Dregs reunion concert at The Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY on March 15, 2018. After a recent hospital stay, an attendant came into the room with the wheelchair to escort my dad out of the building. I introduced myself to him, and he immediately reminded me that he knew who I was, having helped me a few years ago when I was being treated in the hospital\u2019s ER for kidney stones. He also told me he was a guitarist, a major Dixie Dregs fan, and had seen the Dregs every single time we have played on Long Island since the \u201870\u2019s. I then introduced him to my dad, to which he replied, \u2018What, are you kidding, I know your dad, and I also know your mom. Every Dixie Dregs fan on Long Island knows them. They\u2019re just as famous as the band members, because every Dregs fan who has come to your shows these past 40+ years sees your parents every single time. He then proceeded to tell me exactly where they were sitting at The Paramount Theater concert two years ago! My dad has been an inspiration to me, and many of my friends, for a lifetime. In fact, quite a few of my friends have told me that he has been a role model, playing a major part in how they try to live their lives. I am forever grateful to have had him in my life. The floodgates have opened, and the countless, beautiful memories of this amazingly special man, my dad, are everywhere I look\u2026 1-10-20 Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of Rush. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil\u2019s zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many divergent paths. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when The Steve Morse Band toured with Rush as their opening act on the band\u2019s Power Windows Tour. Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on Rush\u2019s \u201885/\u201986 \u2018Power Windows Tour\u2019 would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for Rush\u2019s sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band\u2019s two-hour concert. After the concert, Neil would usually hang for a short time before excusing himself to go to the band\u2019s tour bus, to work on one of his future literary creations. Sometime during this same time period, when he had some time off from touring, Neil flew to China, where he met up with a handful of bicycling enthusiasts for a 3-week journey through remote parts of the country. With pad and pen in hand (at the time, Neil felt that a camera interfered with the creative process) he would jot down highlights of the day\u2019s experiences, which eventually culminated in one of his first literary works entitled, \u2018Riding The Golden Lion\u2019. In addition to the writing portion of this 39-page journal/book, Neil was involved in every step of the process in putting the book together, including choosing the cover art, font, page color and thickness, etc. I believe it was the first outing in what would become a passion of his, eventually authoring several critically acclaimed books. On the very last day off of The Steve Morse Band\u2019s final leg of the Rush Power Windows Tour Neil, Alex, and Geddy took our band to an exotic restaurant for a memorable band dinner. Sitting cross-legged on pillows on the floor, in our very own private room, sans silverware, we dined on an incredible feast of delicacies using only our fingers. Alex, a wine expert and connoisseur, made sure the nectar of the Gods was flowing. So, there I am sitting next to Neil, chit-chatting while trying to think of something interesting and stimulating to say to this sophisticated, worldly, well-traveled man. Neil beat me to the punch, turning to me and posing the question, \u2018So Rod, have you ever considered the effects of climate on the development of Western Civilization?\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, sums up the ever-inquisitive Neil Peart, always seeking knowledge and new experiences, never happy with the status quo. He is the textbook definition of \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019, seizing every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, sailing, cross-country skiing, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man. RIP Neil. 11/2/19 Hey Everybody, I am part of a very cool project, called The Road Crew, with Billy Sheehan on bass and some very talented musicians from my area. We are performing our first, and at the moment our only, concert on Long Island on December 18. Also on the bill will be Zebra guitarist/vocalist Randy Jackson. The Road Crew came about as a result of the tragic loss of a young child, who was run down in his front yard by someone who was texting while driving. This innocent, precious child, Rocco Cangemi, is the inspiration for his father, Joe Cangemi, putting The Road Crew together. Hope to see you there. 9/10/19\n\nDetroit Drummers Day featuring Rod\n\nSunday 9/15 @ The Token Lounge \u00b7 Westland, Michigan 7/25/17 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The original lineup of instrumental masters the Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in 2018.

The vibe this time around is in-your-face, good old slammin' rock 'n roll.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of the band's first studio recording. Hopefully, it will be completed and released by the end of the year or early 2010.\n\n\n\nSoon to be released from Sonic Reality is The Ken Scott Collection, a series of drum loops by 5 of the drummers Ken Scott has worked with including myself, Billy Cobham, Terry Bozzio, Woody Woodmansey, and Bob Siegerman.

Further info on this collection can be found at www.sonicreality.com/kenscottcollection.php\n\n\n\nI recently completed my 12th year at Berklee College of Music.

Ken chose 6 drummers he has worked with including Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie), Bob Seibenberg (Supertramp), and Nigel Olson (Elton John). Ken engineered and produced two classic Dixie Dregs records, 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs'.

The drum library collection, which focuses on recreating the analog drum sounds from the 70's, will also feature a book on Ken's life and his ground-breaking engineering and recording techniques.

Look for the release in the latter part of this year or early 2009.\n\n\n\nWinger toured the US this past Feb/March, and is looking into touring South America this fall.

ALthough Winger has toured in nearly 25 countries, this will be the band's first tour in SA.\n\n\n\nRudess Morgenstein Project will play in Poland this October as part of the Percussion Festival in Opole, Poland. In addition to each of us performing a clinic, we will play several concerts. Info will be posted when the dates are officially set.\n\n\n\nI have been recording a cd with a phenomenal pianist by the name of Rob Apostle. Rob's music is an incredible blend of classical, jazz, and fusion music. Deceptively simple, this music will touch both musician and non-musician on a very deep and emotional level. No release date is set yet as it is in its early stages. I'll keep you posted as the project nears completion.\n\n\n\nMid-May completed my 11th year teaching at Berklee College of Music. What began in September 1997, filling in for a teacher who went off on a year's Sabbatical leave, has blossomed into an integral and very rewarding part of my professional music career. Also, midway through the semester I became a full professor. I wish to thank my incredible students for always continuing to inspire me.\n\n\n\nHave a COOL, wonderful summer............ 12/9/07 - update from Rod Japan and Australia were amazing! It's been way too long since WINGER played in Japan. The last time were toured there was for the PULL tour in '93. Sold out shows in Tokyo and Yokohama and awesome crowds in Osaka and Nagoya brought back so many great memories of touring in the good ole days! The trip to Australia was our first and I'm sure we'll be back, as the crowds were really enthusiastic there, too. We had a blast touring with Ratt for the 2 weeks, and got to hang out a bunch with those guys. All I can say is it was a TON OF FUN!!!\n\n\n\nWINGER 'LIVE' was just released on Frontiers Records and is available in both dvd and cd. The concert was filmed at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA in March '07 and the reviews have been fantastic.\n\n\n\nMONSTER BALLADS XMAS was just released on Razor and Tie Records. 15 rock/metal artists each contributed a tune. WINGER did a cool version of John Lennon's Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Other bands include Queensryche, Dokken, Skid Row, Twisted Sister, Danger Danger, and Firehouse.\n\n\n\nWINGER will be touring the US in Feb/Mar '08. Tour dates will be posted shortly. Hope to see ya'll there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, and every other holiday which occurs this time of year. See you on tour next year!!!\n\n10/5/07 - update from Rod Hey All, Look for the new Winger 'Live' dvd/cd coming out in November. It was flimed this past March at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA, and is Winger's first live recording ever! Remember 'Monster Ballads', the cd which featured ballads from all the metal bands from the good ole days? Well, here comes 'Monster Ballads Xmas' this November, featuring Christmas songs by lots of the same bands. Winger covers the John Lennon song, 'Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Also in November, Winger is touring in Japan and Australia with Ratt. It will be our first time back to Japan since the Pull tour in '93. And it will be our very first trip to Australia. My last\n\ntime in the 'land down under' was in '94 for a drum clinic tour which took me to both Australia and New Zealand. What a magnificent part of the world! The Dixie Dregs are in the process of setting up gigs for the new year. As soon as dates are confirmed they will go\n\nup on my 'In Concert' page. Jazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of our first stdio cd. No release date yet, but I'll keep you posted. 9/7/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Berklee fall semester is just around the corner, and so next Monday I'll be off and running to Boston to meet this year's crop of amazing students. This semester begins my 11th year teaching at the college.\n\n\n\nWinger played a handful of gigs this summer, the most memorable being The Rocklahoma fest in Pryor, Oklahoma, a 3 day non-stop 70's/80's trip down memory lane with the likes of Skid Row, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Warrant, Dokken, Vince Neil, Poison, Firehouse, Quiet Riot, Enuff's Enuff, Queensryche and a ton of other bands. It was very cool catching up with musicians I haven't seen in years. We were told in excess of 60,000 tix were sold for the event. We're playing in Las Vegas in October and then touring with Ratt in Japan and Australia in November. Check my 'In Concert' page in the next couple of weeks for details.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead played a one-off at Berklee back in July. It's always a blast walking out on stage and jamming to songs you haven't played in a long time. Being on the edge of your seat as a musician stirs the creative side of things in really interesting ways. Our new cd is being mixed at the moment and should be released later this year.\n\n\n\nI played drums on Jordan Rudess' very cool new cd, 'The Road Home', which will be released September 12 on Magna Carta Records. This one's a 'cover' album, with Jordan paying homage to the bands which influenced him as an aspiring musician. Included are songs by Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Gentle Giant, and Genesis. As is always the case when I work with Jordan, this was a very challenging recording! Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined CalProg in Whittier, CA back in May. When time permits, Jordan and I will try to get back to finishing up the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd which we've been working on for the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nSee ya..................... 4/20/07 - update from Rod Life has been a whirlwind since the new year began. First, the Dixie Dregs toured out west in January. While in southern\n\nCalifornia, I raced to the NAMM show in Anaheim during the day to play with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth. For those performances I played on Roland's V-Drums, an amazing electronic drumset which I have future plans of incorporating them into my acoustic Premier kit. From the NAMM show I had to race to another town to play with the Dregs that evening. Nothing like multiple gigs in one day! On a sad note, the Dixie Dregs tour was cut short when sudden news arrived of Steve Morse's dad falling into a coma. Steve raced back to his home in Florida to be by his dad's side, who sadly passed away later that day. Steve's and my friendship goes back many years. I knew his dad, a brilliant man who will be missed by all whose lives he touched. February 1 was the start of a 5+ week Winger tour in support of the new Winger 4 cd. Crowds were considerably larger than anyone anticipated and we all had an amazing time together. There will be some summer touring, so just check my 'In Concert' page periodically. The Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined Baja Prog '07 in Mexicali, Mexico this past March. 1300 seats were filled to capacity each of 4 nights at this amazing festival. Bands and aficionados of progressive rock music come from all over the world for this event. From there Jordan and I travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to play at the Music Messe for Roland. And then we played a concert in London, also for Roland, and once again on the V Drums. In a few weeks Jordan and I will headline CalProg '07, a prog festival in Whittier, California. Also, around this time, I'll be recording with Jordan for his new solo record which will be out later this year. And we're hoping that, time permitting, we can make more headway on the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. The new Jazz Is Dead cd is at the mixing stages and will be completed in the next couple of months. I have heard the rough mixes and this is by far the coolest JID recording since the band's inception. Three weeks left to the Berklee semester. it's been a crazy semester with all my touring. But I tip my hat to my students, who waited patiently until I got back to town. And I've been spending extra days making up for the days I missed earlier in the semester. I truly have some incredible drummers this year. I'm certain I will see them out there doing it Big Time in the coming years! See ya......... 1/8/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody, Happy New Year. WInger played New Years Eve in Pittsburgh, PA....... OUTDOORS in the pouring rain to a couple thousand diehard fans! We were all soaking wet, and I mean completely drenched. All in all it was a ton of fun. Feb 1 Winger begins a 5 week US tour which will take us all around the country. We'll be mixing it up with stuff from the new cd, Winger 4, and of course, all the tunes from the good ole days. The Dixie Dregs begin touring next week out west which will take us through Colorado, Utah, California, and Arizona. While in southern CA, I'll be racing to the NAMM show to jam with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth.\n\n\n\nAll concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Immediatley following the Dregs tour I will fly directly to Boston to begin the spring '07 semester at Berklee College of Music. I always look forward to meeting a new crop of talented, eager students. 9/19/06 - update from Rod Lots going on since we last 'chatted'. The first new Winger cd in 13 years , Winger IV, is slated for release October 20 in Europe on Frontiers Records, Japan on King Records, with a US release to follow shortly thereafter on Shrapnel Records. The recording is a natural progression from 'Pull', which came out in '93. Kip produced the recording, which sounds HUGE! The band will tour Europe in October in support of the cd. Concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Audio clips can be heard at www.myspace.com/kipwingermusic Also, we're setting up a winger myspace page which should be up soon... The Rudess Morgenstein Project played in Caracas, Venezuela and San Jose, Costa Rica back in May. Jordan and I had a blast doing these shows, as they were our first gigs south of the border. The energy of the fans was unbelievable! In Venezuela, we played with Angra, a fantastic band from Brazil, and we spent a good bit of time hanging with them. In Costa Rica, we were the only band on the bill, and so our show was much longer than anything we've done in the past. We did a fair amount of jamming, which inspired us to take that approach on some of the new RPM cd, which is moving along nicely. We will be playing the Baja Progfest in Mexico in March, and are talking to other south American promoters about doing shows in some other countries. Jordan is also working on his next solo cd. I will cut drum tracks for some of this recording sometime before the end of the year. The Dixie Dregs will be touring the west coast in January. Look for tour dates on the 'In Concert' page in the next few weeks. Jazz Is Dead is in the mixing stages of a new cd. Even though it will be the band's fourth release, it actually will be our very first studio recording. All the other cds were live recordings. The Berklee fall semester began last week. After a year of living the life of nomads without 'homes', due to problems with the basement area of the building we taught in, the percussion faculty are quite comfortable in our brand new, sound proofed, incredible facility. Should be a great semester. 9/16/06 - from Rod It has been quite some time since I have posted updates on my site. For those of you who may not be aware, my wife, Michele, passed away this past December. Michele was a warrior's warrior during a 22 year journey battling breast cancer. The vast majority of people in our life knew little or nothing of her condition. She chose to keep it a quiet affair so she would not have it be front and center in every aspect of her daily life. It allowed her to lead a relatively normal life and not be known as 'Michele with breast cancer'. As painfully difficult as living with cancer can be at times, our life together was nothing short of perfection. We learned to smell the roses years ago. There are no regrets, as we told each other how deeply we loved each other virtually every day of our lives. Michele was my childhood sweetheart, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate. I miss her more than anyone can imagine. Thank you to everyone for your e-mails, letters and phone calls which have offered me some level of comfort during this very difficult time. I wish you all happiness and good health. Rod\n\n5/2/05 - Update from Rod The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was awesome, covering 18 cities in 19 days. Travelling highlights included driving through a surprise spring blizzard with virtually NO visiability in the middle of the night after jamming in Cleveland! Ah, the exciting life of a touring musician. Progress continues on the new Jazz Is Dead cd. Luis Conte has added amazing percussion to several tracks and we're hoping to get a few more folks to play on this one. Winger is still looking into a fall tour to record a live dvd and possible\n\nstudio cd. I'm getting ready to do some recording with Marc Muller who has been playing pedal steel and guitar with Shania Twain for the last 10 years. We're also involved in co-writing songs. The Berklee spring semester comes to a close this week and, as always, I've had a great bunch of students who never cease to amaze me.\n\n1/29/05 - Update from Rod Just got home from the Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band west coast tour. As always, it was a lot of fun jamming with my band mates of many years. Steve Morse band drummer Van Romaine and I worked out a two-man drum solo (guess you call that a drum duo)which was really a blast to perform. Looks like we'll be doing an east coast run in mid-March, from Florida all the way up through Chicago, so check my concert calendar in a couple of weeks for tour dates. Winger is discussing the possibility of a live dvd which would involve a week or two of concerts, possibly in May or June. Stay posted for details. The Berklee College of Music spring semester has begun and, as always, I have a wonderful group of students. 9/25/04 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nWell, believe it or not, after nearly 3 years since we first began work on it, The Jelly Jam 2 was just released. We are really beginning to sound like a band! Now we're looking at all of our schedules to see if we can do some live 'Jelly Jamming' in the next few months. I'll keep you posted. If you can't find Jelly Jam 2 in a cd shop, you can go to InsideOutMusic.com to read all about it and get purchase info. Jordan Rudess' new cd, 'Rhythm of Time', was released recently on Magna Carta Records. Like I had said a while back this recording was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and rewarding recordings of my career. The Dixie Dregs will be gearing up for a west coast tour in January. Tour dates will be available on my concert calendar in the next several weeks. We're already 4 weeks into the 2004 fall semester at Berklee College of Music and, as always, I have a great bunch of students. This time around there seem to be several who are into many of the classic rock and fusion bands and drummers, which is totally fine by me. It's right up my alley. Hope you all have an enjoyable fall season....... 7/23/04 - Update from Rod\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Rudess Morgenstein Project will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center at BerkleeCollege of Music in Boston on Thursday, August 5 at 8:15 PM. We will be playing classic RPM tunes as well as music from Jordan's soon-to-be released solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time'. Ty Tabor has completed mixing The Jelly Jam 2 and it is now in the hands of Inside Out Records. I'll keep you all posted regarding the release date. Kip Winger is putting some finishing touches on the recording I did with him and Turkish producer/guitarist Cenk Eroglu earlier this year, and getting ready to shop it for a deal. The recording with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar was incredible. The jam band concept is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my 30+ years as a musician. We need to record a couple more tracks to have a full length cd, so we'll probably get together in the fall to complete it. I'm in the midst of Berklee's 5 week summer program and having a blast with my roughly 75 students. It's amazing how many talented young musicians there are out there! 4/17/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, Kip is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey to finish recording and mix several tunes on his current project with Cenk Eroglu. Talk about a fresh, new killer sound, this is it!\n\n\n\nI just got back from Illinois for a week of recording with\n\nguitarist/keyboardist Brian Moritz and his band Balance. Dave LaRue (Dixie Dregs) played bass, with Joel Kaplan on keyboards and Vince Claps on vocals. With the exception of Dave and I, all these guys have been very active in the Chicago music scene for many years. The recording was engineered by Brian Mitchell, who lives a double life as a forensic pathologist! All in all, it was quite an experience. I'll update you as the recording progresses.\n\n\n\nI'm on my way to meet up with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar in\n\nHartford, CT to record for several days on both Jeff's solo cd and some jam band oriented stuff.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I return from CT, I'll be getting together with Jordan Rudess to pick up where he and I left off with the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. We're looking into the possibility of playing some gigs later this year.\n\n\n\nThe release of Jordan's solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is August 31 on Magna Carta Records.\n\n\n\nWell, yet another Berklee school year has come to a close. I guarantee that somewhere in the future you will see some of these students realizing their musical dreams!\n\n\n\nHave a HOT summer.................... 3/19/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, I just spent the last several days in Nashville recording with Kip Winger. Over the past year, Kip has been making trips to Istanbul, Turkey where he has been writing and recording with Turkish artist/guitarist/producer Cenk Eroglu. The music is an incredible blend of east-meets-west sounds and rhythms, both traditional and high-tech. Kip and Cenk hope to finish it up in the next several months. I'll keep you posted. We're talking about the possibility of recording Winger Live In Concert along with a bunch of archival/ interview footage. Jordan Rudess' solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is set for release in July on Magna Carta Records. What an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience it always is, working with my friend Jordan. Among the guest artists appearing on the recording are Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Vinnie Moore and Greg Howe. Modern Drummer presents 'Drum Nation' was released in mid-January and includes drum performances by 14 drummers. Jordan Rudess played keys on my track 'Faceless Pastiche'. Other members of the cast include Steve Smith, Simon Phillips, Bill Bruford, Trilok Gurtu and Chad Wackerman, to name but a\n\nfew. I recorded a couple of tracks with Jeff Pevar on a solo recording he's working on. I met Jeff when he joined Jazz Is Dead in 2001. He is one of the most well-rounded, musical guitarists around. I recently went to see him perform with CPR, the band he has with David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young fame.) Jeff is the 'P' in CPR. A highlight of the evening for me was meeting David Crosby and having HIM say all these great things about the Dixie Dregs. I felt like a million bucks! Jelly Jam 2's completion is just around the corner, I promise........ Another snow has fallen, with more expected tonight. It sure has been a\n\nLOOOOOOONG Winter. 11/09/03 - Update from Rod Jordan Rudess is in the studio working on his next solo recording for Magna Carta. We're planning on doing drum tracks before the end of the year. January 13 is the Magna Carta release date for 'Modern Drummer Presents: Drum Nation Volume 1', an all-out drummers' cd featuring quite an interesting cast of players. Each participating drummer contributed one track; Jordan Rudess plays keyboards on my tune 'Faceless Pastiche'. Additional info about the cd can be found at Magna Carta'a website. I know it sounds like a broken record but Ty Tabor is planning on mixing The Jelly Jam's next cd before the end of this year, as soon as he gets off the current King's X tour. It seems like only yesterday that the semester began but the Berklee College of Music fall semester is already entering its 10th week. I have some very fine students this year and am sure to hear about them in years to come! 7/19/03 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nI've been meaning to post something ever since I got back from Europe last month. The clinic tour was an absolute blast! I played in 8 countries in 3 weeks and spent some time in the UK visiting Premier Percussion on a break in the middle of the clinic events. Thanks to everyone who came out, the turn-outs were fantastic, and I met so many wonderful drummers, Premier/Sabian/Vic Firth reps, music store personnel and other musicians. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in making these clinics first class events and I look forward to seeing all of you again somewhere down the road. I'm already full steam ahead in the Berklee College of Music 5 week program and have been teaching 11 different classes in addition to many private lessons. And I can say without hesitation that there are some VERY talented young people out there! I'm sure we'll be seeing quite a few of ya'll enrolled as Berklee College students in the years to come. Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, is putting the finishing touches on Jelly Jam 2, my project with him and John Myung, bassist with Dream Theater. Stay posted for a release date. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Talk to you in the fall. Rod 5/16/03 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody,\n\nI leave in a week for a 3 week European drum clinic tour for Premier and Sabian which will take me to some very cool places including, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Iceland, with a trip to the Premier Percussion complex in Leicester, UK thrown in for good measure. The clinics will feature the new line of Premier drums which were showcased at this year's NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA back in January. The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was a lot of fun, and as we didn't hit all of the usual east coast cities, hopefully we'll be able to put another run together this year. Ty tabor is hard at work on the next Jelly Jam recording. I'll keep you posted on a release date as soon as I hear something. And, as I've said before, we really want to tour for this one. Still waiting on a release date for the Magna Carta drummers cd. I played in a very cool blues concert last weekend at the West Hampton Performing Arts Center with Frank Latorre and The King Bees. Frank, an incredible harmonica player, played the harp on Winger's 'Down incognito' on PULL back in '93. The band also featured Richie Cannata of Billy Joel fame and 3 of Frank's longtime buddies- Doug, Paul and Paul who play guitar, bass and guitar respectively. I hope to do some more playing with these guys in the future. Jordan Rudess and I played during Berklee College's Percussion week back in April and the turn out was overwhelming. Thanks for all your support. Some day, I promise, we'll get the next studio cd released. We have interested parties in Puerto Rico and Finland wanting to bring us over to jam. So we're looking into getting it together. Well, another year at Berklee has come to a close and, as always, I had a wonderful time teaching so many talented drummer/musicians. I'll be teaching the 5 Week Summer program beginning the second week in July, so if you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hey. 2/21/03 - Update from Rod Hey everybody.\n\nThe January west coast Dixie Dregs tour was fantastic. The timing enabled us to spend some time at the NAMM Music trade show in Anaheim. It's always a blast going to the show as you meet up with so many friends and acquaintances who you don't necessarily get to see that often.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in late April for an east coast run. Check my site in the coming weeks for concert info. I recently recorded a song for an upcoming 'drummers' cd which will be coming out on Magna Carta sometime in the spring. 10-15 drummers are each contributing a tune. As I understand it, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio and Steve Smith have already submitted their tracks. Should be quite a recording. Ty Tabor is hoping to put the final touches on the new Jelly Jam cd March/April. So, hopefully, it won't be too long after that before it is released by Inside Out Records. Until we meet again.......... 12/2/02 - Update from Rod The Dixie Dregs will be touring in CA, January 10 through the 19th. Check the concert calendar for specific dates. Thanks to everyone who came out to see Winger on the east coast this past October. As is always the case with these guys, it was a tremendous amount of fun both musically and just hanging with Kip, Paul, Reb, and John. Now we'll just have to see where it all leads... Jordan Rudess and I picked up where we left off last summer on our second RPM studio recording. It's awesome working together again with my power duo partner. We're hoping to get it done in the next few months for a 2003 release and some touring. Ty Tabor will put the finishing touches on the next Jelly Jam recording as soon as he gets home from the King's X/ Ronnie Dio tour later this month. The first Jelly Jam cd created a nice buzz at radio and so we're all looking forward to releasing this next one. John Myung, Ty and I are determined to tour with this band. Another semester at Berklee is fast coming to a close. As usual, I have a great bunch of students who continue to keep me on my toes. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you next year.\n\nRod 8/28/02 - Update from Rod Well, it looks like summer is almost over. Man it was a hot one! The Poison, Cinderella, Winger, Faster Pussycat tour was an incredible amount of fun. Being back with the guys was truly an amazing experience. Jamming with them was a blast and I don't think I've laughed this much in years. These people are so much fun to hang with. And it looks like we'll be hanging again, if but for only a short time. We're doing a string of east coast Winger shows beginning October 1. Check the Concert Calendar for the dates. These will be full length shows covering considerably more songs than we did on the Poison tour. We're looking into the possibility of doing some combination Dixie Dregs/ Jelly Jam shows later this year. I'll keep you posted. Jordan Rudess and I have been in communicado trying to nail down a time period to finish up our next studio recording which was begun last summer. I'll keep you abreast of that one, too. The Berklee College of Music fall semester begins shortly and I'm looking forward to meeting lots of new faces as well as the 'veterans'. See you all soon......\n\n5/2/02 - Update from Rod Hey everybody. Well, as you all know by now, Winger is back together and will be touring with Poison, Cinderella, and Faster Pussycat from mid-May through July. I must admit, the adrenaline is beginning to flow as the starting date approaches. This will be the first time we've played as a band live in nearly 9 years. A few Winger Only headline shows will be happening, too. For all tour dates click here. The Jelly Jam debut cd was released in the latter part of March and Ty and I have been doing a good amount of press and radio in support of it. We're hoping to do some touring with this project as soon as our schedules permit. John Myung is currently on tour with Dream Theater, and Ty is on the road with King's X. So, all three of us have our hands full at the moment. But we're determined to make The Jelly Jam a full-fledged, LIVE jamming band. This week was the last week of classes for the spring 2002 semester at Berklee College of Music. Finals are next week, after which I race back to New York to board a plane to Nashville for a week of Winger rehearsals. I had a fantastic group of students this year who really kept me on my toes. I'm sure I'll be seeing many of them in concert with their own bands in the years to come! Have a great summer and I hope to run in to some of you along the way.........

I don\u2019t think a more positive, \u2018life is beautiful\u2019 human being has ever graced this planet of ours. She truly was 'salt of the earth'. Along with my dad, Mel, her soulmate for 84 years, my mom lived a truly happy, content, and fulfilling life. Making it to the tender young age of 97 is a gift unto itself. Clearly, I got my musical abilities from her, as my dad was a clap-on-beats 1 and 3 kind of guy, but she was, instinctively, a backbeat girl, feeling the groove on where it\u2019s supposed to be experienced - beats 2 and 4! This has been a trying year, having experienced so much loss. But, in the end, folks like my mom have instilled in me the belief that there is always a bright side of life to not only dwell on, but to embrace wholeheartedly. 7-13-2020 Hey Everybody,Rod here. After 45 years of amassing an enormous collection of drum sets, snare drums, cymbals, percussion, Winger clothing (from the good ole days), tour laminates, itineraries, posters and awards, drumheads, drumsticks, assorted hardware, and other mementos, I have decided to part with a tremendous amount of these items. Three of the major items I am parting with are drum sets from\u2013 The Dixie Dregs, \u2018Bring \u2018Em Back Alive\u2019, live recording (from The Center Stage in Atlanta, GA in early \u201992) and tour, including an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in December 1992 The 2002 \u2018Hollyweird Summer Tour\u2019 featuring Poison, Cinderella, Winger and Faster Pussycat, plus a Winger tour that followed in the fall of \u201802 The drum set used on several Dixie Dregs tours from the late \u201890\u2019s through 2007\n\nRod It has been an amazing trip down memory lane sorting through hundreds of possessions, each one triggering a smile, a story, or an unforgettable memory I will cherish forever. If you are interested in checking out some of these items, you can contact my friend and fellow drummer, Ed Tucker, at Studio 3T studio3t@icloud.com Or join Ed\u2019s Facebook group: Vintage Drum Collectors & Players. Type in \u201cRod Mo\u201d in the question to join the group.It\u2019s gonna take awhile before each and every item is listed, so make sure to check in over the coming weeks to see what new things have been added.Thanks for all the great years. It has been, and continues to be, an incredible ride.Rock On!Rod 6-6-2020\n\n\n\nI was shocked and saddened this week to learn that my friend and Dixie Dregs drum tech and monitor ace, Skoots Lyndon, passed away. Skoots was the consummate band mate, always seeking perfection in everything he did. He was an extremely kind and generous human being, periodically checking in on me to see how my parents are doing and how life, in general is faring. He also happened to be one of the best storytellers who ever graced our planet. His years of touring the globe with Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, and numerous other acts, created a vast library of colorful stories; truly amazing stories that only a wordsmith like Skoots could impart to an audience lucky enough to be in his presence. My memory is filled with moments like these, where I would be hanging on every word, completely engrossed, often in stitches, for hours on end. RIP Skoots. Your memory will live on in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate to have you in our live 4-26-2020 WINGER - Better Days Comin' - All-Star\n\n4-12-2020 \u2018Hi, this is Mel, how can I help you?\u2019 For years, these were the first words my dad would speak upon answering the phone. I think this phrase pretty much sums up the kind of person he was; always wanting to lend a helping hand in any way he could. My dad passed away yesterday and, almost immediately, the memories of an extraordinary life began flooding my brain. He was a professor by trade, having taught at a handful of colleges and universities in New York, including Columbia University. He would often comment that he never felt like he worked a day in his life, as his love of teaching and being among young, talented, motivated students inspired him to no end. At the age of 10, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show along with my parents and sister, Carol, I knew then and there what I wanted to be when I grew up. From that day on, and continuing to this day, my parents have been my most ardent supporters, having attended nearly every single New York area concert I have played since 1976, be it with Winger, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, Rudess Morgenstein Project, The Jelly Jam, Jazz Is Dead, drum clinics and festivals, you name it. The last show they attended was the Dixie Dregs reunion concert at The Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY on March 15, 2018. After a recent hospital stay, an attendant came into the room with the wheelchair to escort my dad out of the building. I introduced myself to him, and he immediately reminded me that he knew who I was, having helped me a few years ago when I was being treated in the hospital\u2019s ER for kidney stones. He also told me he was a guitarist, a major Dixie Dregs fan, and had seen the Dregs every single time we have played on Long Island since the \u201870\u2019s. I then introduced him to my dad, to which he replied, \u2018What, are you kidding, I know your dad, and I also know your mom. Every Dixie Dregs fan on Long Island knows them. They\u2019re just as famous as the band members, because every Dregs fan who has come to your shows these past 40+ years sees your parents every single time. He then proceeded to tell me exactly where they were sitting at The Paramount Theater concert two years ago! My dad has been an inspiration to me, and many of my friends, for a lifetime. In fact, quite a few of my friends have told me that he has been a role model, playing a major part in how they try to live their lives. I am forever grateful to have had him in my life. The floodgates have opened, and the countless, beautiful memories of this amazingly special man, my dad, are everywhere I look\u2026 1-10-20 Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of Rush. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil\u2019s zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many divergent paths. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when The Steve Morse Band toured with Rush as their opening act on the band\u2019s Power Windows Tour. Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on Rush\u2019s \u201885/\u201986 \u2018Power Windows Tour\u2019 would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for Rush\u2019s sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band\u2019s two-hour concert. After the concert, Neil would usually hang for a short time before excusing himself to go to the band\u2019s tour bus, to work on one of his future literary creations. Sometime during this same time period, when he had some time off from touring, Neil flew to China, where he met up with a handful of bicycling enthusiasts for a 3-week journey through remote parts of the country. With pad and pen in hand (at the time, Neil felt that a camera interfered with the creative process) he would jot down highlights of the day\u2019s experiences, which eventually culminated in one of his first literary works entitled, \u2018Riding The Golden Lion\u2019. In addition to the writing portion of this 39-page journal/book, Neil was involved in every step of the process in putting the book together, including choosing the cover art, font, page color and thickness, etc. I believe it was the first outing in what would become a passion of his, eventually authoring several critically acclaimed books. On the very last day off of The Steve Morse Band\u2019s final leg of the Rush Power Windows Tour Neil, Alex, and Geddy took our band to an exotic restaurant for a memorable band dinner. Sitting cross-legged on pillows on the floor, in our very own private room, sans silverware, we dined on an incredible feast of delicacies using only our fingers. Alex, a wine expert and connoisseur, made sure the nectar of the Gods was flowing. So, there I am sitting next to Neil, chit-chatting while trying to think of something interesting and stimulating to say to this sophisticated, worldly, well-traveled man. Neil beat me to the punch, turning to me and posing the question, \u2018So Rod, have you ever considered the effects of climate on the development of Western Civilization?\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, sums up the ever-inquisitive Neil Peart, always seeking knowledge and new experiences, never happy with the status quo. He is the textbook definition of \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019, seizing every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, sailing, cross-country skiing, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man. RIP Neil. 11/2/19 Hey Everybody, I am part of a very cool project, called The Road Crew, with Billy Sheehan on bass and some very talented musicians from my area. We are performing our first, and at the moment our only, concert on Long Island on December 18. Also on the bill will be Zebra guitarist/vocalist Randy Jackson. The Road Crew came about as a result of the tragic loss of a young child, who was run down in his front yard by someone who was texting while driving. This innocent, precious child, Rocco Cangemi, is the inspiration for his father, Joe Cangemi, putting The Road Crew together. Hope to see you there. 9/10/19\n\nDetroit Drummers Day featuring Rod\n\nSunday 9/15 @ The Token Lounge \u00b7 Westland, Michigan 7/25/17 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The original lineup of instrumental masters the Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in 2018.

This 12 week course is available for college credit or non- credit and is an all-encompassing program incorporating hours of video instruction, hundreds of drumming audio examples and transcriptions, and multiple play-a-long tacks covering a vast number of rock drumming styles. As the teacher of this interactive course, I meet with students each week for a class chat, as well as give input on their weekly performance projects. I have had a blast putting this course together, drawing from nearly 40 years as a recording and touring musician. For more info check out the website below. Hope to see you in class! Rod www.berkleemusic.com/school/course? course_item_id=21848140&program=new_online_music_courses\n\n6/4/10 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nSonic Reality has released Epik Drums, a deluxe collection of drumkit and groove instruments created with legendary producer Ken Scott. Ken produced 2 Dixie Dregs records- 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs', and has engineered and produced a who's who list of artists including the Beatles, David Bowie, Supertramp, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. This package is packed with hours of drumming by me, Billy Cobham, Bob Siebenberg, Woody Woodmansey, and Terry Bozzio. Check it out at www.sonicreality.com\n\n\n\nWinger will be touring throughout the summer in support of our new cd, 'Karma', which was released in the fall of 2009. For tour dates check my 'In Concert' page. You can also get more info on the band at www.myspace.com/wingertheband and www.wingertheband.com\n\n\n\nThe Jelly Jam are up and running again, having recently cut basic tracks for Jelly Jam 3. Ty Tabor (guitarist with King's X) hopes to finish up the recording this fall. Look for its release by year's end or early 2011. We are also looking into the possibility of doing some live shows. Stay posted.\n\n\n\nFinished my 13th year of teaching at Berklee this past May. The talent just keeps getting better and better! There is a 5 minute drum lesson on this month's home page @ www.musicradar.com plus another lesson from last month.\n\n\n\n3 part interview on www.vicfirth.com\n\n\n\nC oming soon! Lessons at www.evansdrumheads.com\n\n\n\nOct/Nov: New WInger cd on Frontiers Records and Europe Tour dates to be announced soon. October '09 release from Sonic Reality--The recreation of drum sounds from classic albums recorded by producer Ken Scott and 5 legendary drummers: Rod Morgenstein (Dixie Dregs), Terry Bozzio (Missing Persons), Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie\u2019s Spiders from Mars), Bill Cobham (Mahavishnu Orchestra) and Bob Siebenberg (Supertramp). 5/22/09 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nWinger is in the studio recording our 5th studio cd for Frontiers Records. It will be released fall '09 with touring to follow. The vibe this time around is in-your-face, good old slammin' rock 'n roll.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of the band's first studio recording. Hopefully, it will be completed and released by the end of the year or early 2010.\n\n\n\nSoon to be released from Sonic Reality is The Ken Scott Collection, a series of drum loops by 5 of the drummers Ken Scott has worked with including myself, Billy Cobham, Terry Bozzio, Woody Woodmansey, and Bob Siegerman. Ken's discography reads like a who's who of the recording industry, having been head engineer on the Beatle's White Album, and engineer/producer of such artists as David Bowie, Supertramp, Dixie Dregs and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Further info on this collection can be found at www.sonicreality.com/kenscottcollection.php\n\n\n\nI recently completed my 12th year at Berklee College of Music. The musical talent just seems to be getting better and better every year!!!\n\n\n\nHave a great summer.......... 7/1/08 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nIt's been a while........\n\n\n\nRecently, I was in California recording with legendary producer Ken Scott as part of a massive drum library project for Sonic Reality. Ken chose 6 drummers he has worked with including Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie), Bob Seibenberg (Supertramp), and Nigel Olson (Elton John). Ken engineered and produced two classic Dixie Dregs records, 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs'. His bio reads like a Who's Who of the record biz--The Beatles, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Missing Persons, David Bowie, Supertramp, Elton John, and Stanley Clarke to name a few. The drum library collection, which focuses on recreating the analog drum sounds from the 70's, will also feature a book on Ken's life and his ground-breaking engineering and recording techniques. The release date is scheduled for early 2009.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead guitarist, Jeff Pevar, is in the studio mixing the new Jazz Is Dead cd, finally! This recording will be, believe it or not, the first studio cd in the band's history. Look for the release in the latter part of this year or early 2009.\n\n\n\nWinger toured the US this past Feb/March, and is looking into touring South America this fall. Concert dates will be posted once they are confirmed. ALthough Winger has toured in nearly 25 countries, this will be the band's first tour in SA.\n\n\n\nRudess Morgenstein Project will play in Poland this October as part of the Percussion Festival in Opole, Poland. In addition to each of us performing a clinic, we will play several concerts. Info will be posted when the dates are officially set.\n\n\n\nI have been recording a cd with a phenomenal pianist by the name of Rob Apostle. Rob's music is an incredible blend of classical, jazz, and fusion music. Deceptively simple, this music will touch both musician and non-musician on a very deep and emotional level. No release date is set yet as it is in its early stages. I'll keep you posted as the project nears completion.\n\n\n\nMid-May completed my 11th year teaching at Berklee College of Music. What began in September 1997, filling in for a teacher who went off on a year's Sabbatical leave, has blossomed into an integral and very rewarding part of my professional music career. Also, midway through the semester I became a full professor. I wish to thank my incredible students for always continuing to inspire me.\n\n\n\nHave a COOL, wonderful summer............ 12/9/07 - update from Rod Japan and Australia were amazing! It's been way too long since WINGER played in Japan. The last time were toured there was for the PULL tour in '93. Sold out shows in Tokyo and Yokohama and awesome crowds in Osaka and Nagoya brought back so many great memories of touring in the good ole days! The trip to Australia was our first and I'm sure we'll be back, as the crowds were really enthusiastic there, too. We had a blast touring with Ratt for the 2 weeks, and got to hang out a bunch with those guys. All I can say is it was a TON OF FUN!!!\n\n\n\nWINGER 'LIVE' was just released on Frontiers Records and is available in both dvd and cd. The concert was filmed at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA in March '07 and the reviews have been fantastic.\n\n\n\nMONSTER BALLADS XMAS was just released on Razor and Tie Records. 15 rock/metal artists each contributed a tune. WINGER did a cool version of John Lennon's Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Other bands include Queensryche, Dokken, Skid Row, Twisted Sister, Danger Danger, and Firehouse.\n\n\n\nWINGER will be touring the US in Feb/Mar '08. Tour dates will be posted shortly. Hope to see ya'll there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, and every other holiday which occurs this time of year. See you on tour next year!!!\n\n10/5/07 - update from Rod Hey All, Look for the new Winger 'Live' dvd/cd coming out in November. It was flimed this past March at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA, and is Winger's first live recording ever! Remember 'Monster Ballads', the cd which featured ballads from all the metal bands from the good ole days? Well, here comes 'Monster Ballads Xmas' this November, featuring Christmas songs by lots of the same bands. Winger covers the John Lennon song, 'Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Also in November, Winger is touring in Japan and Australia with Ratt. It will be our first time back to Japan since the Pull tour in '93. And it will be our very first trip to Australia. My last\n\ntime in the 'land down under' was in '94 for a drum clinic tour which took me to both Australia and New Zealand. What a magnificent part of the world! The Dixie Dregs are in the process of setting up gigs for the new year. As soon as dates are confirmed they will go\n\nup on my 'In Concert' page. Jazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of our first stdio cd. No release date yet, but I'll keep you posted. 9/7/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Berklee fall semester is just around the corner, and so next Monday I'll be off and running to Boston to meet this year's crop of amazing students. This semester begins my 11th year teaching at the college.\n\n\n\nWinger played a handful of gigs this summer, the most memorable being The Rocklahoma fest in Pryor, Oklahoma, a 3 day non-stop 70's/80's trip down memory lane with the likes of Skid Row, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Warrant, Dokken, Vince Neil, Poison, Firehouse, Quiet Riot, Enuff's Enuff, Queensryche and a ton of other bands. It was very cool catching up with musicians I haven't seen in years. We were told in excess of 60,000 tix were sold for the event. We're playing in Las Vegas in October and then touring with Ratt in Japan and Australia in November. Check my 'In Concert' page in the next couple of weeks for details.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead played a one-off at Berklee back in July. It's always a blast walking out on stage and jamming to songs you haven't played in a long time. Being on the edge of your seat as a musician stirs the creative side of things in really interesting ways. Our new cd is being mixed at the moment and should be released later this year.\n\n\n\nI played drums on Jordan Rudess' very cool new cd, 'The Road Home', which will be released September 12 on Magna Carta Records. This one's a 'cover' album, with Jordan paying homage to the bands which influenced him as an aspiring musician. Included are songs by Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Gentle Giant, and Genesis. As is always the case when I work with Jordan, this was a very challenging recording! Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined CalProg in Whittier, CA back in May. When time permits, Jordan and I will try to get back to finishing up the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd which we've been working on for the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nSee ya..................... 4/20/07 - update from Rod Life has been a whirlwind since the new year began. First, the Dixie Dregs toured out west in January. While in southern\n\nCalifornia, I raced to the NAMM show in Anaheim during the day to play with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth. For those performances I played on Roland's V-Drums, an amazing electronic drumset which I have future plans of incorporating them into my acoustic Premier kit. From the NAMM show I had to race to another town to play with the Dregs that evening. Nothing like multiple gigs in one day! On a sad note, the Dixie Dregs tour was cut short when sudden news arrived of Steve Morse's dad falling into a coma. Steve raced back to his home in Florida to be by his dad's side, who sadly passed away later that day. Steve's and my friendship goes back many years. I knew his dad, a brilliant man who will be missed by all whose lives he touched. February 1 was the start of a 5+ week Winger tour in support of the new Winger 4 cd. Crowds were considerably larger than anyone anticipated and we all had an amazing time together. There will be some summer touring, so just check my 'In Concert' page periodically. The Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined Baja Prog '07 in Mexicali, Mexico this past March. 1300 seats were filled to capacity each of 4 nights at this amazing festival. Bands and aficionados of progressive rock music come from all over the world for this event. From there Jordan and I travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to play at the Music Messe for Roland. And then we played a concert in London, also for Roland, and once again on the V Drums. In a few weeks Jordan and I will headline CalProg '07, a prog festival in Whittier, California. Also, around this time, I'll be recording with Jordan for his new solo record which will be out later this year. And we're hoping that, time permitting, we can make more headway on the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. The new Jazz Is Dead cd is at the mixing stages and will be completed in the next couple of months. I have heard the rough mixes and this is by far the coolest JID recording since the band's inception. Three weeks left to the Berklee semester. it's been a crazy semester with all my touring. But I tip my hat to my students, who waited patiently until I got back to town. And I've been spending extra days making up for the days I missed earlier in the semester. I truly have some incredible drummers this year. I'm certain I will see them out there doing it Big Time in the coming years! See ya......... 1/8/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody, Happy New Year. WInger played New Years Eve in Pittsburgh, PA....... OUTDOORS in the pouring rain to a couple thousand diehard fans! We were all soaking wet, and I mean completely drenched. All in all it was a ton of fun. Feb 1 Winger begins a 5 week US tour which will take us all around the country. We'll be mixing it up with stuff from the new cd, Winger 4, and of course, all the tunes from the good ole days. The Dixie Dregs begin touring next week out west which will take us through Colorado, Utah, California, and Arizona. While in southern CA, I'll be racing to the NAMM show to jam with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth.\n\n\n\nAll concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Immediatley following the Dregs tour I will fly directly to Boston to begin the spring '07 semester at Berklee College of Music. I always look forward to meeting a new crop of talented, eager students. 9/19/06 - update from Rod Lots going on since we last 'chatted'. The first new Winger cd in 13 years , Winger IV, is slated for release October 20 in Europe on Frontiers Records, Japan on King Records, with a US release to follow shortly thereafter on Shrapnel Records. The recording is a natural progression from 'Pull', which came out in '93. Kip produced the recording, which sounds HUGE! The band will tour Europe in October in support of the cd. Concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Audio clips can be heard at www.myspace.com/kipwingermusic Also, we're setting up a winger myspace page which should be up soon... The Rudess Morgenstein Project played in Caracas, Venezuela and San Jose, Costa Rica back in May. Jordan and I had a blast doing these shows, as they were our first gigs south of the border. The energy of the fans was unbelievable! In Venezuela, we played with Angra, a fantastic band from Brazil, and we spent a good bit of time hanging with them. In Costa Rica, we were the only band on the bill, and so our show was much longer than anything we've done in the past. We did a fair amount of jamming, which inspired us to take that approach on some of the new RPM cd, which is moving along nicely. We will be playing the Baja Progfest in Mexico in March, and are talking to other south American promoters about doing shows in some other countries. Jordan is also working on his next solo cd. I will cut drum tracks for some of this recording sometime before the end of the year. The Dixie Dregs will be touring the west coast in January. Look for tour dates on the 'In Concert' page in the next few weeks. Jazz Is Dead is in the mixing stages of a new cd. Even though it will be the band's fourth release, it actually will be our very first studio recording. All the other cds were live recordings. The Berklee fall semester began last week. After a year of living the life of nomads without 'homes', due to problems with the basement area of the building we taught in, the percussion faculty are quite comfortable in our brand new, sound proofed, incredible facility. Should be a great semester. 9/16/06 - from Rod It has been quite some time since I have posted updates on my site. For those of you who may not be aware, my wife, Michele, passed away this past December. Michele was a warrior's warrior during a 22 year journey battling breast cancer. The vast majority of people in our life knew little or nothing of her condition. She chose to keep it a quiet affair so she would not have it be front and center in every aspect of her daily life. It allowed her to lead a relatively normal life and not be known as 'Michele with breast cancer'. As painfully difficult as living with cancer can be at times, our life together was nothing short of perfection. We learned to smell the roses years ago. There are no regrets, as we told each other how deeply we loved each other virtually every day of our lives. Michele was my childhood sweetheart, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate. I miss her more than anyone can imagine. Thank you to everyone for your e-mails, letters and phone calls which have offered me some level of comfort during this very difficult time. I wish you all happiness and good health. Rod\n\n5/2/05 - Update from Rod The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was awesome, covering 18 cities in 19 days. Travelling highlights included driving through a surprise spring blizzard with virtually NO visiability in the middle of the night after jamming in Cleveland! Ah, the exciting life of a touring musician. Progress continues on the new Jazz Is Dead cd. Luis Conte has added amazing percussion to several tracks and we're hoping to get a few more folks to play on this one. Winger is still looking into a fall tour to record a live dvd and possible\n\nstudio cd. I'm getting ready to do some recording with Marc Muller who has been playing pedal steel and guitar with Shania Twain for the last 10 years. We're also involved in co-writing songs. The Berklee spring semester comes to a close this week and, as always, I've had a great bunch of students who never cease to amaze me.\n\n1/29/05 - Update from Rod Just got home from the Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band west coast tour. As always, it was a lot of fun jamming with my band mates of many years. Steve Morse band drummer Van Romaine and I worked out a two-man drum solo (guess you call that a drum duo)which was really a blast to perform. Looks like we'll be doing an east coast run in mid-March, from Florida all the way up through Chicago, so check my concert calendar in a couple of weeks for tour dates. Winger is discussing the possibility of a live dvd which would involve a week or two of concerts, possibly in May or June. Stay posted for details. The Berklee College of Music spring semester has begun and, as always, I have a wonderful group of students. 9/25/04 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nWell, believe it or not, after nearly 3 years since we first began work on it, The Jelly Jam 2 was just released. We are really beginning to sound like a band! Now we're looking at all of our schedules to see if we can do some live 'Jelly Jamming' in the next few months. I'll keep you posted. If you can't find Jelly Jam 2 in a cd shop, you can go to InsideOutMusic.com to read all about it and get purchase info. Jordan Rudess' new cd, 'Rhythm of Time', was released recently on Magna Carta Records. Like I had said a while back this recording was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and rewarding recordings of my career. The Dixie Dregs will be gearing up for a west coast tour in January. Tour dates will be available on my concert calendar in the next several weeks. We're already 4 weeks into the 2004 fall semester at Berklee College of Music and, as always, I have a great bunch of students. This time around there seem to be several who are into many of the classic rock and fusion bands and drummers, which is totally fine by me. It's right up my alley. Hope you all have an enjoyable fall season....... 7/23/04 - Update from Rod\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Rudess Morgenstein Project will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center at BerkleeCollege of Music in Boston on Thursday, August 5 at 8:15 PM. We will be playing classic RPM tunes as well as music from Jordan's soon-to-be released solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time'. Ty Tabor has completed mixing The Jelly Jam 2 and it is now in the hands of Inside Out Records. I'll keep you all posted regarding the release date. Kip Winger is putting some finishing touches on the recording I did with him and Turkish producer/guitarist Cenk Eroglu earlier this year, and getting ready to shop it for a deal. The recording with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar was incredible. The jam band concept is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my 30+ years as a musician. We need to record a couple more tracks to have a full length cd, so we'll probably get together in the fall to complete it. I'm in the midst of Berklee's 5 week summer program and having a blast with my roughly 75 students. It's amazing how many talented young musicians there are out there! 4/17/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, Kip is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey to finish recording and mix several tunes on his current project with Cenk Eroglu. Talk about a fresh, new killer sound, this is it!\n\n\n\nI just got back from Illinois for a week of recording with\n\nguitarist/keyboardist Brian Moritz and his band Balance. Dave LaRue (Dixie Dregs) played bass, with Joel Kaplan on keyboards and Vince Claps on vocals. With the exception of Dave and I, all these guys have been very active in the Chicago music scene for many years. The recording was engineered by Brian Mitchell, who lives a double life as a forensic pathologist! All in all, it was quite an experience. I'll update you as the recording progresses.\n\n\n\nI'm on my way to meet up with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar in\n\nHartford, CT to record for several days on both Jeff's solo cd and some jam band oriented stuff.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I return from CT, I'll be getting together with Jordan Rudess to pick up where he and I left off with the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. We're looking into the possibility of playing some gigs later this year.\n\n\n\nThe release of Jordan's solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is August 31 on Magna Carta Records.\n\n\n\nWell, yet another Berklee school year has come to a close. I guarantee that somewhere in the future you will see some of these students realizing their musical dreams!\n\n\n\nHave a HOT summer.................... 3/19/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, I just spent the last several days in Nashville recording with Kip Winger. Over the past year, Kip has been making trips to Istanbul, Turkey where he has been writing and recording with Turkish artist/guitarist/producer Cenk Eroglu. The music is an incredible blend of east-meets-west sounds and rhythms, both traditional and high-tech. Kip and Cenk hope to finish it up in the next several months. I'll keep you posted. We're talking about the possibility of recording Winger Live In Concert along with a bunch of archival/ interview footage. Jordan Rudess' solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is set for release in July on Magna Carta Records. What an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience it always is, working with my friend Jordan. Among the guest artists appearing on the recording are Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Vinnie Moore and Greg Howe. Modern Drummer presents 'Drum Nation' was released in mid-January and includes drum performances by 14 drummers. Jordan Rudess played keys on my track 'Faceless Pastiche'. Other members of the cast include Steve Smith, Simon Phillips, Bill Bruford, Trilok Gurtu and Chad Wackerman, to name but a\n\nfew. I recorded a couple of tracks with Jeff Pevar on a solo recording he's working on. I met Jeff when he joined Jazz Is Dead in 2001. He is one of the most well-rounded, musical guitarists around. I recently went to see him perform with CPR, the band he has with David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young fame.) Jeff is the 'P' in CPR. A highlight of the evening for me was meeting David Crosby and having HIM say all these great things about the Dixie Dregs. I felt like a million bucks! Jelly Jam 2's completion is just around the corner, I promise........ Another snow has fallen, with more expected tonight. It sure has been a\n\nLOOOOOOONG Winter. 11/09/03 - Update from Rod Jordan Rudess is in the studio working on his next solo recording for Magna Carta. We're planning on doing drum tracks before the end of the year. January 13 is the Magna Carta release date for 'Modern Drummer Presents: Drum Nation Volume 1', an all-out drummers' cd featuring quite an interesting cast of players. Each participating drummer contributed one track; Jordan Rudess plays keyboards on my tune 'Faceless Pastiche'. Additional info about the cd can be found at Magna Carta'a website. I know it sounds like a broken record but Ty Tabor is planning on mixing The Jelly Jam's next cd before the end of this year, as soon as he gets off the current King's X tour. It seems like only yesterday that the semester began but the Berklee College of Music fall semester is already entering its 10th week. I have some very fine students this year and am sure to hear about them in years to come! 7/19/03 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nI've been meaning to post something ever since I got back from Europe last month. The clinic tour was an absolute blast! I played in 8 countries in 3 weeks and spent some time in the UK visiting Premier Percussion on a break in the middle of the clinic events. Thanks to everyone who came out, the turn-outs were fantastic, and I met so many wonderful drummers, Premier/Sabian/Vic Firth reps, music store personnel and other musicians. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in making these clinics first class events and I look forward to seeing all of you again somewhere down the road. I'm already full steam ahead in the Berklee College of Music 5 week program and have been teaching 11 different classes in addition to many private lessons. And I can say without hesitation that there are some VERY talented young people out there! I'm sure we'll be seeing quite a few of ya'll enrolled as Berklee College students in the years to come. Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, is putting the finishing touches on Jelly Jam 2, my project with him and John Myung, bassist with Dream Theater. Stay posted for a release date. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Talk to you in the fall. Rod 5/16/03 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody,\n\nI leave in a week for a 3 week European drum clinic tour for Premier and Sabian which will take me to some very cool places including, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Iceland, with a trip to the Premier Percussion complex in Leicester, UK thrown in for good measure. The clinics will feature the new line of Premier drums which were showcased at this year's NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA back in January. The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was a lot of fun, and as we didn't hit all of the usual east coast cities, hopefully we'll be able to put another run together this year. Ty tabor is hard at work on the next Jelly Jam recording. I'll keep you posted on a release date as soon as I hear something. And, as I've said before, we really want to tour for this one. Still waiting on a release date for the Magna Carta drummers cd. I played in a very cool blues concert last weekend at the West Hampton Performing Arts Center with Frank Latorre and The King Bees. Frank, an incredible harmonica player, played the harp on Winger's 'Down incognito' on PULL back in '93. The band also featured Richie Cannata of Billy Joel fame and 3 of Frank's longtime buddies- Doug, Paul and Paul who play guitar, bass and guitar respectively. I hope to do some more playing with these guys in the future. Jordan Rudess and I played during Berklee College's Percussion week back in April and the turn out was overwhelming. Thanks for all your support. Some day, I promise, we'll get the next studio cd released. We have interested parties in Puerto Rico and Finland wanting to bring us over to jam. So we're looking into getting it together. Well, another year at Berklee has come to a close and, as always, I had a wonderful time teaching so many talented drummer/musicians. I'll be teaching the 5 Week Summer program beginning the second week in July, so if you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hey. 2/21/03 - Update from Rod Hey everybody.\n\nThe January west coast Dixie Dregs tour was fantastic. The timing enabled us to spend some time at the NAMM Music trade show in Anaheim. It's always a blast going to the show as you meet up with so many friends and acquaintances who you don't necessarily get to see that often.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in late April for an east coast run. Check my site in the coming weeks for concert info. I recently recorded a song for an upcoming 'drummers' cd which will be coming out on Magna Carta sometime in the spring. 10-15 drummers are each contributing a tune. As I understand it, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio and Steve Smith have already submitted their tracks. Should be quite a recording. Ty Tabor is hoping to put the final touches on the new Jelly Jam cd March/April. So, hopefully, it won't be too long after that before it is released by Inside Out Records. Until we meet again.......... 12/2/02 - Update from Rod The Dixie Dregs will be touring in CA, January 10 through the 19th. Check the concert calendar for specific dates. Thanks to everyone who came out to see Winger on the east coast this past October. As is always the case with these guys, it was a tremendous amount of fun both musically and just hanging with Kip, Paul, Reb, and John. Now we'll just have to see where it all leads... Jordan Rudess and I picked up where we left off last summer on our second RPM studio recording. It's awesome working together again with my power duo partner. We're hoping to get it done in the next few months for a 2003 release and some touring. Ty Tabor will put the finishing touches on the next Jelly Jam recording as soon as he gets home from the King's X/ Ronnie Dio tour later this month. The first Jelly Jam cd created a nice buzz at radio and so we're all looking forward to releasing this next one. John Myung, Ty and I are determined to tour with this band. Another semester at Berklee is fast coming to a close. As usual, I have a great bunch of students who continue to keep me on my toes. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you next year.\n\nRod 8/28/02 - Update from Rod Well, it looks like summer is almost over. Man it was a hot one! The Poison, Cinderella, Winger, Faster Pussycat tour was an incredible amount of fun. Being back with the guys was truly an amazing experience. Jamming with them was a blast and I don't think I've laughed this much in years. These people are so much fun to hang with. And it looks like we'll be hanging again, if but for only a short time. We're doing a string of east coast Winger shows beginning October 1. Check the Concert Calendar for the dates. These will be full length shows covering considerably more songs than we did on the Poison tour. We're looking into the possibility of doing some combination Dixie Dregs/ Jelly Jam shows later this year. I'll keep you posted. Jordan Rudess and I have been in communicado trying to nail down a time period to finish up our next studio recording which was begun last summer. I'll keep you abreast of that one, too. The Berklee College of Music fall semester begins shortly and I'm looking forward to meeting lots of new faces as well as the 'veterans'. See you all soon......\n\n5/2/02 - Update from Rod Hey everybody. Well, as you all know by now, Winger is back together and will be touring with Poison, Cinderella, and Faster Pussycat from mid-May through July. I must admit, the adrenaline is beginning to flow as the starting date approaches. This will be the first time we've played as a band live in nearly 9 years. A few Winger Only headline shows will be happening, too. For all tour dates click here. The Jelly Jam debut cd was released in the latter part of March and Ty and I have been doing a good amount of press and radio in support of it. We're hoping to do some touring with this project as soon as our schedules permit. John Myung is currently on tour with Dream Theater, and Ty is on the road with King's X. So, all three of us have our hands full at the moment. But we're determined to make The Jelly Jam a full-fledged, LIVE jamming band. This week was the last week of classes for the spring 2002 semester at Berklee College of Music. Finals are next week, after which I race back to New York to board a plane to Nashville for a week of Winger rehearsals. I had a fantastic group of students this year who really kept me on my toes. I'm sure I'll be seeing many of them in concert with their own bands in the years to come! Have a great summer and I hope to run in to some of you along the way.........

Upon acceptance into the program, degree students are also given a berklee.edu email address.\n\nStudents must enroll in a certificate by paying the $175 certificate registration fee prior to completing the final course in the program. All for-credit courses that have been awarded a passing grade and that align with a certificate program may transfer into that program.\n\nCan I upgrade from a lower-level certificate to a higher-level certificate?\n\nCHANGE CERTIFICATE: When a student wants to change their lower-level certificate to a higher-level certificate (or vice versa) prior to the completion of the program. There are no additional fees for this option other than the cost of additional courses, and you will only earn one certificate upon completion. STARTING A NEW CERTIFICATE: When a student wants to earn more than one certificate by having the courses from their lower-level certificate waived into a higher-level certificate. In this case, an additional $175 registration fee is required. Yes! Berklee Online offers two certificate options:\n\nFaculty\n\nWho teaches Berklee Online courses?

Financial assistance is available for Berklee Online degree programs. This assistance may come from a variety of sources including federal awards, outside scholarships, and private loans.\n\n\n\nFederal financial aid is not available for non-degree programs. Non-degree students typically finance their costs out-of-pocket or with a private loan. Review our payment options.\n\nGraduation\n\nWhat happens if I turn in my graduation application late? Do I still need to apply by December 1 even if I don\u2019t want to walk in the Commencement ceremony? Because we must coordinate with the Boston campus for Commencement, it is essential that students planning to walk in the ceremony submit their graduation application by 12:00 midnight ET on December 1. If you submit your application late, you will need to wait until the following year to walk.\n\n\n\nWe ask all students planning to graduate within the current academic year to apply for graduation by December 1, regardless of their plans to participate in Commencement. Late application for students who do not wish to walk will result in processing delays for your academic record and diploma, and your name may not be listed in the ceremony program.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between graduating and walking in Commencement?\n\n\n\nYou can walk in Commencement when you are nine (9) credits or less away from completing your degree requirements by the end of the spring term. Please note: Berklee Online degree students are not required to walk in Commencement in Boston.\n\n\n\nYou graduate when you have met all of the following criteria: Attained at least a 2.70 cumulative GPA in concentrate courses\n\nHave a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00\n\nFulfilled all program requirements AND completed a minimum of 120 credits for a single major or 165 for a dual major\n\nCompleted a minimum of 60 institutional credits for a single major or 105 institutional credits for a dual major\n\nFulfilled all financial obligations to the college Note Walking across the stage in Commencement does not mean that you have graduated.

If you are interested in applying to the Bachelor of Arts degree program and would like an estimate of the amount of transfer credit you would receive, you can request an unofficial transfer evaluation by emailing a copy of your transcript(s) to the Berklee Online Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu . Be sure to include your name, major of interest, and any additional questions you may have. You can expect to receive your assessment within 7-10 business days.\n\nI didn\u2019t receive credit on my Official Evaluation for all of the courses that I thought I would. What should I do? The earlier you contact us with questions or concerns regarding your evaluation, the easier it will be for us to address any issues. Therefore, it is very important when you first receive your official transfer evaluation that you review the information carefully.\n\n\n\nIf you notice a remaining requirement that you believe you\u2019ve already fulfilled, first consult our document on Common Reasons Credit Does Not Transfer. It\u2019s possible that the course you are thinking of didn\u2019t meet our eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\nIf none of those exclusions apply, please fill out a Transfer Credit Equivalency Re-evaluation form for the courses you wish to have reconsidered.\n\n\n\nSometimes, we are not able to locate specific information for a course online and we are not able to determine an equivalency, but we are always happy to review additional material which will help us make that determination.\n\nDo my Berklee Online, Berklee campus, or Prior Learning Credit coursework count towards the 60 transfer credit limit? No, credits completed at Berklee or through the prior learning process do not count towards the 60 transfer credit limit. This maximum is for credit-bearing exams and undergraduate-level coursework completed externally.\n\nWhat is a credit deficiency and why do I need to make up credit? Credit deficiencies are caused by transferring a course that is less than three (3) credits to fulfill a three (3) credit Berklee Online requirement. Students with a credit deficiency will be short of the minimum number of credits required to graduate once they have completed their program requirements. In order to be eligible to graduate, you will need to make up the credits you are deficient in.\n\n\n\nWhile the Transfer Team does their best to avoid giving students credit deficiencies, it is not always possible. You can make up the credits you are deficient in by completing additional Berklee Online coursework, by applying for prior learning credit, or by completing additional external coursework in the area in which you are deficient.\n\n\n\nNote all external courses will first need to be approved by the Transfer Team.\n\nCan transfer credit fulfill prerequisites? It depends. Generally, transfer credit cannot be used to fulfill prerequisites unless we determine that the course you completed is a direct equivalent to one of the courses we offer at Berklee Online. Keep in mind that there are some courses which require you to pass a placement exam. For these you will need to achieve a passing grade on the test to fulfill the prerequisite, otherwise you will need to complete the appropriate Berklee Online course.\n\nCan I transfer credits to Berklee Online after I have started the degree program? Yes, you can. To determine if the coursework you already completed or are considering taking is eligible to fulfill your remaining degree requirements, contact the Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu\n\nI am a Berklee campus student. Can I transfer courses from Berklee Online to my campus-based program?\n\n\n\nFor additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at View a list of transferable courses to Berklee\u2019s campus programs.For additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at transfercredits@berklee.edu\n\nAre Berklee Online courses transferable to other institutions? Berklee Online is regionally accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), the same association that accredits our main campus and other leading academic institutions such as Harvard University and MIT. Our courses are transferable to other institutions, but it's up to the receiving institution to decide the number and types of courses that may transfer. We recommend getting a course pre-approved by an institution before enrolling.\n\nTuition\n\nHow do Berklee Online\u2019s costs compare to other education options? Berklee Online\u2019s programs have a tuition cost that is approximately 64 percent less than on-campus tuition at Berklee\u2019s Boston campus. Moreover, a recent study revealed that the average annual tuition at for-profit colleges is more than twice as expensive as Berklee Online. Even average annual tuition at other accredited non-profit online universities is roughly $11,000 more expensive than tuition for a year with Berklee Online!\n\nHow much does a certificate program cost? There is a one time $175 registration fee per certificate program. Students may either pay per course term (at the $1,515 per credit course cost) or pay in full to receive a 10 percent discount. The registration fee and all courses for the term you wish to begin in must be paid in full in order to begin.\n\nHow much does an online Bachelor\u2019s degree cost? Online undergraduate degree tuition is $59,160 for 120 credits for all majors except the guitar major. Tuition for the guitar major is $63,660. Students taking 10 courses per year can complete the degree in four years at a cost of $14,790 per year. (Note: Tuition and fees are subject to change.)\n\nHow much does an online master's degree cost? Online graduate degree tuition is $33,120 for 36 credits.

The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dreg\u2019s music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\n\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possible the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\n\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beack, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\n\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\n\n\nAnd so, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band\n\n\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. And offshoot of Platypus is Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their first release is due out in 2001.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently an Associate Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Premier Percussion (Rod Morgenstein Signature Drumheads), Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been and endorser for many, many years.\n\n\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://online.berklee.edu/faculty/rod-morgenstein", "page_content": "Berklee Online is the online school of Berklee College of Music, delivering access to Berklee\u2019s acclaimed curriculum from anywhere in the world.

If you are interested in applying to the Bachelor of Arts degree program and would like an estimate of the amount of transfer credit you would receive, you can request an unofficial transfer evaluation by emailing a copy of your transcript(s) to the Berklee Online Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu . Be sure to include your name, major of interest, and any additional questions you may have. You can expect to receive your assessment within 7-10 business days.\n\nI didn\u2019t receive credit on my Official Evaluation for all of the courses that I thought I would. What should I do? The earlier you contact us with questions or concerns regarding your evaluation, the easier it will be for us to address any issues. Therefore, it is very important when you first receive your official transfer evaluation that you review the information carefully.\n\n\n\nIf you notice a remaining requirement that you believe you\u2019ve already fulfilled, first consult our document on Common Reasons Credit Does Not Transfer. It\u2019s possible that the course you are thinking of didn\u2019t meet our eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\nIf none of those exclusions apply, please fill out a Transfer Credit Equivalency Re-evaluation form for the courses you wish to have reconsidered.\n\n\n\nSometimes, we are not able to locate specific information for a course online and we are not able to determine an equivalency, but we are always happy to review additional material which will help us make that determination.\n\nDo my Berklee Online, Berklee campus, or Prior Learning Credit coursework count towards the 60 transfer credit limit? No, credits completed at Berklee or through the prior learning process do not count towards the 60 transfer credit limit. This maximum is for credit-bearing exams and undergraduate-level coursework completed externally.\n\nWhat is a credit deficiency and why do I need to make up credit? Credit deficiencies are caused by transferring a course that is less than three (3) credits to fulfill a three (3) credit Berklee Online requirement. Students with a credit deficiency will be short of the minimum number of credits required to graduate once they have completed their program requirements. In order to be eligible to graduate, you will need to make up the credits you are deficient in.\n\n\n\nWhile the Transfer Team does their best to avoid giving students credit deficiencies, it is not always possible. You can make up the credits you are deficient in by completing additional Berklee Online coursework, by applying for prior learning credit, or by completing additional external coursework in the area in which you are deficient.\n\n\n\nNote all external courses will first need to be approved by the Transfer Team.\n\nCan transfer credit fulfill prerequisites? It depends. Generally, transfer credit cannot be used to fulfill prerequisites unless we determine that the course you completed is a direct equivalent to one of the courses we offer at Berklee Online. Keep in mind that there are some courses which require you to pass a placement exam. For these you will need to achieve a passing grade on the test to fulfill the prerequisite, otherwise you will need to complete the appropriate Berklee Online course.\n\nCan I transfer credits to Berklee Online after I have started the degree program? Yes, you can. To determine if the coursework you already completed or are considering taking is eligible to fulfill your remaining degree requirements, contact the Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu\n\nI am a Berklee campus student. Can I transfer courses from Berklee Online to my campus-based program?\n\n\n\nFor additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at View a list of transferable courses to Berklee\u2019s campus programs.For additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at transfercredits@berklee.edu\n\nAre Berklee Online courses transferable to other institutions? Berklee Online is regionally accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), the same association that accredits our main campus and other leading academic institutions such as Harvard University and MIT. Our courses are transferable to other institutions, but it's up to the receiving institution to decide the number and types of courses that may transfer. We recommend getting a course pre-approved by an institution before enrolling.\n\nTuition\n\nHow do Berklee Online\u2019s costs compare to other education options? Berklee Online\u2019s programs have a tuition cost that is approximately 64 percent less than on-campus tuition at Berklee\u2019s Boston campus. Moreover, a recent study revealed that the average annual tuition at for-profit colleges is more than twice as expensive as Berklee Online. Even average annual tuition at other accredited non-profit online universities is roughly $11,000 more expensive than tuition for a year with Berklee Online!\n\nHow much does a certificate program cost? There is a one time $175 registration fee per certificate program. Students may either pay per course term (at the $1,515 per credit course cost) or pay in full to receive a 10 percent discount. The registration fee and all courses for the term you wish to begin in must be paid in full in order to begin.\n\nHow much does an online Bachelor\u2019s degree cost? Online undergraduate degree tuition is $59,160 for 120 credits for all majors except the guitar major. Tuition for the guitar major is $63,660. Students taking 10 courses per year can complete the degree in four years at a cost of $14,790 per year. (Note: Tuition and fees are subject to change.)\n\nHow much does an online master's degree cost? Online graduate degree tuition is $33,120 for 36 credits.

Both programs are comprised of 12 three-credit courses that can be taken during four 12-week semesters."}, {"url": "https://drummerworld.com/drummers/Alan_Dawson.html", "page_content": "Alan Dawson, his performance credits are staggering, like reading a who's who in jazz: Oscar Peterson, George Shearing, Charles Mingus, Woody Shaw, Phil Woods, Sonny Stitt, Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, Reggie Workman, Quincy Jones, Dexter Gordon, Tal Farlow, Earl Hines, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Frank Morgan, Hank Jones, Frank Foster, Phineas Newborn, Charles McPhereson, Jaki Byard, Teddy Wilson, Booker Ervin, James Williams, Phil Wilson, Terry Gibbs, and many others.\n\n\n\nEqually impressive are his former students who have gone on to become their own innovators: Tony Williams, Terri Lyne Carrington, Steve Smith, Joe LaBarbera, Joe Corsello, Kenwood Dennard, John \"J.R.\" Robinson, Casey Scheuerell, Harvey Mason, Vinnie Colaiuta, Keith Copeland, Jake Hanna, Bobby Ward, Akira Tana, and many, many, others.\n\n\n\nGeorge \"Alan\" Dawson was born in 1929 in Marietta, Pennsylvania and raised in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. He studied drumset for four years with percussionist Charles Alden before serving in the Army for Korean War duty. Dawson played with the Army Dance Band while stationed at Fort Dix from 1951-1953. During his army experience, Dawson was able to dive into the post-bop era by performing with pianist Sabby Lewis' eight-piece band, and after his release from the Army he embarked on a three-month tour of Europe with Lionel Hampton.\n\n\n\nDuring the mid-'50s. Dawson returned to Boston where he maintained an active recording career and did clinics and some brief tours. In 1957 he became the house drummer at Wally's Paradise in Boston and also began an eighteen-year association at the Berklee College of Music. In the late 1950s, Dawson performed with John and Paul Neves, and he worked with Herb Pomeroy at the Stables from 1959-1960.\n\n\n\nFrom 1963-1970, Dawson was the house drummer at Lennie's On The Turnpike, in Peabody, where he had the opportunity to perform with many leading artists. Dawson subsequently became Boston's drummer of choice for local players as well as touring jazz giants. In the 1960s, Dawson's New York recording experiences reached full gear with saxophonist Booker Ervin's recording project The Freedom Book. Richard Davis on bass for Prestige records was substantial between 1963-1968. From 1968-1975 Alan worked with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and toured with Brubeck's family band, Two Generations of Brubeck.\n\n\n\nIn 1975, Dawson suffered a ruptured disc and needed surgery. He stopped all touring, ended his tenure at Berklee and returned to limited teaching at his home in Lexington, a suburb of Boston. Dawson formed a quartet with James Williams, Bill Pierce and Richard Reid, and established a more staid and relaxed lifestyle. Dawson's decision to limit his teaching to thirty hours per week resulted in an impressive waiting list of students who wanted to learn his \"ritual\" for practice, his secret to independence, his obsession in obtaining musical variation, and his quest for control of sound, color and swing.\n\n\n\nDawson had planned to be a performer first and foremost. But in 1954 he began an informal parting of information to Clifford Jarvis, and shortly afterwards, he began teaching in a more formal manner by taking on Tony Williams and others. Alan started teaching at Berklee College of Music and began to analyze everything he was playing. He developed to a point where he felt comfortable as a professional player thinking like a teacher, and as a teacher who could readily impart his performance secrets to others. Once Dawson attained this important balance between teaching and performing, he found that both mediums improved significantly.\n\n\n\nDawson's approach to teaching was simple. He primarily taught people to play music, and the instrument itself was secondary. Dawson felt very strongly about drummers knowing the melodies and forms of tunes in order to better fulfill their role in accompanying.\n\n\n\nDawson was well noted for a teaching concept of four-way independence via a musical approach by using Ted Reed's Syncopation For The Modern Drummer and George Stone's Stick Control. Alan always felt that coordination was good to have, but when taken to extremes it could set up rhythmic interference instead of keeping the groove going. He went beyond using exercises, books and rudiments for technical purposes, pursuing musical ways to utilize those materials. Alan once stated that, \"The difference between jazz and other music is like the difference between marching and dancing - marching is done on the heels and dancing is done on the toes. If you take away those written accents on the beat or syncopate the rolls, you can get a nice jazz feel.\"\n\n\n\nDawson advocated the use of brushes for all sticking and rudimental exercises. He felt that by using brushes, one wouldn't be getting much rebound, thereby giving one the sense of \"picking up\" the sticks. Dawson also stressed proper posture at the drumset and relaxation in body movements, relating these issues to balance in sound in one's playing and the ability to control all four limbs.\n\n\n\nDawson realized that some students were more talented than others, but he was equally proud of them all. Alan truly believed that, as a teacher, he had gotten back more than he gave.\n\n\n\nThe following quotes by some of today's leading performers and educators reflect the impact Alan had on the drumming community:\n\n\n\nJohn Robinson: \"Once I was finally able to study with Alan, a part of me would have been satisfied just to hear the stories from a legend or to watch and hear him play. Alan's teaching technique showed me chart reading, confidence, song sense and, most of all, groove. What Alan did for music is unrivaled. What Alan did for drummers is godly.\"\n\n\n\nFred Buda: \"During my many years teaching with Alan we shared many musical ideas and thoughts about guiding young drummers through the challenges of the art and profession of music. Alan taught his students about the mechanics of playing, but he mostly emphasized the role of the drummer to swing and to make the time comfortable for other musicians to sound their best.\"\n\n\n\nCasey Scheuerell: \"Alan was the best mentor a drummer could have. Music, melody and form were what impressed him. He would bust you in a New York-minute for loosing your place in a tune. A.D. had a certain crispness to his sound - a snap, crackle, pop, if you will. Alan was one of the best soloists ever to play the instrument. Alan was 'Awesome Dawson'.\"\n\n\n\nTerri Lyne Carrington: \"To be a great teacher, one has to have a big heart and a large capacity to love. Alan had those qualities and was very generous to all that came in contact with him. When I started playing drums at age seven, he refused to teach me until I was fourteen for fear that his discipline might discourage me. I didn't realize until many years later how compassionate this was of him. I'll miss Alan's artistry and friendship, and only hope that he felt the love that we all had for him.\"\n\n\n\nTony Williams: \"Alan Dawson was one of the best drummers in the world. That's a fact, not just my opinion. I met Mr. Dawson when I was nine years old. He went out of his way to encourage me, help me and to see that I had opportunities to develop my meager skills. For example, on Saturday nights he would drive one hundred miles out of his way to pick me up in Roxbury, drive to Cambridge to let me perform with his trio and gain valuable experience, and then return me safely home before returning home himself to Lexington. I was twelve years old. Every drummer, local and worldwide, knew of his legendary speed, precision and control. Mr. Dawson didn't only teach me to play the drums, he taught me how to conduct myself as a musician and as a man. Thank you, Alan Dawson.\"\n\n\n\nOn February 23, 1996, Dawson died of leukemia at the age of 66. He will be remembered for his dedication to his craft and the excellence that he sought to attain. We will always remember Alan's perpetual smile, fixed gaze and deep passion for teaching. The void left by his passing will remain, and the inspiration that he was to all who studied with, played with, or listened to him perform, will live on.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://drummercafe.com/featured/articles/interview-with-rod-morgenstein", "page_content": "The professional music career of Rod Morgenstein began as a founding member of the groundbreaking group the Dixie Dregs when, as a student at the University of Miami in Florida, he met Steve Morse, Andy West and Allen Sloan. The university was a hotbed of musical activity during this period, playing host to brilliant future talents like Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Playing under the official Studio Music and Jazz curriculum title of Rock Ensemble II, the Dregs honed their fusionesque chops. It was here that the band recorded its classic Great Spectacular album now available on CD.\n\nThe Dixie Dregs' music combines rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk and classical influences into a rich, ever-changing tapestry of sound. All the while, Rod\u2019s drumming weaves its way seamlessly and colorfully through this swirling musical landscape.\n\nHis unique, dynamic and musical drumming style has led to Rod\u2019s winning the Best Progressive Rock Drummer award in Modern Drummer Magazine\u2019s Reader\u2019s Poll 5 years in a row (1986-1990) and Best All-Around Drummer (1999), earning him a permanent position in the magazine\u2019s prestigious Honor Roll. The Dixie Dregs, whose last 6 recordings have each received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, are best described in the following Philadelphia Inquirer concert review, \u201cThe Dregs have their own unique language and style familiar to bluegrass and country music, refined with classical finesse and delivered with high-powered technology and rock energy. The band is possibly the most important, and certainly the most technically advanced, instrumental group in progressive fusion.\u201d\n\nWhen the group temporarily disbanded in 1983, Rod joined forces with Steve Morse who, along with bassist Jerry Peek, formed the Steve Morse Band. Rod remembers, \u201cOne of our biggest breaks came when we had the opportunity to tour for 3 months with Rush on their 1985-1986 Power Windows tour. I felt a surge of popularity, both as a band and as a drummer, as a result of performing night after night in sold out arenas packed with appreciative progressive-rock fans. And it was more than obvious that many of them were drummers.\u201d\n\nThe Steve Morse Band recorded two albums, at which point Rod found himself at a crossroad in his career, as Steve Morse joined the reforming group Kansas. \u201cI was ready for a musical change and to try something both new and challenging.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of moving to New York City in 1986 after living in and around Atlanta, Georgia, for the previous 11 years, Rod met Kip Winger and Reb Beach, namesake and lead guitarist of the as-of-then-non-existent band Winger. \u201cKip and Reb had been writing and recording demos and forever being rejected by record labels. I met them at a point in their lives where they were completely driven to get signed. Nothing could shake their determination. We got together and jammed, hit it off, and two months later they called to say they got a deal and to see if I\u2019d be interested in doing the record.\u201d\n\nThe rest is history! Their self-titled debut album in 1988 sold over two million copies worldwide, earning the band a platinum album in the U.S. and gold albums in Japan and Canada. It also led to an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band. This album was followed by In the Heart of the Young and, once again, platinum and gold awards were in the offing, coupled with non-stop international touring.\n\nThe band ceased activities in 1993 after touring for the highly acclaimed Pull recording, as dramatic changes were taking place in the music scene. Alternative music had replaced metal as the accepted music of the day.\n\nIn 2002, WInger reunited for a summer tour with Poison, CInderella and Faster Pussycat in support of 'The Very Best of Winger', a greatest hits collection. And in 2006, the band released the critically acclaimed, 'Winger IV', followed by tours in Europe, US, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, when Winger temporarily disbanded, Kip Winger set out to record his first solo album, This Conversation Seems Like Dream (1997), a dramatic departure from the first three Winger recordings, drawing heavily on world percussive rhythms, dark imagery and heavy grooves. Rod recorded the drum tracks for this album and the more recent Songs From The Ocean Floor (2001) at Kip\u2019s home studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n1997 also saw the self-titled debut release by the Rudess/Morgenstein Project, an instrumental progressive power-duo, featuring Rod and Dream Theater keyboardist extraordinaire Jordan Rudess. The seed for this project was planted one evening on the Dixie Dregs 1994 Full Circle tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when a sudden power failure shut down the guitar, bass and violin rigs. For whatever reason, the keyboards remained unaffected. And what followed was a blistering, 10 minute drum/keyboard power-duo jam, which brought down the house. It was that evening\u2019s events, which inspired Rod and Jordan to form their \u201csmall in numbers yet mighty in sound\u201d band. The Rudess Morgenstein Project has played concerts in the US, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Holland and the UK. Additionally, Rod recorded the drum tracks for Jordan's solo cds, ' Rhythm of Time' and 'The Road Home'.\n\nOther on-going projects that Rod is involved with are jam band Jazz Is Dead which features creative improvisations of the music by the Grateful Dead. Members of JID have included T Lavitz, Alphonso Johnson, Jeff Sipe, Billy Cobham, Jeff Pevar, Dave Livolsi, and Jimmy Herring, with an ever-changing line up. Another project is Platypus, whose two recordings feature John Myung (Dream Theater), Ty Tabor (King\u2019s X) and Derek Sherinian (Planet X). The music is a mix of instrumental and vocal tunes that blend many different styles together. An offshoot of Platypus is The Jelly Jam, a power trio featuring Rod, Ty Tabor and John Myung. Their debut release came out in 2001, and The Jelly Jam, '2' was released in 2004.\n\nIn addition to his recording and touring credits, Rod is very active in drum education. He is currently a Professor of Percussion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Also, his highly recognized instructional materials include videos, audio cassettes and books. His most recent offering is Drum Set Warm-Ups, touted as the definitive text for developing and improving all aspects of drum set playing. Additionally, Rod has been a columnist for Modern Drummer Magazine (U.S.), Rhythm Magazine (UK), Sticks Magazine (Germany) and is an international clinician and involved with product development for Sabian Cymbals (Signature Tri-Top Ride), and Vic Firth Sticks (Signature Sticks and Isolation Headphones), with whom he has been an endorser for many, many years.\n\nRod can be summed up in the following passage from a cover story in Modern Drummer Magazine: \u201cYou can see it in his face; Rod Morgenstein loves what he does for a living. Get him talking about drums and you\u2019ll see those eyes start to crinkle as a warm, sincere smile spreads over his face. Get him behind a set of drums, and the same enthusiasm is evident in the way that he tears into the kit as though he\u2019s been waiting for weeks to get at it. That\u2019s not to imply that his playing is uncontrolled, because he is definitely in charge of everything that is happening on the drum set. It\u2019s just to say that you never get the sense that Morgenstein has lost any of the initial excitement about the drums that makes people become drummers to begin with.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.moderndrummer.com/2009/12/alan-dawson/", "page_content": "Influencer: Alan Dawson\n\nAlan Dawson was an outstanding jazz drummer and a legendary teacher. He was strongly influenced by Papa Jo Jones, and his first break came in the early \u201950s with the Lionel Hampton band. By 1951 he was working with Sabby Lewis and building a solid reputation as a superb jazz drummer in the Boston area. Between 1963 and 1970 Alan was the house drummer at Lennie\u2019s in Boston, where he backed a variety of top artists.\n\nAlan was known for his ingenious use of rudiments, his melodic approach to drumming, and an extremely advanced level of hand and foot coordination. As a member of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with Gerry Mulligan and Jack Six) from 1968 through 1974, Alan also established himself as a resourceful soloist with rock-steady time. Additional performances with artists like Phil Woods, Reggie Workman, Oscar Peterson, Sony Stitt, Dexter Gordon, Quincy Jones, George Shearing, Tal Farlow, Earl Hines, and Hank Jones further heightened his popularity among musicians, who considered him one of the most tasteful, meticulous, and intelligent players on the jazz scene.\n\nIronically, what started out to be a sideline for Alan\u2014teaching\u2014may be what he is most remembered for. In 1957 he became a member of the faculty at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, where he remained for the next eighteen years. The list of drummers he taught and directly influenced includes Steve Smith, Kenwood Dennard, Harvey Mason, John \u201cJ.R.\u201d Robinson, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Tony Williams. In 1987 Dawson appeared at Modern Drummer\u2019s inaugural Drum Festival alongside Dave Weckl, Kenny Aronoff, Rod Morgenstein, and Steve Gadd. Dawson died in 1996 a the age of sixty-six."}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/rod-morgenstein-picks-10-essential-drum-albums-568991", "page_content": "Rod Morgenstein picks 10 essential drum albums\n\nAlthough he's celebrated for his idiosyncratic, virtuosic drumming in bands such as the Dixie Dregs, Winger, Jazz Is Dead and The Jelly Jam, among others, Rod Morgenstein says that great drum albums don't always have to pack explosive displays of technical firepower.\n\n\"What makes something a brilliant listening experience can vary album to album, drummer to drummer,\" he says. \"The role that percussion plays in the music just has to draw you in somehow, and that can be anything. What moves me can be all over the map, but I always respond when somebody is inspired and it shines through.\"\n\nLike so many other children of the '60s, Morgenstein bought a copy of Meet The Beatles after seeing the band's historic performance on the Ed Sullivan Show. Wearing out both sides of that disc, he marveled at Ringo Starr's wildly inventive, idiosyncratic playing. \"He did these little things that were so interesting,\" Morgenstein says, \"but it wasn't about being a show-off. He was just being himself, and he was integral to what was going on. He was one quarter of what made the music sound the way it did.\"\n\nThree years later, Morgenstein's musical world turned upside down yet again when a friend sat him down and played The Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experience. \"I never heard a guitar played in quite that way before,\" he says, \"but that also holds true for what Mitch Mitchell did on the drums. Hendrix was a very dominant figure, but to me, Mitch was just as important to the whole of the music. I was floored. Soon after that, along came John Bonham and Jethro Tull\u2019s Clive Bunker and, of course, all the fusion guys. Drumming really opened up.\"\n\nAs one of fusion's most acclaimed drummers and highly respected instructors (16 years as a professor in the Percussion department at Berklee College of Music), Morgenstein has spent years analyzing the minutiae of musical composition and performance. Yet he's the first to admit that what distinguishes a great drummer from a good one can be a subtle, elusive difference.\n\n\"It\u2019s always a question mark in my head,\" he says. \"'What is it about this person\u2019s feel that\u2019s different from everybody else's?' is what I ask myself. A lot of times, it goes beyond ability and comes down to personality. If you can allow some aspect of your character to come out in your playing, you'll stand out, you'll drive the music. Any time I hear an album that's really great, it's because the drummer is driving the band.\"\n\nOn the following pages, Morgenstein runs down his choices for what he considers to be 10 essential drum albums (listed alphabetically by artist). \"I could probably have picked 20 very easily,\" he says. \"Led Zeppelin alone have several records where you're like, 'How can I decide? It's all too good!'\""}, {"url": "https://www.tigerbill.com/drummerinterviews/rodmorgenstein.htm", "page_content": "The Tiger Interview Rod Morgenstein Rod talks about his career and what is takes to make it in music Rod Morgenstein has been playing drums professionally for more than 20 years. In addition to his claim to fame as a founding member of the progressive rock-fusion band Dixie Dregs (who have received multiple Grammy nominations for Best Rock Instrumental Performance), he was also an original member of the heavy metal group Winger (who received an American Music Award nomination for Best New Heavy Metal Band in 1989). In addition, Rod has worked with many jazz-fusion greats over the years and has won Modern Drummer magazine's Readers Poll award for Best Progressive Rock Drummer many times. I met Rod backstage at the Modern Drummer Festival 2001. Rod is one of those positive people who always has a smile on his face and he was nice enough to grant me an interview where he talks about his musical beginnings, his latest projects, and offers tips to help others on the road to fame and fortune. He also discusses his latest drum book )see the sidebar for my review). Take a few minutes now to glean some valuable tips from one of drumming's greats \u0096 Rod Morgenstein. TB (Tiger Bill): What was it that made you want to become a drummer? RM (Rod Morgenstein): I knew I wanted to be a drummer the moment I saw The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show in the early '60s. I instantly identified with Ringo, the drummer. TB: When you were first starting out on the drums, did you have formal instruction or were you self-taught? RM: My parents bought me a bass drum, snare drum, and a cymbal (on a stand mounted on the bass drum), and I began copying the drum beats to The Beatles records. About a year later, after my parents saw that I had an affinity for the instrument, they hooked me up with Howie Mann, a local drum teacher who still teaches in Hicksville, Long Island. He's a wonderful guy who taught me how to hold the sticks correctly, how to negotiate my way around the drum set, and he exposed me to the fact that there was music beyond rock music. He taught me how to read big band drum charts and showed me how to set up figures and play the kicks, etc. I studied with Howie for about five years and it was a wonderful experience. While I was a typical kid who emulated the drummers of my favorite bands like Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and Jethro Tull, I owe my well-rounded background to Howie Mann. TB: When did you first start to use double bass drums? RM: I was traveling around the southeastern part of the US with the Dixie Dregs and had just finished a show in Florida when I ran into a guy who had an old chrome Fibes drum kit for sale. It had two bass drums, 2 floor toms, 4 rack toms, and a snare. At the time, I was obsessing over Billy Cobham with The Mahavishnu Orchestra and Billy was playing a clear Fibes kit. So, I bought the chrome Fibes drums and set them up on the next gig. I've been playing double bass from that day on. It's funny that you mention it because I play with this band called Jazz Is Dead and I inherited the drum chair after Billy Cobham left. It's all based on the Grateful Dead's music but you wouldn't know it after a minute into a song because it's basically a free for all jam. Anyway, every time the band goes on tour there's a different theme. This particular tour was based on two relatively mellow Grateful Dead albums from the '70s called \"Workingman's Dead\" and \"American Beauty,\" and it was billed almost like Jazz Is Dead Acoustic, even though it turned out not to be. The idea was to have everybody scale down, so I took out a single bass kit with a double bass pedal, one floor tom, two rack toms (instead of my usual three), and it was a very weird feeling. After 20 years of playing behind two bass drums it's like, all of a sudden, one side of my body was open to the audience and I felt like I lost my security blanket. But by midway through the 30 some odd dates we played I was like, hey, this is really cool! When you play on a different configuration it makes you play differently, you rethink your playing. It's nice to try new things, it's like continually being a student. By not always playing it safe, you'll find things out about yourself and you'll keep improving. TB: What's your latest project? RM: Jazz Is Dead has a live CD coming out and we'll probably support it with a month or so of touring. I'm guessing somewhere around August. I also work with Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess. We have this power duo made up of just one keyboard and drums. We played the Modern Drummer Festival in 1998. TB: Tell me more about your power duo. RM: It's really an amazing thing in that 95 percent of what we do is totally live. Essentially, other than the drums, what Jordan is playing IS the band and you wouldn't know that there wasn't an army of musicians playing. Jordan has harnessed the existing keyboard technology to do things like layer multiple sounds on one note and access each different sound based on how hard you strike that key on the keyboard. Jordan also splits his keyboard into three sections where he plays bass with his left hand and chords in the middle section where he programs his sustain pedal to sustain only those chords that he selects to be sustained. This leaves his right hand free for soloing. Then, since he can't pitch bend with his left hand because he's playing bass, he programs the keyboard to pitch bend based on the pressure he uses on the keys. It's astounding! We refer to ourselves as the world's mightiest duo: Never before has so much music been made by so few people [laughs]. Here I am saying how great our band is but I'm saying it's because of what Jordan is able to do. TB: Does Jordan use sequencing with the duo? RM: Remember I said that 95 percent is live? Well that's the other 5 percent. At times Jordan might use a bass sequence so he can do pitch bending or some other astounding thing with his left hand, but the whole idea of the band is to pull it off live, which we don't think anyone else can do. We have a couple of CDs out already and we'll soon be working on another one. TB: I know you've authored some drum instructional books and videos in the past, but do you have anything new coming out? RM: I have a new book called Drum Set Warm-ups (see sidebar) that came out on Berklee Press recently. The story behind this book is interesting. A couple of years ago I was warming up on my drum pad and I was struck by a very funny scenario. I was thinking alright, it's time to warm-up so guitarists go get your guitars, sax players go get your saxophones, keyboardists go sit at your synths and drummers go get your chunk of wood with the slab of rubber glued to it! It dawned on me that everybody warms-up on their own instrument except for drummers. While we all know how important it is to warm-up on a pad to focus on our finger, wrist, and hand technique, there's no way that the range of motion required on a drum set can be covered just sitting at a pad. It struck me as kind of amazing that never before has there been a drum set warm-up book and so I set out to write the Stick Control equivalent for the drum set using some of the exercises I've been creating for myself over the last 20 years, based on things that have frustrated me. Things like: I can't get around the set fast enough because the cymbals are so far away; My coordination's not happening; I'm not playing dynamically enough; My right side is weaker than my left because I'm left handed, etc. When I completed the manuscript and sent copies out to my drummer friends and acquaintances for their opinions, I got really wonderful feedback. Vic Firth (with the Boston Symphony Orchestra), John Beck (from the Easton School of Music), Danny Gottlieb, Steve Smith, Kenny Aronoff, and Joe Morello, they all gave me great quotes for the book. Ron Spagnardi, editor/publisher of Modern Drummer magazine, sent back a quote that said, \"This is the drum set equivalent for Stone's Stick Control.\" I'm really excited about the book and I know it works because I've used the exercises myself. While many of the exercises in the book put demands on the body that you would never actually receive playing the drum set, consider them similar to the exercise that has football players running through tires. There are no tires on a football field but that exercise helps to condition the player's body. The result is some pretty bizarre exercises that force you to go in contrary motions but over time, you'll feel yourself moving up a notch technically. TB: It sounds like the drumming equivalent to a martial artist's warm-up prior to a strenuous workout or tournament. RM: Exactly. TB: Here's my final stock question, Rod \u0096 Do you have any words of wisdom for drummers trying to make it in the business today? RM: This is the most difficult question to answer because in rock and pop music there is often no rhyme or reason to success. But, based on my own personal experiences in the field, I would offer these tips: Don't get into the business because you want to be a millionaire and live in the mansion driving the Ferrari. It may happen but it may not. Just do it because you love music and if you really think you have something that's cool, you just have to be persistent.\n\nThere are people in the music business who are paid a lot of money to be able to judge what a hit song is and what it is not - and they are very often wrong. You just have to believe in YOURSELF because, along the way, a lot of people are going to tell you that you don't have any talent. And these might be the same people that end up patting you on the back a couple of years later saying, \"I knew you guys were going to make it!\"\n\nYou never know when you're going to get your lucky break so you have to just get yourself out there and meet people, and play with as many people as you can.\n\nHone your live performance chops by playing out as much as possible, writing original music, and doing demo after demo after demo. The more you do it, the more you're going to see little doors of opportunity open here and there. End of Interview Thanks to Rod Morgenstein for sharing his experiences and insights.

Along with my dad, Mel, her soulmate for 84 years, my mom lived a truly happy, content, and fulfilling life. Making it to the tender young age of 97 is a gift unto itself. Clearly, I got my musical abilities from her, as my dad was a clap-on-beats 1 and 3 kind of guy, but she was, instinctively, a backbeat girl, feeling the groove on where it\u2019s supposed to be experienced - beats 2 and 4! This has been a trying year, having experienced so much loss.

Skoots was the consummate band mate, always seeking perfection in everything he did. He was an extremely kind and generous human being, periodically checking in on me to see how my parents are doing and how life, in general is faring. He also happened to be one of the best storytellers who ever graced our planet. His years of touring the globe with Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, and numerous other acts, created a vast library of colorful stories; truly amazing stories that only a wordsmith like Skoots could impart to an audience lucky enough to be in his presence. My memory is filled with moments like these, where I would be hanging on every word, completely engrossed, often in stitches, for hours on end. RIP Skoots. Your memory will live on in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate to have you in our live 4-26-2020 WINGER - Better Days Comin' - All-Star\n\n4-12-2020 \u2018Hi, this is Mel, how can I help you?\u2019 For years, these were the first words my dad would speak upon answering the phone. I think this phrase pretty much sums up the kind of person he was; always wanting to lend a helping hand in any way he could. My dad passed away yesterday and, almost immediately, the memories of an extraordinary life began flooding my brain. He was a professor by trade, having taught at a handful of colleges and universities in New York, including Columbia University. He would often comment that he never felt like he worked a day in his life, as his love of teaching and being among young, talented, motivated students inspired him to no end. At the age of 10, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show along with my parents and sister, Carol, I knew then and there what I wanted to be when I grew up. From that day on, and continuing to this day, my parents have been my most ardent supporters, having attended nearly every single New York area concert I have played since 1976, be it with Winger, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, Rudess Morgenstein Project, The Jelly Jam, Jazz Is Dead, drum clinics and festivals, you name it. The last show they attended was the Dixie Dregs reunion concert at The Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY on March 15, 2018. After a recent hospital stay, an attendant came into the room with the wheelchair to escort my dad out of the building. I introduced myself to him, and he immediately reminded me that he knew who I was, having helped me a few years ago when I was being treated in the hospital\u2019s ER for kidney stones. He also told me he was a guitarist, a major Dixie Dregs fan, and had seen the Dregs every single time we have played on Long Island since the \u201870\u2019s. I then introduced him to my dad, to which he replied, \u2018What, are you kidding, I know your dad, and I also know your mom. Every Dixie Dregs fan on Long Island knows them. They\u2019re just as famous as the band members, because every Dregs fan who has come to your shows these past 40+ years sees your parents every single time. He then proceeded to tell me exactly where they were sitting at The Paramount Theater concert two years ago! My dad has been an inspiration to me, and many of my friends, for a lifetime. In fact, quite a few of my friends have told me that he has been a role model, playing a major part in how they try to live their lives. I am forever grateful to have had him in my life. The floodgates have opened, and the countless, beautiful memories of this amazingly special man, my dad, are everywhere I look\u2026 1-10-20 Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of Rush. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil\u2019s zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many divergent paths. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when The Steve Morse Band toured with Rush as their opening act on the band\u2019s Power Windows Tour. Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on Rush\u2019s \u201885/\u201986 \u2018Power Windows Tour\u2019 would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for Rush\u2019s sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band\u2019s two-hour concert. After the concert, Neil would usually hang for a short time before excusing himself to go to the band\u2019s tour bus, to work on one of his future literary creations. Sometime during this same time period, when he had some time off from touring, Neil flew to China, where he met up with a handful of bicycling enthusiasts for a 3-week journey through remote parts of the country. With pad and pen in hand (at the time, Neil felt that a camera interfered with the creative process) he would jot down highlights of the day\u2019s experiences, which eventually culminated in one of his first literary works entitled, \u2018Riding The Golden Lion\u2019. In addition to the writing portion of this 39-page journal/book, Neil was involved in every step of the process in putting the book together, including choosing the cover art, font, page color and thickness, etc. I believe it was the first outing in what would become a passion of his, eventually authoring several critically acclaimed books. On the very last day off of The Steve Morse Band\u2019s final leg of the Rush Power Windows Tour Neil, Alex, and Geddy took our band to an exotic restaurant for a memorable band dinner. Sitting cross-legged on pillows on the floor, in our very own private room, sans silverware, we dined on an incredible feast of delicacies using only our fingers. Alex, a wine expert and connoisseur, made sure the nectar of the Gods was flowing. So, there I am sitting next to Neil, chit-chatting while trying to think of something interesting and stimulating to say to this sophisticated, worldly, well-traveled man. Neil beat me to the punch, turning to me and posing the question, \u2018So Rod, have you ever considered the effects of climate on the development of Western Civilization?\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, sums up the ever-inquisitive Neil Peart, always seeking knowledge and new experiences, never happy with the status quo. He is the textbook definition of \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019, seizing every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, sailing, cross-country skiing, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man. RIP Neil. 11/2/19 Hey Everybody, I am part of a very cool project, called The Road Crew, with Billy Sheehan on bass and some very talented musicians from my area. We are performing our first, and at the moment our only, concert on Long Island on December 18. Also on the bill will be Zebra guitarist/vocalist Randy Jackson. The Road Crew came about as a result of the tragic loss of a young child, who was run down in his front yard by someone who was texting while driving. This innocent, precious child, Rocco Cangemi, is the inspiration for his father, Joe Cangemi, putting The Road Crew together.

This 12 week course is available for college credit or non- credit and is an all-encompassing program incorporating hours of video instruction, hundreds of drumming audio examples and transcriptions, and multiple play-a-long tacks covering a vast number of rock drumming styles. As the teacher of this interactive course, I meet with students each week for a class chat, as well as give input on their weekly performance projects. I have had a blast putting this course together, drawing from nearly 40 years as a recording and touring musician. For more info check out the website below. Hope to see you in class! Rod www.berkleemusic.com/school/course? course_item_id=21848140&program=new_online_music_courses\n\n6/4/10 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nSonic Reality has released Epik Drums, a deluxe collection of drumkit and groove instruments created with legendary producer Ken Scott. Ken produced 2 Dixie Dregs records- 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs', and has engineered and produced a who's who list of artists including the Beatles, David Bowie, Supertramp, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. This package is packed with hours of drumming by me, Billy Cobham, Bob Siebenberg, Woody Woodmansey, and Terry Bozzio. Check it out at www.sonicreality.com\n\n\n\nWinger will be touring throughout the summer in support of our new cd, 'Karma', which was released in the fall of 2009.

Ty Tabor (guitarist with King's X) hopes to finish up the recording this fall. Look for its release by year's end or early 2011. We are also looking into the possibility of doing some live shows. Stay posted.\n\n\n\nFinished my 13th year of teaching at Berklee this past May. The talent just keeps getting better and better! There is a 5 minute drum lesson on this month's home page @ www.musicradar.com plus another lesson from last month.\n\n\n\n3 part interview on www.vicfirth.com\n\n\n\nC oming soon!

October '09 release from Sonic Reality--The recreation of drum sounds from classic albums recorded by producer Ken Scott and 5 legendary drummers: Rod Morgenstein (Dixie Dregs), Terry Bozzio (Missing Persons), Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie\u2019s Spiders from Mars), Bill Cobham (Mahavishnu Orchestra) and Bob Siebenberg (Supertramp). 5/22/09 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nWinger is in the studio recording our 5th studio cd for Frontiers Records. It will be released fall '09 with touring to follow. The vibe this time around is in-your-face, good old slammin' rock 'n roll.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of the band's first studio recording. Hopefully, it will be completed and released by the end of the year or early 2010.\n\n\n\nSoon to be released from Sonic Reality is The Ken Scott Collection, a series of drum loops by 5 of the drummers Ken Scott has worked with including myself, Billy Cobham, Terry Bozzio, Woody Woodmansey, and Bob Siegerman. Ken's discography reads like a who's who of the recording industry, having been head engineer on the Beatle's White Album, and engineer/producer of such artists as David Bowie, Supertramp, Dixie Dregs and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Further info on this collection can be found at www.sonicreality.com/kenscottcollection.php\n\n\n\nI recently completed my 12th year at Berklee College of Music. The musical talent just seems to be getting better and better every year!!!\n\n\n\nHave a great summer.......... 7/1/08 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nIt's been a while........\n\n\n\nRecently, I was in California recording with legendary producer Ken Scott as part of a massive drum library project for Sonic Reality. Ken chose 6 drummers he has worked with including Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie), Bob Seibenberg (Supertramp), and Nigel Olson (Elton John). Ken engineered and produced two classic Dixie Dregs records, 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs'. His bio reads like a Who's Who of the record biz--The Beatles, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Missing Persons, David Bowie, Supertramp, Elton John, and Stanley Clarke to name a few. The drum library collection, which focuses on recreating the analog drum sounds from the 70's, will also feature a book on Ken's life and his ground-breaking engineering and recording techniques. The release date is scheduled for early 2009.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead guitarist, Jeff Pevar, is in the studio mixing the new Jazz Is Dead cd, finally! This recording will be, believe it or not, the first studio cd in the band's history. Look for the release in the latter part of this year or early 2009.\n\n\n\nWinger toured the US this past Feb/March, and is looking into touring South America this fall. Concert dates will be posted once they are confirmed. ALthough Winger has toured in nearly 25 countries, this will be the band's first tour in SA.\n\n\n\nRudess Morgenstein Project will play in Poland this October as part of the Percussion Festival in Opole, Poland. In addition to each of us performing a clinic, we will play several concerts. Info will be posted when the dates are officially set.\n\n\n\nI have been recording a cd with a phenomenal pianist by the name of Rob Apostle. Rob's music is an incredible blend of classical, jazz, and fusion music. Deceptively simple, this music will touch both musician and non-musician on a very deep and emotional level. No release date is set yet as it is in its early stages. I'll keep you posted as the project nears completion.\n\n\n\nMid-May completed my 11th year teaching at Berklee College of Music. What began in September 1997, filling in for a teacher who went off on a year's Sabbatical leave, has blossomed into an integral and very rewarding part of my professional music career. Also, midway through the semester I became a full professor. I wish to thank my incredible students for always continuing to inspire me.\n\n\n\nHave a COOL, wonderful summer............ 12/9/07 - update from Rod Japan and Australia were amazing! It's been way too long since WINGER played in Japan. The last time were toured there was for the PULL tour in '93. Sold out shows in Tokyo and Yokohama and awesome crowds in Osaka and Nagoya brought back so many great memories of touring in the good ole days! The trip to Australia was our first and I'm sure we'll be back, as the crowds were really enthusiastic there, too. We had a blast touring with Ratt for the 2 weeks, and got to hang out a bunch with those guys. All I can say is it was a TON OF FUN!!!\n\n\n\nWINGER 'LIVE' was just released on Frontiers Records and is available in both dvd and cd. The concert was filmed at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA in March '07 and the reviews have been fantastic.\n\n\n\nMONSTER BALLADS XMAS was just released on Razor and Tie Records. 15 rock/metal artists each contributed a tune. WINGER did a cool version of John Lennon's Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Other bands include Queensryche, Dokken, Skid Row, Twisted Sister, Danger Danger, and Firehouse.\n\n\n\nWINGER will be touring the US in Feb/Mar '08. Tour dates will be posted shortly. Hope to see ya'll there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, and every other holiday which occurs this time of year. See you on tour next year!!!\n\n10/5/07 - update from Rod Hey All, Look for the new Winger 'Live' dvd/cd coming out in November. It was flimed this past March at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA, and is Winger's first live recording ever! Remember 'Monster Ballads', the cd which featured ballads from all the metal bands from the good ole days? Well, here comes 'Monster Ballads Xmas' this November, featuring Christmas songs by lots of the same bands. Winger covers the John Lennon song, 'Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Also in November, Winger is touring in Japan and Australia with Ratt. It will be our first time back to Japan since the Pull tour in '93. And it will be our very first trip to Australia. My last\n\ntime in the 'land down under' was in '94 for a drum clinic tour which took me to both Australia and New Zealand. What a magnificent part of the world! The Dixie Dregs are in the process of setting up gigs for the new year. As soon as dates are confirmed they will go\n\nup on my 'In Concert' page. Jazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of our first stdio cd. No release date yet, but I'll keep you posted. 9/7/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Berklee fall semester is just around the corner, and so next Monday I'll be off and running to Boston to meet this year's crop of amazing students. This semester begins my 11th year teaching at the college.\n\n\n\nWinger played a handful of gigs this summer, the most memorable being The Rocklahoma fest in Pryor, Oklahoma, a 3 day non-stop 70's/80's trip down memory lane with the likes of Skid Row, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Warrant, Dokken, Vince Neil, Poison, Firehouse, Quiet Riot, Enuff's Enuff, Queensryche and a ton of other bands. It was very cool catching up with musicians I haven't seen in years. We were told in excess of 60,000 tix were sold for the event. We're playing in Las Vegas in October and then touring with Ratt in Japan and Australia in November. Check my 'In Concert' page in the next couple of weeks for details.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead played a one-off at Berklee back in July. It's always a blast walking out on stage and jamming to songs you haven't played in a long time. Being on the edge of your seat as a musician stirs the creative side of things in really interesting ways. Our new cd is being mixed at the moment and should be released later this year.\n\n\n\nI played drums on Jordan Rudess' very cool new cd, 'The Road Home', which will be released September 12 on Magna Carta Records. This one's a 'cover' album, with Jordan paying homage to the bands which influenced him as an aspiring musician. Included are songs by Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Gentle Giant, and Genesis. As is always the case when I work with Jordan, this was a very challenging recording! Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined CalProg in Whittier, CA back in May. When time permits, Jordan and I will try to get back to finishing up the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd which we've been working on for the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nSee ya..................... 4/20/07 - update from Rod Life has been a whirlwind since the new year began. First, the Dixie Dregs toured out west in January. While in southern\n\nCalifornia, I raced to the NAMM show in Anaheim during the day to play with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth. For those performances I played on Roland's V-Drums, an amazing electronic drumset which I have future plans of incorporating them into my acoustic Premier kit. From the NAMM show I had to race to another town to play with the Dregs that evening. Nothing like multiple gigs in one day! On a sad note, the Dixie Dregs tour was cut short when sudden news arrived of Steve Morse's dad falling into a coma. Steve raced back to his home in Florida to be by his dad's side, who sadly passed away later that day. Steve's and my friendship goes back many years. I knew his dad, a brilliant man who will be missed by all whose lives he touched. February 1 was the start of a 5+ week Winger tour in support of the new Winger 4 cd. Crowds were considerably larger than anyone anticipated and we all had an amazing time together. There will be some summer touring, so just check my 'In Concert' page periodically. The Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined Baja Prog '07 in Mexicali, Mexico this past March. 1300 seats were filled to capacity each of 4 nights at this amazing festival. Bands and aficionados of progressive rock music come from all over the world for this event. From there Jordan and I travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to play at the Music Messe for Roland. And then we played a concert in London, also for Roland, and once again on the V Drums. In a few weeks Jordan and I will headline CalProg '07, a prog festival in Whittier, California. Also, around this time, I'll be recording with Jordan for his new solo record which will be out later this year. And we're hoping that, time permitting, we can make more headway on the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. The new Jazz Is Dead cd is at the mixing stages and will be completed in the next couple of months. I have heard the rough mixes and this is by far the coolest JID recording since the band's inception. Three weeks left to the Berklee semester. it's been a crazy semester with all my touring. But I tip my hat to my students, who waited patiently until I got back to town. And I've been spending extra days making up for the days I missed earlier in the semester. I truly have some incredible drummers this year. I'm certain I will see them out there doing it Big Time in the coming years! See ya......... 1/8/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody, Happy New Year. WInger played New Years Eve in Pittsburgh, PA....... OUTDOORS in the pouring rain to a couple thousand diehard fans! We were all soaking wet, and I mean completely drenched. All in all it was a ton of fun. Feb 1 Winger begins a 5 week US tour which will take us all around the country. We'll be mixing it up with stuff from the new cd, Winger 4, and of course, all the tunes from the good ole days. The Dixie Dregs begin touring next week out west which will take us through Colorado, Utah, California, and Arizona. While in southern CA, I'll be racing to the NAMM show to jam with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth.\n\n\n\nAll concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Immediatley following the Dregs tour I will fly directly to Boston to begin the spring '07 semester at Berklee College of Music. I always look forward to meeting a new crop of talented, eager students. 9/19/06 - update from Rod Lots going on since we last 'chatted'. The first new Winger cd in 13 years , Winger IV, is slated for release October 20 in Europe on Frontiers Records, Japan on King Records, with a US release to follow shortly thereafter on Shrapnel Records. The recording is a natural progression from 'Pull', which came out in '93. Kip produced the recording, which sounds HUGE! The band will tour Europe in October in support of the cd. Concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Audio clips can be heard at www.myspace.com/kipwingermusic Also, we're setting up a winger myspace page which should be up soon... The Rudess Morgenstein Project played in Caracas, Venezuela and San Jose, Costa Rica back in May. Jordan and I had a blast doing these shows, as they were our first gigs south of the border. The energy of the fans was unbelievable! In Venezuela, we played with Angra, a fantastic band from Brazil, and we spent a good bit of time hanging with them. In Costa Rica, we were the only band on the bill, and so our show was much longer than anything we've done in the past. We did a fair amount of jamming, which inspired us to take that approach on some of the new RPM cd, which is moving along nicely. We will be playing the Baja Progfest in Mexico in March, and are talking to other south American promoters about doing shows in some other countries. Jordan is also working on his next solo cd. I will cut drum tracks for some of this recording sometime before the end of the year. The Dixie Dregs will be touring the west coast in January. Look for tour dates on the 'In Concert' page in the next few weeks. Jazz Is Dead is in the mixing stages of a new cd. Even though it will be the band's fourth release, it actually will be our very first studio recording. All the other cds were live recordings. The Berklee fall semester began last week. After a year of living the life of nomads without 'homes', due to problems with the basement area of the building we taught in, the percussion faculty are quite comfortable in our brand new, sound proofed, incredible facility. Should be a great semester. 9/16/06 - from Rod It has been quite some time since I have posted updates on my site. For those of you who may not be aware, my wife, Michele, passed away this past December. Michele was a warrior's warrior during a 22 year journey battling breast cancer. The vast majority of people in our life knew little or nothing of her condition. She chose to keep it a quiet affair so she would not have it be front and center in every aspect of her daily life. It allowed her to lead a relatively normal life and not be known as 'Michele with breast cancer'. As painfully difficult as living with cancer can be at times, our life together was nothing short of perfection. We learned to smell the roses years ago. There are no regrets, as we told each other how deeply we loved each other virtually every day of our lives. Michele was my childhood sweetheart, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate. I miss her more than anyone can imagine. Thank you to everyone for your e-mails, letters and phone calls which have offered me some level of comfort during this very difficult time. I wish you all happiness and good health. Rod\n\n5/2/05 - Update from Rod The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was awesome, covering 18 cities in 19 days. Travelling highlights included driving through a surprise spring blizzard with virtually NO visiability in the middle of the night after jamming in Cleveland! Ah, the exciting life of a touring musician. Progress continues on the new Jazz Is Dead cd. Luis Conte has added amazing percussion to several tracks and we're hoping to get a few more folks to play on this one. Winger is still looking into a fall tour to record a live dvd and possible\n\nstudio cd. I'm getting ready to do some recording with Marc Muller who has been playing pedal steel and guitar with Shania Twain for the last 10 years. We're also involved in co-writing songs. The Berklee spring semester comes to a close this week and, as always, I've had a great bunch of students who never cease to amaze me.\n\n1/29/05 - Update from Rod Just got home from the Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band west coast tour. As always, it was a lot of fun jamming with my band mates of many years. Steve Morse band drummer Van Romaine and I worked out a two-man drum solo (guess you call that a drum duo)which was really a blast to perform. Looks like we'll be doing an east coast run in mid-March, from Florida all the way up through Chicago, so check my concert calendar in a couple of weeks for tour dates. Winger is discussing the possibility of a live dvd which would involve a week or two of concerts, possibly in May or June. Stay posted for details. The Berklee College of Music spring semester has begun and, as always, I have a wonderful group of students. 9/25/04 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nWell, believe it or not, after nearly 3 years since we first began work on it, The Jelly Jam 2 was just released. We are really beginning to sound like a band! Now we're looking at all of our schedules to see if we can do some live 'Jelly Jamming' in the next few months. I'll keep you posted. If you can't find Jelly Jam 2 in a cd shop, you can go to InsideOutMusic.com to read all about it and get purchase info. Jordan Rudess' new cd, 'Rhythm of Time', was released recently on Magna Carta Records. Like I had said a while back this recording was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and rewarding recordings of my career. The Dixie Dregs will be gearing up for a west coast tour in January. Tour dates will be available on my concert calendar in the next several weeks. We're already 4 weeks into the 2004 fall semester at Berklee College of Music and, as always, I have a great bunch of students. This time around there seem to be several who are into many of the classic rock and fusion bands and drummers, which is totally fine by me. It's right up my alley. Hope you all have an enjoyable fall season....... 7/23/04 - Update from Rod\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Rudess Morgenstein Project will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center at BerkleeCollege of Music in Boston on Thursday, August 5 at 8:15 PM. We will be playing classic RPM tunes as well as music from Jordan's soon-to-be released solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time'. Ty Tabor has completed mixing The Jelly Jam 2 and it is now in the hands of Inside Out Records. I'll keep you all posted regarding the release date. Kip Winger is putting some finishing touches on the recording I did with him and Turkish producer/guitarist Cenk Eroglu earlier this year, and getting ready to shop it for a deal. The recording with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar was incredible. The jam band concept is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my 30+ years as a musician. We need to record a couple more tracks to have a full length cd, so we'll probably get together in the fall to complete it. I'm in the midst of Berklee's 5 week summer program and having a blast with my roughly 75 students. It's amazing how many talented young musicians there are out there! 4/17/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, Kip is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey to finish recording and mix several tunes on his current project with Cenk Eroglu. Talk about a fresh, new killer sound, this is it!\n\n\n\nI just got back from Illinois for a week of recording with\n\nguitarist/keyboardist Brian Moritz and his band Balance. Dave LaRue (Dixie Dregs) played bass, with Joel Kaplan on keyboards and Vince Claps on vocals. With the exception of Dave and I, all these guys have been very active in the Chicago music scene for many years. The recording was engineered by Brian Mitchell, who lives a double life as a forensic pathologist! All in all, it was quite an experience. I'll update you as the recording progresses.\n\n\n\nI'm on my way to meet up with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar in\n\nHartford, CT to record for several days on both Jeff's solo cd and some jam band oriented stuff.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I return from CT, I'll be getting together with Jordan Rudess to pick up where he and I left off with the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. We're looking into the possibility of playing some gigs later this year.\n\n\n\nThe release of Jordan's solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is August 31 on Magna Carta Records.\n\n\n\nWell, yet another Berklee school year has come to a close. I guarantee that somewhere in the future you will see some of these students realizing their musical dreams!\n\n\n\nHave a HOT summer.................... 3/19/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, I just spent the last several days in Nashville recording with Kip Winger. Over the past year, Kip has been making trips to Istanbul, Turkey where he has been writing and recording with Turkish artist/guitarist/producer Cenk Eroglu. The music is an incredible blend of east-meets-west sounds and rhythms, both traditional and high-tech. Kip and Cenk hope to finish it up in the next several months. I'll keep you posted. We're talking about the possibility of recording Winger Live In Concert along with a bunch of archival/ interview footage. Jordan Rudess' solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is set for release in July on Magna Carta Records. What an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience it always is, working with my friend Jordan. Among the guest artists appearing on the recording are Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Vinnie Moore and Greg Howe. Modern Drummer presents 'Drum Nation' was released in mid-January and includes drum performances by 14 drummers. Jordan Rudess played keys on my track 'Faceless Pastiche'. Other members of the cast include Steve Smith, Simon Phillips, Bill Bruford, Trilok Gurtu and Chad Wackerman, to name but a\n\nfew. I recorded a couple of tracks with Jeff Pevar on a solo recording he's working on. I met Jeff when he joined Jazz Is Dead in 2001. He is one of the most well-rounded, musical guitarists around. I recently went to see him perform with CPR, the band he has with David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young fame.) Jeff is the 'P' in CPR. A highlight of the evening for me was meeting David Crosby and having HIM say all these great things about the Dixie Dregs. I felt like a million bucks! Jelly Jam 2's completion is just around the corner, I promise........ Another snow has fallen, with more expected tonight. It sure has been a\n\nLOOOOOOONG Winter. 11/09/03 - Update from Rod Jordan Rudess is in the studio working on his next solo recording for Magna Carta. We're planning on doing drum tracks before the end of the year. January 13 is the Magna Carta release date for 'Modern Drummer Presents: Drum Nation Volume 1', an all-out drummers' cd featuring quite an interesting cast of players. Each participating drummer contributed one track; Jordan Rudess plays keyboards on my tune 'Faceless Pastiche'. Additional info about the cd can be found at Magna Carta'a website. I know it sounds like a broken record but Ty Tabor is planning on mixing The Jelly Jam's next cd before the end of this year, as soon as he gets off the current King's X tour. It seems like only yesterday that the semester began but the Berklee College of Music fall semester is already entering its 10th week. I have some very fine students this year and am sure to hear about them in years to come! 7/19/03 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nI've been meaning to post something ever since I got back from Europe last month. The clinic tour was an absolute blast! I played in 8 countries in 3 weeks and spent some time in the UK visiting Premier Percussion on a break in the middle of the clinic events. Thanks to everyone who came out, the turn-outs were fantastic, and I met so many wonderful drummers, Premier/Sabian/Vic Firth reps, music store personnel and other musicians. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in making these clinics first class events and I look forward to seeing all of you again somewhere down the road. I'm already full steam ahead in the Berklee College of Music 5 week program and have been teaching 11 different classes in addition to many private lessons. And I can say without hesitation that there are some VERY talented young people out there! I'm sure we'll be seeing quite a few of ya'll enrolled as Berklee College students in the years to come. Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, is putting the finishing touches on Jelly Jam 2, my project with him and John Myung, bassist with Dream Theater. Stay posted for a release date. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Talk to you in the fall. Rod 5/16/03 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody,\n\nI leave in a week for a 3 week European drum clinic tour for Premier and Sabian which will take me to some very cool places including, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Iceland, with a trip to the Premier Percussion complex in Leicester, UK thrown in for good measure. The clinics will feature the new line of Premier drums which were showcased at this year's NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA back in January. The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was a lot of fun, and as we didn't hit all of the usual east coast cities, hopefully we'll be able to put another run together this year. Ty tabor is hard at work on the next Jelly Jam recording. I'll keep you posted on a release date as soon as I hear something. And, as I've said before, we really want to tour for this one. Still waiting on a release date for the Magna Carta drummers cd. I played in a very cool blues concert last weekend at the West Hampton Performing Arts Center with Frank Latorre and The King Bees. Frank, an incredible harmonica player, played the harp on Winger's 'Down incognito' on PULL back in '93. The band also featured Richie Cannata of Billy Joel fame and 3 of Frank's longtime buddies- Doug, Paul and Paul who play guitar, bass and guitar respectively. I hope to do some more playing with these guys in the future. Jordan Rudess and I played during Berklee College's Percussion week back in April and the turn out was overwhelming. Thanks for all your support. Some day, I promise, we'll get the next studio cd released. We have interested parties in Puerto Rico and Finland wanting to bring us over to jam. So we're looking into getting it together. Well, another year at Berklee has come to a close and, as always, I had a wonderful time teaching so many talented drummer/musicians. I'll be teaching the 5 Week Summer program beginning the second week in July, so if you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hey. 2/21/03 - Update from Rod Hey everybody.\n\nThe January west coast Dixie Dregs tour was fantastic. The timing enabled us to spend some time at the NAMM Music trade show in Anaheim. It's always a blast going to the show as you meet up with so many friends and acquaintances who you don't necessarily get to see that often.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in late April for an east coast run. Check my site in the coming weeks for concert info. I recently recorded a song for an upcoming 'drummers' cd which will be coming out on Magna Carta sometime in the spring. 10-15 drummers are each contributing a tune. As I understand it, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio and Steve Smith have already submitted their tracks. Should be quite a recording. Ty Tabor is hoping to put the final touches on the new Jelly Jam cd March/April. So, hopefully, it won't be too long after that before it is released by Inside Out Records. Until we meet again.......... 12/2/02 - Update from Rod The Dixie Dregs will be touring in CA, January 10 through the 19th. Check the concert calendar for specific dates. Thanks to everyone who came out to see Winger on the east coast this past October. As is always the case with these guys, it was a tremendous amount of fun both musically and just hanging with Kip, Paul, Reb, and John. Now we'll just have to see where it all leads... Jordan Rudess and I picked up where we left off last summer on our second RPM studio recording. It's awesome working together again with my power duo partner. We're hoping to get it done in the next few months for a 2003 release and some touring. Ty Tabor will put the finishing touches on the next Jelly Jam recording as soon as he gets home from the King's X/ Ronnie Dio tour later this month. The first Jelly Jam cd created a nice buzz at radio and so we're all looking forward to releasing this next one. John Myung, Ty and I are determined to tour with this band. Another semester at Berklee is fast coming to a close. As usual, I have a great bunch of students who continue to keep me on my toes. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you next year.\n\nRod 8/28/02 - Update from Rod Well, it looks like summer is almost over. Man it was a hot one! The Poison, Cinderella, Winger, Faster Pussycat tour was an incredible amount of fun. Being back with the guys was truly an amazing experience. Jamming with them was a blast and I don't think I've laughed this much in years. These people are so much fun to hang with. And it looks like we'll be hanging again, if but for only a short time. We're doing a string of east coast Winger shows beginning October 1. Check the Concert Calendar for the dates. These will be full length shows covering considerably more songs than we did on the Poison tour. We're looking into the possibility of doing some combination Dixie Dregs/ Jelly Jam shows later this year. I'll keep you posted. Jordan Rudess and I have been in communicado trying to nail down a time period to finish up our next studio recording which was begun last summer. I'll keep you abreast of that one, too. The Berklee College of Music fall semester begins shortly and I'm looking forward to meeting lots of new faces as well as the 'veterans'. See you all soon......\n\n5/2/02 - Update from Rod Hey everybody. Well, as you all know by now, Winger is back together and will be touring with Poison, Cinderella, and Faster Pussycat from mid-May through July. I must admit, the adrenaline is beginning to flow as the starting date approaches. This will be the first time we've played as a band live in nearly 9 years. A few Winger Only headline shows will be happening, too. For all tour dates click here. The Jelly Jam debut cd was released in the latter part of March and Ty and I have been doing a good amount of press and radio in support of it. We're hoping to do some touring with this project as soon as our schedules permit. John Myung is currently on tour with Dream Theater, and Ty is on the road with King's X. So, all three of us have our hands full at the moment. But we're determined to make The Jelly Jam a full-fledged, LIVE jamming band. This week was the last week of classes for the spring 2002 semester at Berklee College of Music. Finals are next week, after which I race back to New York to board a plane to Nashville for a week of Winger rehearsals. I had a fantastic group of students this year who really kept me on my toes. I'm sure I'll be seeing many of them in concert with their own bands in the years to come! Have a great summer and I hope to run in to some of you along the way.........

I don\u2019t think a more positive, \u2018life is beautiful\u2019 human being has ever graced this planet of ours. She truly was 'salt of the earth'. Along with my dad, Mel, her soulmate for 84 years, my mom lived a truly happy, content, and fulfilling life. Making it to the tender young age of 97 is a gift unto itself. Clearly, I got my musical abilities from her, as my dad was a clap-on-beats 1 and 3 kind of guy, but she was, instinctively, a backbeat girl, feeling the groove on where it\u2019s supposed to be experienced - beats 2 and 4! This has been a trying year, having experienced so much loss. But, in the end, folks like my mom have instilled in me the belief that there is always a bright side of life to not only dwell on, but to embrace wholeheartedly. 7-13-2020 Hey Everybody,Rod here. After 45 years of amassing an enormous collection of drum sets, snare drums, cymbals, percussion, Winger clothing (from the good ole days), tour laminates, itineraries, posters and awards, drumheads, drumsticks, assorted hardware, and other mementos, I have decided to part with a tremendous amount of these items. Three of the major items I am parting with are drum sets from\u2013 The Dixie Dregs, \u2018Bring \u2018Em Back Alive\u2019, live recording (from The Center Stage in Atlanta, GA in early \u201992) and tour, including an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in December 1992 The 2002 \u2018Hollyweird Summer Tour\u2019 featuring Poison, Cinderella, Winger and Faster Pussycat, plus a Winger tour that followed in the fall of \u201802 The drum set used on several Dixie Dregs tours from the late \u201890\u2019s through 2007\n\nRod It has been an amazing trip down memory lane sorting through hundreds of possessions, each one triggering a smile, a story, or an unforgettable memory I will cherish forever. If you are interested in checking out some of these items, you can contact my friend and fellow drummer, Ed Tucker, at Studio 3T studio3t@icloud.com Or join Ed\u2019s Facebook group: Vintage Drum Collectors & Players. Type in \u201cRod Mo\u201d in the question to join the group.It\u2019s gonna take awhile before each and every item is listed, so make sure to check in over the coming weeks to see what new things have been added.Thanks for all the great years. It has been, and continues to be, an incredible ride.Rock On!Rod 6-6-2020\n\n\n\nI was shocked and saddened this week to learn that my friend and Dixie Dregs drum tech and monitor ace, Skoots Lyndon, passed away. Skoots was the consummate band mate, always seeking perfection in everything he did. He was an extremely kind and generous human being, periodically checking in on me to see how my parents are doing and how life, in general is faring. He also happened to be one of the best storytellers who ever graced our planet. His years of touring the globe with Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, and numerous other acts, created a vast library of colorful stories; truly amazing stories that only a wordsmith like Skoots could impart to an audience lucky enough to be in his presence. My memory is filled with moments like these, where I would be hanging on every word, completely engrossed, often in stitches, for hours on end. RIP Skoots. Your memory will live on in the hearts of all of us who were so fortunate to have you in our live 4-26-2020 WINGER - Better Days Comin' - All-Star\n\n4-12-2020 \u2018Hi, this is Mel, how can I help you?\u2019 For years, these were the first words my dad would speak upon answering the phone. I think this phrase pretty much sums up the kind of person he was; always wanting to lend a helping hand in any way he could. My dad passed away yesterday and, almost immediately, the memories of an extraordinary life began flooding my brain. He was a professor by trade, having taught at a handful of colleges and universities in New York, including Columbia University. He would often comment that he never felt like he worked a day in his life, as his love of teaching and being among young, talented, motivated students inspired him to no end. At the age of 10, watching The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show along with my parents and sister, Carol, I knew then and there what I wanted to be when I grew up. From that day on, and continuing to this day, my parents have been my most ardent supporters, having attended nearly every single New York area concert I have played since 1976, be it with Winger, Dixie Dregs, Steve Morse Band, Rudess Morgenstein Project, The Jelly Jam, Jazz Is Dead, drum clinics and festivals, you name it. The last show they attended was the Dixie Dregs reunion concert at The Paramount Theater in Huntington, NY on March 15, 2018. After a recent hospital stay, an attendant came into the room with the wheelchair to escort my dad out of the building. I introduced myself to him, and he immediately reminded me that he knew who I was, having helped me a few years ago when I was being treated in the hospital\u2019s ER for kidney stones. He also told me he was a guitarist, a major Dixie Dregs fan, and had seen the Dregs every single time we have played on Long Island since the \u201870\u2019s. I then introduced him to my dad, to which he replied, \u2018What, are you kidding, I know your dad, and I also know your mom. Every Dixie Dregs fan on Long Island knows them. They\u2019re just as famous as the band members, because every Dregs fan who has come to your shows these past 40+ years sees your parents every single time. He then proceeded to tell me exactly where they were sitting at The Paramount Theater concert two years ago! My dad has been an inspiration to me, and many of my friends, for a lifetime. In fact, quite a few of my friends have told me that he has been a role model, playing a major part in how they try to live their lives. I am forever grateful to have had him in my life. The floodgates have opened, and the countless, beautiful memories of this amazingly special man, my dad, are everywhere I look\u2026 1-10-20 Neil Peart was a Renaissance man. Most of us know him as the iconic drummer and lyricist of Rush. But beyond his exceptional talents in the world of music, Neil\u2019s zest for life, thirst for knowledge, and quest for adventure led him down many divergent paths. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Neil in 1985, when The Steve Morse Band toured with Rush as their opening act on the band\u2019s Power Windows Tour. Most touring musicians will attest to the absolute joy and excitement of bringing their music to audiences around the globe. Most of these same musicians will also agree on the physical and emotional toll that endless touring can take on a human being. That said, a typical show day often consists of travel, sound checks, meet and greets, interviews, the performance, followed by more meet and greets. Well, as if this is not enough, a typical show day for Neil Peart on Rush\u2019s \u201885/\u201986 \u2018Power Windows Tour\u2019 would usually begin in the wee hours of morning, as Neil would journey on his bicycle from the previous city (assuming said previous city was within 150 miles of the next gig). Neil would often be on his bike for hours, arriving in time for Rush\u2019s sound check. Directly after sound check, he would have dinner, which was immediately followed by a one-hour conversational French language lesson with a local French-speaking tutor. Upon completing his French lesson, Neil would proceed to a private practice room and warm-up on a small drum kit prior to the band\u2019s two-hour concert. After the concert, Neil would usually hang for a short time before excusing himself to go to the band\u2019s tour bus, to work on one of his future literary creations. Sometime during this same time period, when he had some time off from touring, Neil flew to China, where he met up with a handful of bicycling enthusiasts for a 3-week journey through remote parts of the country. With pad and pen in hand (at the time, Neil felt that a camera interfered with the creative process) he would jot down highlights of the day\u2019s experiences, which eventually culminated in one of his first literary works entitled, \u2018Riding The Golden Lion\u2019. In addition to the writing portion of this 39-page journal/book, Neil was involved in every step of the process in putting the book together, including choosing the cover art, font, page color and thickness, etc. I believe it was the first outing in what would become a passion of his, eventually authoring several critically acclaimed books. On the very last day off of The Steve Morse Band\u2019s final leg of the Rush Power Windows Tour Neil, Alex, and Geddy took our band to an exotic restaurant for a memorable band dinner. Sitting cross-legged on pillows on the floor, in our very own private room, sans silverware, we dined on an incredible feast of delicacies using only our fingers. Alex, a wine expert and connoisseur, made sure the nectar of the Gods was flowing. So, there I am sitting next to Neil, chit-chatting while trying to think of something interesting and stimulating to say to this sophisticated, worldly, well-traveled man. Neil beat me to the punch, turning to me and posing the question, \u2018So Rod, have you ever considered the effects of climate on the development of Western Civilization?\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, sums up the ever-inquisitive Neil Peart, always seeking knowledge and new experiences, never happy with the status quo. He is the textbook definition of \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019, seizing every moment of life to engage in something of importance, be it music, reading, writing, philosophizing, bicycling, motorcycling, sailing, cross-country skiing, trekking through foreign lands, climbing the highest peaks, and devoting himself to family. He is a truly inspiring human being, whose breath of humanity has touched millions around the world. I am forever grateful to have known this unique and special man. RIP Neil. 11/2/19 Hey Everybody, I am part of a very cool project, called The Road Crew, with Billy Sheehan on bass and some very talented musicians from my area. We are performing our first, and at the moment our only, concert on Long Island on December 18. Also on the bill will be Zebra guitarist/vocalist Randy Jackson. The Road Crew came about as a result of the tragic loss of a young child, who was run down in his front yard by someone who was texting while driving. This innocent, precious child, Rocco Cangemi, is the inspiration for his father, Joe Cangemi, putting The Road Crew together. Hope to see you there. 9/10/19\n\nDetroit Drummers Day featuring Rod\n\nSunday 9/15 @ The Token Lounge \u00b7 Westland, Michigan 7/25/17 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The Dixie Dregs' Original Lineup Will Reunite and Tour in 2018 The original lineup of instrumental masters the Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in 2018.

It will be released fall '09 with touring to follow. The vibe this time around is in-your-face, good old slammin' rock 'n roll.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of the band's first studio recording. Hopefully, it will be completed and released by the end of the year or early 2010.\n\n\n\nSoon to be released from Sonic Reality is The Ken Scott Collection, a series of drum loops by 5 of the drummers Ken Scott has worked with including myself, Billy Cobham, Terry Bozzio, Woody Woodmansey, and Bob Siegerman.

Further info on this collection can be found at www.sonicreality.com/kenscottcollection.php\n\n\n\nI recently completed my 12th year at Berklee College of Music.

Ken chose 6 drummers he has worked with including Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Woody Woodmansey (David Bowie), Bob Seibenberg (Supertramp), and Nigel Olson (Elton John). Ken engineered and produced two classic Dixie Dregs records, 'What If' and 'Night of the Living Dregs'. His bio reads like a Who's Who of the record biz--The Beatles, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Missing Persons, David Bowie, Supertramp, Elton John, and Stanley Clarke to name a few. The drum library collection, which focuses on recreating the analog drum sounds from the 70's, will also feature a book on Ken's life and his ground-breaking engineering and recording techniques. The release date is scheduled for early 2009.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead guitarist, Jeff Pevar, is in the studio mixing the new Jazz Is Dead cd, finally! This recording will be, believe it or not, the first studio cd in the band's history. Look for the release in the latter part of this year or early 2009.\n\n\n\nWinger toured the US this past Feb/March, and is looking into touring South America this fall. Concert dates will be posted once they are confirmed. ALthough Winger has toured in nearly 25 countries, this will be the band's first tour in SA.\n\n\n\nRudess Morgenstein Project will play in Poland this October as part of the Percussion Festival in Opole, Poland. In addition to each of us performing a clinic, we will play several concerts. Info will be posted when the dates are officially set.\n\n\n\nI have been recording a cd with a phenomenal pianist by the name of Rob Apostle. Rob's music is an incredible blend of classical, jazz, and fusion music. Deceptively simple, this music will touch both musician and non-musician on a very deep and emotional level. No release date is set yet as it is in its early stages. I'll keep you posted as the project nears completion.\n\n\n\nMid-May completed my 11th year teaching at Berklee College of Music. What began in September 1997, filling in for a teacher who went off on a year's Sabbatical leave, has blossomed into an integral and very rewarding part of my professional music career. Also, midway through the semester I became a full professor. I wish to thank my incredible students for always continuing to inspire me.\n\n\n\nHave a COOL, wonderful summer............ 12/9/07 - update from Rod Japan and Australia were amazing! It's been way too long since WINGER played in Japan. The last time were toured there was for the PULL tour in '93. Sold out shows in Tokyo and Yokohama and awesome crowds in Osaka and Nagoya brought back so many great memories of touring in the good ole days! The trip to Australia was our first and I'm sure we'll be back, as the crowds were really enthusiastic there, too. We had a blast touring with Ratt for the 2 weeks, and got to hang out a bunch with those guys. All I can say is it was a TON OF FUN!!!\n\n\n\nWINGER 'LIVE' was just released on Frontiers Records and is available in both dvd and cd. The concert was filmed at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA in March '07 and the reviews have been fantastic.\n\n\n\nMONSTER BALLADS XMAS was just released on Razor and Tie Records. 15 rock/metal artists each contributed a tune. WINGER did a cool version of John Lennon's Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Other bands include Queensryche, Dokken, Skid Row, Twisted Sister, Danger Danger, and Firehouse.\n\n\n\nWINGER will be touring the US in Feb/Mar '08. Tour dates will be posted shortly. Hope to see ya'll there!\n\n\n\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, and every other holiday which occurs this time of year. See you on tour next year!!!\n\n10/5/07 - update from Rod Hey All, Look for the new Winger 'Live' dvd/cd coming out in November. It was flimed this past March at the Galaxy Theater in Anaheim, CA, and is Winger's first live recording ever! Remember 'Monster Ballads', the cd which featured ballads from all the metal bands from the good ole days? Well, here comes 'Monster Ballads Xmas' this November, featuring Christmas songs by lots of the same bands. Winger covers the John Lennon song, 'Happy Christmas (War Is Over). Also in November, Winger is touring in Japan and Australia with Ratt. It will be our first time back to Japan since the Pull tour in '93. And it will be our very first trip to Australia. My last\n\ntime in the 'land down under' was in '94 for a drum clinic tour which took me to both Australia and New Zealand. What a magnificent part of the world! The Dixie Dregs are in the process of setting up gigs for the new year. As soon as dates are confirmed they will go\n\nup on my 'In Concert' page. Jazz Is Dead is still in the mixing stages of our first stdio cd. No release date yet, but I'll keep you posted. 9/7/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Berklee fall semester is just around the corner, and so next Monday I'll be off and running to Boston to meet this year's crop of amazing students. This semester begins my 11th year teaching at the college.\n\n\n\nWinger played a handful of gigs this summer, the most memorable being The Rocklahoma fest in Pryor, Oklahoma, a 3 day non-stop 70's/80's trip down memory lane with the likes of Skid Row, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Warrant, Dokken, Vince Neil, Poison, Firehouse, Quiet Riot, Enuff's Enuff, Queensryche and a ton of other bands. It was very cool catching up with musicians I haven't seen in years. We were told in excess of 60,000 tix were sold for the event. We're playing in Las Vegas in October and then touring with Ratt in Japan and Australia in November. Check my 'In Concert' page in the next couple of weeks for details.\n\n\n\nJazz Is Dead played a one-off at Berklee back in July. It's always a blast walking out on stage and jamming to songs you haven't played in a long time. Being on the edge of your seat as a musician stirs the creative side of things in really interesting ways. Our new cd is being mixed at the moment and should be released later this year.\n\n\n\nI played drums on Jordan Rudess' very cool new cd, 'The Road Home', which will be released September 12 on Magna Carta Records. This one's a 'cover' album, with Jordan paying homage to the bands which influenced him as an aspiring musician. Included are songs by Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Gentle Giant, and Genesis. As is always the case when I work with Jordan, this was a very challenging recording! Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined CalProg in Whittier, CA back in May. When time permits, Jordan and I will try to get back to finishing up the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd which we've been working on for the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nSee ya..................... 4/20/07 - update from Rod Life has been a whirlwind since the new year began. First, the Dixie Dregs toured out west in January. While in southern\n\nCalifornia, I raced to the NAMM show in Anaheim during the day to play with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth. For those performances I played on Roland's V-Drums, an amazing electronic drumset which I have future plans of incorporating them into my acoustic Premier kit. From the NAMM show I had to race to another town to play with the Dregs that evening. Nothing like multiple gigs in one day! On a sad note, the Dixie Dregs tour was cut short when sudden news arrived of Steve Morse's dad falling into a coma. Steve raced back to his home in Florida to be by his dad's side, who sadly passed away later that day. Steve's and my friendship goes back many years. I knew his dad, a brilliant man who will be missed by all whose lives he touched. February 1 was the start of a 5+ week Winger tour in support of the new Winger 4 cd. Crowds were considerably larger than anyone anticipated and we all had an amazing time together. There will be some summer touring, so just check my 'In Concert' page periodically. The Rudess Morgenstein Project headlined Baja Prog '07 in Mexicali, Mexico this past March. 1300 seats were filled to capacity each of 4 nights at this amazing festival. Bands and aficionados of progressive rock music come from all over the world for this event. From there Jordan and I travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to play at the Music Messe for Roland. And then we played a concert in London, also for Roland, and once again on the V Drums. In a few weeks Jordan and I will headline CalProg '07, a prog festival in Whittier, California. Also, around this time, I'll be recording with Jordan for his new solo record which will be out later this year. And we're hoping that, time permitting, we can make more headway on the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. The new Jazz Is Dead cd is at the mixing stages and will be completed in the next couple of months. I have heard the rough mixes and this is by far the coolest JID recording since the band's inception. Three weeks left to the Berklee semester. it's been a crazy semester with all my touring. But I tip my hat to my students, who waited patiently until I got back to town. And I've been spending extra days making up for the days I missed earlier in the semester. I truly have some incredible drummers this year. I'm certain I will see them out there doing it Big Time in the coming years! See ya......... 1/8/07 - update from Rod Hey Everybody, Happy New Year. WInger played New Years Eve in Pittsburgh, PA....... OUTDOORS in the pouring rain to a couple thousand diehard fans! We were all soaking wet, and I mean completely drenched. All in all it was a ton of fun. Feb 1 Winger begins a 5 week US tour which will take us all around the country. We'll be mixing it up with stuff from the new cd, Winger 4, and of course, all the tunes from the good ole days. The Dixie Dregs begin touring next week out west which will take us through Colorado, Utah, California, and Arizona. While in southern CA, I'll be racing to the NAMM show to jam with Jordan Rudess at the Roland booth.\n\n\n\nAll concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Immediatley following the Dregs tour I will fly directly to Boston to begin the spring '07 semester at Berklee College of Music. I always look forward to meeting a new crop of talented, eager students. 9/19/06 - update from Rod Lots going on since we last 'chatted'. The first new Winger cd in 13 years , Winger IV, is slated for release October 20 in Europe on Frontiers Records, Japan on King Records, with a US release to follow shortly thereafter on Shrapnel Records. The recording is a natural progression from 'Pull', which came out in '93. Kip produced the recording, which sounds HUGE! The band will tour Europe in October in support of the cd. Concert info can be found on my 'In Concert' page. Audio clips can be heard at www.myspace.com/kipwingermusic Also, we're setting up a winger myspace page which should be up soon... The Rudess Morgenstein Project played in Caracas, Venezuela and San Jose, Costa Rica back in May. Jordan and I had a blast doing these shows, as they were our first gigs south of the border. The energy of the fans was unbelievable! In Venezuela, we played with Angra, a fantastic band from Brazil, and we spent a good bit of time hanging with them. In Costa Rica, we were the only band on the bill, and so our show was much longer than anything we've done in the past. We did a fair amount of jamming, which inspired us to take that approach on some of the new RPM cd, which is moving along nicely. We will be playing the Baja Progfest in Mexico in March, and are talking to other south American promoters about doing shows in some other countries. Jordan is also working on his next solo cd. I will cut drum tracks for some of this recording sometime before the end of the year. The Dixie Dregs will be touring the west coast in January. Look for tour dates on the 'In Concert' page in the next few weeks. Jazz Is Dead is in the mixing stages of a new cd. Even though it will be the band's fourth release, it actually will be our very first studio recording. All the other cds were live recordings. The Berklee fall semester began last week. After a year of living the life of nomads without 'homes', due to problems with the basement area of the building we taught in, the percussion faculty are quite comfortable in our brand new, sound proofed, incredible facility. Should be a great semester. 9/16/06 - from Rod It has been quite some time since I have posted updates on my site. For those of you who may not be aware, my wife, Michele, passed away this past December. Michele was a warrior's warrior during a 22 year journey battling breast cancer. The vast majority of people in our life knew little or nothing of her condition. She chose to keep it a quiet affair so she would not have it be front and center in every aspect of her daily life. It allowed her to lead a relatively normal life and not be known as 'Michele with breast cancer'. As painfully difficult as living with cancer can be at times, our life together was nothing short of perfection. We learned to smell the roses years ago. There are no regrets, as we told each other how deeply we loved each other virtually every day of our lives. Michele was my childhood sweetheart, the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate. I miss her more than anyone can imagine. Thank you to everyone for your e-mails, letters and phone calls which have offered me some level of comfort during this very difficult time. I wish you all happiness and good health. Rod\n\n5/2/05 - Update from Rod The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was awesome, covering 18 cities in 19 days. Travelling highlights included driving through a surprise spring blizzard with virtually NO visiability in the middle of the night after jamming in Cleveland! Ah, the exciting life of a touring musician. Progress continues on the new Jazz Is Dead cd. Luis Conte has added amazing percussion to several tracks and we're hoping to get a few more folks to play on this one. Winger is still looking into a fall tour to record a live dvd and possible\n\nstudio cd. I'm getting ready to do some recording with Marc Muller who has been playing pedal steel and guitar with Shania Twain for the last 10 years. We're also involved in co-writing songs. The Berklee spring semester comes to a close this week and, as always, I've had a great bunch of students who never cease to amaze me.\n\n1/29/05 - Update from Rod Just got home from the Dixie Dregs/Steve Morse Band west coast tour. As always, it was a lot of fun jamming with my band mates of many years. Steve Morse band drummer Van Romaine and I worked out a two-man drum solo (guess you call that a drum duo)which was really a blast to perform. Looks like we'll be doing an east coast run in mid-March, from Florida all the way up through Chicago, so check my concert calendar in a couple of weeks for tour dates. Winger is discussing the possibility of a live dvd which would involve a week or two of concerts, possibly in May or June. Stay posted for details. The Berklee College of Music spring semester has begun and, as always, I have a wonderful group of students. 9/25/04 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nWell, believe it or not, after nearly 3 years since we first began work on it, The Jelly Jam 2 was just released. We are really beginning to sound like a band! Now we're looking at all of our schedules to see if we can do some live 'Jelly Jamming' in the next few months. I'll keep you posted. If you can't find Jelly Jam 2 in a cd shop, you can go to InsideOutMusic.com to read all about it and get purchase info. Jordan Rudess' new cd, 'Rhythm of Time', was released recently on Magna Carta Records. Like I had said a while back this recording was, without a doubt, one of the most challenging and rewarding recordings of my career. The Dixie Dregs will be gearing up for a west coast tour in January. Tour dates will be available on my concert calendar in the next several weeks. We're already 4 weeks into the 2004 fall semester at Berklee College of Music and, as always, I have a great bunch of students. This time around there seem to be several who are into many of the classic rock and fusion bands and drummers, which is totally fine by me. It's right up my alley. Hope you all have an enjoyable fall season....... 7/23/04 - Update from Rod\n\n\n\nHi Everybody,\n\n\n\nThe Rudess Morgenstein Project will be performing at the Berklee Performance Center at BerkleeCollege of Music in Boston on Thursday, August 5 at 8:15 PM. We will be playing classic RPM tunes as well as music from Jordan's soon-to-be released solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time'. Ty Tabor has completed mixing The Jelly Jam 2 and it is now in the hands of Inside Out Records. I'll keep you all posted regarding the release date. Kip Winger is putting some finishing touches on the recording I did with him and Turkish producer/guitarist Cenk Eroglu earlier this year, and getting ready to shop it for a deal. The recording with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar was incredible. The jam band concept is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my 30+ years as a musician. We need to record a couple more tracks to have a full length cd, so we'll probably get together in the fall to complete it. I'm in the midst of Berklee's 5 week summer program and having a blast with my roughly 75 students. It's amazing how many talented young musicians there are out there! 4/17/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, Kip is on his way to Istanbul, Turkey to finish recording and mix several tunes on his current project with Cenk Eroglu. Talk about a fresh, new killer sound, this is it!\n\n\n\nI just got back from Illinois for a week of recording with\n\nguitarist/keyboardist Brian Moritz and his band Balance. Dave LaRue (Dixie Dregs) played bass, with Joel Kaplan on keyboards and Vince Claps on vocals. With the exception of Dave and I, all these guys have been very active in the Chicago music scene for many years. The recording was engineered by Brian Mitchell, who lives a double life as a forensic pathologist! All in all, it was quite an experience. I'll update you as the recording progresses.\n\n\n\nI'm on my way to meet up with T Lavitz and Jeff Pevar in\n\nHartford, CT to record for several days on both Jeff's solo cd and some jam band oriented stuff.\n\n\n\nAs soon as I return from CT, I'll be getting together with Jordan Rudess to pick up where he and I left off with the next Rudess Morgenstein Project cd. We're looking into the possibility of playing some gigs later this year.\n\n\n\nThe release of Jordan's solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is August 31 on Magna Carta Records.\n\n\n\nWell, yet another Berklee school year has come to a close. I guarantee that somewhere in the future you will see some of these students realizing their musical dreams!\n\n\n\nHave a HOT summer.................... 3/19/04 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody, I just spent the last several days in Nashville recording with Kip Winger. Over the past year, Kip has been making trips to Istanbul, Turkey where he has been writing and recording with Turkish artist/guitarist/producer Cenk Eroglu. The music is an incredible blend of east-meets-west sounds and rhythms, both traditional and high-tech. Kip and Cenk hope to finish it up in the next several months. I'll keep you posted. We're talking about the possibility of recording Winger Live In Concert along with a bunch of archival/ interview footage. Jordan Rudess' solo cd, 'Rhythm of Time', is set for release in July on Magna Carta Records. What an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience it always is, working with my friend Jordan. Among the guest artists appearing on the recording are Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, Dave LaRue, Vinnie Moore and Greg Howe. Modern Drummer presents 'Drum Nation' was released in mid-January and includes drum performances by 14 drummers. Jordan Rudess played keys on my track 'Faceless Pastiche'. Other members of the cast include Steve Smith, Simon Phillips, Bill Bruford, Trilok Gurtu and Chad Wackerman, to name but a\n\nfew. I recorded a couple of tracks with Jeff Pevar on a solo recording he's working on. I met Jeff when he joined Jazz Is Dead in 2001. He is one of the most well-rounded, musical guitarists around. I recently went to see him perform with CPR, the band he has with David Crosby (of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young fame.) Jeff is the 'P' in CPR. A highlight of the evening for me was meeting David Crosby and having HIM say all these great things about the Dixie Dregs. I felt like a million bucks! Jelly Jam 2's completion is just around the corner, I promise........ Another snow has fallen, with more expected tonight. It sure has been a\n\nLOOOOOOONG Winter. 11/09/03 - Update from Rod Jordan Rudess is in the studio working on his next solo recording for Magna Carta. We're planning on doing drum tracks before the end of the year. January 13 is the Magna Carta release date for 'Modern Drummer Presents: Drum Nation Volume 1', an all-out drummers' cd featuring quite an interesting cast of players. Each participating drummer contributed one track; Jordan Rudess plays keyboards on my tune 'Faceless Pastiche'. Additional info about the cd can be found at Magna Carta'a website. I know it sounds like a broken record but Ty Tabor is planning on mixing The Jelly Jam's next cd before the end of this year, as soon as he gets off the current King's X tour. It seems like only yesterday that the semester began but the Berklee College of Music fall semester is already entering its 10th week. I have some very fine students this year and am sure to hear about them in years to come! 7/19/03 - Update from Rod Hey Everybody,\n\nI've been meaning to post something ever since I got back from Europe last month. The clinic tour was an absolute blast! I played in 8 countries in 3 weeks and spent some time in the UK visiting Premier Percussion on a break in the middle of the clinic events. Thanks to everyone who came out, the turn-outs were fantastic, and I met so many wonderful drummers, Premier/Sabian/Vic Firth reps, music store personnel and other musicians. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in making these clinics first class events and I look forward to seeing all of you again somewhere down the road. I'm already full steam ahead in the Berklee College of Music 5 week program and have been teaching 11 different classes in addition to many private lessons. And I can say without hesitation that there are some VERY talented young people out there! I'm sure we'll be seeing quite a few of ya'll enrolled as Berklee College students in the years to come. Ty Tabor, King's X guitarist, is putting the finishing touches on Jelly Jam 2, my project with him and John Myung, bassist with Dream Theater. Stay posted for a release date. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Talk to you in the fall. Rod 5/16/03 - Update from Rod Hi Everybody,\n\nI leave in a week for a 3 week European drum clinic tour for Premier and Sabian which will take me to some very cool places including, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Switzerland and Iceland, with a trip to the Premier Percussion complex in Leicester, UK thrown in for good measure. The clinics will feature the new line of Premier drums which were showcased at this year's NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA back in January. The east coast Dixie Dregs tour was a lot of fun, and as we didn't hit all of the usual east coast cities, hopefully we'll be able to put another run together this year. Ty tabor is hard at work on the next Jelly Jam recording. I'll keep you posted on a release date as soon as I hear something. And, as I've said before, we really want to tour for this one. Still waiting on a release date for the Magna Carta drummers cd. I played in a very cool blues concert last weekend at the West Hampton Performing Arts Center with Frank Latorre and The King Bees. Frank, an incredible harmonica player, played the harp on Winger's 'Down incognito' on PULL back in '93. The band also featured Richie Cannata of Billy Joel fame and 3 of Frank's longtime buddies- Doug, Paul and Paul who play guitar, bass and guitar respectively. I hope to do some more playing with these guys in the future. Jordan Rudess and I played during Berklee College's Percussion week back in April and the turn out was overwhelming. Thanks for all your support. Some day, I promise, we'll get the next studio cd released. We have interested parties in Puerto Rico and Finland wanting to bring us over to jam. So we're looking into getting it together. Well, another year at Berklee has come to a close and, as always, I had a wonderful time teaching so many talented drummer/musicians. I'll be teaching the 5 Week Summer program beginning the second week in July, so if you're in the neighborhood, stop by to say hey. 2/21/03 - Update from Rod Hey everybody.\n\nThe January west coast Dixie Dregs tour was fantastic. The timing enabled us to spend some time at the NAMM Music trade show in Anaheim. It's always a blast going to the show as you meet up with so many friends and acquaintances who you don't necessarily get to see that often.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Dregs will be hitting the road in late April for an east coast run. Check my site in the coming weeks for concert info. I recently recorded a song for an upcoming 'drummers' cd which will be coming out on Magna Carta sometime in the spring. 10-15 drummers are each contributing a tune. As I understand it, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio and Steve Smith have already submitted their tracks. Should be quite a recording. Ty Tabor is hoping to put the final touches on the new Jelly Jam cd March/April. So, hopefully, it won't be too long after that before it is released by Inside Out Records. Until we meet again.......... 12/2/02 - Update from Rod The Dixie Dregs will be touring in CA, January 10 through the 19th. Check the concert calendar for specific dates. Thanks to everyone who came out to see Winger on the east coast this past October. As is always the case with these guys, it was a tremendous amount of fun both musically and just hanging with Kip, Paul, Reb, and John. Now we'll just have to see where it all leads... Jordan Rudess and I picked up where we left off last summer on our second RPM studio recording. It's awesome working together again with my power duo partner. We're hoping to get it done in the next few months for a 2003 release and some touring. Ty Tabor will put the finishing touches on the next Jelly Jam recording as soon as he gets home from the King's X/ Ronnie Dio tour later this month. The first Jelly Jam cd created a nice buzz at radio and so we're all looking forward to releasing this next one. John Myung, Ty and I are determined to tour with this band. Another semester at Berklee is fast coming to a close. As usual, I have a great bunch of students who continue to keep me on my toes. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you next year.\n\nRod 8/28/02 - Update from Rod Well, it looks like summer is almost over. Man it was a hot one! The Poison, Cinderella, Winger, Faster Pussycat tour was an incredible amount of fun. Being back with the guys was truly an amazing experience. Jamming with them was a blast and I don't think I've laughed this much in years. These people are so much fun to hang with. And it looks like we'll be hanging again, if but for only a short time. We're doing a string of east coast Winger shows beginning October 1. Check the Concert Calendar for the dates. These will be full length shows covering considerably more songs than we did on the Poison tour. We're looking into the possibility of doing some combination Dixie Dregs/ Jelly Jam shows later this year. I'll keep you posted. Jordan Rudess and I have been in communicado trying to nail down a time period to finish up our next studio recording which was begun last summer. I'll keep you abreast of that one, too. The Berklee College of Music fall semester begins shortly and I'm looking forward to meeting lots of new faces as well as the 'veterans'. See you all soon......\n\n5/2/02 - Update from Rod Hey everybody. Well, as you all know by now, Winger is back together and will be touring with Poison, Cinderella, and Faster Pussycat from mid-May through July. I must admit, the adrenaline is beginning to flow as the starting date approaches. This will be the first time we've played as a band live in nearly 9 years. A few Winger Only headline shows will be happening, too. For all tour dates click here. The Jelly Jam debut cd was released in the latter part of March and Ty and I have been doing a good amount of press and radio in support of it. We're hoping to do some touring with this project as soon as our schedules permit. John Myung is currently on tour with Dream Theater, and Ty is on the road with King's X. So, all three of us have our hands full at the moment. But we're determined to make The Jelly Jam a full-fledged, LIVE jamming band. This week was the last week of classes for the spring 2002 semester at Berklee College of Music. Finals are next week, after which I race back to New York to board a plane to Nashville for a week of Winger rehearsals. I had a fantastic group of students this year who really kept me on my toes. I'm sure I'll be seeing many of them in concert with their own bands in the years to come! Have a great summer and I hope to run in to some of you along the way.........
