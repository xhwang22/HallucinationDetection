It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t exist, more that they split popular opinion. Just ask Jose Mourinho or Jurgen Klopp.\n\nBut regardless of your opinions on either of them, at least they\u2019re interesting. Plenty aren\u2019t.\n\nWith mistrust of reporters on the rise, media training compulsory, and clubs increasingly keen to restrict access to their managers and stars, interviews and press conferences are often a place of repetition, banality and clich\u00e9s.\n\nManagers turn up and give their thoughts because they have to, not because they want to. They utter their well-practised stock phases, bat away any unwanted lines of enquiry and get out as soon as possible.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always like this. And one man typifies a different, better way of interacting. Gordon Strachan.\n\nHis reaction to Harry Kane\u2019s equaliser for England against his Scotland side in 2017 and post-match quip that \u201cthis might be a good night to start drinking\u201d provided just a small glimpse of a man that was once the most entertaining, sarcastic, witty, self-aware and often obtuse voice in the sport.\n\nStrachan, back in his days of managing Coventry and Southampton in the late 1990s and early 2000s, represents what we no longer have.\n\n\u201cI do the job the way I like to do it, enjoying myself,\u201d he said in a 2001 interview. \u201cI don\u2019t want to change my personality just to be a manager.\u201d\n\nThat ethos was evident right from the off when he finally swapped the short shorts and shin pads for a suit, aged 39.\n\nStrachan\u2019s best of is a thing to behold, full of caustic, quick-witted, awkward and simply amusing responses, all delivered in his pleasing Scottish lilt.\n\nWhile you wouldn\u2019t want to be the reporter tasked with interviewing him, for fans his take on media duties was a refreshing change. Like his contemporary and fellow dry-wit enthusiast Mick McCarthy, he never took himself too seriously.\n\nStrachan\u2019s memorable moments contain a mixture of dry humour, awkward interviews and plenty of snappy punchlines, but he is also keen to highlight the bigger picture. Football is not everything \u2013 after all he\u2019s got a yoghurt to finish today before its expiry date.\n\nHe offered his thoughts on subjects as wide-ranging as politics, the pope and the meaning of life over his early years as a manager.\n\nSometimes, somehow, these came prompted \u2013 but frequently they came courtesy of a strange, off-kilter tangent.\n\nAsk a silly question\u2026\n\nA sense of humour is a rare and very welcome attribute in football, and for Strachan it came naturally to the fore as a manager.\n\nMany bosses are bigger stories than their team, but Strachan\u2019s resistance of dull press conferences and interviews were typically understated, not driven by ego.\n\nHis mantra was simple: If you\u2019re going to ask me stupid questions, I\u2019m going to give you stupid answers.\n\nHis resistance of hyperbole was also particularly noble, and is more relevant now than ever. Journalists can be guilty of overemphasising the importance of football, of placing significance onto minor things and of focusing their attention onto matters managers find trivial.\n\nBack in his heyday of 2002, it\u2019s hard to imagine a tabloid hack summoning up the courage to press a feisty Strachan on a topic he didn\u2019t want raised. They could be met by any response from the sliding scale of Strachan\u2019s repertoire, which ranges from self-effacing asides through classic one-liners and ends with the sharp rebuff.\n\nWhile he sometimes crossed the narrow line between funny and rude, it was worth it; his spiky manner not only entertained the masses, sat at home watching Match of the Day, they also helped cut through the inherent triteness of the situation.\n\nStrachan developed a reputation. Although obviously not recorded on YouTube for posterity, reporters wised up, eager not to be the next object of fun.\n\nBox office\n\nHow many people record the highlights in order to fast-forward managers\u2019 post-match interviews, or simply switch off when they speak? The likes of Tony Pulis, David Moyes or Craig Shakespeare hardly demand our attention.\n\nBy contrast, Strachan was box office. Having been groomed for the managers\u2019 job while still playing at Coventry under Ron Atkinson, he had a unique learning experience and applied his exuberance from the playing field straight into his new line of work.\n\nLike many modern-day bosses he was a figure of perpetual motion on the touch-line, shouting and cajoling his players. With his blood still pumping in the tunnel and press conference afterwards, his humour came from a blunt honesty rarely seen these days.\n\nStrachan played for Aberdeen, Manchester United and Leeds United in a stellar career. The majority of his managerial success came at Celtic between 2005 and 2009.\n\nBut an important part of his legacy came in his formative years as a manager, when his personality entertained and cut through the banality of media duties. Managers of his ilk are few and far between.\n\nBy Felix Keith\n\nREAD NEXT: Where are they now?

The following year, he lost vision in his right eye when a pen in his pocket accidentally poked his eye during a football match on the school playground.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAt the age of 18, he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly match with Arsenal. His outstanding performance won him the seat of a regular player for the 1975-1976 season, which also happened to be the inaugural season for the Scottish Premier Division.\n\nHe became the team captain for the 1976-1977 First Division campaign, but he lost his position soon, after a drinking incident with Jimmy Johnstone.\n\nHe quit Dundee and signed a contract with Aberdeen in 1977. Poor form and injuries crippled the 1977-78 season for him. However, he was selected for the 1979 League Cup where the team recorded two wins at the Celtic Park. His brilliant performance on the field earned him the SFWA Footballer of the Year.\n\nIn 1980, he was awarded his first cap in the British Home Championship, against Northern Island. Two years later, he was instrumental in getting his home team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 1982.\n\nThe 1982-1983 seasons were the most successful runs for the club and he made his mark by striking four goals in a 5-1 victory with Dundee in the League Cup. His team then went on to win the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. They also defeated Hamburg in the 1983 European Super Cup Final.\n\nIn the 1984-1985 season, he took four goals in a total of seven games and even though he did not participate in the 1985 FA Cup Final at Wembley, the team went on to win the opening ten league games in the 1985-1986 season.\n\nAfter accepting a contract by Ron Atkinson, he led the Leeds United Club to the Second Division title in the 1989-1990 season. They finished fourth overall, but managed to secure a place in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract with Leeds and captained them to record a victory in the league title of 1991-1992. However, due to poor health and back problems, he started missing a number of games and thus, became unable to build on the success of Leeds Untied.\n\nOn April 10, 1993, despite his downfalls and tough seasons, he scored a hat-trick against the Blackburn Rovers and then moved to Coventry City to serve as an assistant to the manager, Ron Atkinson.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe coached the team and trained them and also appeared in the seasons 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. The club struggled at the start of the 1996-1997 season, which resulted in Atkinson being asked to step down from the managerial position.\n\nAfter Strachan was appointed as manager, he helped his team reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1997-1998.\n\nIn 2001, he was appointed as the manager of Premier League Southampton, succeeding Stuart Gray. Under his leadership, the Southampton team earned their place for the UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, he returned to manage the team, Celtic, on June 1, 2005. Although he had a very shaky start as a manager, the team eventually began to do well under his management and started winning tournaments.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, he was signed on as the manager for Middlesbrough.

Despite the fact that the Saints take a narrow lead into the second-leg of the League Cup semi-final and competed in the group-stages of the Europa League, the fact that they look set to finish well adrift of the European spots in the top flight this term has led some to question current boss Claude Puel.\n\nBut how does the current squad compare with the side that Gordon Strachan guided to eighth place in the Premier League and the FA Cup final during the 2002-03 campaign? Here is HITC Sport\u2019s combined XI\u2026\n\nGK: Contenders \u2013 Antti Niemi, Fraser Forster\n\nAntti Niemi was an excellent shot stopper while Fraser Forster has perhaps not been at his best this season. However, at their respective bests, it is arguably the Englishman who is the better stopper.\n\nGK Verdict: Fraser Forster\n\nSouthampton\u2019s Fraser Forster\n\nRB: Contenders \u2013 Paul Telfer, Jason Dodd, Cedric\n\nJason Dodd was coming towards the end of his career when the 2002-03 season rolled around, so it was often Paul Telfer who Gordon Strachan turned to. The Scotsman was solid but unspectacular at St Mary\u2019s, so once again, the nod goes to Cedric, who is enjoying a good campaign.\n\nRB Verdict: Cedric\n\nLB: Contenders \u2013 Wayne Bridge, Ryan Bertrand\n\nRyan Bertrand has a Champions League medal, and has undoubtedly been an excellent signing for the south coast club. However, Wayne Bridge was really breaking onto the international scene by the 2002-03 season and was clearly beginning to put himself on Chelsea\u2019s radar. It is one of the most difficult calls, but Bridge edges the battle.\n\nLB Verdict: Wayne Bridge\n\nCB: Contenders \u2013 Claus Lundekvam, Michael Svensson, Virgil van Dijk, Jose Fonte\n\nIf this line-up was compiled last season, it would be difficult to find a reason to not pick the current pairing of Virgil van Dijk and Jose Fonte. However, the latter has arguably not been at his best this term, leaving the path clear for Michael Svensson to partner the Dutchman. Lundekvam is unlucky to miss out, but Svensson was excellent under Strachan.\n\nCB Verdict: Michael Svensson and Virgil van Dijk\n\nMichael Svensson\n\nCM: Contenders \u2013 Matt Oakley, Rory Delap, Chris Marsden, Anders Svensson, Oriol Romeu, Steven Davis, Jordy Clasie\n\nThe first thing to say is that based on Oriol Romeu\u2019s current form, he is undoubtedly deserving of a place in the line-up. Meanwhile, Steven Davis also stands out for his consistent displays this term and versatility. Of the old guard, it was arguably Anders Svensson who created the most excitement, so he edges out some of the stalwarts who were so influential in guiding the Saints to Cardiff.\n\nCM Verdict: Anders Svensson, Oriol Romeu and Steven Davis\n\nRW: Contenders \u2013 Brett Ormerod, Dusan Tadic\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a close battle. Strachan often used a 4-4-2 system with Ormerod playing up front while Tadic is much more comfortable playing on the wing. For that reason, the Serbian makes it into the team over the hardworking forward.\n\nRW Verdict: Dusan Tadic\n\nLW: Contenders \u2013 Fabrice Fernandes, Sofiane Boufal\n\nSofiane Boufal has struggled since joining the Saints in a club-record deal, and has only shown glimpses of his true quality. Fabrice Fernandes was arguably a very similar type of player, capable of brilliance, but also more than capable of going missing for large spells. It is difficult to call, but Boufal\u2019s potential suggests that he could become a much better player than the Frenchman.\n\nLW Verdict: Sofiane Boufal\n\nSouthampton\u2019s Sofiane Boufal\n\nST: Contenders \u2013 James Beattie, Charlie Austin, Jay Rodriguez\n\nAlthough Charlie Austin impressed before he picked up his injury, this is arguably almost as easy a decision as the right-wing call. James Beattie was sensational during the 2002-03 season, scoring 23 in 38 league games so would lead the line. Austin, and perhaps Jay Rodriguez, would certainly be on the bench for this combined team.\n\nST Verdict: James Beattie\n\nHere is what the team would look like\u2026"}, {"url": "https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/national-associations/news/0199-0f8e9be98693-78d4f9e79039-1000--strachan-to-leave-southampton/", "page_content": "Southampton FC announced today that Gordon Strachan will leave the club when his managerial contract runs out in the summer.\n\nClub statement\n\nA club statement indicated that the 46-year-old former Scottish international, who has made a marked improvement to Southampton's fortunes since joining in October 2001, has decided to take a break from Premiership football.\n\n'Needs a break'\n\n\"A new contract has been under discussion for some time now but Gordon has decided that, for medical and other personal reasons, he needs a break from the demands and pressures that are associated with being a football manager,\" said the statement.\n\nFA Cup final\n\nA former Aberdeen FC, Manchester United FC and Leeds United AFC player, Strachan previously managed Coventry City FC.

He had an ability to thread his way through defences and was a master of the long sweeping pass. He had an illustrious career in Scotland as one of the key players in Aberdeen's success under Alex Ferguson in the 1980's winning Scottish Premier League titles in 1980 and 1984, Scottish Cup medals in 1982, 1983 and 1984 and a European Cup Winners Cup medal in 1983 when the Dons beat Real Madrid.\n\nRon Atkinson brought Gordon to Old Trafford in 1984 where he won an FA Cup Winners medal and played again under Ferguson before moving to Leeds United. He captained Leeds to the Division Two title in 1990 and two years later, at the age of 35, led them to the Division One Championship in its last year before the inception of the Premier League. Gordon also turned out for Dundee and Coventry.\n\nHe was voted Scottish Footballer of the Year in 1980 and in 1992 he won the English Footballer of the Year award becoming the only man to win the award on both sides of the border. He won his first Scottish cap in 1980 against Northern Ireland, was a member of the World Cup squads in both 1982 and 1986, and won his 50th and final cap against Finland in 1992.\n\nGordon became full time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as Director of Football. After five years in the job he moved on in 2001, when Coventry were relegated. He immediately returned to the Premier League with Southampton and guided that club to the 2003 FA Cup Final \u2013 losing 1\u20130 to Arsenal. Gordon then resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16 month break from management before returning to Scotland to become manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League.

Strachan was the manager of the Scotland national team. Strachan played for Dundee , Aberdeen , Manchester United , Leeds United and Coventry City , as well as the Scotland national team.\n\nHe has managed Coventry City , Southampton , Celtic and Middlesbrough . In club football, he played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football, Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and playing in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. Whilst at Aberdeen, Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982\u201383 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup . Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup Final in five seasons with Manchester United , before spending the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989\u201390 Second Division and 1991\u201392 First Division league titles.\n\nHe played his last game for Scotland in 1992 while still at Leeds, and then moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach. Strachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as Director of Football . After five years in the job, he was sacked in 2001, when Coventry were relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. However, he immediately returned to the Premier League with Southampton and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup Final \u2013 where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal.\n\nStrachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management before returning to Scotland to become manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League . With Celtic he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins, before resigning in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title.

Southampton failed to produce a fairy-tale finish to their season, but they have Europe to look forward to next season.\n\nDavid Seaman will be 40 on hisnext birthday, but his reactions are still something to behold. The goalkeeper did not have much to do in what may prove to be his last appearance for Arsenal and probably had more trouble keeping his eyes open than keeping watch for Southampton's sporadic attacks, yet when the moment came he was ready for it.\n\nEight minutes from the end, Brett Ormerod broke through to the byline and produced a fierce shot on the turn that was on target until Seaman flung up his arms and deflected it away. It was not difficult to identify the game's moment of high drama because it was the only one, at least until Ashley Cole cleared a header by James Beattie off his own line from a last-minute corner. This was not one of the great Cup finals. There was more than a suspicion that the instant applause Seaman's reaction save generated was due to relief that he had prevented the game going into extra time.\n\nArsenal won without being wonderful, Southampton could not produce any kind of fairy-tale. They put out such a defensive line-up, it was tempting to conclude that they had accepted the inevitable.\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger fielded his strongest available team after Patrick Vieira and Sol Campbell had fallen victim to injury and suspension respectively, keeping faith with a half-fit Martin Keown at the back and preferring Dennis Bergkamp to Sylvain Wiltord up front. It was Gordon Strachan who sprang the big selection surprise, keeping Fabrice Fernandes on the bench and giving only the second start of his career to Chris Baird, a 21-year-old youth international from Northern Ireland.\n\nSouthampton went into a huddle just before kick-off as their vociferous supporters enjoyed out-shouting an Arsenal end perhaps jaded by three consecutive Cup finals. Once the game started, it became clear that it might be a good idea for Southampton to stay in a huddle and form it around Thierry Henry.\n\nThe footballer of the year could have had a goal in the opening minute, evading a shirt-tug from Claus Lundekvam and bringing a one-handed save from Antti Niemi at the near post. Had Henry gone down, Southampton would surely have conceded a penalty, but Graham Barber played advantage, while Henry probably felt he would get a few more opportunities against a defence he last saw leaking six goals.\n\nHe was not wrong. As Southampton continued to stand off Henry, the striker forced another save from Niemi, in the seventh minute, and when the goalkeeper failed to hold the ball, Baird had to make a goalline clearance after Bergkamp followed up with a shot from a narrow angle. Henry broke free again three minutes later, rounding Lun dekvam with almost insolent ease, but he failed to extend Niemi with an inexplicably half-hearted shot.\n\nLittle had been seen of Southampton's attack, a header by Michael Svensson comfortably saved by Seaman being no more than a token effort, although by the mid-point of the first half, the game had become much less one-sided. Southampton gradually steadied and began to play more in Arsenal's half and Baird came close to making a name for himself in the 19th minute, when he popped up in attack on the left and brought a sprawling save from Seaman with a shot from 20 yards.\n\nTwo minutes later, Southampton had the ball in the net, Beattie producing a finish as crisp as the pass from Ormerod that put him through, but the linesman's flag was raised as soon as the former Blackpool striker released the ball.\n\nA sure sign that the game was now a close contest was the amount of niggle that crept in before half-time. Paul Telfer was spoken to for a tackle that left Gilberto on the floor and the yellow card came out for the first time when Keown blundered into Ormerod on the left wing with studs showing. Beattie became the second player booked moments later for deliberately clipping Oleg Luzhny's ankles, but before the game could get any sillier, Arsenal took the lead.\n\nTheir precise passing did the trick, with Ray Parlour, Henry and Bergkamp bemusing the Southampton defence to present Fredrik Ljungberg with a shooting opportunity. Ljungberg's effort was blocked, only for the ball to run kindly to Robert Pires, another loosely marked Arsenal player in the Southampton penalty area, who had all the time he needed to place a low shot into Niemi's bottom corner.\n\nPoor old Lundekvam was exposed on a couple more occasions before the sanctuary of the interval arrived. Henry's cross from the right almost produced an instant second goal for Pires; although put off by a subtle push in the back from Telfer, he could manage only a shot over the bar. Then, when Bergkamp found space on the right, his cross-cum-shot eluded Ljungberg by inches and fell to Lundekvam instead. For an agonising moment, it appeared as if the Norwegian was contemplating an own goal, but Arsenal looked just as surprised and generously allowed him the considerable space he needed to control, turn and clear.\n\nHalf-time was as good as it got for Lundekvam, who hobbled off the pitch five minutes into the second half after hurting himself in yet another last-ditch tackle on Bergkamp. Gamely he hobbled back on for more punishment, but during the couple of minutes he spent receiving treatment on the touchline, Arsenal nearly increased their lead. Revelling in even more space, Bergkamp forced a save from Niemi, but Ljungberg hit the side netting from the rebound. Lundekvam rejoined the action just in time to catch the now familiar sight of Henry disappearing into the distance, the striker bringing another fine save from Niemi after a run from halfway.\n\nThe Southampton goalkeeper had done more than most to keep the score down, but he made a dramatic exit in the 65th minute after collapsing, following a clearance, with a recurrence of a knee injury. The Saints had an ideal replacement in Paul Jones, the Wales player, but Niemi's timing was unfortunate in every sense. Not only did his Cup-final dream end abruptly, his chances of joining a big club such as Manchester United may be put on hold.\n\nArsenal could have done with another goal to breathe more easily, although Southampton's attacking efforts were so predictable that there was never much doubt about the outcome. Playing against a well-organised defence in which Luzhny proved himself capable of handling Beattie and everything else thrown at him, Southampton were crying out for a flair player willing to take on opponents and try to go past them. Fernandes is just such a player, yet for reasons best known to Strachan he remained on the bench until the 87th minute. The French winger is another Southampton player who is being linked with a move to a bigger club in summer and if he proves a success at Liverpool or somewhere else, Strachan may have some explaining to do.\n\nThe match ended with blatant timewasting by Arsenal and one last, frantic effort by Southampton when even Jones came up for the last corner. So Southampton, rather than Arsenal, finish the season empty handed. They are used to it, but they still have Europe."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/gordon-david-strachan-1535.php", "page_content": "Before he professionally started playing football, he was offered a contract by Eddie Turnbull to play for a club, but his father opposed the decision by stating that the club did not cover sufficient expenses.\n\nGeorge David Strachan was born to Jim and Catherine in Muirhouse, Edinburgh.

Poor form and injuries crippled the 1977-78 season for him. However, he was selected for the 1979 League Cup where the team recorded two wins at the Celtic Park. His brilliant performance on the field earned him the SFWA Footballer of the Year.\n\nIn 1980, he was awarded his first cap in the British Home Championship, against Northern Island. Two years later, he was instrumental in getting his home team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 1982.\n\nThe 1982-1983 seasons were the most successful runs for the club and he made his mark by striking four goals in a 5-1 victory with Dundee in the League Cup. His team then went on to win the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. They also defeated Hamburg in the 1983 European Super Cup Final.\n\nIn the 1984-1985 season, he took four goals in a total of seven games and even though he did not participate in the 1985 FA Cup Final at Wembley, the team went on to win the opening ten league games in the 1985-1986 season.\n\nAfter accepting a contract by Ron Atkinson, he led the Leeds United Club to the Second Division title in the 1989-1990 season. They finished fourth overall, but managed to secure a place in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract with Leeds and captained them to record a victory in the league title of 1991-1992. However, due to poor health and back problems, he started missing a number of games and thus, became unable to build on the success of Leeds Untied.\n\nOn April 10, 1993, despite his downfalls and tough seasons, he scored a hat-trick against the Blackburn Rovers and then moved to Coventry City to serve as an assistant to the manager, Ron Atkinson.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe coached the team and trained them and also appeared in the seasons 1994-1995 and 1995-1996.

Arsenal had 23 shots, six on target, but Jan Bednarek\u2019s calm finish on the brink of the interval was the only effort that rippled the net.\n\nThe agonising part for Arsenal is that they failed to take advantage of Tottenham\u2019s slip-up at home to Brighton and instead drop to sixth, after Manchester United overcame Norwich late on. Asked how big an opportunity was missed, Arteta replied: \u201cHuge. Because as somebody who doesn\u2019t know the result and is watching the game, you know what they would tell you: that Arsenal won the game. And we didn\u2019t. But it is very disappointing and it\u2019s difficult to explain with words.\n\n\u201cThis is sport. It is what makes it different to any other. In basketball, you have 25 shots and the opponent has one, you win 10 out of 10 times. They are really down because they cannot find the right answer, apart from what we can do better around the box, to win the match.\u201d\n\nMikel Arteta shows his frustration when giving C\u00e9dric Soares instruction. Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock\n\nArteta, all in black, was dressed appropriately for the funereal mood in the away dressing room at full-time. Eddie Nketiah, who led the line in the absence of the ill Alexandre Lacazette, collapsed to the floor as the final whistle sounded. Arsenal struggled to penetrate Southampton, whose manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, decided to switch to a five-man defence after conceding 19 goals in their previous six matches. Yan Valery and Lyanco both wobbled but Southampton, shielded impeccably by Forster, defended stoutly as Martin \u00d8degaard rattled the side netting and Granit Xhaka took aim late on.\n\n\u201cWe knew that it was time to show a reaction and that we can play a little bit different,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cWe wanted to minimise the mistakes we made in the last weeks. We had to change things. Because of the history of the last games it was needed.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBednarek\u2019s goal was ugly from an Arsenal perspective. When Ramsdale punched a James Ward-Prowse corner clear, Southampton appeared rather harmless opponents. But Romain Perraud managed to recycle possession, hooking a ball over his head more in hope than anything and Mohamed Elyounoussi darted towards the byline, where he cut the ball back for Bednarek to side-foot in beyond the goalkeeper. Gabriel summed up Arsenal\u2019s frustrations, walloping the ball against the bar as Southampton ran off to celebrate.\n\nBefore the visiting supporters had the chance to digest the arrival of Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 with 20 minutes to play, this game had morphed into an exercise of attack versus defence but Arsenal could not forage a route through.\n\n\u201cThe players that we have, they haven\u2019t done it in this league,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cWhen you have world-class players who have done it in the league for 10 years, probably you are not sitting here with that. The result is what at the end we need to be where we have to be. If we are not able to do that, then we are not going to be there. It is as simple as that.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048522", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nJan Bednarek's fourth goal of the season earned Southampton their first victory since February\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta admitted his side's form was \"a real worry\" after Southampton won at St Mary's to inflict a third successive defeat on the top-four chasing Gunners.\n\nJan Bednarek scored the game's only goal late in the first half after the visitors had failed to adequately deal with a Saints corner.\n\nBukayo Saka was denied from point-blank range by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster with the score still goalless, but further clear-cut openings proved hard to come by for Arsenal until the closing stages of the second half.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe forced another fine save out of Forster after latching on to Yan Valery's attempted clearance, before Martin Odegaard dragged a left-footed shot wide of the near post after cutting in from the right.\n\nForster produced yet another impressive stop to deny Granit Xhaka late on as Arsenal desperately piled forward in search of an equaliser.\n\n\"We've lost games in different ways - to lose the way we did today is difficult to explain,\" Arteta told BBC Match of the Day. \"If you saw the game, you'd say Arsenal had won comfortably.\n\n\"You have to put the ball in the net. You have to make the decisive moments count to win football matches and at the moment we're not doing that.\"\n\nThe Gunners remain three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham - who were beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - although they do still have a game in hand on their north London rivals.\n\nSouthampton, meanwhile, climb to 12th after claiming their first league win since February.\n\nMagnificent Forster keeps Gunners at bay\n\nSouthampton 1-0 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta disappointed with 'painful' Saints defeat\n\nFollowing lacklustre displays at Crystal Palace and at home to Brighton last weekend, Gunners fans may have hoped this trip to St Mary's would prove to be an ideal fixture to reignite their top-four push.\n\nSaints had lost five of their past six games in all competitions before Saturday and conceded 19 goals in the process - including a 6-0 capitulation at home to Chelsea in their last match. They had also won only one of their past 12 meetings with Arsenal in the Premier League.\n\nThe hosts had Forster to thank for keeping the score goalless in the early stages of the first half, the veteran goalkeeper getting down low to palm Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot past the post before brilliantly tipping Saka's close-range effort over the bar following an error from Valery.\n\nAlthough the Gunners continued to dominate possession as the half wore on, they lacked the tempo to create further openings against a resolute and defensively organised Southampton, who punished Arsenal when Bednarek fired home his fourth goal of the season with a minute of the first half remaining.\n\nWhen Arsenal did manage to penetrate the Saints rearguard late in the second half, they found Forster in inspired form. The 34-year-old did magnificently to parry Smith Rowe's goal-bound effort wide before getting in the way of a low Saka shot.\n\nForster also managed to get his fingertips to Xhaka's curling strike with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes - although the Switzerland international's effort may have been heading narrowly wide.\n\nSouthampton 1-0 Arsenal: Ralph Hasenhuttl pleased with 'important' three points for Saints\n\n\"It wasn't so sure he could play today,\" Saints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Forster's display. \"He had a problem with his ankle, but we needed a goalkeeper like him in such a game today.\n\n\"The most important thing is the clean sheet after six or seven games [without one]. We've played much better games, especially with the ball, but today the target was a different one.\"\n\nArsenal still have a game in hand on Spurs in fourth but with matches against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham coming up in the next fortnight, this will go down as a missed opportunity for Arteta and his players.\n\nPlayer of the match Forster Fraser Forster with an average of 7.48 Southampton Southampton Southampton\n\nArsenal Arsenal Arsenal Southampton Avg Squad number 44 Player name Forster Average rating 7.48 Squad number 21 Player name Livramento Average rating 7.38 Squad number 8 Player name Ward-Prowse Average rating 7.24 Squad number 7 Player name Long Average rating 7.20 Squad number 17 Player name S Armstrong Average rating 7.16 Squad number 35 Player name Bednarek Average rating 7.08 Squad number 2 Player name Walker-Peters Average rating 7.07 Squad number 18 Player name Broja Average rating 7.04 Squad number 11 Player name Redmond Average rating 7.03 Squad number 24 Player name Elyounoussi Average rating 6.86 Squad number 6 Player name Oriol Romeu Average rating 6.84 Squad number 15 Player name Perraud Average rating 6.78 Squad number 4 Player name Lyanco Average rating 6.63 Squad number 43 Player name Valery Average rating 6.55 Arsenal Avg Squad number 7 Player name Saka Average rating 5.03 Squad number 32 Player name Ramsdale Average rating 4.69 Squad number 35 Player name Gabriel Martinelli Average rating 4.65 Squad number 8 Player name \u00d8degaard Average rating 4.57 Squad number 4 Player name White Average rating 4.34 Squad number 6 Player name Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es Average rating 4.27 Squad number 34 Player name Xhaka Average rating 4.17 Squad number 23 Player name Sambi Lokonga Average rating 4.10 Squad number 30 Player name Nketiah Average rating 4.04 Squad number 20 Player name Nuno Tavares Average rating 4.02 Squad number 17 Player name C\u00e9dric Soares Average rating 3.90 Squad number 10 Player name Smith Rowe Average rating 3.64 Squad number 19 Player name P\u00e9p\u00e9 Average rating 3.16\n\nLine-ups\n\nMatch Stats\n\nLive Text Line-ups Southampton Formation 3-4-3 44 Forster 43 Valery 4 Lyanco 35 Bednarek 2 Walker-Peters 8 Ward-Prowse 6 Romeu 15 Perraud 17 S Armstrong 18 Broja 24 Elyounoussi 44 Forster\n\n43 Valery\n\n4 Lyanco\n\n35 Bednarek\n\n2 Walker-Peters\n\n8 Ward-Prowse\n\n6 Romeu\n\n15 Perraud\n\n17 S Armstrong Substituted for Redmond at 82' minutes\n\n18 Broja Booked at 56mins Substituted for Long at 74' minutes Booked at 90mins\n\n24 Elyounoussi Substituted for Livramento at 90+2' minutes Substitutes 5 Stephens\n\n7 Long\n\n9 A Armstrong\n\n10 Adams\n\n11 Redmond\n\n13 Caballero\n\n21 Livramento\n\n22 Salisu\n\n23 Tella Arsenal Formation 4-2-3-1 32 Ramsdale 17 C\u00e9dric Soares 4 White 6 Gabriel 20 Tavares 23 Sambi Lokonga 34 Xhaka 35 Martinelli 8 \u00d8degaard 7 Saka 30 Nketiah 32 Ramsdale\n\n17 C\u00e9dric Soares Substituted for Smith Rowe at 60' minutes\n\n4 White Booked at 90mins\n\n6 Gabriel\n\n20 Tavares Substituted for P\u00e9p\u00e9 at 70' minutes\n\n23 Sambi Lokonga\n\n34 Xhaka\n\n35 Martinelli\n\n8 \u00d8degaard\n\n7 Saka\n\n30 Nketiah Substitutes 1 Leno\n\n10 Smith Rowe\n\n16 Holding\n\n19 P\u00e9p\u00e9\n\n25 Elneny\n\n38 Azeez\n\n61 Ogungbo\n\n69 Swanson\n\n82 Hutchinson Referee: Peter Bankes Attendance: 31,465 Match Stats Live Text Post update Match ends, Southampton 1, Arsenal 0.

The same could be said for the players down on the pitch \u2014 \u201cempty\u201d was how Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta described the feeling afterwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis Southampton counterpart Ruben Selles marched out of his technical area and gathered his team into a huddle. It has been a theme throughout Southampton\u2019s season to convene during galling moments, often after conceding or moments of respite.\n\n\u201cIt felt a disappointment in terms of the result,\u201d said Selles after seeing his last-placed side draw away to the league leaders, but do so having been 3-1 up with three minutes of normal time remaining. \u201cBut we need to go out of this stadium with our chests out and know that we put a good performance in and knew the solutions to every single moment.\n\n\u201cThe players showed that they want to play and are going to fight for each other. I told them when we go to our fans (to applaud), we need to show that, because they were very proud of us.\u201d\n\nSouthampton did not lose, and last night\u2019s draw means they are one of only three Premier League sides Arsenal have failed to beat this season \u2014 and the only one of those three to have played them twice. At any other stage of the campaign, it would be regarded as an excellent point.\n\nBut being engulfed in a relegation fight distorts logic and turns creditable draws into difficult blows. The same could be said for Arsenal and the title race, of course.\n\nThe sight of James Ward-Prowse, hands on hips and talking with various reporters\u2019 recording devices under his chin after a gruelling match, has become all too common over the years. In tough moments for Southampton, it will invariably be the captain fronting up publicly.\n\nWard-Prowse was put in the same spot again on Friday night. He rued the second half\u2019s \u201cvery strange\u201d eight minutes of additional time; a period that could yet define Southampton\u2019s season.\n\nSelles had doubled down a day earlier insisting his side would be on the front foot in north London and were going there to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor 87 minutes, Southampton made good on his promise, producing a display that exploited Arsenal\u2019s nerves and was underpinned by an attacking threat and a spirit \u2014 traits that have been profoundly absent of late.\n\nThey were two goals to the good. Plenty in the away end swung their shirts in disbelief and, although briefly, started to shout \u201cOl\u00e9\u201d after every pass.\n\nWard-Prowse, the only player in the squad to have scored away from home in the league this season before this match with Che Adams still out, tends to be the one figure every team-mate and supporter looks to. He was busy organising, yet found time to whisper a few words of praise to the undeniably mercurial Romeo Lavia following his substitution late on.\n\nWhen Lavia\u2019s replacement Ibrahima Diallo almost immediately got played around on the edge of the box, affording Martin Odegaard time and space to bend one past Gavin Bazunu and make it 3-2 in the 88th minute, a maelstrom ensued.\n\nAs it turned out, Southampton had 12 minutes left to cling on\u2026\n\nOdegaard rushed back to the centre circle and left team-mates and Arteta, as they did relentlessly all game, waving furiously for the crowd to raise its decibels.\n\nSouthampton\u2019s players thought about regrouping in a huddle, only for Ward-Prowse to disperse them and gesture for Bazunu to go long towards target-man striker Paul Onuachu.\n\nPlay restarted with Ward-Prowse passing all the way back to his goalkeeper, who duly followed those orders. Note team-mates trying to delay kick-off by creeping into Arsenal\u2019s territory, but referee Simon Hooper does not (or choose to) spot it.\n\nOnuachu managed to get himself offside from Bazunu\u2019s long kick, giving possession straight back to Arsenal.\n\nSouthampton backpedalled furiously, with the game plan and Selles\u2019 \u201cprinciples\u201d having left the pitch when Lavia did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked afterwards to explain how he felt watching the opposition take nine shots in 10 minutes, Selles half-shrugged and then smiled. \u201cIt required a lot of mental effort,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Southampton\u2019s heatmap for the minutes after Odegaard\u2019s goal showed, Onuachu (No 12) found himself increasingly isolated.\n\nSouthampton were caught, unable to push back upfield or to simply stop the ball from moving closer to their goal. Panic set in and appeared all-consuming.\n\nThey made 19 blocks to Arsenal\u2019s five in the match, but now could not swat the ball somewhere, anywhere, to safety.\n\nA combination of Bazunu\u2019s untidy parry and Armel Bella-Kotchap slipping allowed Bukayo Saka to equalise in the 90th minute.\n\nIt is rare for a goal to feel so inevitable and for one team to feel so powerless. To compound matters, the fourth official\u2019s board was held aloft while Saka celebrated, leaving Ward-Prowse, who wore the look of a man who has seen this movie before, to protest. Eight added minutes, it said.\n\nWhen Ward-Prowse eventually passed the ball back to Bazunu from kick-off once more, it bore hallmarks of Southampton\u2019s defeat at Old Trafford in February 2021 and Stuart Armstrong, in hopeless desperation, being booked for delaying taking kick-off, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Manchester United scoring a ninth goal against visitors by then down to nine men.\n\nSouthampton\u2019s players could not hear one another such was the din at the Emirates, which is not ideal as an already dishevelled unit continues to unravel further.\n\nWard-Prowse was the seventh Southampton player to go down injured after Leandro Trossard smashed a shot off the crossbar, a clear sign of trying to find shelter in whatever way possible. Romain Perraud would do the same following the next Arsenal attack, as the game clock neared the 100-minute mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomehow, Southampton survived without conceding again.\n\nThe result left a strange mix of regret and relief, exemplified in the players\u2019 body language at the final whistle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double feeling,\u201d said Selles. \u201cThe feeling of dropping two points that will help us a lot but the feeling that we can do it against any opponent (in the remaining six games).\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://soccer.nbcsports.com/2022/10/23/southampton-vs-arsenal-video-highlights-recap-analysis/", "page_content": "We may be heading for another summer of Tottenham transfer tumult, as uncertainty at manager following Antonio Conte\u2019s exit could lead to quite a few exits and entrances.\n\nAnd Spurs\u2019 failure to qualify for Europe could make quite a difference to their recruitment team\u2019s work.\n\n[ VIDEO: Premier League analysis ]\n\nWill Harry Kane sign a new deal and continue his rewriting of the team and PL record book, or might Tottenham be using a huge line item in the budget (again) to sign new attacking talent?

It\u2019s the end of an era. I have desires for other things. \u2026 But I don\u2019t forget that I still have a year of contract with Tottenham and that in football it is always difficult to predict what will happen. What is essential at the moment is to recover well from my injury. I\u2019m on vacation but I continue to talk and do my training. My goal is to be on top in July, then we\u2019ll see what the future holds for me.\u201d\n\nLloris made clear in the interview that he\u2019s not looking to retire, and that he\u2019s not ruling out more time at Tottenham.\n\nHe says he has more to give on the pitch.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go from a successful World Cup to being an average player in a few months,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cI had a few hard knocks, I was a little inconsistent in my performance, I got injured twice. I came out of the World Cup pretty dull. The pace had been hellish before that. This is the first time in my career that I am unavailable, but I\u2019m good in my head, in my body. This period will bring me freshness to still make me happy in the effort, the performance, the work.

The report says Montpellier\u2019s asking for around $35 million.\n\nThe 6-foot center forward had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday\u2019s visit from Toulouse. The advanced stats say he can carry the ball above average but basically has been strictly a finisher. Sounds like someone could use some schooling from a certain Harry Kane.

The 29-year-old striker has been heavily linked with a move to both Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Manchester United in the past but a move to the former now seems like it has passed after Erling Haaland\u2019s arrival.

Despite Spurs struggling at the moment as they lose ground in the top four race and the future of Antonio Conte as boss is uncertain, having Kane sign a new contract would at least give Spurs fans some good news as they\u2019ll know Kane will be around to score 20-25 goals a season for at least the next few years.

If circumstances right, possible 29yo will now extend past 2024. Striker\u2019s priority is to succeed with #THFC @TheAthleticFC https://t.co/aSnuYBX4mE \u2014 David Ornstein (@David_Ornstein) January 23, 2023\n\nJan. 12 \u2013 Spurs offer $14 million for Trossard\n\nFootball.London has a very Spurs-like report that Tottenham has \u2018verbally offered\u2019 $14 million for Leandro Trossard after the Brighton man expressed his wishes to leave the Amex Stadium.\n\nTrossard has reportedly fallen out with Seagulls boss Roberto De Zerbi and Brighton\u2019s been said to want between $25-30 million for the playmaker.\n\nSpurs landing Trossard for under $20 million would be at-worst a good risk and at-best an absolute coup, as the Belgian has done big things for Brighton. Playing with a focal point like Harry Kane could take him to the next level. (NM)\n\nJan. 9 \u2013 Trossard, Raya linked with Spurs\n\nTottenham have been linked with moves for both Leandro Trossard and David Raya as they try to strengthen their lineup. According to The Telegraph, Brentford and Spain goalkeeper Raya, 27, is seen as the long-term replacement for Hugo Lloris. The French captain only recently signed a contract extension but Lloris, 36, has been linked with a move away from Tottenham in recent years. Per the report, Raya will become Spurs\u2019 top goalkeeping target in the summer and he is a fine shot-stopper and is very good playing the ball out of the back with his feet.\n\nAs for Trossard, this seems like a deal which could happen in January. The Daily Mail claim that Spurs are among several clubs, including Chelsea, who are set to move for the Belgian winger. Trossard, 28, is out of contract at Brighton next summer and didn\u2019t feature in their win at Everton or in their 5-1 FA Cup win at Middlesbrough. It seems like a move this month could be possible as Brighton will aim to recoup some cash for their talented winger/wing-back. Trossard has added goals and assists to his game over the last 12 months and was a key cog in Graham Potter\u2019s success as a hybrid wing-back. However, Roberto De Zerbi could use Kaoru Mitoma in that role and Brighton will look to move on Trossard in January. Spurs need to upgrade their wing-back potions and if Trossard comes in on the left, it would allow Ivan Perisic to play further up the pitch. Alternatively, Trossard is also comfortable playing as a winger or attacking midfielder and he is proven in the Premier League. Is he the type of player who can turn Spurs into a guaranteed top four team? Probably not. Is he a top quality addition who has the potential to slot in seamlessly? He is. (JPW)\n\nDec. 29 \u2013 Tottenham, Manchester United open talks with Rennes for Martin Terrier\n\nYes, Tottenham\u2019s just splashed plenty of cash on a star left winger in Richarlison, but would the versatility of Martin Terrier make him a great fit to compete with the Brazilian as well as Heung-min Son?\n\nFree-scoring Rennes forward Terrier is said to be a target for Tottenham and Manchester United as both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the Ligue 1 outfit regarding the 25-year-old. Price tag? It reportedly starts around $38 million.\n\nTerrier has scored and assisted on the regular in France\u2019s top flight. He scored 21 goals last season and has eight in 14 matches this season. The left wing can also play center forward amongst other positions. He\u2019s chipped in three goals in the Europa League this campaign and also had provided 11 assists across all competitions since the start of last season.\n\nVery strong in the air and plenty good in combination play, Terrier has posted impressed xG and xA numbers and could combine with Kane but also deputize for the exhaustively-used CF. He may be a better fit for Spurs but might Man United before more willing to spend to get him?

The 25-year-old was signed from Real Madrid in the summer of 2020 and initially impressed under Jose Mourinho. The Spaniard was rather quickly deemed ill-fitting by current manager Antonio Conte, and that was pretty much that.

Per the report, Spurs are willing to pay up to $41 million for the Texas native. McKennie, 23, was signed for Juventus by their former sporting director Fabio Paratici, who is now in the same role at Spurs. Antonio Conte wants to strengthen his midfield options and McKennie would be a near-perfect fit in midfield in Conte\u2019s aggressive, mobile 4-3-3 system. His versatility is also stated as a big factor for Conte.\n\nBut there\u2019s a twist. There\u2019s always a twist. With superstar Paul Pogba arriving back at Juventus this summer and expected to eat up plenty of the minutes McKennie was previously getting, Pogba has just gone down with a knee injury in preseason. That requires surgery and it means Juve may not move on McKennie this summer after all. Another twist? McKennie is yet to feature on Juventus\u2019 preseason tour of the United States of America as he was unused substitute in each of their games against Barcelona and Chivas Guadalajara. During the tour Juve boss Max Allegri has stated that McKennie is working his way back to full fitness, so maybe there\u2019s nothing to read into here, but it is a little odd that Juventus haven\u2019t given any minutes to one of the best USMNT players on their U.S. tour, right? Perhaps they aren\u2019t risking him being injured as a transfer away is imminent? McKennie seems fairly happy at Juventus but it seems inevitable he will end up in the Premier League at some point.

Spence excelled while he was on loan at Nottingham Forest last season and it is believed he\u2019s signed for Spurs for an initial $15 million fee and add ons could take the deal to $24 million. Spence is regarded as one of the top young right back prospects in England and he will push Emerson Royal and Matt Doherty all the way for a starting spot. Spence is exactly the kind of right wing-back Conte loves in his 3-4-3 system and his attacking instincts will slot in really well at Spurs.

The 27-year-old is said to have stayed Thursday night in Tottenham\u2019s on-site hotel at the club\u2019s training facility.\n\nWhile Ben Davies was certainly a (surprising) standout performer as the left-sided center back in Conte\u2019s back-three down the stretch last season, Lenglet represents an upgrade in quality and his arrival instantly creates depth at a vitally important (and dangerous thin) position in Tottenham\u2019s squad.

Bissouma, a Mali international, had one year left on his contract at Brighton and that drove his transfer fee down. He\u2019s worth at least double what Spurs paid for him and the combative central midfielder is just the type of destroyer who will thrive in Antonio Conte\u2019s system.\n\n\ud83c\udf99 \u201cI'm very happy to be here\u201d Watch Bissouma\u2019s first interview as a Spurs player! \ud83d\udc4a \u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 17, 2022\n\nOf course, he\u2019s smooth on the ball and has plenty of poise to his game too, but Bissouma\u2019s arrival adds more steel to Tottenham\u2019s team and more depth too as Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster have already arrived this summer. Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici are certainly delivering the additions Conte wanted. This is a very savvy addition by Spurs. With Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur the first-choice pairing in central midfield and Oliver Skipp around too, Conte now has four top quality options for his two central midfield spots. That will help a lot with rotating the lineup from Champions League games in midweek to PL action at he weekend.

It\u2019s the end of an era. I have desires for other things. \u2026 But I don\u2019t forget that I still have a year of contract with Tottenham and that in football it is always difficult to predict what will happen.

(NM)\n\nJan. 9 \u2013 Trossard, Raya linked with Spurs\n\nTottenham have been linked with moves for both Leandro Trossard and David Raya as they try to strengthen their lineup. According to The Telegraph, Brentford and Spain goalkeeper Raya, 27, is seen as the long-term replacement for Hugo Lloris. The French captain only recently signed a contract extension but Lloris, 36, has been linked with a move away from Tottenham in recent years. Per the report, Raya will become Spurs\u2019 top goalkeeping target in the summer and he is a fine shot-stopper and is very good playing the ball out of the back with his feet.\n\nAs for Trossard, this seems like a deal which could happen in January. The Daily Mail claim that Spurs are among several clubs, including Chelsea, who are set to move for the Belgian winger. Trossard, 28, is out of contract at Brighton next summer and didn\u2019t feature in their win at Everton or in their 5-1 FA Cup win at Middlesbrough. It seems like a move this month could be possible as Brighton will aim to recoup some cash for their talented winger/wing-back. Trossard has added goals and assists to his game over the last 12 months and was a key cog in Graham Potter\u2019s success as a hybrid wing-back. However, Roberto De Zerbi could use Kaoru Mitoma in that role and Brighton will look to move on Trossard in January. Spurs need to upgrade their wing-back potions and if Trossard comes in on the left, it would allow Ivan Perisic to play further up the pitch. Alternatively, Trossard is also comfortable playing as a winger or attacking midfielder and he is proven in the Premier League. Is he the type of player who can turn Spurs into a guaranteed top four team? Probably not. Is he a top quality addition who has the potential to slot in seamlessly? He is. (JPW)\n\nDec. 29 \u2013 Tottenham, Manchester United open talks with Rennes for Martin Terrier\n\nYes, Tottenham\u2019s just splashed plenty of cash on a star left winger in Richarlison, but would the versatility of Martin Terrier make him a great fit to compete with the Brazilian as well as Heung-min Son?\n\nFree-scoring Rennes forward Terrier is said to be a target for Tottenham and Manchester United as both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the Ligue 1 outfit regarding the 25-year-old. Price tag? It reportedly starts around $38 million.\n\nTerrier has scored and assisted on the regular in France\u2019s top flight. He scored 21 goals last season and has eight in 14 matches this season. The left wing can also play center forward amongst other positions. He\u2019s chipped in three goals in the Europa League this campaign and also had provided 11 assists across all competitions since the start of last season.\n\nVery strong in the air and plenty good in combination play, Terrier has posted impressed xG and xA numbers and could combine with Kane but also deputize for the exhaustively-used CF. He may be a better fit for Spurs but might Man United before more willing to spend to get him?

The 25-year-old was signed from Real Madrid in the summer of 2020 and initially impressed under Jose Mourinho. The Spaniard was rather quickly deemed ill-fitting by current manager Antonio Conte, and that was pretty much that.

Per the report, Spurs are willing to pay up to $41 million for the Texas native. McKennie, 23, was signed for Juventus by their former sporting director Fabio Paratici, who is now in the same role at Spurs. Antonio Conte wants to strengthen his midfield options and McKennie would be a near-perfect fit in midfield in Conte\u2019s aggressive, mobile 4-3-3 system. His versatility is also stated as a big factor for Conte.\n\nBut there\u2019s a twist. There\u2019s always a twist. With superstar Paul Pogba arriving back at Juventus this summer and expected to eat up plenty of the minutes McKennie was previously getting, Pogba has just gone down with a knee injury in preseason. That requires surgery and it means Juve may not move on McKennie this summer after all. Another twist? McKennie is yet to feature on Juventus\u2019 preseason tour of the United States of America as he was unused substitute in each of their games against Barcelona and Chivas Guadalajara. During the tour Juve boss Max Allegri has stated that McKennie is working his way back to full fitness, so maybe there\u2019s nothing to read into here, but it is a little odd that Juventus haven\u2019t given any minutes to one of the best USMNT players on their U.S. tour, right? Perhaps they aren\u2019t risking him being injured as a transfer away is imminent? McKennie seems fairly happy at Juventus but it seems inevitable he will end up in the Premier League at some point. (JPW)\n\nJuly 19 \u2013 Tottenham finally sign Djed Spence\n\nTottenham have finally confirmed the signing of Djed Spence, 21, from Middlesbrough as the talented right back/wing-back becomes Antonio Conte\u2019s sixth signing of the summer window. Spence excelled while he was on loan at Nottingham Forest last season and it is believed he\u2019s signed for Spurs for an initial $15 million fee and add ons could take the deal to $24 million. Spence is regarded as one of the top young right back prospects in England and he will push Emerson Royal and Matt Doherty all the way for a starting spot. Spence is exactly the kind of right wing-back Conte loves in his 3-4-3 system and his attacking instincts will slot in really well at Spurs.

The 27-year-old is said to have stayed Thursday night in Tottenham\u2019s on-site hotel at the club\u2019s training facility.\n\nWhile Ben Davies was certainly a (surprising) standout performer as the left-sided center back in Conte\u2019s back-three down the stretch last season, Lenglet represents an upgrade in quality and his arrival instantly creates depth at a vitally important (and dangerous thin) position in Tottenham\u2019s squad. As is the case all over the field, there will be plenty of games to go around \u2014 in two condensed half-seasons either side of the World Cup, with the five-substitutes rule once again in effect as well.

Spurs will reportedly receive $31.9 million from Ajax, nearly an identical match to the $32 million they paid to PSV Eindhoven to bring him to the Premier League in January 2020.

Bissouma, a Mali international, had one year left on his contract at Brighton and that drove his transfer fee down. He\u2019s worth at least double what Spurs paid for him and the combative central midfielder is just the type of destroyer who will thrive in Antonio Conte\u2019s system.\n\n\ud83c\udf99 \u201cI'm very happy to be here\u201d Watch Bissouma\u2019s first interview as a Spurs player! \ud83d\udc4a \u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 17, 2022\n\nOf course, he\u2019s smooth on the ball and has plenty of poise to his game too, but Bissouma\u2019s arrival adds more steel to Tottenham\u2019s team and more depth too as Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster have already arrived this summer. Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici are certainly delivering the additions Conte wanted. This is a very savvy addition by Spurs. With Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur the first-choice pairing in central midfield and Oliver Skipp around too, Conte now has four top quality options for his two central midfield spots. That will help a lot with rotating the lineup from Champions League games in midweek to PL action at he weekend.

A sloppy start gave way to a comfortable afternoon\u2019s work; even better, the goals were shared between a striker, a midfielder and a defender. In recent years Mikel Arteta would have revelled in a healthy haul that did not rely squarely on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, so he could be doubly relieved to savour one here.\n\nWhile Alexandre Lacazette, Martin \u00d8degaard and Gabriel can be feted for their contributions, their names took a back seat in the post-match conversation. Arteta must have thought he had left Arsenal\u2019s soap\u2011opera habits behind after a summer revamp but he now faces a huge decision on how to deal with his club captain, who was dropped from the match\u2011day squad after returning late from a trip abroad. Aubameyang has let Arteta down before and been forgiven. On the available evidence that is not a state of affairs that can continue infinitely and it is no example to set when you are an elder statesman in the Premier League\u2019s youngest squad.\n\nThe way in which Aubameyang\u2019s peers went about their work may focus Arteta\u2019s thinking when he considers who should lead his team. Their attitude was sound throughout, even if they are liable to perplex. There are no two ways about it: Arsenal are a strange side, rough around the edges, who can drift out of games for alarmingly long periods before illuminating them at a stroke. That is exactly what happened here, an error\u2011strewn first 20 minutes courting punishment before Southampton were put to the sword.\n\n\u201cWe started a little bit nervy, gave some difficult balls away and could not dominate,\u201d Arteta said. Aaron Ramsdale was called into action three times early on, most notably parrying one-handed from Adam Armstrong, and Arsenal seemed cowed by their late disappointment at Everton on Monday. The uncertainty over Aubameyang may not have helped but it was alleviated, for one night at least, by the player who took his place in attack.\n\nLacazette\u2019s goal concluded a journey from the ridiculous to the sublime, which began when Ramsdale was almost robbed by Armando Broja. The goalkeeper improvised and set in train a sweeping move that broke the Southampton press. Eventually Takehiro Tomiyasu found Bukayo Saka in an inordinate amount of space on the right; Saka\u2019s run was purposeful, his cutback precise, and Lacazette swept into the corner. Arsenal had almost rued loose passing from the back several times but when it works it pays off marvellously.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette whips his finish into the top corner after a flowing Arenal move that started with Aaron Ramsdale. Photograph: Tony Obrien/Action Images/Reuters\n\nArteta praised Lacazette\u2019s \u201cenergy and commitment and the way he leads\u201d, saying he \u201creally affected the team\u201d. He also had warm words for \u00d8degaard, whose third goal in as many games came within six minutes. Kieran Tierney miscued one attempted cross and had a second bite blocked but, after the ball looped up, nodded his third attempt into \u00d8degaard\u2019s path. The resulting header was emphatic and proved a point his manager has hammered home. \u201cHe is making the box much more and now he\u2019s understanding why we encourage him to do that because he is a match\u2011winner, that is the difference between a very good player and a match-winner,\u201d Arteta said.\n\nThat was indeed game over, even if Southampton\u2019s emergency goalkeeper, the 40-year-old Willy Caballero, had hitherto been untroubled. He saved from Saka before half-time but was beaten to a corner by Gabriel in the 62nd minute, adding gloss to Arsenal\u2019s day. Gabriel had had a goal disallowed moments previously; he was also booked and had been behind much of Arsenal\u2019s skittish early work, additionally flirting with disaster in a penalty-area coming together with Nathan Tella. His display was of a piece with the fare on show: far from polished, but effective and ultimately superior.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSouthampton, who lost Armstrong and Broja to injury, found Ramsdale an impenetrable barrier as they sought a consolation; Saka and Gabriel Martinelli both hit posts at the other end for Arsenal.\n\n\u201cAfter the third goal the game is gone,\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cYou could feel the quality they had when they were in the flow.\u201d Arteta must decide whether the reinsertion of his captain will add to that or not."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51893552", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nArteta's 'door is open' for Guendouzi return\n\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta remains hopeful that his side can qualify for Europe this season after they won their first game since the restart of the Premier League at Southampton.\n\nThe Gunners had lost both of their previous two games, to Manchester City and Brighton, but Thursday's victory arrests the slump, moving them up to ninth in the table.\n\nChampions League qualification looks unlikely, but with Manchester City's involvement in Europe still up in the air pending their appeal against a ban for breaching financial fair play, Arteta's side could well claim a Europa League spot.\n\n\"I am always very positive,\" said Arteta. \"We have enough time, we have enough games left to do it.\n\n\"We had two defeats for the first time since I joined, but now we have won and it lifts the spirit, it lifts the belief.\n\n\"The calendar of the Premier League has given us is pretty tough. We have four away games and we have to recover the players now.\"\n\nThe Gunners were helped along their way at St Mary's by a dreadful error from Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy who faltered under pressure from Eddie Nketiah following a back-pass, allowing the striker to intercept his attempted ball out and slot into an unguarded net.\n\nThe win was sealed late on when Jack Stephens was sent off for fouling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the last man and from the resulting free-kick substitute Joe Willock finished after Alexandre Lacazette's free-kick struck the wall and his follow-up was parried.\n\nIt was timely boost for the Gunners, who have struggled with injuries and form since the restart.\n\nThe victory, though, was not undeserved. Prior to the goal, Nketiah had seen a close-range finish ruled out for offside and Aubameyang had crashed an angled effort against the bar.\n\nComing after such an impressive display in their first game back at Norwich, the result continues Southampton's woeful inability to replicate their away form at St Mary's.\n\nThis was their 10th loss at home this season - equalling the club record for a Premier League season, set back in 1993-94 when their were 42 games in a campaign.\n\nWith 10 points separating them and the bottom three it is very unlikely that they will get dragged into a relegation fight.\n\nSmall steps forward for Arsenal\n\nNketiah's goal was his second in the league for Arsenal this season\n\nSince the restart, the Gunners have lurched from one mini-crisis to the next - David Luiz's calamitous display against Manchester City, injury problems galore, and a winning position thrown away at Brighton.\n\nTwo defeats from two games since the restart had already put paid to Arsenal's already slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nIt also placed them in serious danger of recording their worst league finish since 1994-95 - the season in which George Graham was sacked and they ended up 12th.\n\nThat threat is far from over but what is just a third away win in 16 fixtures this season, coming from a much more assured performance, will bring at least a small injection of confidence and calm.\n\nGoalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, in for the injured Bernd Leno, was solid, Granit Xhaka returned effectively in midfield and Nketiah and Aubameyang were typically lively in attack.\n\n\"I asked the players to be together, to defend each other and to play for 90 minutes and that is what they have done today,\" said Arteta.\n\n\"We gave the ball away very easily in the second half. They committed a lot of men forward and we had to defend but the commitment and the way they competed was really good.\"\n\nHowever, it would not be this current Arsenal without some shadows lurking in the background.\n\nFull-back Kieran Tierney, who has been hampered by injury problems since joining the Gunners from Celtic last summer, limped out of the game in the second half.\n\nAlso, Matteo Guendouzi was left out of the squad entirely. While manager Mikel Arteta stated that his exclusion was down to \"squad management\", he also did not entirely dismiss speculation that the Frenchman blotted his copybook by clashing with Neal Maupay at the end of the Brighton game on Saturday.\n\nNo home comforts for Saints\n\nSaints conceded goals too easily - Hasenhuttl\n\nSouthampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl is an animated manager at the best of times but spent much of Thursday's game prowling the touchline with a frustrated look and sweat on his brow.\n\nHaving handed the Austrian a new four-year deal at the start of this month, the Saints recognise a man with a plan and a project worth pursuing.\n\nHis first job, though, is to rectify the disparity between their away and home results.\n\nAway from St Mary's they appear unburdened, pressing effectively and counter-attacking with menace, but back on the south coast they struggle to exert themselves, even without the pressure of fans in the stands.\n\nTheir display was not completely without merit but attacks tended to yield half-chances from long range for James Ward-Prowse, Stuart Armstrong and Nathan Redmond as opposed to the kind of clear-cut ones that have enabled the likes of Danny Ings to thrive this campaign.\n\nIngs' one big chance of the game came in the final quarter when he was released behind the defence by a long ball forward, but his drive was parried well by Martinez.\n\n\"It is always difficult when you give away too easy goals to such an opponent,\" said Hasenhuttl.\n\n\"But in the second half only we were playing, The decisions we made in the final third were not that bad and we had some good chances. It is a step forward, especially in possession.\"\n\nIt may get worse before it gets better, though, for Saints. Manchester City are the next visitors to St Mary's.\n\nMan of the match - Rob Holding (Arsenal)\n\nNot a spectacular display by Holding but his calm, solid presence at the back is exactly what Arsenal need right now following the erratic performances of David Luiz\n\nSaints top errors chart - the stats you need to know\n\nNo team has made more errors leading to opposition goals in the Premier League this season than Southampton (10).

The gym is very important but what happens in your brain is more important.\n\n\u201cHow much you want it, how tough you want to be with yourself, how pushy you want to be with yourself and what you do to get to that level.\u201d\n\nArteta was forced to defend his decision to play Saka in Thursday night\u2019s Europa League win over PSV Eindhoven and again explained that he was not putting his player at risk by asking him to play every three days.\n\n\u201cWe have so much data right now and we know what the players have done, what they can do, how they respond when they play every three days, when you play three, four, five consecutive matches, where the risk can be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still nobody has a crystal clear ball.\n\nObviously we want to protect our players as well, which means they need to have the robustness to play those matches when it is necessary, because it\u2019s going to be necessary and after the World Cup it\u2019s going to be absolutely crazy the amount of games we\u2019re going to have.\u201d\n\nArteta also revealed he had spoken to several national managers ahead of the World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt is great for both managers to have an update on where the players are not only physically but mentally, issues that they have had, things that we insist from them and what helps a player, what brings them down,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, defender Gabriel Magalhaes has signed a new, long-term deal at Arsenal.\n\nAhead of kick-off at 2pm, we'll be bringing you team news, live updates, and latest reaction after the match too."}]}
