Doleva said in a statement. \"We congratulate and thank them for everything they've done to better the sport and look forward to honoring them during Enshrinement this fall.\"\n\nThe enshrinement ceremony is set for Sept. 10 in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nGinobili is one of two players, along with Bill Bradley, to win a EuroLeague title, an NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal. Ginobili was a two-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA selection and the 2007-08 Sixth Man of the Year during his 16-year career with the San Antonio Spurs. He led his native Argentina to the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics.\n\n\"I was a part of two incredible teams; if it wasn't for being part of those two teams, I wouldn't be here,'' Ginobili said. \"It's not just about individual accomplishments. I never won a scoring championship, an MVP or even [All-NBA] first team. I'm here because of my surroundings, of the players I played with, of the coaches I was coached [by] and the organizations. I know I've been very lucky.''\n\nBut Ginobili did leave his mark on the game in the way he employed lateral movement after picking up his dribble to get up shots in the paint. It became known as the \"Eurostep,\" because Ginobili had played for a EuroLeague championship-winning team in Bologna, Italy, before coming to the NBA.\n\n\"I never saw that I created anything or brought anything new. I just played the only way I thought possible,\" Ginobili explained, bringing up the challenge of trying to score against 7-footer Shaquille O'Neal early in his career.\n\n\"I was not going to go over Shaq and dunk, I had to go around people,'' Ginobili said. \"That's the way my skill set and physical abilities found to get to the rim. I've done it since I can remember.\"\n\nHardaway, who won gold at the 2000 Olympics, was a five-time All-NBA selection, earning first-team honors in 1996-97 and second-team honors on three occasions. He ranks in the top 20 all time in assists and 12th in assists per game.\n\nCash was a four-time WNBA All-Star. In addition to her WNBA titles and Olympic gold medals, she was a two-time NCAA champion at UConn, where she helped lead the Huskies to a perfect 39-0 mark in 2001-02. Cash was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame last year and currently serves as vice president of basketball operations for the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nWhalen, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was named to the WNBA first team in 2008, 2011 and 2013. She ranks third all-time in the WNBA in assists and led the league in the category five times. As a player at Minnesota, where she currently serves as head coach, Whalen led the Golden Gophers to the Final Four in 2004 and was named an All-American three times.\n\nWest Virginia coach Huggins has spent 39 seasons as a head coach with more than 900 career wins. He has led his teams to two Final Fours, once at Cincinnati and once with the Mountaineers.\n\nKarl was an NBA head coach for 27 seasons and is sixth in career victories with 1,175. He led Seattle to the NBA Finals in 1996 and was named the NBA Coach of the Year in 2013 with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nEvans officiated more than 1,900 regular-season games, 170 playoff games and 35 NBA Finals games over a 28-year career before stepping away from the court in 2001.\n\nStanley, currently the coach of the Indiana Fever, coached Old Dominion to an NCAA championship in 1984-85 and back-to-back AIAW titles in 1979 and 1980. She was named the WNBA Coach of the Year in 2002 with the Washington Mystics.\n\nHudson and Costello will both be inducted posthumously. Hudson played 11 seasons with the Hawks franchise and averaged 20.2 points over his 13-year NBA career. Costello was known as the last two-handed set shooter and led the NBA in free throw percentage twice.\n\nHarris was the NBA Coach of the Year with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1994-95 as part of a coaching career that spanned more than 50 years. Shank-Grentz was a member of three consecutive AIAW national champions at Immaculata University from 1972 to '74.\n\nKorac led Yugoslavia to a silver medal in the 1968 Olympics and FIBA World Cup silvers in 1963 and 1967. He holds the EuroLeague's single-game scoring mark with 99 points and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. Korac died after a car crash in 1969.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31455606/paul-pierce-chris-bosh-chris-webber-ben-wallace-headline-2021-class-basketball-hall-fame", "page_content": "A day after watching his longtime friend and teammate Kevin Garnett enter the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, longtime Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce joined him in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nPierce, along with two-time champion and 11-time All-Star selection Chris Bosh, five-time All-NBA selection Chris Webber and four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace, headlined the 2021 Hall of Fame class. The honor was announced the day after Garnett, Tim Duncan and the late Kobe Bryant officially were inducted as part of the 2020 class, which saw its entry delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe 2021 class will be enshrined on Sept. 11.\n\nWebber had been a finalist in each of the past five years before finally breaking through.

AP Photo/Charles Krupa\n\nBosh, who was drafted fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in 2003, spent seven years with Toronto before joining the Miami Heat as a free agent in 2010, teaming up with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade to advance to four straight NBA Finals, winning two of them (2012 and 2013). He also won a gold medal with Team USA in 2008, though his career was cut short by blood-clot issues that caused him to have to retire in 2017 while still in his prime.\n\n\"It was short-lived, in my opinion,\" Bosh said about his career. \"I wanted to play a lot longer; unfortunately it came to an abrupt end. But just looking back on everything I was able to accomplish, all the friends I was able to make, the connections I made, all the memories we were able to make together, that's what's most important.\"\n\nAfter being part of one of college basketball's most iconic teams as the top recruit of the Fab Five to attend the University of Michigan, Webber, the No. 1 pick in the 1993 NBA draft, was a five-time All-Star, five-time All-NBA selection and the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1994. His best years came playing for Adelman with the Sacramento Kings from 1998 to 2005, when he helped lead the Kings to seven of the 10 playoff appearances they've made in their 36 years in Sacramento -- and he was there all four times they won a playoff series.\n\n\"I'm just thankful man, thankful ... I'm just in shock, I really don't know what to say,\" Webber told his friend and former Michigan teammate Jalen Rose when asked for his reaction to the news.\n\nWallace, who went undrafted out of Virginia Union in 1996, developed into one of the best defensive players of all time and was the anchor of the great Detroit Pistons teams of the 2000s that won the title in 2004 and made it to six consecutive Eastern Conference finals. Wallace, who also played for the Wizards, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers, is tied with Dikembe Mutombo for the most Defensive Player of the Year honors (four) in a career, and he made four All-Star teams, five All-NBA teams and five All-Defensive teams.\n\nAdelman made it to two NBA Finals and won more than 1,000 games as a coach with the Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets and Minnesota Timberwolves, while Wright lifted Villanova back to the top of the college basketball world, winning titles in 2016 and 2018 and making three Final Fours during his time in Philadelphia.\n\n\"It's pretty amazing,\" Wright said. \"You showed the picture of all those guys -- Bill Russell, KG, Chris Webber -- and just to be hanging with these guys right now and listening to their stories and being part of the Hall with them, and this class, it's nothing you'd ever even dream of. It's pretty cool.\"\n\nRussell, one of the greatest players of all time and the NBA's first Black head coach, won a pair of titles as the Celtics' coach in the late '60s. He had previously been enshrined as a player in 1975. He becomes the fifth Hall of Famer who'll be inducted as both a player and a coach, joining John Wooden, Lenny Wilkens, Bill Sharman and Tommy Heinsohn.\n\nJackson was a three-time MVP and won two championships with the Seattle Storm, while Yolanda Griffith was the 1999 WNBA MVP and led the Sacramento Monarchs to the title in 2005.\n\n\"I'm very, very proud just to be given an opportunity,\" Griffith said of her time in the WNBA. \"I got drafted in '99, No. 2 pick to the Sacramento Monarchs, and it was a joy because that gave me an opportunity to be back home from playing over in Europe. It gave my family a chance to see me play, finally, on the professional level, and just enjoy playing at that level on the highest level, basically. I enjoyed the ride with the Sacramento Monarchs.\"\n\nAlso Sunday, the Hall said ESPN vice president of women's sports programming Carol Stiff is this year's recipient of the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award. She will be honored during Hall of Fame weekend.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/insider/story/_/id/34464189/basketball-hall-fame-2022-most-clandestine-hall-fame-voting-process-all-sports", "page_content": "BOB COUSY TURNED 94 years old last month, and the Boston Celtics legend believes nearly half of his life has been spent affiliated with the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I've served in just about every capacity on every committee,\" the \"Houdini of the Hardwood\" says with pride one summer morning, calling from his home in Worcester, Massachusetts, about an hour's drive east from the hall in Springfield. The 13-time All-Star, six-time champion and 1957 NBA MVP was inducted as a player in 1971. Nearly two decades later, in 1989, Cousy became the first Hall of Famer to be named president of the hall itself -- a short stint that he says was more honorary than hands-on.\n\nFor all his involvement, Cousy admits that he has one notable blind spot: how someone becomes a Hall of Famer.\n\n\"Because of my reasons or someone else's,\" he says, \"I've never taken time to inform myself on the voting process.\"\n\nThere's a primer on the hall's website, but it doesn't provide identities of the voters themselves, a sharp contrast from the respective halls for professional hockey, football and baseball. So who are the voters? Who picks them? And why is the whole procedure shrouded in mystery?\n\nThese are among Cousy's queries, and when details -- provided to ESPN by those who have voted (and who largely wanted to remain anonymous) along with top executives at the hall -- are shared with Cousy, he pauses, then offers a long \"hmmmmmm.\"\n\n\"It sounds byzantine,\" Cousy says. \"It probably wouldn't pass a Supreme Court muster.\"\n\nThe hall's latest class, a 13-member group that features Manu Ginobili, Tim Hardaway, Bob Huggins, Swin Cash and Lindsay Whalen, among others, will be enshrined in basketball's birthplace this weekend. How that class came about, exactly, is unclear, because the Basketball Hall of Fame is the least transparent among the halls in perhaps all of sports.\n\nThe election process for the Basketball Hall of Fame is so secretive, in fact, that its final ballots are destroyed.\n\nEACH OF THE four major Halls of Fame has similar procedures for inducting members. There are requirements for eligibility, largely based on years removed from the league itself, and then committees that screen nominees and another for the final vote. The bar for induction is high in all four: nominees must receive either 75% or 80% of possible votes for enshrinement. Some halls, such as hockey and basketball, have limited voting terms for committee members who vote; others are open-ended.\n\nBut the Basketball Hall of Fame is different from its brethren in two striking ways. The first is that the other halls focus only on inducting members from their sports' professional ranks in North America, whereas Naismith encompasses all levels and genders of the entire sport globally: the NBA, WNBA, college, high school, international, men's, women's -- you name it. This is the case despite the fact that there are halls of fame for college basketball (in Kansas City), women's basketball (in Knoxville, Tennessee) and international basketball (the FIBA hall in Madrid).\n\n\"I think that sets us apart,\" says Jerry Colangelo, the hall's chairman since 2009. \"We represent the game of basketball, on all levels. And whether there are other hall of fames within basketball doesn't matter. That's fine.\"\n\nThen there's the voting.\n\nFor both the hockey and football halls, the identities of the voters are listed online. And in baseball, where only writers vote, all 394 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America who voted in the 2022 Hall of Fame election are also listed online. (Ballots from BBWAA voters who want theirs to be public will be listed online at a later date, too.)\n\nWith the Basketball Hall of Fame, the only online description of the anonymous voters' identities is an in-house mention that the two 24-person honors committees (one for North American men and one for women) are comprised of \"Hall of Famers, basketball executives and administrators, members of the media, and other experts in the game of basketball.\"\n\n\"There's not any major reason why we're different from anyone else,\" Colangelo says. \"It's just that it's always been that way, because we want to protect the people who are voting, who are involved in the process, and that eliminates a lot of things that do happen, conceivably, in the other sports, in terms of influencing those people who are voters. There's potentially an integrity issue if names are out there in the public. We have active coaches, we have active general managers, we have media people who are all involved. We have Hall of Famers who are involved. And so there's no requirement to disclose those names.\n\n\"What does that accomplish?\"\n\nBoth Colangelo and John Doleva, the hall's president and CEO since 2001, say that anonymity -- which Doleva says has been part of the voting process for as long as he can remember -- serves a greater purpose than transparency.\n\nJerry Colangelo, the current chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, was inducted into the Hall in 2004. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBA/Getty Images\n\n\"All the halls of fame are flawed in a way because it's like in any voting. There's bias,\" says one former voter. \"The one thing is that it's not corrupt. No one -- Jerry or anybody in the NBA -- have ever leaned on me in any of those situations.\"\n\nGranting anonymity also allows the hall to tap into a deeper pool of voters with significant experience in the game -- voters who wouldn't participate if their vote were made public.\n\n\"If I could show you the list, you would nod your head and go, 'Wow,'\" Doleva says.\n\nDoleva continues, \"Why is there confidentiality? It's not because we want to be secretive. It is to protect you, the voter, and give you the reassurance that your vote and your comments are not going to be circulated so you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.\"\n\nAn uncomfortable situation like a legendary player on a screening committee who said an eligible teammate wasn't Hall of Fame worthy and thus didn't vote for them. This particular instance, several voters say, has happened multiple times.\n\n\"It really gave me an added measure of respect that they valued the game that much,\" one former voter says, recalling witnessing just such an incident.\n\nColangelo and some former voters note that the pool of voting expertise that the hall draws from is deeper than some other halls of fame, with participants all taking part not just on the final voting committees but on the screening committees, too (the North American screening committee has nine members and the women's screening committee has seven members).\n\nBaseball, in comparison, relies only on media members to vote.\n\n\"I don't like the baseball thing, because it's just writers,\" the former voter says. \"They don't know enough about the game. They're not involved in baseball.\"\n\nHowever, hockey's voting body is made up of former players, executives, coaches and media, and their identities are all public.\n\nStill, Basketball Hall of Fame voters are reminded not to publicly reveal their identity as a voter or to discuss how they ultimately voted. The penalty for doing otherwise? Doleva says he's not sure.\n\n\"To be honest, we have never had any violations of it that has come back to me in terms of media,\" he says.\n\nLongtime NBA journalist Peter Vecsey, a former voter, would like a word.\n\n\"I want everything I say to be on the record,\" he begins.\n\nLIKE OTHER VOTERS, Vecsey was sworn to secrecy about his role as a voter.\n\n\"I never told anybody, except you,\" he says. \"So I played it pretty close to the vest.\"\n\nWhat Vecsey -- and others who have voted -- recall is first receiving a booklet in the mail containing the names and biographies of nominated individuals eligible for induction that year. In a typical year, that booklet contains anywhere from 40 to 50 names.\n\nIn early February, the nine-member North American screening committee gathers in its Manhattan headquarters (though the COVID-19 pandemic forced those meetings onto a Zoom call) to debate and discuss the names in the booklet and, ultimately, whittle that list of players, coaches and referees down to no more than 10.\n\nEach candidate must receive at least seven votes to make the final cut, which is then mailed out to the 24-member honors committee in the second week in March; members receive that list, mark yes or no on each candidate, then mail their ballots back to the hall. Those final ballots are then tallied by a lawyer and eventually shredded \"so that there is not a paper trail to go back and somehow find that some individuals voted in some way -- again, to protect the process,\" Doleva says.\n\nESPN Daily podcast Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nElectees are announced at the NCAA Men's Final Four in April, when anxious hopefuls wait by the phone, but the real tension of the entire Hall of Fame induction process comes in that room where the screening committee gathers. The meetings can last several hours and the level of debate on each individual candidate can be intense. For some attendees, this meeting marks the best part of being a voter: to hear the game's greats discussing teammates and colleagues in an unfiltered manner.\n\n\"It gets really, really spirited and heavily debated -- but in a good way, where it's not disrespectful,\" says one former voter.\n\nSays another former voter, \"You know you're either denying somebody or promoting somebody to go to the next level and get into the Hall of Fame and how serious that is. A lot of times, it's just a thin thread separating one person from another person.\"\n\nSome enter the room campaigning for those they played with, coached, worked alongside or covered as a member of the media. Vecsey says when he was a voter in the immediate years after receiving the Hall's Curt Gowdy Media Award in 2009, he campaigned for Dennis Rodman, who was inducted in 2011. Other voters say they, too, campaigned for certain eligible members.\n\n\"Sometimes you feel very strongly about a person that you might not even know that well, but you just know their impact on the game,\" says another former voter. \"And it doesn't go your way. But you respect why it didn't.\"\n\nSome attendees -- which include Colangelo and Doleva -- are talkative, others less so. But there are plenty of stories, as players will share what it was like playing against eligible players, or coaches will share what it was like coaching that player, and on and on.\n\n\"There's a lot of room for mischief,\" a tongue-in-cheek Vecsey says. But Vecsey and all former voters who spoke with ESPN say they believe that, despite any criticisms of their own or beliefs that there should be transparency, the vote, ultimately, is fair.\n\n\"I think the vote is fair,\" Vecsey says. \"Jerry has a say like everybody else in the room. But he doesn't have more to say.\"\n\n\"It sounds byzantine. It probably wouldn't pass a Supreme Court muster.\"\n\nDoleva and Matt Zeysing, a historian and curator at the hall, help create lists of potential voters for all the committees, then the list is presented to Colangelo for final approval. Voters serve staggered three-year terms, so the voting committees turn over regularly.\n\n\"We always try to keep up the appropriate representation -- male, female, Hall of Famers, coaches, etc.,\" Colangelo says. \"We like how we balance this thing off so that each segment of the basketball world is represented.\"\n\nAfter the screening committee finishes its vote, the finalists are then reviewed by the Hall's board of trustees, and according to the hall's site, \"At this time, should it be determined by the Board of Trustees that a Finalist has damaged the integrity of the game of basketball, he/she shall be deemed not worthy of Enshrinement and removed from consideration.\"\n\nThe topic of off-court issues does come up, several voters say.\n\n\"To the best of my recollection, or the time I've been involved, there's only been a few cases where that's even been a conversation,\" Colangelo says. \"We don't have a lot of individuals who have checkered pasts as it relates to personal conduct and things like that. But everything is always discussed.\"\n\nThere is always a question of what qualifies one to be a Hall of Famer: What is the criteria? To Colangelo, the answer is simply their \"body of work,\" which leaves room for interpretation.\n\n\"That becomes sort of a discussion point -- of what he would think as a Hall of Famer might not be what somebody else might not think as a Hall of Famer,\" says one former voter.\n\nSays another former voter, \"I look at who's in the hall. You use that as your bar.\"\n\nSome voters say the ambition to represent the entire sport can make it challenging when, say, a high school coach they're unaware of becomes eligible. Others say the votes at times are more representative of NBA success.\n\n\"Everything was basically being judged on your NBA career,\" one former voter says.\n\nWith voting, several who spoke to ESPN say the biggest dilemma is that some years are so stacked with obvious choices -- such as two years ago, when Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett were all up for election for the first time -- that it blocks out other deserving candidates. (In the case of 2020, that was Chris Bosh, another first-year-eligible player who had to wait until 2021 to get the call.)\n\nVoters told ESPN that some Hall of Famers -- like Michael Jordan -- are no brainers, while others generate hours of debate among the voting committee. Jim Rogash/Getty Images\n\n\"There's always some of you out there that some people will say, 'Well, how could he not get in the Hall of Fame?'\" Colangelo says. \"My response is, well, thus far, that's true. That doesn't mean it's not going to happen.\"\n\nThe committee also walks a fine line on the urgency to induct deserving members before they die or become compromised by health issues that prevent them from even speaking during their induction process.\n\n\"Why not sooner than later?\" says one official affiliated with the hall. \"Why drag it out? Some of these guys get in after they die. Why not let them enjoy it now?\"\n\nSays Vecsey, \"There's nothing worse to me than getting an award posthumously.\"\n\nLarry Costello, an NBA champion as a player (1967) and a coach (1971), is being inducted this year as a contributor after he died in 2001. Vecsey plans to attend the ceremony in honor of Costello, who will be represented by family.\n\n\"That is a sad thing,\" Colangelo says of those being inducted posthumously. \"I don't know of any solution. You can't just say, 'Well this guy may die in three years, so we've got to get him in.'\"\n\nIT WAS A Monday morning in Denver when George Karl got the call this year. He was told it would come whether he was inducted or not. Karl says he hadn't wondered too much about going into the hall during his 27-season NBA coaching career, but when he crossed the 1,000-win mark -- something only 10 NBA coaches have done -- he started to hear from friends, family and colleagues that he might be next in line. But he didn't want to think about it too much or even look into how it all worked too carefully.\n\n\"I thought if I studied the process, I would jinx it,\" Karl says.\n\nGeorge Karl will be enshrined as part of the Basketball Hall of Fame's Class of 2022. AP Photo/Seth Wenig\n\nHe did find himself asking some questions about the process to former NBA head coach Don Nelson, who was inducted in 2012, when the two would golf together.\n\nThis year, the call came from Doleva, who told Karl he was one of the members of the Class of 2022. Karl, who is 71, was elated, quiet, reflective. He called friends and family, and he says he later found out that Gary Payton, whom Karl coached in Seattle, was a voter this year and \"was really prominent in getting me elected,\" Karl says. (Colangelo and Doleva declined comment regarding whether Payton was or has been a voter.)\n\nKarl last coached in the NBA in 2016. His Hall of Fame wait was seven years, which is nothing compared to Spencer Haywood, a 1980 NBA champion, four-time NBA All-Star, 1970 ABA MVP and Olympic gold medalist.\n\n\"My waiting process was 27 years,\" says Haywood, who was inducted in 2015 after retiring in 1983. \"I was a finalist three times. Each time I didn't get in, I was hurt, crushed, feeling bad and not knowing why. But I stayed the course.\"\n\nHaywood, who averaged 20.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in an NBA and ABA career that spanned from 1969 to 1983, says he never got an explanation of what took so long, and he figured, at one point, that if it didn't happen, so be it, because his career had always been unusual anyway. Maybe it was payback, in a way?\n\n\"Because when you sue the NBA and the NCAA all the way to the Supreme Court\" -- as Haywood did in 1970, winning a case that challenged eligibility rules and changed the course of the NBA -- \"you're gonna catch some hell,\" Haywood says.\n\nIt's your league. Run it how you want. Choose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to follow in order to create the fantasy basketball league you want to play in. Create your custom league for free!\n\nDuring his wait, Haywood says he didn't lose hope, as he looked to former South Africa president Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned from 1962 until 1990.\n\n\"He had 27 years in the hole,\" Haywood says, \"and he never lost hope.\"\n\nOn the other side of the waiting spectrum is Dick Barnett, a two-time NBA champion with the New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973, two-time NBA All-Star and a three-time NAIA champion at Tennessee A&I (now Tennessee State University).\n\nBarnett, who will turn 86 on Oct. 2, has been inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame, the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame and the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2019, the Naismith Hall of Fame inducted Barnett's Tennessee A&I teams of 1957, 1958 and 1959.\n\nBut he is still waiting for a call as a player.\n\n\"I think that whole process has been tremendously compromised,\" says Barnett, whose No. 12 was retired by the Knicks in 1990. \"Are they going by players' abilities and records and accomplishments? Because Dick Barnett should've been in the Hall of Fame 50 years ago.\"\n\nAt this point, Barnett has lost several teammates, and time isn't on his side.

Her legacy in the W was honored this past summer, when she was named to the W25 list, honoring the greatest 25 players in the league history, along with four other Lynx.\n\nWhalen joins the legendary Katie Smith \u2014 who is currently the associate head coach of the Lynx \u2014 as the only two Lynx players in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame.\n\nOver her WNBA career, Whalen was selected to five All-Star teams, five All-WNBA teams, and etched her name in the record books of several important categories.\n\nThe University of Minnesota legend has won more games in the WNBA (307) than any other player in league history, is third all-time in career assists with 2,345, and holds top 10 marks in free throws made (1,407 \u2014 ninth all-time), games played (480 \u2014 sixth), win shares (59.8 \u2014 seventh).\n\nWhere Whalen truly sets herself apart is in her playoff performance. Whalen\u2019s 341 assists are most in WNBA playoff history, while her 953 points rank fifth all-time, and her playoff record of 40-16 (71.4%) with the Lynx speaks for itself. No player in the history of the league has played more playoff basketball than Wheezy, either. Her 82 playoff games played is one more than fellow Lynx, and current Lynx assistant coach, Rebekkah Brunson.\n\nWhile a member of the Minnesota Lynx, Whalen won four championships (2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017) and was an integral part of stamping the Lynx as one of the greatest dynasties in WNBA history and the franchise as the league-wide standard other teams aspire to reach.\n\nWhalen\u2019s No. 13 jersey hangs in the rafters, right where it belongs, at the Target Center and at Mohegan Sun Arena, where she was a standout player for the Connecticut Sun prior to joining the Lynx in 2010.\n\nIn addition to her tremendous accomplishments as a WNBA player, Whalen was named a EuroLeague All-Star in 2008, 2009, and 2010 for her play overseas during the W\u2019s offseason, and won the EuroCup championship in 2013-14 as a member of Dynamo Moscow.\n\nThe trusted floor general also took to the court for her country. Whalen was a core member of the 2012 and 2016 United States Olympic teams, which both captured gold medals. Prior to that, she won gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 FIBA World Championship for USA Basketball, and captured golds at the 2002 FIBA U20 World Championship and 2003 FIBA U21 World Championships.\n\nBefore Whalen went pro, she but Minnesota basketball on the map. A four-year standout at the University of Minnesota, Whalen helped the Golden Gophers to a 80-43 record over her stellar career. She fueled Minnesota to three NCAA tournaments, culminating with a Sweet 16 appearance in 2003 and the program\u2019s first trip to the Final Four in 2004.\n\nWhalen was the Big Ten Player of the Year in 2002, a three-time All-American, and first-team All-Big Ten in her sophomore, junior and senior years. She held the program\u2019s scoring record with 2,285 for nearly two decades before current Lynx guard Rachel Banham broke it in 2018.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, Whalen was introduced as the head coach of her alma mater, a position she still holds.\n\nLater that year, Whalen announced her retirement from professional basketball. This photo says it all. Standing beside the coach she credits as one of her greatest influences, her indelible mark on the franchise she helped Cheryl Reeve build comes in the form of four WNBA championship trophies behind her.\n\nWhalen walked away as one of the game\u2019s greatest players.\n\nShe left behind an iconic, homegrown winning legacy that will never, ever be matched, and inspired a generation of young girls and boys who grew up dreaming they could achieve anything on the basketball court.\n\nFrom the moment the four-time all-state player from Hutchinson stepped on the floor at Williams Arena as a Gopher in 2000, all the way to her walking off that raised floor for the final time as player a four-time WNBA champion in 2017, and everywhere in between, Lindsay Whalen has taken Minnesota on the basketball ride of a lifetime.\n\nThat ride now includes a stop in Springfield, Massachusetts at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, an honor Whalen so richly deserves.\n\nWe\u2019re all witnesses to the greatest athlete in the history of this proud state.\n\nFor giving us Minnesota kids the opportunity to grow up knowing what it\u2019s like to look up to homegrown greatness, thank you, Whay. The game is forever changed.\n\nCongratulations, Hall of Famer!"}]}
