Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.\n\nWith speeds that can reach over 90 mph, luge is one of the most dangerous sports at the Olympic Games.\n\nAccidents and injuries are common during competition.\n\nTwelve years ago, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died before the Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics after losing control of his sled on a training run and hitting a steel pole that was unpadded.\n\nThe International Luge Federation conducted an investigation where they determined that human error was the cause of the deadly training run crash. While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport. Austria\u2019s 22 total luge medals are the most in Olympic history for a non-German country.\n\nGerman Natalie Geisenberger is the two-time defending Olympic champion in women\u2019s singles entering Beijing and has continued her dominance in the sport with four world championship medals since the last Winter Olympics."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/20/luge-death-winter-olympics-report", "page_content": "The death of the Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who was killed during a training run at the Vancouver Olympics, was not caused by one single event, the International Luge Federation said yesterday.\n\nKumaritashvili lost control and slammed into an exposed steel pillar during his last training run at the Whistler Sliding Centre on 12 February, hours before the Games' opening ceremony. His death was the first of a luger in competition since 1975.\n\n\"What happened to Nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident,\" said the FIL secretary general, Svein Romstad, in a statement.\n\n\"After an in-depth analysis we concluded that there was no single reason, but a complex series of interrelated events which led to this tragedy.\"\n\nThe report said Kumaritashvili's run appeared normal until he was exiting curve 15. \"At that time Nodar appears to have hung on to the curve too long,\" it said.\n\n\"This resulted in him being sent to the right-hand side of the straightaway (going into curve 16) when he steered the sled out of that curve instead of being left of centre on the straightaway which is the preferred positioning going into curve 16.\n\n\"Nodar appears to have hit the wall at an exceptional angle that caused the sled to compress rather than break or bounce off. This resulted in the sled serving as a catapult when it decompressed launching him and the sled into the air.\"\n\nIt said that this \"catapult effect\" of the sled sent the luger over the wall on to the outside of the track.\n\n\"Due to the unusual behaviour of the sled at the moment of impact, the sled was inspected by both the police and FIL experts to determine if there were any deficiencies in sled construction.\"\n\nThe inspection showed the sled met all construction criteria.\n\nAn initial governing body report a day after the crash put the blame on human error by the 21-year-old and the Olympic competitions went ahead, although the starting spot was lowered to reduce the speed of the fast track and a wall was erected to cover the pillars.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has said it had a moral responsibility but not a legal one, with the federation and organisers responsible for the construction of the track and the staging of competitions."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/2.722/georgian-luger-dies-in-crash-1.891276", "page_content": "Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died Friday in a horrific crash in an Olympic training run at Whistler, B.C., just hours before the Games opening ceremony.\n\nKumaritashvili was coming around the final 270-degree turn, where speeds approach 140 kilometres an hour, when he flipped off his sled and flew into a metal pole.\n\nMedics administered CPR to the 21-year-old from Borjomi, Georgia, before he was lifted into an ambulance. An air-rescue helicopter arrived eight minutes after the crash.\n\nCurve 16 to be altered Olympic officials have decided to make some changes to the track at the Whistler Sliding Centre following the death of Nodar Kumaritashvili.

The IOC is in deep mourning,\" he said. \"Here you have a young athlete who lost his life in pursuing his passion. He had a dream to participate in the Olympic Games, he trained hard, and had this fatal accident.\n\n\"I have no words to say what we feel.\"\n\nRogge said the IOC had been in touch with Kumaritashvili's family, and that he had a conversation with Mikheil Saakashvili, the president of the Georgia, who is attending the Games.\n\nJohn Furlong, the CEO of the organizing group VANOC, shared Rogge's sentiments.\n\n\"We are heartbroken beyond words to be sitting here,\" Furlong said. \"It's not something that I had prepared for, or ever thought I would need to be prepared for.\"\n\nFurlong expressed his condolences to the friends and family of Kumaritashvili, \"who came to Vancouver to follow his Olympic dream.\"\n\nVANOC will conduct a complete investigation, he said.\n\n\"The accident is tragic. It will be investigated, and when we know the substance of what happened, you will know it.\"\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili was speeding around the final 270-degree turn at 140 kms an hour when he flipped off his sled. ((The New York Times))\n\nAs mark of respect for their \"fallen comrade,\" the Georgian Olympic team will still compete in the Vancouver Games, Georgian Sport and Culture Minister Nicholas Rurua told a Vancouver media conference later Friday.\n\nDick Pound, Canada's senior IOC member, told CBC News: \"The Games go on with a little bit of a cloud and sorrow. And I think what to do in luge is analyze this and say, 'Are we making the tracks too demanding for athletes or is it one of these things that, because there's a high risk in a lot of these winter sports, it was just not his day?\"\n\nKumaritashvili went high in the corner, banking left, near the finish of the run. His sled swooped out from under him and he rocketed through the air, turning backward as he launched into a thick metal pillar that supports the canopy above the finish area.\n\nThere was a collective gasp on the finish dock from officials and athletes as the crash was beamed on the large-screen TVs. The screens were immediately turned off as crews raced to Kumaritashvili.\n\nMedics were seen performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the Georgian, his helmet still on, face up on the concrete beside the track and the ambulance. Track officials then ordered all bystanders away.\n\nMedics administered CPR to the bloodied Kumaritashvili before he was loaded into an ambulance. An air-rescue helicopter arrived eight minutes after the crash and the slider was taken to a medical facility at the athletes' village south of Whistler.\n\nVideo of the crash was posted on YouTube \u2014 but was quickly removed.\n\nAlpine skier Brad Spence of Calgary wrote on Twitter: \"My thoughts and condolences go out to the family and friends of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. What a tragedy.\"\n\nKumaritashvili was a relatively inexperienced luger. He had competed in five World Cup races this season, finishing 44th in the world standings.\n\nIt was his second crash during training for the Vancouver Games. He also failed to finish his second of his six practice runs.\n\n\"Half the time in luge, people are shaking their heads and saying, 'You're heading down this track, feet first, in something you can't really steer \u2014 isn't that crazy?' But in kind of a funny way. And now you realize there's a huge degree of skill and risk involved,\" said Pound.\n\nConcerns over sliding track\n\n\"This is the first time we've seen this. It's very sad,\" said Canadian luge team coach Wolfgang Staudinger, who was in the finish area. He said he planned to meet with his team to discuss what happened.\n\nThe $105-million sliding centre, on the southeast face of Blackcomb Mountain, has been billed as a wild ride and the crash happened at its fastest point.\n\nThe 1,450-metre course has 16 turns and drops steeply for 152 metres, the longest drop of any track in the world. The average grade is about 11 per cent, including two stomach-inverting drops of 20 per cent.\n\nCanadian world champion skeleton racer Mellisa Hollingsworth has called the Whistler course the most challenging track in the world.\n\nIt was the second crash of the day on the course after defending Olympic champion Armin Zoeggeler of Italy lost control on the lower part of the track. He didn't appear to be injured. On Thursday, Romanian women's slider Violeta Stramaturaru crashed and had to be airlifted out.\n\nMore than a dozen athletes have crashed during Olympic training.\n\nHarper statement\n\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper expressed his condolences to the Georgian Olympic team and Kumaritashvili's family.\n\n\"All Canadians were deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of Georgian Olympic team member Nodar Kumaritashvili following a luge training accident in Whistler today.

The video has since been yanked from Internet sites like YouTube.\n\n\"He was sliding and it looked like it was a pretty good time into his practice session and he went flying over the wall into the air and then hit a post,\" said Kriesel. \"When he hit the post he didn't really bounce off that much, he just stayed where he was and then officials came over and tended to him.\"\n\nRescue workers performed chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation less than a minute after the crash, and then quickly airlifted the luger to a trauma center in Whistler.\n\nThe head of Georgia's delegation, Irakly Japaridze, said in a press conference this afternoon that the country's team stay and compete in the Winter games despite the tragedy, according to ESPN.\n\n\"We are all in deep shock,\" Japaridze said. Kumaritashvili died just hours before the opening ceremony, which was dedicated to him and the seven remaining members of the Georgian delegation, who wore black armbands as they marched behind a black-trimmed flag. Most of the crowd rose to give respectful applause. There were also plans to lower the Olympic and Canadian flags to half staff.\n\nMore than 50,000 ticket-holders packed into the stadium for the evening extravaganza, the first Olympic opening or closing ceremony ever held indoors.\n\nLuge Track at Winter Olympics Breathtakingly Fast\n\nA joint statement from the International Olympic Committee, the Games' organizing committee VANOC and the International Luge Federation offered condolences to the luger's family.\n\n\"The whole Olympic family is struck by this tragedy, which clearly casts a shadow over these Games,\" said IOC President Jacques Rogge.\n\nAt a press conference late Friday, Rogge became emotional, taking off his glasses to wipe away his tears.\n\n\"Sorry it's a bit difficult to remain composed,\" said Rogge, adding that now is not the time to \"talk about investigations.\"\n\nSpeaking for the International Luge Federation, President Josef Fendt called the accident, \"The gravest thing that can happen in sport.\"\n\nThe statement also confirmed that there is an investigation underway into the circumstances of the accident and that training has since been suspended.\n\nEven before Kumaritashvili's tragic accident there was criticism brewing of the high speeds the luge track allows athletes to reach. There was also question as to how the unusually warm temperatures may have impacted the safety of the luge tracks.\n\nBut Gonzalez said that despite what the critics say, the higher the temperature, the easier the track is on a luger beacuse the ice is \"softer and easier to navigate.\" He added that he believes the real safety problem is the height of the wall on the side of the luge, which he says is not tall enough.\n\nMore than a dozen athletes have crashed during training runs here, including four Americans.\n\nIt was just a year ago, the International Luge Federation President said that the wooden protective devices near the track's curb are too short and that they needed to be lengthened to keep lugers from flying off the track.\n\n\"I agree one hundred percent,\" said Gonzalez about the President's comments, \"My response is, why didn't they do it?\"\n\nAn Australian athlete said late today, the track is too much. \"To what extent are we just...crash test dummies?\" asked luger Hannah Campbell-Pegg. \"I mean, this is our lives.\"\n\nSome of other lugers said that the breathtaking speed of the track surprised them when they first rode it.\n\n\"The track is super fast and I'll tell you, when I first got here it felt like a blur,\" said American luger Tony Benshoof. \"It took me about 10 or 12 runs before it started slowing down in my mind.\"\n\nBenshoof estimated that he and his fellow lugers will \"hit 100 miles per hour during the race\" which even the thrill-seeker admitted would be \"very very fast.\"\n\n\"Pretty much from the top down you've got your hands full. There's a lot of really tricky corners,\" said Benshoof.\n\nBut American luger Erin Hamlin told ABC News Radio that speed is part of the sport.\n\n\"The reason we do this sport is to go fast,\" said Hamlin. \"I think I can say that for everyone, and you've got to have the extreme factor in there sometimes.

While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport.

(AP Photo/Sandra Skutane, File)\n\nLuge is Saba Kumaritashvili\u2019s family business. His great-grandfather is credited with bringing the sport to their homeland, the former Soviet republic of Georgia, more than a half-century ago. His father runs the national federation, as his relatives have for decades.\n\nAt home, his family is synonymous with sliding.\n\nAt the Olympics, his family is synonymous with sadness.\n\nHe qualified for the Beijing Games with hopes of changing that.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since his cousin, Nodar Kumaritashvili, died in a training accident at the Vancouver Games, a death that still haunts the sport, especially so every four years when the Olympics roll around and the memories get rekindled. Nodar was 21 when he would have made his Olympic debut; Saba is 21 now, about to make his Olympic debut.\n\nPut simply, Saba slides for his country. For his family. And for Nodar.\n\n\u201cEvery generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.\u201d\n\nIt is that strength that got him here, even while he knows that some in his family are nervous whenever he takes the ice because of what happened to his cousin.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili was killed Feb. 12, 2010, after losing control of his sled during a training run just hours before the Vancouver Games officially opened. He would have raced the next day, becoming the first in his family to compete on sliding\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nHis cousin now has that chance.\n\n\u201cI am happy and proud that I have opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said. \u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me. It\u2019s really big motivation, so I will try to do my best for them.\u201d\n\nThat is what Nodar Kumaritashvili was trying to do 12 years ago.\n\nThe crash happened at 10:50 a.m. on a Friday, with most people already turning their attention to the opening ceremony taking place that night. The Whistler, Canada, track has 16 curves, and Nodar Kumaritashvili appeared to lose control around the 13th turn. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces, which sent him careening along the ice-covered walls of the track. The last impact with one of those walls knocked him off his sled and sent him flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nHis body sailed over the wall of the track near the finish line, the back of his head striking a metal post outside of the track. Rescue workers got to him within seconds to no avail. He was pronounced dead after 59 minutes of resuscitation efforts, though a coroner\u2019s report later revealed his head injuries were so traumatic that he died instantly.\n\nHis last recorded speed was 89.4 mph (143.9 kph), which almost certainly was the fastest of his career. Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2014 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. ... I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident. An accident. These things happen in life and it\u2019s awful, but we can either live in fear from it or learn from it, grow from it and keep going. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s an excellent story.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with luge is believed to go back to at least the early 1970s when Aleko Kumaritashvili \u2014 \u201cmy great-grandfather laid the foundation for this sport,\u201d Saba said \u2014 oversaw the building of a short training track. Soviet officials helped build a more complete track around 1973, and Aleko Kumaritashvili served as the country\u2019s coach.\n\nIt has been part of the family makeup ever since. Saba and Nodar took similar paths to the Olympics; both were introduced to the sport by their family as kids, then got into international sliding and did enough to qualify for the Games despite not having World Cup circuit experience.\n\nSaba insists he is ready.\n\n\u201cI look at his story as what the Olympics are all about,\u201d Niccum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what life is about. It\u2019s what every motivational story there is talks about. It\u2019s perseverance. Forgetting about the past, the fears of the past, the tragedies of the past and looking forward, not living in fear or letting anything slow you down.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://www.cleveland.com/olympics/2010/02/olympics_luger_nodar_kumaritas.html", "page_content": "WHISTLER, British Columbia -- A men's Olympic luger from the former Soviet republic of Georgia died after a crash during training Friday, an Olympic official with direct knowledge of the crash said.\n\nThe official tells The Associated Press that the International Olympic Committee received confirmation of Nodar Kumaritashvili's death.

An air-rescue helicopter was summoned and was over the track about eight minutes after the crash.\n\nKumaritashvili struck the inside wall of the track on the final turn.

The track is considered the world's fastest and several Olympians recently questioned its safety. More than a dozen athletes have crashed during Olympic training.\n\nAt the finish area, not far from the crash scene, athletes, coaches and officials solemnly awaited word on Kumaritashvili.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Shiva Keshavan, a four-time Olympian from India. \"I'm afraid it's bad.\"\n\nTraining was suspended indefinitely, International Luge Federation members were called for a briefing and team captains from each nation were asked to attend a meeting.\n\nKumaritashvili competed in five World Cup races this season, finishing 44th in the world standings.\n\nEarlier in the day, gold-medal favorite Armin Zoeggeler of Italy crashed, losing control of his sled on Curve 11. Zoeggeler came off his sled and held it with his left arm to keep it from smashing atop his body. He slid on his back down several curves before coming to a stop and walking away.\n\nTraining days in Whistler have been crash-filled. A Romanian woman was briefly knocked unconscious and at least four Americans -- Chris Mazdzer on Wednesday, Megan Sweeney on Thursday and both Tony Benshoof and Bengt Walden on Friday in the same training session where Zoeggeler wrecked -- have had serious trouble just getting down the track.\n\n\"I think they are pushing it a little too much,\" Australia's Hannah Campbell-Pegg said Thursday night after she nearly lost control in training. \"To what extent are we just little lemmings that they just throw down a track and we're crash-test dummies?

He was given CPR on the site through a plastic tube, then lifted into an ambulance and rushed to Whistler Polyclinic as an emergency helicopter hovered above.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said after the accident that he was uncertain if Georgia's Olympic delegation would stay and participate in the Games, but at a press conference later in the day, Nikolos Rurua, minister of sport for Georgia, said the seven-member team will compete, and would march in Friday night's Opening Ceremony wearing commemorative black stripes on their arms and would place a black stripe on the Georgian flag.\n\nRogge also said an investigation into the luge venue was underway, but declined to elaborate about what steps might be taken. \"I will be ready to debate or deliberate with you about that at a proper time,\" said Rogge. \"I'm sorry but this is a time for sorrow. It is not a time to look for reasons. That will come in due time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGruesome replays of the crash were being shown all over Olympic venues Friday afternoon, dousing enthusiasm for the torch relay and the run-up to the opening ceremonies. Later, in an apparent effort at damage control, the IOC invoked its copyrights on the crash video and removed it from YouTube and several other Internet sites.\n\nEntering the out-run of the luge track, the 21-year-old Kumaritashvili went over the wall, crashed into the post and lay motionless. About 90 minutes after the crash, photographers and television crews milled about on the wet asphalt, able to take photographs of the scene of the accident. The location where Kumaritashvili met his gruesome end was at the end of the final turn of the track, where about 20 steel pillars support a canopy of corrugated metal. The pillars are each square in shape.\n\nA few hours after the accident, a group of six people in blue Olympic uniforms sat in a light drizzle on a concrete barrier just a few steps from where the accident occured, and were later seen talking to Canadian law enforcement officials while other uniformed officers kept a growing cluster of international television crews from getting closer to the track. By the time Olympic officials confirmed Kumaritashivili's death, access to the area near the death was more limited.\n\nTraining was suspended indefinitely and members of the International Luge Federation were called for a briefing. The head of Georgia's delegation, Irakly Japaridze, said after the accident that the Georgia team might withdraw from the Olympics, although the team decided later to compete. \"We are all in deep shock, we don't know what to do. We don't know whether to take part in (today's) opening ceremony or even the Olympic Games themselves,\" said Japaridze.\n\nJohn Furlong, the CEO of the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee, said at a press conference following the incident that he was \"heartbroken\" about Kumaritashvili's death.\n\n\"He came here to be able to feel what it's like to be able to call yourself an Olympian,\" Furlong said. \"The accident is tragic. It will be investigated, and when we know the substance of what happened, you will know it.\"\n\nThe British Columbia Coronrers Service, assisted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, is on site at Whistler Sliding Center conducting an investigation into the cause of the fatality. The track remains closed while both agencies conduct their investigations.\n\nThe Whistler Sliding Center has long had the reputation of a super-fast course, with sliders achieving blinding speeds above 90 mph. Lugers are easily ejected from their sleds at such speeds, which is what happened to Kumaritashvili, who had been competing for the Georgian national team for two years. Kumaritashvili was ranked only 44th in the world but, judging by other training crashes the past two days, expertise was not the problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere had been several other crashes on the luge course. A Romanian woman, Violeta Stramaturaru was knocked briefly unconscious on Thursday and taken to a hospital after slamming into a wall several times.\n\nAs investigators examine the scene of the accident, questions will almost certainly be asked about why organizers and engineers of the course allowed a competition to go on without any padding or fencing covering the metal pillars alongside the track. At the Alpine skiing venues across the valley, for instance, most of the boundaries of the racecourses are lined with sophisticated screens that ensure most racers who crash will slide down the hill and back onto the field of play rather than fly into the forests, chairlift towers, or other man-made structures.\n\nThe Pinstripe Express Weekly The Daily News sports editors handpick the week\u2019s best Yankees stories from our award-winning columnists and beat writers.

On other tracks in the world, too, they always work for higher safety.\"\n\nSchweiger said it would be hard for him and his colleagues to explain what happened to their athletes.\n\n\"It's not easy for anyone to tell such bad news,\" he said. \"We have no experience in saying such bad things.\"\n\nSeveral sliders, including four American lugers reported terrible troubles finishing the course, while the gold medal favorite, Armin Zoeggler of Italy, also crashed on his training run, coming off his sled and holding it with his left arm to keep it from hitting his body. He walked away from the crash on Blackcomb Mountain's southeast side.

There was also question as to how the unusually warm temperatures may have impacted the safety of the luge tracks.\n\nBut Gonzalez said that despite what the critics say, the higher the temperature, the easier the track is on a luger beacuse the ice is \"softer and easier to navigate.\" He added that he believes the real safety problem is the height of the wall on the side of the luge, which he says is not tall enough.\n\nMore than a dozen athletes have crashed during training runs here, including four Americans.\n\nIt was just a year ago, the International Luge Federation President said that the wooden protective devices near the track's curb are too short and that they needed to be lengthened to keep lugers from flying off the track.\n\n\"I agree one hundred percent,\" said Gonzalez about the President's comments, \"My response is, why didn't they do it?\"\n\nAn Australian athlete said late today, the track is too much. \"To what extent are we just...crash test dummies?\" asked luger Hannah Campbell-Pegg. \"I mean, this is our lives.\"\n\nSome of other lugers said that the breathtaking speed of the track surprised them when they first rode it.\n\n\"The track is super fast and I'll tell you, when I first got here it felt like a blur,\" said American luger Tony Benshoof. \"It took me about 10 or 12 runs before it started slowing down in my mind.\"\n\nBenshoof estimated that he and his fellow lugers will \"hit 100 miles per hour during the race\" which even the thrill-seeker admitted would be \"very very fast.\"\n\n\"Pretty much from the top down you've got your hands full.
