The popularity of his work overseas, especially in Asia, have established him as a top Hallyu star. While he is known for the serious roles he has done in dramas like Moon Lovers and Flower of Evil, his comedic role in Lawless Lawyer truly shows how great he is as an actor. He played the role of Bong Sang Pil, a former gangster turned lawyer who takes advantage of loopholes in the law and boasts an excellent win rate. Born in Kisung, but raised by his uncle Dae Woong in Seoul after his mother was killed. As a member of his uncle's gang, he became an excellent fighter. Prior to becoming a lawyer, he spent time in prison for his gang activity, he has lived a life of hardship. While now a lawyer, he is not afraid to use his fists and his old gang connections when needed for a case. He is defined by his desire to gain justice for his mother and his loyalty to Jae Yi. He trusts Jae Yi completely, even when his life, freedom, or work is on the line.\n\nHe is a South Korean singer and actor.

As an actor, he is best known for starring in the film The Attorney (2013), and the cable series Misaeng: Incomplete Life (2014), which were both successful in the box office and ratings. He is an extremely unique filmography, with some characters being introverted and straight-arrowed while others are twisted and of an antagonist like in the award winning Emergency Declaration. While investigating a terrorist threat that goes online, Korean authorities discover that a suspect has recently boarded a flight bound for the United States. When a healthy passenger on the same plane suddenly dies, panic erupts both in-flight and on the ground. With steadily decreasing fuel and international refusals to offer aid, the captain and crew take unprecedented emergency measures to save the lives of all on board. Seeing him in the film was such an experience when compared to his famous drama role in Run On, who was a sweet and heartwarming character.\n\nLee Min Ho\n\nLee Min Ho is a South Korean actor, singer, model, creative director and businessman.
