As long as they're chics, and not one.

Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that.

She was born in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents who named her Oluwaseyi Odedere. Seyi\u2019s father is an indigene of Ife (a town in Osun State, South West, Nigeria), which means the singer\u2019s ethnicity is Yoruba. However, her mother hails from one of the Northern states in Nigeria. Nothing much is known about her parents and siblings except that they lived in the United Kingdom for many years.\n\nSeyi spent her early years in England until she was 2 years of age when she started visiting her home country, Nigeria. She eventually relocated to Nigeria, where she completed her high school education at Command High School, Maryland, Lagos State. She holds a degree in music and business management, which she obtained from a local UK college and the University of East London, respectively.\n\nHer Family Has an Extensive Background in Music\n\nBeing born into a family with proximity to a certain profession could help you develop a special interest in it, gain inside knowledge, and even be privy to career-centered opportunities that others may not have access to. This is a true situation for Seyi Shay, who grew up among family members with a passion for music. Shay was raised by her single mother, who, as a Christian, was a church chorister. She has three siblings- two brothers, one of which was a prominent club and radio DJ in London, and a sister who used to compose songs for the BBC.\n\nIt took Seyi Shay only a few years to master some aspects of music, after which she decided to pursue a professional career in music. At the young age of six, Shay joined her secondary school choir to perform for the London Community Gospel Choir during their world tour, which included 13 cities in Japan. She was also a member of several musical groups over there. Her talent has also taken her to several cities in many countries, where she wowed the audience with her wonderful voice.\n\nHer participation in the competition further fueled her passion for pursuing music as a career. When it was time for Seyi to take up courses that would help her boost her career in music, she faced strong opposition from her mother, who wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. However, before her death, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nA Look At Seyi Shay\u2019s Breakthrough in the Music World\n\nBeing a successful female musician in a competitive industry dominated by men is not an easy feat. It requires talent, prowess, effort, expertise, and a lot of hard work, and Seyi Shay has proven she has all it takes to take over the music industry in her home country and beyond. Her music career started when she signed her first music deal with the record label No Apology, and afterward, formed a UK-based girl band called Boadicea in 2006. However, the group went their separate ways two years later.\n\nThe Nigerian-based artist became the group\u2019s lead vocalist after she won the highly-coveted \u201dFrom Above UK singing audition,\u201d which led to the group signing a deal with Matthew Knowles\u2019 management company and undergoing serious vocal and dance training. The girls also launched their own MTV reality show titled: \u201cBreaking From Above\u201d (it aired in over 166 countries worldwide) and were also present at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, where they presented an award to recipients.\n\nSeyi Shay later scored a recording deal with Sony and has continued to move from one level of success to another. Her return to Nigeria to pursue her music career was inspired by Nigerian rapper and singer Sound Sultan, who she met in London in 2011. After listening to her demos, Sultan convinced her to relocate to Nigeria and pursue her musical career. Under Cecil Hammond\u2019s record label Fly time Music, Seyi was able to launch her solo career in Nigeria and promote her brand. The superstar\u2019s debut album \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d was released in 2015, while her second studio album titled: \u201cElectric Package\u201d followed in 2018.\n\nSeyi Shay\u2019s most famous hits include: Loving Your Way\n\nNo Le Le\n\nIrawo\n\nIrawo (Remix) ft Vector\n\nChante ft Ajuju\n\nRight Now\n\nAlele, ft DJ Consequence and Flavour N\u2019abania\n\nKo Ma Roll ft Harmonize\n\nSurrender ft Kizz Daniel\n\nAir brush\n\nPack and Go ft Olamide\n\nYour Matter ft Eugy ft Efosa\n\nWeekend Vibes Remix ft Sarkodie\n\nYolo Yolo\n\nGimme Love ft Runtown\n\nKilin Me Softly ft Timaya\n\nChairman ft Kcee\n\nRagga Ragga\n\nMurda ft Patoranking and Shaydee\n\nHer Awards and Recognitions\n\nIn addition to gaining a huge fan base, Seyi Shay has also received awards for a job well done in most of his hit songs.

She is beautiful but it is her talent behind the mic that has made the name Seyi Shay a most valuable brand.\n\nSeyi Shay was born Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua on 21 December 1985. She was born in the United Kingdom of Nigerian parents. You might be aware of these. How much more of the star do you know? Here are all the facts about the star summed into five sizzling things.\n\n1. Men see her as a sex symbol\n\nIf you are a man, as long as you know the name Seyi Shay, you have considered her a sex symbol at some point in your life whether you remember doing so or not, whether you have actually done so or not does not count, you are a man. Guilty, as charged. Or, at least, that is how the artiste implied it.\n\nIn an interview with Kemi Lawal of Punch Newspaper in early 2013, Seyi Shay was asked the cause of her success. She attributed it to four things. One, hard work; two, experience; three, God. Then she crowned her list by saying: \u201cI am a female, but men will always see me as a sex symbol.\u201d Suggesting that this is why she was an easy sell on stage. \u201cThere is a lot of sexism and bias in the industry,\u201d she, however, lamented.\n\n2. Seyi is from a family of entertainers\n\nShay is a singer; a songwriter who has written lyrics for Konami\u2019s video game, Chip, Melanie, Columbia Records, etc. She is also a producer. She is gifted. This seems to be in her blood as her family is made of music stars. Her mother was a chorister, Shay had a sister who composed songs for TV and a brother who was a DJ.\n\nSee facts about the amazing Simi\n\nThough she is from an entertaining family, her mother was not very keen about her taking music professionally, at first. But on her deathbed, she had a few words for her daughter. Put God first and do your music in Nigeria.\n\n3. Seyi Shay was established in the UK\n\nYou might have only recently heard of Seyi Shay when she arrived in Nigeria, leading people, in some quarters, to say, Sound Sultan discovered her. This might be akin to Mungo Park discovering the Niger that has been among Nigerians for centuries. Seyi Shay met Sound Sultan in 2011. Before now, she was aware of her talent and had already been part of music groups and endeavors in the UK; the London Community Gospel Choir been the most notable. She had toured Japan and Europe and America (with Matthew Knowles and sometimes with Beyonce in their entourage). She was a member of the musical group, Boadicea, a group so popular they had a reality show, \u201cBreaking from Above\u201d, showing on MTV to 166 countries.\n\nHow did Sound Sultan discover someone who had been in the industry for so long and had worked with a name so famous? While Seyi was singing in the UK, very few were aware of her in Nigeria. Her relocation to Nigeria was a blessing and Sound Sultan played a major role in making that happen. There is also a special sentiment to this regards, as her mother\u2019s last wish on earth just a day before she passed away was for her daughter to return to Nigeria.\n\nSeyi Shay met Sultan in early 2011 and he helped convince her to return home.\n\n4. Seyi Shay says she is done acting\n\nShe is beautiful, she has a voice of gold, she has strong name recognition and following, all the kind of assets many producers will kill for. So Seyi Shay found herself on the set as the lead character of Lara Giwa in the film, \u201cLara and the Beats\u201d which hit cinemas in July 2018. \u201cThis is very special for me,\u201d Seyi said after shooting the video directed by Tosin Coker and produced by Tolu Olusoga for Biola Alabi Media.\n\nWhile Seyi is proud of her performance in the star-studded film that has Chioma Chukwuka, Uche Jombo, Chinedu Ikedieze and DJ Xclusive, she told The Sun Newspaper that she won\u2019t do it again. \u201cI was a bit worried about spending so much time outside the music scene,\u201d she said, adding that, \u201cI had to leave my singing career for about a month and I lost some shows.\u201d\n\nThe singer recounts how she had moments of regrets on the set of the movie. After sighing and heaving about her future as a thespian, she suggested she might do it again with the Biola Alabi production. Her last word but a contrast of the implications of her earlier words.\n\n5. Seyi Shay eats anything\n\nShe has a good figure for video and dreams. She should be starving, you say. Far from it, she isn\u2019t. There is no beauty routine for the diva, at least not when it is related to food. \u201cI eat anything I like,\u201d she told Punch. Her reason is simple: \u201cFood is meant to be eaten.\u201d How does she keep the junks off her system? She goes to the gym and works it off, she says. When she has time.\n\nIn the end, there is one conclusion, Seyi\u2019s body can be counted among her many gifts."}], "Seyi Shay is a singer.": [{"url": "https://www.legit.ng/1394704-seyi-shay-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-songs.html", "page_content": "Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua Odedere, popularly known by her stage name as Seyi Shay, is a famous Nigerian R&B singer, songwriter, recording artist, stage performer, model, and a philanthropist.

I had my ring on and everything \u2013 people thought it was a fashion ring or something but it was actually an engagement ring \u2013 and then a few months later we broke up.\u201d\n\nExplaining the reasons why the relationship ended, she revealed:\n\n\u201cWe were already arguing about the whole wedding; there is a lot of stress when you are planning a wedding and I think somewhere in that all process, our relationship started to break down. Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that. There is a type of glory that marriage gives you and your relationship as a woman or man and that is beyond the contract or the things you say to each other or the number of people in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nSeyi Shay quotes\n\nHere are some of her famous quotes\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t realize it, you are always moving forward and evolving.

She was born in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents who named her Oluwaseyi Odedere. Seyi\u2019s father is an indigene of Ife (a town in Osun State, South West, Nigeria), which means the singer\u2019s ethnicity is Yoruba. However, her mother hails from one of the Northern states in Nigeria. Nothing much is known about her parents and siblings except that they lived in the United Kingdom for many years.\n\nSeyi spent her early years in England until she was 2 years of age when she started visiting her home country, Nigeria. She eventually relocated to Nigeria, where she completed her high school education at Command High School, Maryland, Lagos State. She holds a degree in music and business management, which she obtained from a local UK college and the University of East London, respectively.\n\nHer Family Has an Extensive Background in Music\n\nBeing born into a family with proximity to a certain profession could help you develop a special interest in it, gain inside knowledge, and even be privy to career-centered opportunities that others may not have access to. This is a true situation for Seyi Shay, who grew up among family members with a passion for music. Shay was raised by her single mother, who, as a Christian, was a church chorister. She has three siblings- two brothers, one of which was a prominent club and radio DJ in London, and a sister who used to compose songs for the BBC.\n\nIt took Seyi Shay only a few years to master some aspects of music, after which she decided to pursue a professional career in music. At the young age of six, Shay joined her secondary school choir to perform for the London Community Gospel Choir during their world tour, which included 13 cities in Japan. She was also a member of several musical groups over there. Her talent has also taken her to several cities in many countries, where she wowed the audience with her wonderful voice.\n\nHer participation in the competition further fueled her passion for pursuing music as a career. When it was time for Seyi to take up courses that would help her boost her career in music, she faced strong opposition from her mother, who wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. However, before her death, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nA Look At Seyi Shay\u2019s Breakthrough in the Music World\n\nBeing a successful female musician in a competitive industry dominated by men is not an easy feat. It requires talent, prowess, effort, expertise, and a lot of hard work, and Seyi Shay has proven she has all it takes to take over the music industry in her home country and beyond.
