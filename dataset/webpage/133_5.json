Brown\u2019s name in a major league box score. But in his way, he is as much a part of baseball lore as the Gas House Gang, the Whiz Kids, and the House That Ruth Built.\n\nJoe E. Brown was a movie star: a wide-mouthed co\u00ad median whose face was his fortune. The zenith of his popularity came in the 1930s, when he appeared in a se\u00adries of hit comedies produced by Warner Bros. Three of them-Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer the Great (1933), and Alibi Ike (1935)-featured Joe E. as comical baseball players. Moreover, Brown was around the game all his life. He played baseball. He loved baseball. And he was a vigorous proponent of the game.\n\nJoseph Evan Brown was born on July 28, 1892, in Holgate, a small town in northwestern Ohio. His parents were warm and loving but desperately poor, and young Joe E. was determined to abandon his roots and embrace a life of adventure. \u201cI remember when I was a little guy going to school, stopping to look at a big 24-inch sheet announcing the arrival of the circus,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cAnother boy was with me. I pointed to the aerial act and said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u2019 I remember it clearly. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to be.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u201d\u2018\n\nAnd so, at the age of nine, Joe E. lived out what for other youngsters would be a storybook fantasy as he left home to join the circus. He became the junior member of The Five Marvelous Ashtons, an acrobatic act that toured the country performing under big tops and in vaudeville theaters. He earned $1.50 a week for the honor of being tossed through the air, and often being bloodied. As he grew into adolescence, Brown developed into a solidly proficient acrobat. While playing a date in San Francisco, he experienced firsthand the 1906 earthquake. It was around this time that he linked up with acrobats Tommy Bell and Frank Prevost and became the junior member of the Bell-Prevost Trio, a vaudeville act.\n\nDuring this period Brown managed to play baseball whenever he could. He wrote in his autobiography, Laughter Is a Wonderful Thing, that his passion for the game \u201cpredates my first days at school, of that I\u2019 m sure, so it probably began when I learned to walk.\u201d In his youth, he explained, he\n\nbegan haunting the knotholes around big league ball parks when 1 wasn\u2019t on stage or practicing. And in the spring, after a season of sore ankles, skinned wrists, and broken legs, baseball as a career held more than a casual interest for me.\n\nIn 1908, Brown decided that he would seek summer employment as a ballplayer. Tim Flood, manager of the St. Paul Saints in the American Association, signed him as a second sacker, but his season ended abruptly when he broke his leg while sliding into third base. During the next few summers he played for various semipro teams in the Toledo, OH, area, including the Crowley All-Stars, Young Avondales, and Needham\u2019s All-Stars. One of the many baseball-related photos printed in his autobiography features a serious-looking Brown, with arms folded, garbed in a Crowley All-Stars uniform and posing with a dozen teammates.\n\nIn 1911, when he was 19, Brown was offered a Boston Red Sox contract. At the time, he also had a lucrative offer to appear in a burlesque show. He already had spent a decade in show business, and realized that his best chance for long-term success was on the stage. So burlesque won out over baseball.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1915, Brown wed Kathryn Frances McGraw. The couple eventually became the parents of two sons and two adopted daughters. As Joe E. now had a family to support, his career choice was appropriate given his now-steady employment on the stage. By this time, he had morphed from acrobat to comic actor. On occasion, he even incorporated baseball into his stage act. The New York Times described one such routine, in which \u201ca young pitcher [is] harried by batters, umpires and base runners.\u201d Brown often quipped that he\n\nonce had a major league job. The manager wanted me to play third base. He said that ifT couldn\u2019t reach the ball with my hands, I would open my mouth and catch it between my teeth. I tried it once and darn near swallowed the ball.\n\nHis Great White Way debut came in Jim Jam Jems (1920), and he spent the decade as a headliner appearing on Broadway and touring in stage shows. But he was not through playing baseball. In 1920, Brown worked out and appeared in exhibition games with the Red Sox.\n\nThroughout his career, newspaper or magazine pro\u00ad files of Brown invariably cited his love of baseball-and his talent for playing the game. As far back as March 1921, the Boston Globe reported that Brown \u201chas recently received an offer from the New York Americans to play with the team this year.\u201d The actor added,\n\nAt one time I played [semipro ball in Toledo], but an accident to my arm made it necessary for me to give it up. Since then I have received many offers to go back into baseball but it would be rather foolish alter I had started a successful career on the stage.\n\nWhile a fine athlete \u2014 his athleticism is ever apparent in his baseball films, as he tosses balls and belts line drives without the aid of special effects or body dou\u00adbles \u2014 it is debatable whether Brown possessed the talent to sustain a major league career. During a moment of candor in a 1937 interview, he even admitted, \u201c[There] are a lot of stories about my baseball playing, but most of my big-league experiences happened in the imagina\u00adtion of various writers.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s celebrity status, however, did allow him to maintain his insider access to major leaguers. On April 18, 1922, the Boston Globe reported, \u201cThe Red Sox and Yankees occupied boxes last night at \u2018Greenwich Village Follies\u2019 at the Shubert Theatre as guests of Joe E. Brown, the principal comedian in the show.\u201d The item concluded by noting that Brown \u201cwas formerly a profes\u00adsional baseball player.\u201d\n\nBy this time Brown\u2019s calling card was his face rather than his physical aptitude. A Boston Globe profile of the comic began: \u2018\u201dDid you ever see anything so funny as that man\u2019s expression,\u2019 exclaimed a woman in the audi\u00adence at the Wilbur Theatre\u2026 as she gazed upward at Joe E. Brown, comedian of\u2019 Jim Jam Jems.\u201d\u2018 The article continued, \u201cHe has a comic style particularly his own, and not the least part of his success is the expression of his countenance. He doesn\u2019t have to say a word to get a laugh.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the nature of Brown\u2019s comedy primarily was physical-and it was a wonder that he did not become a silent cinema comedian. His screen debut did not come until the dawn of the sound era, in Crooks Can\u2019t Win (1928), an inauspicious melodrama. He quickly established himself, however, upon signing a Warner Bros. contract and appearing in a series of come\u00ad dies in which he alternately played two character types, both of whom were rubes. One was self-centered, with a mouth that was figuratively and literally big. The other was more shy and naive.\n\nBrown\u2019s three baseball films were especially popular. The first was Fireman, Save My Child, in which he starred as \u201cSmokey\u201d Joe Grant, an absentminded, Rube Waddell\u00ad like small-town firefighter whose pitching prowess earns him a spot with the St. Louis Cardinals. Just as he was starting his screen career, Brown had been cast in the road production of Elmer the Great, Ring Lardner and George M. Cohan\u2019s stage comedy about a none-too\u00ad bright hurler (originally played by Walter Huston) which opened on Broadway in 1928. Jack Oakie starred in the first screen version, titled Fast Company (1929). Brown was tapped for the remake, in which his character, Elmer Kane, is a small-town rube/home run hitter who plays for the Chicago Cubs and falls for a flighty actress. Finally, in Alibi Ike, Brown played Frank X. Farrell, a fireballing Cubs rookie right hander who is as brash and overconfident as he is talented.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. decided to sign him to a contract, Brown asked the studio to provide him with his own baseball team. It was written into his contract that Warner Bros. would pay for the team\u2019s uniforms, equip\u00adment, and travel expenses. The ball club was named Joe E. Brown\u2019s First National All-Stars; it consisted of studio employees and former professional players, and was pitted against all-star, semipro, college, and Negro League nines up and down the Pacific Coast. Decades later, Brown described the contract as a \u201cpip.\u201d\n\nAs he settled into his Hollywood lifestyle, the come\u00addian was at the epicenter of Southern California baseball. In February 1932, he and Buster Keaton-another screen star whose love for baseball was legendary-were involved in an all-star fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Olympic games. Over 8,500 fans packed Wrigley Field to see the Joe E. Browns defeat the Buster Keatons, 10-3. Rogers Hornsby, Gabby Hartnett, Paul and Lloyd Waner, Sam Crawford, Billy Jurges, Stan Hack, Tris Speaker, Dave Bancroft, Carl Hubbell, Charlie Root, Pat Malone, Johnny Moore, and Pie Traynor were a few of the big leaguers who participated.\n\nBrown also was instrumental in getting his baseball pals parts in movies. Frank Shellenback had a supporting role in Fireman, Save My Child; Shellenback and a roster full of ballplayers (Herman \u201cHi\u201d Bell, Guy Cantrell, Dick Cox, Cedric Durst, Ray French, Mike Gazella, Wally Hebert, Wally Hood, Don Hurst, Smead Jolley, Lou Koupal, Wes Kingdon, Jim Levey, Bob Meusel, Wally Rehg, Jim Thorpe, and Ed Wells) appear as big leaguers in Alibi Ike.\n\nIn 1934, a Los Angeles Times reporter asked Brown, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really ask Dizzy and Daffy Dean to accept a picture contract, did you?\u201d His response:\n\nWhy not? They\u2019re fine boys, interesting, natural, lovely characters. When I was sitting next to Dizzy in Detroit [during the World Series], with the fans swarming around him for autographs, he whispered, \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? Five years ago I didn\u2019t even own a pair of shoes.\u201d They\u2019re not swell-headed. Besides, Warners wired me to ask them\u2026\n\nThe Dean boys soon were starring in Dizzy and Daffy (1934), a Warner Bros. two-reel comedy short in which Shemp Howard (of the Three Stooges fame) remarks, \u201cThe only Dean I ever heard of is Gunga.\u201d\n\nBrown also reportedly-and inadvertently-played a more direct role in the \u201934 series. According to the Los Angeles Times, Detroit hurler Schoolboy Rowe \u201ccaught part of his pitching hand in a door jamb\u2026and subse\u00adquently had the bruise aggravated by a hearty good-luck hand-shake from Joe E. Brown, the film comedian.\u201d\n\nFrom 1932 through 1935, Brown was a part owner of the American Association Kansas City Blues. In 1935, the rumor circulated that he was considering purchasing the Boston Braves, but this came to naught. Brown organized a semi pro basketball team whose roster was stocked with ex-UCLA Bruins. He owned racehorses, and often could be found at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, and other Southern California racetracks. His Beverly Hills home housed a trophy room for his rapidly growing collection of autographed baseballs, bats, caps, and other sports memorabilia. He accumulated hundreds of items, from lumber used by Babe Ruth and Nap Lajoie and a cap worn by Eddie Collins to a baseball autographed by England\u2019s King George V, a football jersey worn by Red Grange, Gene Tunney\u2019s and James J. Braddock\u2019s boxing trunks, and a first-edition copy of Henry Chadwick\u2019s 1868 book, The Game ofBase Ball, the initial hardcover baseball tome. Alas, most of the memorabilia was destroyed later in a house fire.\n\nDecades later, Brown recalled that upon learning that Lou Gehrig was about to retire, he wrote the Iron Horse to request the ballplayer\u2019s first baseman\u2019s glove for his collection. \u201cLou wrote back, asking me to name anything but that, and I understood but I felt bad about having asked,\u201d he explained.\n\nNot long afterward, he retired. In the fall of that year [ 1939] I went to New York to see the Yankees play in the World Series. Just before gametime a batboy came up to me and asked me to come to the Yankees\u2019 bench. Well-Lou was waiting there. He was very ill, by then, so thin and gaunt that I was startled at his appearance. But he smiled and held something out to me \u2014 it was his first baseman\u2019s glove. \u201cHere it is, pal,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Brown\u2019s popularity was waning. He left Warner Bros., appeared in some independent movies, and concluded his starring career in a series of low\u00ad budget Columbia Pictures comedies released in the late 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nBut Brown did not fade from the public eye. During World War II, he proved that his heart was as big as his mouth as he became one of the first Hollywood celebri\u00adties to volunteer to entertain the troops. Brown trekked to combat zones from North Africa to Italy, the Pacific is\u00ad lands to Australia and New Zealand, bringing laughter to the Gls. He once estimated that he had traveled over 200,000 air miles during the war. Ever the jokester, he quipped, \u201cWhen I opened my mouth in the South Pacific, 8,000 mosquitoes flew in.\u201d Even though he was a civil\u00adian, Brown reportedly was allowed to pack a carbine and ride in a tank while on Luzon, the Philippine island.\n\nFor his tirelessness in entertaining the troops, Brown was given a Bronze Star as well as a special citation, voted by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, for his \u201cmeritorious service.\u201d However, he and Kathryn person\u00ad ally felt the brunt of the war. Their eldest son, Don Evan Brown, a captain in the Army Air Corps, died at age 25 in October 1942, when his plane crashed near Palm Springs during a training exercise.\n\nIn 1945, as the war wound down, Brown signed to tour as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey, Mary Chase\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy. He opened in Chicago and eventually appeared in the play well over 1,000 times on stages from Broadway to Australia. He also returned to the screen, and gave a highly regarded dramatic per\u00adformance as a small-town minister in The Tender Years (1947). He was ideally cast as Cap\u2019n Andy in the second remake of Show Boat ( 1951), and gave what easily is his best-remembered performance as a loony millionaire in Billy Wilder\u2019s Some Like It Hot ( 1959). Here, as he slyly winks at the camera, Brown ardently romances Jack Lemmon\u2019s jazz musician-in-drag. His closing line\u00ad \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect\u201d-is one of the more famous in film history.\n\nBaseball, of course, remained an intrinsic part of his life. \u201cWhenever he doesn\u2019t have a matinee, he\u2019s at some sports event,\u201d noted sports columnist Braven Dyer in 1946, while Brown was performing Harvey in Chicago. From 1953 to 1964, he served as first president of the PONY League, comprising teams made up of 13- and 14-year-olds. Long a supporter of the UCLA Bruins baseball team, the school\u2019s Westwood ballyard was named \u201cJoe E. Brown Field.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1953 season, Brown conducted pre- and post-game interviews for the New York Yankees and did five innings of play-by-play-three on television, and two on the radio. Radio-television critic Warren Bennett wrote that Brown was \u201cas relaxed before the cameras as an old shoe. Shy, diffident ball players loosen up for him as they never did for his predecessor, the illustrious Joe DiMaggio.\u201d Brown told Bennett, \u201cWhat I want to do is talk to the baseball fan who loves the game so much he stands in line to get a good seat.\u201d\n\nIn l955, his 37-year-old son, Joe L. Brown, replaced Branch Rickey as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. But Joe E. remained firmly rooted in Southern California-and as the Dodgers abandoned Brooklyn for Los Angeles, he was well-suited to become a high-profile promoter of West Coast baseball. In October 1957, not long after the team played its final game at Ebbets Field, Brown was the master of ceremonies of a star-studded luncheon at Los Angeles\u2019 Statler Hotel, held in honor of the team.\n\nBrown was among the leaders in the battle for the \u201cYes\u201d vote that would approve the Dodgers\u2019 contract with the city of Los Angeles, and result in the construc\u00adtion of Dodger Stadium. He became general chairman of the Taxpayers Committee on Yes for Baseball, and pre\u00addicted that the Dodgers would lure baseball fans from far across the region-particularly if they competed in a spanking-new ballyard. The actor clearly was jockeying for support when he observed, near the start of the 1958 season, \u201cDodger President Walter O\u2019Malley hopes to admit 300,000 youngsters [free of charge] to Coliseum games this season, and will up the figure to 600,000 when the club builds its own stadium in Chavez Ravine.\u201d He added, \u201cThe boy whose idol is Duke Snider or Junior Gilliam can\u2019 t go very far wrong in his future life.\u201d\n\nJoe E. Brown quietly lived out the rest of his life. He died at age 81 on July 6, 1973, of pneumonia and heart failure. Kathryn, his wife of 58 years, survived him. Brown was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, which houses the remains of entertainment in\u00addustry legends from George Burns and Gracie Allen to Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, and Spencer Tracy.\n\nBrown\u2019s life may be summed up by the title of a classic Hollywood film, albeit one in which he did not appear: It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. \u201cThere\u2019s been tragedy, when we lost our boy,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cBut l\u2019ve had the chance given every other citizen in a free country of living my life as I wanted to live it and becoming what I wanted to become.\u201d\n\nROB EDELMAN most recently authored the box liner notes and an essay on early baseball films included on the DVD compilation Reel Baseball: Baseball Films from the Silent Era, 1899-1926. He also is an interviewee on several doc\u00adumentaries included on the DVD re-release of The Natural.\n\nSources\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nBronner, Edwin J.

He slipped a disc early in his Burnley career and on his return played extensively in the reserves but was unable to win a place back in the first team.\n\nJoe was a Burnley player for less than two years and was transferred to Bournemouth in the summer of 1954. At Dean Court he was a regular and in six years there made over 200 league appearances. Not only had he finally played some regular football but he'd also spent time qualifying as an FA Coach and on his departure from Bournemouth he took up a coaching role in South Africa.\n\nHe wasn't there long before returning to play for Aldershot, but after five games with the Shots he was forced to retire when he was again hit with back problems. By then it was time to retrace his steps and he returned to Burnley to join the coaching staff in 1961.\n\nHis role was coaching the 'A' team and he was the coach in charge of the Burnley team that lifted the FA Youth Cup in 1968. But when Harry Potts moved upstairs and Jimmy Adamson took over as manager Joe was appointed assistant.\n\nHe carried out that role for six years before replacing Adamson as manager in January 1976 but sadly it didn't work out. He was in charge for thirteen months during which time Burnley said farewell to the first division and were struggling in the second division.\n\nThe club offered him another role but he declined and he moved on to work with the young players at Manchester United. When his coaching days were over he continued for some years at Old Trafford working with the youth set up and was there until his retirement.\n\nMaybe he wasn't cut out for management and should have remained as coach at Burnley. He was considered to be a top coach and good judges always felt he would have been a top player but for his back problems. Joe was, and remains, a gentleman and is one of the nicest people involved in football that I've ever met.\n\nHe'll probably be remembered at Burnley for that year as manager, but that would be so unfair for someone who had proved to be such a successful coach at the club for some years prior.\n\nJoe sadly passed away on 30th October 2014 following a long illness at the age of 85."}, {"url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/texas-sports-nation/astros/article/MLB-Negros-Leagues-recognized-Major-League-15808334.php", "page_content": "Organized baseball, which cherishes its statistical record above all others, took a step Wednesday toward alleviating decades of neglect by recognizing the Negro Leagues of 1920-48 as worthy of inclusion in Major League Baseball\u2019s official records.\n\nThe decision announced by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred reversed a 1969 decision by a rules committee that failed to include the Negro Leagues among other professional baseball leagues whose numbers were worthy of inclusion.\n\n\u201cIt is MLB\u2019s view that the (1969) omission of the Negro Leagues from consideration was clearly an error that demands today\u2019s designation,\u201d MLB said in its announcement.\n\nAdded to the statistical record will be the exploits of about 3,400 players who competed in the Negro National League (1920\u201431, 1933-48), Eastern Colored League (1923\u201428), American Negro League (1929), East-West League (1932), Negro Southern League (1932) and Negro American League (1937\u20141948).\n\nThe designation, which includes leagues that operated one year after the debut of Jackie Robinson as MLB\u2019s first Black player, does not include Houston\u2019s only entry in the Negro Leagues, the Houston Eagles of 1949-50.\n\nartifact lent by Stella Wells\n\nIt does, however, ratify at least a portion of the statistics compiled by seven men born in Texas who played in the Negro Leagues and have been inducted since the 1970s into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.\n\nThat group includes Andrew \u201cRube\u201d Foster of Calvert, who began his professional career with a team in Waco and was founder of the Negro National League in 1920; pitcher Bill Foster, Rube Foster\u2019s younger brother, who had a record of 140-69 from 1923-36; and shortstop Willie Wells of Austin, who played from 1924-48 and is believed to be the first player to use a batting helmet.\n\nAlso, pitcher Smokey Joe Williams of Seguin, who began his pro career in 1905 with the San Antonio Black Bronchos and pitched into his mid-40s; relief pitcher Hilton Smith of Giddings, a longtime teammate with the Kansas City Monarchs of Hall of Famer Satchel Paige and a six-time Negro Leagues All-Star; pitcher Andy Cooper of Waco, who pitched 20 years for the Detroit Stars and Kansas City Monarchs with a record of 129-78 and managed the Monarchs; and catcher Biz Mackey of Luling, a 24-year veteran with a career batting average of .322 who retired from the Newark Eagles when the team was moved to Houston in 1948.\n\nAnother Hall of Famer, Willard \u201cHome Run\u201d Brown, who played for the Monarchs for more than a decade and logged 21 major league games with the 1947 St. Louis Browns, lived in Houston after leaving baseball. He is buried in Houston National Cemetery.\n\nAP\n\nFive Negro Leagues players who went on to major league careers \u2014 Robinson, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Roy Campanella and Ernie Banks \u2014 were elected to the Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America.\n\nLarry Doby, selected to the Hall by the Veterans\u2019 Committee, and Monte Irvin and Paige, both selected by the Negro Leagues committee, also had successful MLB stints.\n\nIrvin, who played in 10 Negro League seasons, Campanella (nine) and Doby (five) are the Hall of Fame position players whose career numbers would be most affected by the statistical review.\n\nAccording to the Seamheads.com Negro Leagues Baseball Database, Irvin played in 353 games with 61 homers, 338 RBIs and a .347 batting average. Campanella had 33 homers and 241 RBIs and a .310 batting average in 339 games. Doby played in 46 games with 21 homers, 130 RBIs and a .327 avearge.\n\nRobinson (1945) and Mays (1948) each played one season in the Negro Leagues. Mays played in 21 games, which if added to his 2,992 total would boost him one spot into eighth place in baseball history. None of his other statistics from that season \u2014 11 runs, three doubles, a triple and no home runs \u2014 would have a significant impact on his total rankings.\n\nAaron is credited in some citations with a .366 batting average in 26 Negro League games in 1951, which is outside the time frame of the statistical additions that MLB said would be implemented. Banks played with the Kansas City Monarchs in 1951 and 1953, also outside the time frame for statistical additions.\n\nPaige\u2019s 18-year Negro Leagues record, according to the research posted on Seamheads.com, was 115-62 with 1,524 strikeouts in 1,563 innings and a 2.36 ERA.\n\nMLB this year commemorated the centennial of Negro Leagues baseball and worked with researchers from the Hall of Fame, the creators of the Seamheads.com Negro Leagues Baseball Database, and officials with the Negro Leagues Baseball Hall of Fame in Kansas City.\n\nFor decades, it was practically impossible to gauge the accuracy of Negro League statistics. For example, it is purported on Josh Gibson\u2019s Cooperstown plaque that he hit \u201calmost 800 home runs.\u201d But many of those would have occurred during barnstorming tours and not in official league contests.\n\nHowever, modern researchers, in collaboration with Seamheads, continue to track down accounts and box scores of thousands of Negro League games, making possible the integration of those numbers into the official MLB records. MLB said it is working with the Elias Sports Bureau to codify Negro Leagues statistics for inclusion in its annals.\n\nSince Negro League seasons were typically much shorter than MLB seasons, the sport\u2019s career records for \u201ccounting\u201d stats \u2014 such as Barry Bonds\u2019s 762 home runs and Pete Rose\u2019s 4,256 hits \u2014 are largely safe, if only because top Negro Leaguers are credited with having played between 1,000 to 1,600 career games, as opposed to, say, Rose\u2019s 3,562.\n\nThe all-time MLB rankings for \u201crate\u201d statistics such as batting average, on the other hand, could see a wholesale rewriting. Gibson\u2019s career batting average of .365, for example, would rank second only to Ty Cobb\u2019s .366 and \u2014 along with Jud Wilson\u2019s .359, Oscar Charleston\u2019s .350 and Turkey Stearnes\u2019 .348 \u2014 would push Babe Ruth\u2019s .342 out of the top 10. Gibson\u2019s career slugging percentage of .690 would edge out Ruth\u2019s .6897 as the highest in major league history.\n\nSingle-season stats would also be affected, with Gibson\u2019s .441 batting average in 1943 supplanting Hugh Duffy\u2019s .440 for the 1894 Boston Beaneaters of the National League as the highest in a single season in history. Ted Williams, who hit .406 for the Boston Red Sox in 1941, would lose his status as the last player to hit .400 in a single season.\n\nAlthough most Negro League seasons featured between 50 to 70 games, MLB\u2019s treatment of its own 2020 records as legitimate \u2014 despite a season that lasted just 60 games due to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 proved to be illustrative in demonstrating the legitimacy of Negro League stats.\n\nMLB is expected to use the same criteria to determine eligibility for single-season records as it currently uses for batting titles, with players required to have amassed 3.1 plate appearances per team-game in order to qualify. A similar factor, one inning pitched per team game, is used for pitchers to determine eligibility for the ERA title.\n\nJohn Thorn, MLB\u2019s official historian, said Wednesday\u2019s announcement was long overdue.\n\n\u201cThe perceived deficiencies of the Negro Leagues\u2019 structure and scheduling were born of MLB\u2019s exclusionary practices, and denying them Major League status has been a double penalty, much like that exacted of Hall of Fame candidates prior to Satchel Paige\u2019s induction in 1971,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cGranting MLB status to the Negro Leagues a century after their founding is profoundly gratifying.\u201d\n\nBob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, said the MLB decision \u201cserves as historical validation for those who had been shunned from the Major Leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.\n\n\u201cThis acknowledgement is a meritorious nod to the courageous owners and players who helped build this exceptional enterprise and shines a welcomed spotlight on the immense talent that called the Negro Leagues home.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.buckeyerosters.com/player/joe-brown/", "page_content": "Post-OSU Update: Joe Brown was undrafted in the 2001 NFL Draft, but was signed by Seattle and an undrafted free agent.

But the 2000 version of Joe Brown is healthy, quicker, leaner and ready to return to the dominant form he has shown in the past. Brown is an extremely strong, physical player at the line of scrimmage. He\u2019s also one of the team\u2019s better pass rushers. \u201cThe thing about him is that he was injured all last year and probably shouldn\u2019t even been playing,\u201d Jim Heacock, Ohio State\u2019s defensive line coach, said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s healthy, he is very effective.

The 1999 season should prove to be Brown\u2019s best. There are plenty of quality young tackles in the program eager to play and Joe is responding to all challengers. He also won\u2019t have to play in pain, like last year, when a broken left thumb and subsequent metal plate caused him to play through a great deal of adversity for the majority of the season. \u201cThe fact that Joe played through the injury was very positive,\u201d tackles coach Jim Heacock said. \u201cHe has worked himself into becoming a great football player.\u201d Brown enters his junior campaign with 44 career tackles, eight tackles-for-loss and three quarterback sacks.\n\n1998: Managed to start every game at defensive tackle, despite playing with a broken left thumb.

On Sunday, the Nationals tied a record with four consecutive home runs. On Monday, the Diamondbacks and Phillies set a record by combining for 13 home runs. On Tuesday, the Braves hit four home runs in one inning. Jerad Eickhoff allowed five home runs on Monday, and Chris Archer did it on Tuesday.\n\nEntering Wednesday's games, 25 players had already hit 17 home runs, putting them on a 40-homer pace. The single-season record for players with 40 home runs is 17 in 1996. As recently as 2014, only one player -- Nelson Cruz -- hit 40 home runs.\n\nNeedless to say, MLB is once again set to shatter the record for total home runs. There were 6,105 home runs in 2017. We're on pace for 6,566 in 2019 -- nearly 1,000 more home runs than there were in 2018. It's not just the quantity but also the apparent cheapness of many of the home runs, seemingly lazy fly balls that land in the bleachers. As Buster Olney said on his podcast the other day, \"How many times have we heard announcers say, 'I can't believe that one went out'?\"\n\nCompared with last season, runs per game are up 0.27, and home runs are up 0.20 per game. Yes, hitters are going for launch angle and all-or-nothing swings while accepting even more strikeouts, but something is clearly up with the ball. The juiced ball of 2017 has returned with rockets attached this time.\n\nNow it's time for a little history lesson. This kind of dramatic season-to-season increase in offense has occurred at various times throughout major league history, with increases traced directly to changes (intentional or not) to the ball. Let's look at some of those seasons and see what happened.\n\n1911: Introducing cork\n\nRuns per game: up 0.68\n\nHome runs per game: up .07\n\nFor decades, the National League (and later the American) used a ball produced by the A.G. Spalding Company, founded by White Sox pitcher Albert Spalding in 1876 to manufacture a standard ball for the new professional league. Prior to that, balls were of inconsistent standards and quality. (The American League ball bore a \"Reach\" label, but Spalding was the actual manufacturer.)\n\nHow baseball should fix the ball Home runs are hopping at a rate that makes the game almost unrecognizable, and you don't need to go far to find a big reason. Bradford Doolittle\n\nThat ball included a rubber core, but during the 1910 World Series, a cork-centered ball was used -- yes, imagine changing the ball that had been used all season for the World Series -- and the cork-centered ball became the new standard. Even though it was still the dead ball era, the increase in runs per game remains the largest year-to-year increase in any season since 1900.\n\nThe overall major league batting average increased from .249 to .266. In 1910, 15 players hit .300 across the two leagues, and only three (Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie and Sherry Magee) slugged above .470. In 1911, 30 players hit .300 and 13 slugged above .470.\n\nLeading the way was Cobb, who hit .419 after hitting .382 the season before. He followed with a .409 mark in 1912. He went from 35 doubles and 13 triples to 47 doubles and 24 triples. Shoeless Joe Jackson, in his first full season in the majors, hit .408. Sam Crawford, Cobb's Hall of Fame Tigers teammate, was a 31-year-old veteran with a .305 career average. He hit .378.\n\nThe offensive gains proved short-lived, however. Runs per game went from 4.51 in 1911 and 4.53 in 1912 all the way down to 3.56 by 1916. According to John McMurray of SABR's dead ball era committee in a 2011 New York Times article, a pitcher named Russ Ford started scuffing the ball, which soon became a widespread tactic. Add various forms of the spitball, and offense fell back to low levels.\n\n1930: The year the National League hit .303\n\nRuns per game: up 0.36\n\nHome runs per game: up .08\n\nThe so-called \"lively ball\" era began in 1920 (runs increased from 3.88 to 4.36 from 1919 to 1920), though the initial increase wasn't so much the result of a different ball. There were two other reasons: (A) banning the spitball; (B) using new balls throughout the game rather than dirty, scuffed-up ones. Babe Ruth began slugging home runs, and the new style of power hitting quickly took over.\n\nThe most notorious high-offense season in major league history saw an average of 5.55 runs per game, the highest of the live ball era. Next highest: 5.19 in 1929 and 5.14 in 2000. The National League averaged 5.68 runs per game and hit a collective .303. The New York Giants hit .319 as a team, and the Phillies allowed 7.69 runs per game with a 6.71 ERA.\n\nSome of the individual highlights:\n\n-- Hack Wilson hit 56 home runs with a record 191 RBIs.\n\n-- Bill Terry of the Giants hit .401.\n\n-- Chuck Klein hit .386 with 107 extra-base hits and 170 RBIs.\n\n-- Freddie Lindstrom of the Giants hit .379 and became one of the worst Hall of Fame selections ever on the strength of that season.\n\n-- Brooklyn's Babe Herman hit .393 with 35 home runs.\n\n-- Cubs pitcher Guy Bush finished with a 6.20 ERA. He still went 15-10.\n\nThat was just in the National League.\n\nWhat happened? The manufacturer insisted that nothing had changed. \"There has been absolutely no change in the major league baseball in the past five years,\" Spalding president Julian Curtis said that June. \"There isn't even a change in the yarn. If we bought our yarn, there might be, but we don't. We have our own yarn mills, and there has been no change in the manufacture or quality; no change in the wrapping; no change in the covers; no change in the rubber or cork.\"\n\nGiants manager John McGraw suggested the owners needed to fix the ball. \"It has taken the confidence out of the pitchers and is so lively the fielders cannot handle it,\" he said. He also proposed moving the pitching distance two feet closer to home plate. Cubs president Bill Veeck offered that the fans liked all the hitting. \"It's the punch that has made baseball over in the last 10 years,\" he said.\n\nIn the end, it was too much offense, even for the owners. The National League changed the ball for 1931, adding a slightly thicker cover and raising the seam. Offense fell from 5.68 runs per game to 4.48, the league average declined from .303 to .277, and home runs dropped from 892 to 493. The American League, however, apparently didn't change its ball, and runs per game remained above 5.0, including 5.67 in 1936 -- just shy of the National League's mark in 1930.\n\n1977: Welcome aboard, Rawlings\n\nRuns per game: up 0.48\n\nHome runs per game: up 0.29\n\nA New York Times story from 1975 detailed the end of Spalding's reign as MLB's baseball manufacturer. With its contract set to expire after the 1976 season, the company reportedly asked for a 5% price increase per ball for 1975 and another 5% for 1976. According to the article, Spalding sold about 250,000 balls per year to MLB at a cost of $2 apiece. A 5% increase to $2.10 per ball would have increased MLB's annual cost to $525,000.\n\nSpalding had produced every baseball ever used in major league baseball, but it was kicked to the curb over an additional $25,000. \"The reason is price,\" said Lee MacPhail, president of the American League. \"We're sorry we're ending such a long and proud relationship. But we've been able to work something out with another manufacturer.\"\n\nThat manufacturer became Rawlings in 1977. Before it took over, however, offense nose-dived in 1976 to 3.99 runs per game. Only four players across the majors hit 30 home runs, and only 22 hit even 20. With Rawlings presumably manufacturing a higher quality ball in 1977 (plus new expansion teams in Seattle and Toronto slightly diluting the pitching), 19 players hit 30-plus home runs, and 56 hit at least 20. Among the big hitters:\n\n-- George Foster of the Reds slugged 52 home runs, the first 50-homer slugger since Willie Mays in 1965.\n\n-- Rod Carew hit .388 and slugged .570, the only full season he slugged .500 in his career.\n\n-- The Dodgers had four players hit 30-plus home runs (Steve Garvey, Reggie Smith, Dusty Baker, Davey Lopes), the first time four teammates had done that (11 teams have done it since, all since 1995).\n\nThe 4.47 runs per game in 1977 were not topped until something strange happened in 1987.\n\nAndre Dawson hit 49 home runs in his MVP season in 1987; the next highest mark in his career was 32. AP Photo/John Swart\n\n1987: The rabbit ball\n\nRuns per game: up 0.31\n\nHome runs per game: up 0.15\n\nThe first sentence in Frank Deford's column in the July 27 edition of Sports Illustrated asked the question on everyone's mind: \"If the baseball is juiced up, who's responsible?\" Deford dismissed any conspiracy to change the ball -- something would have leaked if that were the case, he surmised -- and attempted rational explanations for the home run explosion that season. Batters were stronger, a generation of pitchers was on the defensive due to growing up facing aluminum bats and throwing too many breaking balls, and the best athletes had chosen hitting as their trade.\n\nOr this: \"The last incredible generation of pitchers -- Gibson, Marichal, Koosman, Seaver, Palmer, Sutton, Hunter, John, Jenkins, Carlton, Tiant, the Perrys and the Niekros -- was the product of that postwar time when traditional philosophy still prevailed: discipline and dedication, the Protestant ethic and the commitment to the long haul.\" Pitchers weren't tough enough. Or something. George Will went with the aluminum bat theory and increased weight training. Pirates GM Syd Thrift said pitchers were being rushed to the majors. Braves catcher Ozzie Virgil said the bats were better.\n\nOK ... except the 1988 season saw one of the biggest drops in offense in the game's history. Runs per game fell from 4.72 to 4.14, not just below 1987 figures but well below 1986 or 1985 or 1984. There were 3,813 home runs in 1986 (which was a record for total home runs, though not quite the highest per-game average), then 4,458 in 1987, then 3,180 in 1988. The MLB-wide batting average went from .258 to .263 to .254.\n\nIt was the ball. That was the prevailing theory from those in the game. Tigers manager Sparky Anderson referred to the \"nitroglycerin ball.\" Astros pitcher Mike Scott said the balls were going farther. Reds manager Pete Rose said the ball was definitely livelier.\n\nIndeed, some individual numbers were eye-popping. A's rookie Mark McGwire hit 49 home runs. So did Andre Dawson. Twenty-eight players hit 30-plus home runs, compared with 13 in 1986. Singles- and doubles-hitting Wade Boggs, who hit 22 home runs the previous three seasons, hit 24; he never hit more than 11 the rest of his career. Tony Gwynn hit .370, Boggs hit .363, and Paul Molitor hit .353 and had a 39-game hitting streak. Larry Sheets hit .316 with 31 home runs for the Orioles. (He finished at .266 and 94 in his career.)\n\nFour of the six highest individual home run seasons in the 1980s came in 1987. Eight of the top 14 OPS seasons in the decade came in 1987. As Matthew Pouliot pointed out in an article several years ago, perhaps no player benefited from the 1987 rabbit ball more than Dawson. He won MVP honors for a last-place Cubs team on the strength of those 49 home runs and a league-leading 137 RBIs. His second-highest home run total in his career: 32. Without that 49-homer season and MVP award, he might not have made the Hall of Fame.\n\nThen, just like that, the ball was dead. In 1987, only four starting pitchers had a sub-3.00 ERA. In 1988, 20 pitchers achieved that mark. The sport entered a five-year span with a relative lull in offense.\n\n1993: Juiced players or juiced ball?\n\nRuns per game: up 0.48\n\nHome runs per game: up 0.17\n\nAfter the lull came the explosion. In a two-year span, runs per game went from 4.12 to 4.60 to 4.92. Home runs per game increased from 0.72 to 0.89 to 1.03. Yes, the Rockies joined the National League in 1993, helping to create more offense, but that alone hardly explains a half-run per game increase. Indeed, the American League -- without games in Colorado -- went from 4.32 runs to 4.71 to 5.23. No doubt, PED use was starting to spread across the sport, but the PED theory assumes the unlikelihood that everyone started using all at once.\n\nMeet Wander Franco, MLB's next can't-miss kid Rays phenom Wander Franco will soon join Acuna, Vlad Jr. and Tatis among MLB's new generation of superstars. And he just might be better than all of them. Jeff Passan\n\nSo it was the ball. Something changed in the 1992-93 offseason. The full impact was felt more intensely over two seasons, but some of the individual increases in 1993 were dramatic:\n\n-- In 1992, 10 players hit 30 home runs, and two hit more than 35: Juan Gonzalez (43) and Mark McGwire (42). In 1993, 22 players hit 30 home runs, and 10 hit more than 35.\n\n-- Seven players in 1993 posted an OPS above 1.000. Over five seasons from 1988 to 1992, only five players topped 1.000.\n\n-- Barry Bonds slugged .677 in 1993, the highest figure since Mickey Mantle in 1961.\n\n-- Andres Galarraga hit .370 (in Colorado), and John Olerud hit .363 with 54 doubles for the Blue Jays.\n\n-- Ken Griffey Jr. went from 27 home runs to 45.\n\nIn 1994, things went completely nuts:\n\n-- When the strike hit in August, Matt Williams (43), Griffey (40), Jeff Bagwell (39) and Frank Thomas (38) were trying to chase down Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs.\n\n-- Three players -- Bagwell (.750), Thomas (.729) and Albert Belle (.714) -- slugged over .700, which had been accomplished just three times since World War II (Ted Williams, Mantle and Stan Musial). Bagwell's .750 mark was higher than anybody's since Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1927.\n\n-- Tony Gwynn hit .394.\n\nAnd so on. So what happened? One suggestion is that it was around this time that Rawlings switched from hand manufacture of the core to machine manufacture, which resulted in more tightly wound cores. The offensive gains were only partially realized in 1993 due to some leftover balls from 1992 still existing in the pipeline.\n\nThe owners certainly realized what was happening. The fans loved the long ball. Attendance increased from 26,529 fans per game in 1992 to 30,964 in 1993 to 31,256 in 1994.\n\nThere's your history lesson. It's a reminder that a baseball is a lot more complex object than it might appear."}, {"url": "https://rediscovering-black-history.blogs.archives.gov/2021/02/24/larry-doby-a-life-of-firsts-and-seconds/", "page_content": "Today\u2019s post was written by Dr. Greg Bradsher, senior archivist at the National Archives in College Park, MD\n\nA little over two years ago in 2018 Congress, by Public Law No: 115-322 (132 STAT. 4440-4442) enacted the Larry Doby Congressional Gold Medal Act. Upon hearing about this, I thought about getting Larry Doby\u2019s autograph at a spring training game in Tucson, Arizona, when I was in grade school. In the mid-1950s my father, who was stationed at Davis-Mountain Air Force Base in Tucson often took me to Hi Corbett Field to see my favorite baseball player, Larry Doby, a member of the Cleveland Indians baseball team. It was during one of the spring training games that I got Doby to sign my game program. I obtained the autographs of other members of the Cleveland team, but having obtained Doby\u2019s was my greatest thrill. During the following years, as I began to have new favorite players, Luis Aparicio in the 1960s and Jim Rice in the 1970s, I still followed Doby\u2019s baseball career, which culminated in him being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nLarry Doby, centerfield for the Cleveland Indians, 1953. Baseball card by Bowman Gum\n\nLawrence Eugene \u201cLarry\u201d Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina, on December 13, 1923, and moved to Paterson, New Jersey, in 1938, where he became a standout four-sport athlete during high school. Doby in 1942 accepted a basketball scholarship to play at Long Island University (LIU)-Brooklyn. But first, he played baseball that summer for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League under the assumed name \u201cLarry Walker\u201d to keep his amateur status. That year he played 23 games as a second baseman and batted .309.\n\nThat fall Doby enrolled in LIU, but shortly thereafter he transferred to Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia. There during the 1942-1943 basketball season, while averaging over 10 points a game, Doby helped the school\u2019s basketball team to the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship. Then early in 1943, he became the first Black player to play in the American Basketball League, a forerunner of the National Basketball Association, as a member of the Paterson (New Jersey) team.\n\nDoby hit .301 with the Eagles in 1943 and entered military service at the end of the season. He first served with the Navy at Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois, where he played with the Black baseball team. He maintained a .342 batting average against squads composed of white players, some of which featured major leaguers. He subsequently served at naval installations in Utah and California before spending 1945 at Ulithi Atoll in the Pacific.\n\nShips of the fighting fleet in the Ulithi Atoll, 12/1944 NAID 520666\n\nAfter being discharged from the Navy in January 1946, Doby rejoined his Newark team, again as its second baseman. That year he batted .322, helping his team to the Negro League World Series title. More importantly, he caught the attention of Bill Veeck, owner of the Cleveland Indians, who desired to break the Major League color line.\n\n1946 Roster of the Newark Eagles, including Larry Doby (blackpast.org)\n\nAfter the 1946 season Doby traveled to Puerto Rico to play winter ball with the San Juan Senators. During that winter season he had one of the top batting averages in Puerto Rico at .358 and was second in home runs with 14.\n\nDoby began the 1947 season with Newark while Jackie Robinson, who had spent 1946 in the minor leagues, broke the Major League color line on April 15, when he played his first game in the National League as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Doby would not be far behind him.\n\nDoby was off to a great start at Newark, batting .354, when, during the first days of July he was signed to a Major League contract with the Cleveland Indians. After playing a game for Newark on July 4, Doby took a train to Chicago to join his new team that was beginning a series against the White Sox.\n\nIn the clubhouse on July 5 Doby as greeted with weak handshakes from most of his new teammates. Four of them refused to take his hand. Two of those turned their backs on him. Out on the field before the game only one player, future Hall of Famer Joe Gordon, would play pitch and catch with him. During the game that day, when he became the first African American to play in the American League, Doby struck out pinch hitting.\n\nAfter the game, while his teammates went to one hotel, Doby was sent to a separate hotel that accommodated Black people. During the rest of his career he continually faced segregation. Road trips were especially rough on Doby. Not only did he face boos and taunts wherever he played, opposing players also would not talk to or associate with him at first. On July 20, 1978, Doby recalled \u201cJackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna be nice to the second Black.\u2019\u201d\n\nDoby, during 1947 played little, usually as a second baseman, but sometimes as the team\u2019s first baseman. He batted only .156 in 29 games. Many fans, sportswriters, and teammates had their doubts about his abilities. The next year would be a very good one for Doby.\n\nDuring the 1948 season Doby became life-long best friends with former Navy Gunner\u2019s Mate Lawrence Peter \u201cYogi\u201d Berra. Berra, the New York Yankees catcher during a visit to Cleveland, struck up a conversation with Doby. That encounter made the front page of the newspapers, much as had the integrated lines in the South during the tour of the Freedom Train that year.\n\nBoth events were a reminder that Blacks and Whites could get along, and based partly on that belief President Truman on July 26, 1948, signed Executive Order 9981 (NAID 300009), desegregating the Armed Forces.\n\nOn the playing field both Doby and the Cleveland Indians had great success in 1948. Any questions about Doby\u2019s abilities were put aside as Doby, now the regular centerfielder, batted .301 and helped lead Cleveland to the American League pennant and a World Series championship victory over the Boston Braves. During the World Series victory over the Boston Braves, Doby batted .318 and hit a home run, thus becoming the first African American to hit a home run in a World Series. After the game in which Doby hit his home run to secure the victory, a famous photograph was taken and distributed across the nation showing Doby and his teammate, the winning pitcher of the game, Steve Gromek, hugging, to celebrate the victory (seen here in an article from The Guardian).\n\nDuring 1950, Doby hit .326 for the season, homered 25 times, and lead the American League in on base percentage. In 1952, Doby lead the American League in runs scored, slugging percentage, home runs (32), thus becoming the first African American to lead either league in home runs. Doby led the American league in 1953 with 111 runs batted in. In 1954, he led the league with 32 home runs and 126 runs batted in. During the All-Star game that year Doby became the first African American to hit a home run in an All-Star game. His efforts that year helped gain another pennant for the Cleveland Indians. During the 1954 World Series against the Willie Mays-led New York Giants, Doby struggled, only getting two hits, as the Giants swept the Indians in four games. Despite this loss and his poor showing in the series, Doby finished second in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player award, which was won by Yogi Berra.\n\nDoby remained in the major leagues until 1959, finishing his career playing for the Chicago White Sox. He played in the American League for 13 years, appearing in 1,533 games and batting .283, with 253 home runs and 970 runs batted in. During his major league career he was voted to seven All-Star teams and led the American League in home runs twice.\n\nAfter his major league career ended, Doby played briefly in 1959 with San Diego in the Pacific Coast League and extended his career in 1962, by playing for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan, becoming the second African American to play in the Japanese leagues.\n\nIn 1968 Doby became a scout for the Montreal Expos, with hope of someday becoming a Major League manager. In 1970 he served as a minor league instructor and from 1971 to 1973 served as the Expos\u2019 batting coach. His first managerial opportunity came during the winter 1970-1971 baseball season in Venezuela. He would end up managing various teams during five seasons of winter league baseball in Venezuela.\n\nDoby in 1974 became the first base coach for the Cleveland Indians. At the end of the season the Cleveland manager was fired and many people thought Doby would be elevated to the manager position, thus becoming the first African American manager in the Major Leagues. This did not happen, as Frank Robinson was hired as the club\u2019s player-manager, and baseball\u2019s first Black manager.\n\nIn 1976, Doby returned to the Expos as their batting coach. Bill Veeck, then owner of the Chicago White Sox, in 1977 hired Doby as the batting coach. When the manager, Bob Lemon, a former Indians\u2019 teammate of Doby\u2019s, was fired on June 30, 1978, Doby was promoted to manager, thus becoming the second African American manager in the American League. He managed the team the next four months, but his managerial contract was not renewed at the end of the season. However, Veeck retained Doby as the batting coach for the 1979 season.\n\nAfter retiring from baseball in October 1979, Doby throughout the 1980s, served as director of communications and director of community affairs for the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association. He also spent a lot of time with his Montclair, New Jersey neighbor and best friend Yogi Berra. They spoke nearly daily, either on the phone or in person. They hung out together at each other\u2019s house and when their wives tried to find chores for them to do, they escaped to the local American Legion post to talk about baseball and the Navy.\n\nIn retirement, Doby received honorary doctorate degrees from Long Island University, Princeton University, and Fairfield University.\n\nSlowly but surely, in the mid-1990s, the baseball world began recognizing Doby\u2019s achievements and contributions. A writer on April 20, 1995 in The New York Times wrote \u201cIn glorifying those who are first, the second is often forgotten\u2026 Larry Doby integrated all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And he did it with class and clout.\u201d Doby\u2019s No. 14 was retired by the Indians in 1994 and in 1995 he was named special assistant to the American League\u2019s president. He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 1997 Major League All-Star Game played in Cleveland.\n\nFinally, in 1998, Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. It was Hall of Famer Ted Williams that called Doby to notify him of his selection. In his induction speech on July 26, Doby said: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a very tough thing to look back about things that were probably negative. You put those things on the back burner. You are proud and happy that you\u2019ve been a part of integrating baseball to show people that we can live together, we can work together and we can be successful together.\u201d These remarks prompted the huge crowd to interrupt him with a standing ovation.\n\nAlso in 1998, Doby\u2019s pal, Yogi Berra opened the Yogi Berra Museum Learning Center, where, after Doby\u2019s death, Berra dedicated a wing of the museum to Larry Doby featuring memorabilia from his career and the Negro Leagues.\n\nDoby died June 18, 2003, at Montclair, New Jersey. The following day, Major League Commissioner Bud Selig released a statement that read in part: \u201cLike Jackie, he endured the pain of being a pioneer with grace, dignity, and determination and eased the way for all who followed.\u201d Former Major League Commissioner Fay Vincent wrote \u201cLarry\u2019s role in history was recognized slowly and belatedly. Jackie Robinson, who broke the color line first but in the same year, quite naturally received most of the attention. Larry played out his career with dignity\u2026Only in the 90\u2019s did baseball wake up to the obvious fact that Larry was every bit as deserving of recognition as Jackie.\u201d Shortly after Doby\u2019s death, President George W. Bush said: \u201cLarry Doby was a good and honorable man, and a tremendous athlete and manager. He had a profound influence on the game of baseball, and he will be missed.\u201d\n\nForever Stamp of Larry Doby (USPS)\n\nDuring the past decade Doby continued to be honored. In 2012, the United States Postal Service issued a first-class forever postage stamp depicting Doby at bat. A statue of Doby was placed outside the Cleveland Indians ballpark in 2015 and in December 2018, he was honored by Congress with the enactment of the Larry Doby Congressional Gold Medal Act. The Act stated that Doby was being award the Congressional Gold Medal \u201cin recognition of his achievements and contributions to the American major league athletics, civil rights, and the Armed Forces during World War II.\u201d Larry Doby often was first or second in the things he accomplished, and those accomplishments should be celebrated. But the totality of his life should also be remembered and appreciated."}, {"url": "https://sabr.org/journal/article/when-joe-bauman-hit-72-home-runs/", "page_content": "This article was written by Bart Ripp\n\nThis article was published in 1980 Baseball Research Journal\n\nSome places where only baseball is played are called fields, like Wrigley. Others are parks, as in Fenway. In Roswell, New Mexico, it\u2019s a hybrid: Park Field.\n\nHank Aaron and Babe Ruth never played at Park Field. Roger Mans and Mickey Mantle never were cheered there. George Foster and Jim Rice have never hit home runs at Park Field. Joe Bauman did.\n\nWhere the box seats sat and the clubhouses stood at Park Field, there are now just slabs of concrete, with rabbit-brush and blazing-star sprouting through the cracks. The left field scoreboard is no more. There used to be a wooden fence around the outfield, but it\u2019s gone, too, replaced by chicken wire.\n\nJoe Bauman was a 6-foot-5, 235-pound lefthanded hitter, with an uppercut swing that propelled baseballs over the right field wall, just 329 feet from home plate at Park Field. Twenty-six summers ago, Joe Bauman accomplished something that had never been done in professional baseball, something that has never been equaled.\n\nJoe Bauman hit 72 home runs in one season.\n\nZooming into the record books for the Roswell Rockets in the old Class C Longhorn League in 1954, Bauman, then 32, not only hit a home run once every 6.9 at-bats, he led the league with a .400 batting average, 225 runs batted in, 456 total bases and 1 50 walks and played first base in all 138 of his club\u2019s games. Bauman\u2019s .916 slugging percentage was 69 points better than Ruth\u2019s best.\n\nBauman was 58 years old on April 17. He is now the \u201cSultan of Schlitz\u201d in Roswell, managing a beer distributorship for Albuquerque\u2019s Pete Matteucci. Joe took time recently to rock in his office chair, left hand behind his head, smoke L&M cigarettes and remember a nine-year pro career in which he hit 337 home runs.\n\nBauman grew up in Oklahoma City, signed his first professional contract with Little Rock in 1941, served in the Navy as a landlocked ballplayer at Norman, Okla., then played three more years professionally. Except for one game with Milwaukee in Triple A, he never played at a higher classification than Class A ball. The property of the Boston Braves in 1948, Bauman quit the Hartford club after that season to run a Texaco gas station in Elk City, Okla. For the next three years, he changed oil and hit homers for the Elk City Elks semipro team.\n\n\u201cBoston had called me that winter of `52 and wanted me to go play for the Atlanta Crackers in double-A,\u201d Bauman said. \u201cBut this doctor, I can\u2019t recall his name now, he wanted me to play for Artesia in the Longhorn League.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell, I didn\u2019t know they had baseball out there. Anyhow, this doctor wanted to buy my contract from Boston, and he did. I don\u2019t know what he got, maybe a dollar bill or a jock strap. But he came back and we made the deal on the driveway of my service station. So, I came out to Artesia and played two years for the Drillers.\u201d\n\nBauman drilled 50 homers in 1952, a league record 53 in 1953. He then bought his own release from Artesia and moved up Route 285 to Roswell.\n\n\u201cI was ready to move on,\u201d Bauman said. \u201cI always did like Roswell. Liked this part of the country after I got acquainted.\u201d\n\nJoe liked western skies, he liked seeing rabbits race tumbleweeds across the plains and most of all, he liked the 10-foot high whitewashed wooden fence 329 feet from the batter\u2019s box at Park Field. He bought a gas station and renamed it Joe Bauman\u2019s Texaco Service.\n\nWhen the Rockets were home, Bauman pumped gas during the day, then pumped home runs out of Park Field at night.\n\nBy September 1, 1954, Bauman had hit 64 home runs in 131 games. The pro record was 69, set by Joe Hauser for Minneapolis in 1933 and tied by Bob Crues for Amarillo in 1948.\n\nOn the night of September 1, there were 524 at Park Field to see Roswell beat Sweetwater, 15-9. Joe hit four home runs. He also doubled, and his box score line for the evening read:\n\n7 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 \u2013 10\n\nIn the Roswell Daily Record, Buck Lanier\u2019s column \u201cRiding Herd on Sports,\u201d stated that \u201cThe eyes of the United States are on Roswell at present. It isn\u2019t too often that the activities of a Class C league are pegged on the national Associated Press trunk wires as prime material . . . If Joe does break it, pictures of him will be on the sports pages of every paper in the U.S.\u201d Below Buck\u2019s column was a Worley Auto Sales ad \u2013 you could buy a new Ford Mainliner, two-door, six-cylinder, for $1,645.\n\n\u201cI had to have something like that,\u201d Bauman says, sitting in the deserted grandstand at Park Field. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really trying for home runs, but after I hit those four, I really got conscious of the durned record. It went from an impossibility to a possibility in one night.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Bauman went from No. 4 in Rocket Manager Pat Stasey\u2019s lineup to the leadoff spot, to get more times at bat. Bauman had two doubles, a single and a sacrifice fly. But Stasey, also Roswell\u2019s third baseman, inserted himself into the seemingly magic cleanup slot and belted three home runs.\n\nThe evening of September 3 was Bauman\u2019s last home game, with four more left on the road. \u201cThe pressure really mounted then,\u201d said Bauman, watching the wind blow old newspapers against the mesh fence at Park Field. \u201cThere were four or five photographers shooting every time I went up to the plate. There were guys there from Life and Sports Illustrated, plus the local boys. They\u2019d be snapping while I was hitting. It\u2019s bound to affect you and it did me.\u201d\n\nLanier\u2019s game story the next day led with: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have happened to a nicer guy,\u201d ending \u201caltogether, it was a great night.\u201d In between, Buck managed to mention Bauman\u2019s three-run homer that sailed over the right field wall in the eighth inning and, incidentally, beat Midland, 7-4. It was Bauman\u2019s 69th home run, tying the pro record. On the Roswell Daily Record sports page was a State TV ad for a \u201cPrecision Special Scintillator . . . it detects uranium deposits 100 times easier!\u201d It cost $299.50.\n\nThe Rockets bused to Big Spring, Texas, and Bauman didn\u2019t hit a home run in either of the next two games.\n\n\u201cThey pitched around me in Big Spring,\u201d Bauman says. \u201cThe fans in their own damn ballpark even got riled. So, we go down to Artesia and their manager, Jim Adair, told me before the game that he\u2019s heard what happened in Big Spring. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna walk you,\u2019 he told me.\u201d\n\nIt was Sunday, September 5, a doubleheader between Roswell and the Artesia NuMexers on the final day of the regular season. In the first inning of the first game, Bauman hit No. 70 to set the record. The home run was smiting off Jose Galardo, who thus joined the gopher genre that includes Tom Zachary, Tracy Stallard and Al Downing.\n\nBauman hit two more home runs in the second game, one off John Goodell and No. 72 off Frank Galardo, uncle of Jose. There was no score mentioned in the Daily Record of that first game, but Roswell numbed the NuMexers, 17-0 in the nightcap.\n\n\u201cIt was the ultimate thrill as far as I was concerned,\u201d Bauman says of home run No. 70. \u201cArtesia had a big ballpark \u2013 350 or 60 feet down the right field line and the wind blew in against you.\u201d\n\nJoe\u2019s quote in the next afternoon\u2019s Daily Record was: \u201cNo. 70 was getting the piano stool off my back. No. 69 was the piano.\u201d At the bottom of that page, the Big T Service Station, perhaps sensing the free publicity its competitor Bauman was reaping, took out an ad for gasoline costing 25.5 cents a gallon. The acts clever copy proclaimed: \u201cNo tricky pills added, no horse-feathers, just plain, high grade gasoline.\n\nOn the following Sunday, September 12, the Daily Record wrote of Carlsbad\u2019s Potashers eliminating Roswell from the league playoffs. Joe took out a three-column ad on the sports page and thanked local merchants and fans for their support. A photo showed Joe signing autographs for three boys wearing baseball caps. One boy studied the ball Joe had just signed, another looked up in awe at the slugger, while the third gazed at the right field wall, maybe imagining all those home runs sailing over it.\n\nThere was, and still is, a rodeo grounds beyond the right field wall. Joe\u2019s home runs occasionally would splat into the ring; one might say he was swinging for bullseyes.\n\n\u201cIt was easy to hit balls out here, in a sense,\u201d Bauman says, glancing at the right field wall. \u201cThe ball carries so good here. Plus, we got a free ham for every home run. We had the best-fed ballclub in the country. . .\u201d\n\nBauman didn\u2019t even get a salary raise the next season. He slumped to a mere 46 home runs and 132 RBI in 1955. Slowed by injuries in 1956, he called it a career in mid-season after hitting 17 round trippers in 52 games.\n\nHillerich & Bradsby, the people who make Louisville Sluggers, took the bat Bauman bombed No. 70 with and used it in a traveling bat show. He received a black bat, with gold engraving, in return.\n\n\u201cI just look at that year as what it was. Nothing earthshattering,\u201d Bauman says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any real money out of it. Just a wonderful feeling. I sit around some nights, have a beer and get to thinking about the funny little things that happened. The home runs. The people. It seems like a long time ago. It reminds me how slow the world runs.\u201d\n\nBauman puffed on his cigarette, ran his big left hand through his hair and looked out at the right field mesh fence where the wind had blown tumbleweeds and the old newspapers."}, {"url": "https://sabr.org/journal/article/harvest-seasons-most-runs-batted-in-with-fewest-home-runs-since-1920/", "page_content": "This article was written by James D. Smith III\n\nThis article was published in 1983 Baseball Research Journal\n\nMost modern-day fans see a close connection between large numbers of home runs and equally impressive runs-batted-in figures in a given season. There are certainly sound reasons for this perception, based both in the ancient rules (a four-base hit scores all runners ahead of the batter) and six decades\u2019 evidence parading Ruth, Gehrig, and their kind.\n\nIn the past 25 years, however, something entirely new has come upon the major league scene: the player who hits 40 home runs while batting in fewer than 100 runs. Duke Snider (40/92) was the first to do so, in 1957. The following season, Mickey Mantle (42/97) followed suit, repeating in 1960 (40/94). Rico Petrocelli (40/97) became the only shortstop to do it, in 1969. That same season, Hank Aaron (44/97) turned the trick, and in 1973 (40/96) joined his second base teammate Dave Johnson (43/99) on the list. Harmon Killebrew\u2019s 1963 season (45/96) deserves special mention, with the Twins\u2019 outfielder blasting the most home runs while falling short of the 100 RBI mark.\n\nThis phenomenon, however, represents only part of a larger trend. With the advent of the \u201clively ball,\u201d in 1922 both Babe Ruth (35/99) and Tilly Walker of the A\u2019s (37/99) hit at least 35 home runs without driving home 100 runs. A quarter-century passed before another major leaguer matched this \u201cshortfall\u201d performance, as Hank Sauer compiled 35/97 marks in 1948. Since that time, however, this feat has been accomplished a total of 34 times, the last being by Dave Kingman (37/99) and Mike Schmidt (35/87) in 1982. Fourteen times a player with 35 home runs has failed to drive in 90 runs, with Wally Post and the rookie Frank Robinson batting in but 83 in 1956.\n\nWhatever the exact figures, there are many fine seasons represented in the efforts described above. These players, however, stand in sharp contrast to another, seldom-recognized, group of major leaguers. This select company is composed of those who have driven in the most runs during a season while hitting the fewest home runs.\n\nWe are aware that Hugh Jennings is credited with knocking in 121 runs in that big batting year of 1896 without hitting a home run; and that Lave Cross\u2019 108 RBIs in 1902 were produced without a four-bagger. However, we are limiting our brief study to the modern period of 1920 to the present, not because the RBI became fully official in 1920, but because the home run component came into relatively equal prominence with the RBI at that point. The lively ball made for more Ruthian home run hitters, sweeping the bases ahead of all others.\n\nAfter 1920 it became rather exceptional to see batters like Larry Gardner, Joe Sewell, and Pie Traynor knock in 100 runs with only 2-3 home runs. Sewell almost made the list in 1925 when he hit only one homer and knocked in 98 runs. In most cases the clubs these run producers played for had healthy team averages around .300, there were no full-blown home run hitters in the lineup, and the individual hit for a good average himself.\n\nThere were a few exceptions. In 1931, for example, Pie Traynor of the Pirates knocked in 103 runs while hitting only two round-trippers and batting only .298. The club was sixth in batting (.266) and fifth in scoring runs. Six other Pirates hit more home runs than Traynor, but no one else knocked in more than 70 runs, which was Paul Waner\u2019s figure. There is no doubt that Traynor came through with men on base.\n\nIn 1934 Bill Rogell batted only .296 for the Tigers, and his 3 home runs could not compare with Hank Greenberg\u2019s 26, but he still batted in 100 runs. However, the Tigers batted .300 that season and scored a very high number of runs \u2013 958 to 842 for the runner-up Yankees. Rogell batted sixth behind Gehringer (third), Greenberg (fourth) and Goslin, all of whom knocked in 100 or more runs.\n\nIn 1943, Billy Herman hit two homers and knocked in 100 runs for the Dodgers. However, he batted a solid .330 and the Bums, in spite of little help from their fading home run hitter, Dolf Camilli, led the league in runs.\n\nGradually it became more and more difficult to collect 100 RBIs with fewer than 10 homers. Pinky Higgins and Frank McCormick both finished with 5/106 in 1938; and Cecil Travis and Bob Elliott were both 7/101 in 1941 and 1943 respectively. Herman\u2019s exceptional record in 1943 stood out in comparison.\n\nIn 1950, Detroit third baseman George Kell (8/101) became the last player to post an RBI total in three figures with a single figure HR mark. The shift was already in motion. When Kell played his last season in 1957 Duke Snider became a \u201cfirst\u201d in the other direction with 40 homers and 92 RBI. In 1983 it looked like Ted Simmons might be a throw-back to earlier decades when he was knocking in runs without the long ball. However, by the end of the season his round-trippers had gone up to 13 and his RBIs stood at 108.\n\nHere are the two extremes: Those players with 40 home runs and fewer than 100 RBIs, and those players who knocked in 100 runs with three or fewer four-baggers. Although the period is restricted to 1920 to the present, the two groups still fall into separate eras.\n\nNote: All stats through 1983 season."}, {"url": "https://www.perfectgame.org/Players/Playerprofile.aspx?ID=530283", "page_content": "\u00d7 MAX ACCELERATION\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\nThe maximum acceleration the bat experiences during the swing, measured in \u201cg\u2019s\u201d.

The fans went home happy; despite the homers, the Braves lost, 10-8.\n\nSunday was a terrible debut for Ramirez even before the string of long balls. He struck out the first batter in the fifth inning, then gave up two singles. A runner was caught stealing, giving him hopes of getting out of his first major league inning, but he followed it with a walk.\n\nThen the homers started.\n\nYoan Moncada hit a three-run shot to right, and Yasmani Grandal followed. Jose Abreu and Eloy Jimenez hit theirs to left field. After homer No. 4, Ramirez was finally yanked. It was the sixth time of the 10 that a single pitcher gave up all four of the homers.\n\nRamirez was 6-3 with a 4.78 earned run average last year in Class AA and AAA. His career E.R.A. in the majors stands for now at 81.00.\n\nThe White Sox did not waste the dingers, beating the Cardinals, 7-2.\n\nMore home runs over all would naturally lead to more streaks of consecutive home runs, which is why the back-to-back-to-back-to-backer isn\u2019t such an extreme rarity anymore. Major leaguers hit 6,776 homers last year, breaking the previous record by more than 600.\n\nFour home runs in a row is still pretty remarkable. But five in a row would be more so.\n\nHow close did we come to a record-setting fifth on Sunday? Edwin Encarnacion, with 416 career home runs, stepped to the plate against the new pitcher, Seth Elledge, with a chance to go where no one had gone before.

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\n\nJoe Adcock may have had the greatest single game offensive performance in baseball history. On this day in 1954, the Braves slugger hit four home runs, and set a record for the most total bases in a single game.\n\nWe often see where, in the course of a game, a player needs to borrow a teammate\u2019s bat for whatever reason. Strangely, it seems to work out for the better more often than not, with that bat having a hit or two left for the person swinging it. For Braves slugger Joe Adcock, borrowing that piece of lumber, had a record setting day.\n\nThe fireworks began in the second inning against Dodgers starter Don Newcombe. Leading off the inning, Adcock belted a home run, extending the Braves lead at the time to 2-0. Battered by the Braves lineup, Newcombe lasted three batters into the second before being replaced by Clem Lebine. In the third, Erv Palica took over, and did not fare much better. After a home run for Eddie Matthews, his second of the game, and a fly out, he kept Adcock in the yard with a double off the top of the wall in left, narrowly missing his second homer of the game.\n\nAdcock victimized Palica in the fifth. With two runners on, he took the reliever\u2019s offering deep for a three run homer, giving the Dodgers a 9-1 lead. After the Dodgers got a run back in the sixth, Adcock took another reliever, Pete Wojey, deep for a two run homer, his third of the contest. With Brooklyn holding a 12-2 lead midway through the seventh, the only real drama was whether or not Adcock would get a chance for his fourth home run of the game.\n\nThat opportunity came in the top of the ninth. The Dodgers had battled back to score four runs in the bottom of the eighth, cutting the Braves lead in half. Adcock made sure that the comeback would not materialize, taking Johnny Podres deep to lead off the inning for his fourth homer of the game. If not for a matter of inches in the third, he would have been the first player in baseball history to hit five homers in one game.\n\nAs it was, Adcock slammed his way into history. He became the seventh player in baseball history, and the second member of the Braves organization, to hit four homers in a single game. His 18 total bases set a record that stood until Shawn Green bested him in 2002. It was quite the epic performance.\n\nJoe Adcock was known as a Dodger killer during his playing days. On this day in 1954, Adcock belted four homers against four different pitchers, leading the Braves to victory."}, {"url": "https://sportsh2h.com/h2h-77-al-kaline-vs-carl-yastrzemski-who-was-better/", "page_content": "This site contains affiliate links to products. We may receive a commission for purchases made through these links.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1970s saw a record seven MLB players reach the magical 3,000-hit mark, starting with Hank Aaron in May 1970 and concluding with Carl Yastrzemski in September 1979 (the others being Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, Al Kaline, Pete Rose, and Lou Brock). Among this sterling seven, only Kaline and Yastrzemski hailed from the AL, serving as the respective franchise faces for the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox over their lengthy careers. There are deep similarities between the two players \u2013 each was an outfielder, each was both an excellent hitter and fielder, each played 20+ years, and each was a first-ballot Hall of Famer. With their careers overlapping for more than a dozen years, it is natural to ask the question:\n\nWho was better \u2013 Al Kaline or Carl Yastrzemski?\n\nThe Beginning\n\nKaline and Yastrzemski were each multi-sport stars growing up and upon signing with major league baseball teams, would quickly establish themselves in the big leagues.\n\nBorn and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Kaline played basketball, football, and baseball in high school, earning All-State honors in baseball (he was originally a pitcher growing up before moving to the outfield). Immediately after graduating from high school, he was signed by the Tigers, who had scouted him for a number of years, and made his major league debut at age 18 in 1953, playing a total of 30 games. During Kaline\u2019s first full season in 1954, he hit .276 with 4 home runs, 43 runs batted in, 43 runs scored, a .305 on-base percentage, and a .347 slugging percentage, good for an 80 OPS+ (which measures on-base percentage plus slugging vs. a league-wide average set at 100) and a third-place Rookie of the Year finish.\n\nAs for Yastrzemski, he grew up on Long Island, New York, and played both basketball and baseball in high school; interestingly, he broke Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown\u2019s Long Island high school scoring record in basketball. Based on his two-sport prowess, Yastrzemski went to Notre Dame on a split basketball/baseball scholarship, but left after his freshman year to sign with the Red Sox in 1958. Following a few seasons in Boston\u2019s farm system, he was called up to the big leagues in 1961 to essentially replace the legendary Ted Williams and hit .266 with 11 home runs, 80 runs batted in, 71 runs scored, a .324 on-base percentage, and a .396 slugging percentage (91 OPS+).\n\nCareer Comparison\n\nIn the pre-free agency era, Kaline and Yastrzemski both played their entire careers with one team (Tigers and Red Sox, respectively) and were among the stars of the late 1950s and 1960s, ultimately cementing their legacies as among the era\u2019s greatest players.\n\nIn just his second full MLB season in 1955, Kaline won his only batting title with a .340 batting average, a league-high and career-best 200 hits, 27 home runs, 102 runs batted in, career-high 121 runs scored, a career-best .421 on-base percentage, and a .546 slugging percentage (162 OPS+); in the process, he became the first 20-year-old to win a batting title since another Tigers legend Ty Cobb did it at the turn of the 20th century. Additionally, Kaline earned his first All-Star appearance (he would be an All-Star every year through 1967, and 18x overall) and finished second for AL MVP to Yogi Berra. The next year, he hit .314 with 27 home runs, a career-high 128 runs batted in, 96 runs scored, a .383 on-base percentage, and a .530 slugging percentage, good for a 139 OPS+, this time finishing third for MVP to Yankees teammates Mickey Mantle and Berra. In addition to being a consistent .280 to .300 slugger year in and year out, Kaline was also a terrific defensive outfielder, winning his first Gold Glove in 1957 and a total of 10 over the next 11 seasons.\n\nAs the 1960s rolled around, Kaline continued to be one of the premier players in baseball. During the 1961 season, he finished second to teammate Norm Cash for the batting title, hitting .324 with a league-high 41 doubles, 19 home runs, 82 runs batted in, 116 runs scored, a .393 on-base percentage, and a .515 slugging percentage (138 OPS+) to finish ninth for MVP. One year later, Kaline was on pace for perhaps a career year, but ended up only playing in 100 games due to injury; nevertheless, he still managed to bat .304 with a career-high 29 home runs, 94 runs batted in, 78 runs scored, a .376 on-base percentage, and a career-high .593 slugging percentage for a 152 OPS+ and a sixth-place MVP finish. He nearly won the MVP in 1963, again finishing second (this time to Elston Howard) on the strength of a .312 batting average, 27 home runs, 101 runs batted in, 89 runs scored, a .375 on-base percentage, and a .514 slugging percentage (144 OPS+). To cap off his prime years, Kaline managed his final top-five MVP finish and last Gold Glove in 1967: .308 batting average with 25 home runs, 78 runs batted in, 94 runs scored, a .411 on-base percentage, and a .541 slugging percentage, good for a career-best 176 OPS+.\n\nEntering his mid-30s, Kaline remained an effective player who consistently hit in the .270 to .290 range, but was not quite the superstar of old. After another All-Star season in 1971 (.294 with 15 home runs, 54 runs batted in, 69 runs scored, a .416 on-base percentage, and a .462 slugging percentage for a 144 OPS+), he made his final All-Star Game in 1974 at age 39, though only hit .262 overall for the season. Late in the season, Kaline became just the 12th player in MLB history to reach 3,000 career hits before retiring at season\u2019s end; to this day, he remains the Tigers\u2019 career record-holder for games played, home runs,, and walks (the majority of the team\u2019s hitting records are held by Cobb).\n\nSimilarly for Yastrzemski, he had a good sophomore campaign before breaking out in 1963 to win his first batting title: a .321 batting average with a league-high 183 hits and 40 doubles, 14 home runs, 68 runs batted in, 91 runs scored, a league-leading .418 on-base percentage (also led the league in walks), and a .475 slugging percentage (148 OPS+). In addition to a sixth-place finish for AL MVP, this would also mark the first of 18 All-Star Games and seven Gold Gloves; in fact, starting in 1965, he was an All-Star for 15 straight years, consistently hitting above .280 in the mid-1960s and leading the league in doubles in three of four years. The highlight was Yastrzemski\u2019s unforgettable 1967 season \u2013 with a .326 batting average, 44 home runs, 121 runs batted in, 112 runs scored, a .418 on-base percentage, and a .622 slugging percentage (193 OPS+), he not only won his second batting title and led the league in nearly every hitting category while setting numerous career-best marks, but also won AL MVP, another Gold Glove, and the rare and coveted Triple Crown (while Frank Robinson also won the Triple Crown the previous year, it would not happen again until Miguel Cabrera in 2012 and has not happened in the NL since 1937). Moreover, the 12.5 WAR Yastrzemski produced in 1967 is the third-highest single-season mark ever for a position player, surpassed only by Babe Ruth.\n\nComing off this magical season, Yastrzemski won his third and final batting title in 1968, though his numbers were down significantly: .301 batting average with 23 home runs, 74 runs batted in, 90 runs scored, a league-high .426 on-base percentage (bolstered by a league-leading 119 walks), and a .495 slugging percentage for a 171 OPS+ and a ninth-place MVP finish; note that this was the famous \u201cYear of the Pitcher\u201d before the pitcher\u2019s mound was lowered and thus, the .301 mark is the lowest-ever for a batting champion. This was followed by consecutive seasons with 40 home runs:\n\n1969: only a .255 batting average, but with 40 home runs, 111 runs batted in, 96 runs scored, a .362 on-base percentage, and a .507 slugging percentage (136 OPS+); won another Gold Glove\n\nonly a .255 batting average, but with 40 home runs, 111 runs batted in, 96 runs scored, a .362 on-base percentage, and a .507 slugging percentage (136 OPS+); won another Gold Glove 1970: a career-high .329 batting average (though did not win the batting title), 40 home runs, 102 runs batted in, a league-leading and career-best 125 runs scored, a league-high and career-high .452 on-base percentage, and a .592 slugging percentage (177 OPS+); finished fourth for AL MVP\n\nDue to hand and shoulder injuries as he entered his 30s, Yastrzemski was no longer the same dominant player in the 1970s as he was in the late 1960s, though remained an All-Star every year of the decade. However, he would only hit .300+ once, in 1974: .301 with 15 home runs, 79 runs batted in, a league-high 93 runs scored, a .414 on-base percentage, and a .445 slugging percentage (140 OPS+). Generally, Yastrzemski was more of a .250 to .270 hitter and his power and run production also waned, though he did manage back-to-back seasons with 20+ home runs and 100+ runs batted in during the mid-1970s (1976 \u2013 21 home runs/102 runs batted in, 1977 \u2013 28 home runs/102 runs batted in, plus a final Gold Glove). In 1979, he reached 3,000 career hits, thus becoming the first-ever AL player with 3,000 hits and 400 home runs. Ultimately, Yastrzemski played well into his 40s, earning two final All-Star selections before retiring after the 1983 season at age 44; his 23 seasons with the Red Sox matches Brooks Robinson for most years with one team and he is second all-time in baseball history for games played (most with one team), as well as Boston\u2019s franchise leader for hits, doubles, runs batted in, runs scored, and total bases.\n\nWhile Yastrzemski only played one more MLB season than Kaline (23 vs. 22), his better career durability results in nearly 500 additional games played and almost 2,000 additional at-bats. As a result, Yastrzemski has the advantage in essentially every major counting offensive category; however, the story is a bit more split when it comes to ratios and averages \u2013 while he also has the higher career on-base percentage, Kaline leads in career batting average, slugging percentage, and OPS+. Furthermore, in comparing \u201cgreat\u201d seasons, it is again a mixed story: Kaline hit .300+ more frequently (9x to 6x) and had more 20+ home run seasons (9x to 8x), whereas Yastrzemski leads in 40+ home run seasons (3x to none) and years with 100+ runs batted in (5x vs. 3x), and each scored 100+ runs twice. Both were 18x All-Stars \u2013 Yastrzemski was more acclaimed offensively with the MVP and Triple Crown in 1967 plus three batting titles (vs. one for Kaline), whereas Kaline was the better defensive outfielder (10 vs. 7 edge in Gold Gloves). All in all, when you capture all of this into one advanced metric, their career Wins Above Replacement (WAR) are very close, with Yastrzemski having the slight lead at 96.4 to 92.8 for Kaline. Post-retirement, both legends were first-ballot Hall of Fame inductees (1980 for Kaline and 1989 for Yastrzemski).\n\nRegular Season Statistics\n\nAl Kaline Player Carl Yastrzemski 22 (1953-1974) Seasons 23 (1961-1983) 2,834 Games Played 3,308 10,116 At-Bats 11,988 3,007 Hits 3,419 1,622 Runs 1,816 399 Home Runs 452 1,582 Runs Batted In 1,844 1,277 Walks 1,845 137 Stolen Bases 168 .297 Batting Average .285 .376 On-Base Percentage .379 .480 Slugging Percentage .462 134 OPS+ 130 92.8 Wins Above Replacement 96.4 18x All-Star Games 18x \u2013 MVP 1x 1x World Series Titles \u2013 10x Gold Glove, 1x Batting Title Other Awards 1x Triple Crown, 7x Gold Glove, 3x Batting Title, 1x ML PoY 1980 Hall of Fame Induction 1989\n\nSource: Baseball-Reference.com\n\nOver 20+ MLB seasons apiece, Kaline and Yastrzemski each made only two playoff appearances; however, remember that until 1969, the AL and NL pennant winners met directly in the World Series.\n\nKaline\u2019s first World Series appearance in 1968 came against Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 in a seven-game victory, he was outstanding, batting .379 (11 hits in 29 at-bats) with 2 home runs, 8 runs batted in, and 6 runs scored. Four years later, with the expansion of the playoffs, he would hit .263 in a five-game ALCS loss to the Oakland Athletics.\n\nMeanwhile, both of Yastrzemski\u2019s World Series appearances resulted in heartbreaking losses. First, in 1967, despite his stellar individual play (.400 batting average on 10 hits in 25 at-bats with 3 home runs, 5 runs batted in, and 4 runs scored), the Red Sox would fall in seven games to the aforementioned Gibson and the Cardinals, with the star pitcher accounting for three of the four St. Louis victories. Almost a decade later, in 1975, Yastrzemski hit an incredible .455 in a sweep of the Athletics in the ALCS and then, batted .310 in the World Series, but Boston would again lose in the full seven games, this time to the Cincinnati Reds and their \u201cBig Red Machine\u201d offense led by Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, and Joe Morgan.\n\nPlayoff Statistics\n\nAl Kaline Player Carl Yastrzemski 12 Games Played 17 48 At-Bats 65 16 Hits 24 9 Runs 15 3 Home Runs 4 9 Runs Batted In 11 2 Walks 9 \u2013 Stolen Bases \u2013 .333 Batting Average .369 .373 On-Base Percentage .447 .563 Slugging Percentage .600\n\nSource: Baseball-Reference.com\n\nEvery athlete goes through a natural career lifecycle, from starting off as a rookie to reaching peak years of performance and finally, declining into the inevitable retirement due to a combination of age and/or injury; after quickly becoming stars, both Kaline and Yastrzemski slowed down in their 30s and 40s, though still remained productive All-Star-level players. For Hall of Fame caliber players across sports, I like to look at a concept I call a \u201cdecade of dominance.\u201d The thinking behind this is that for most Hall of Fame type careers, there are roughly 10 great seasons that define an athlete (this idea is embodied in a sense by the NFL\u2019s All-Decade teams), though due to injury or other factors, they might not be 10 consecutive years.\n\nDecade of Dominance\n\nAl Kaline Player Carl Yastrzemski 1955-1959, 1961-1963, 1966-1967 Decade of Dominance 1963, 1965-1970, 1973-1974, 1977 1,407 Games Played 1,535 5,308 At-Bats 5,558 1,663 Hits 1,673 931 Runs 947 249 Home Runs 259 942 Runs Batted In 904 652 Walks 970 78 Stolen Bases 116 .313 Batting Average .301 .388 On-Base Percentage .403 .525 Slugging Percentage .508 64.1 Wins Above Replacement 69.4\n\nSource: Baseball-Reference.com\n\nKaline and Yastrzemski are relatively evenly matched over their respective decades of dominance \u2013 with more games played, the latter has slightly higher counting numbers, but the former has a better batting average and slugging percentage; in terms of WAR, Yastrzemski retains the advantage, largely helped by the 12.5 WAR in his Triple Crown season (Kaline\u2019s highest single-season mark was 8.4 in 1961).\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nBefore baseball free agency took root in the 1970s, you could easily associate most teams in the 1950s and 1960s with a specific player, e.g. Aaron \u2013 Braves, Mays \u2013 Giants, Mantle \u2013 Yankees, Clemente \u2013 Pirates, etc. For the Tigers and Red Sox, respectively, Al Kaline and Carl Yastrzemski were those franchise faces, faithfully carrying the torch for their teams for over two decades each. It is a testament to each player\u2019s greatness and durability that their career totals are so prolific and so comparable (both regular season and playoffs), so who do I give the edge to? While Yastrzemski certainly had the more dominant peak, in particularly in the late 1960s when he won the Triple Crown with arguably the greatest offensive season in modern times and posted two other 40+ home run seasons, I think Kaline was the more consistent standout \u2013 he was the better overall hitter statistically with less season-to-season variance (higher overall batting average and consistently in the .290 to .300+ range, higher career OPS+, etc.), a better defensive outfielder with 10 Gold Gloves, and for what it is worth, was clutch in helping Detroit to the 1968 World Series.\n\nThus, after weighing their careers against each other in terms of statistics, achievements, and impact, the winner of this faceoff is:\n\nAl Kaline\n\nAs always, vote for your choice and leave your thoughts and comments below.\n\nWho was better - Al Kaline or Carl Yastrzemski?

He spent a short time in the minor leagues\u2014and in 2010 was given the J.G. Taylor Spink Award as the best player in the minors\u2014before he made his full-season major-league debut in 2012. He then proceeded to have a spectacular rookie season, leading the American League (AL) in runs scored (129) and stolen bases (49) while posting a .326 batting average. Moreover, his stellar defense in centre field and his dominance in the advanced statistical categories led many observers to trumpet him as the 2012 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP), but he finished second in the MVP voting to Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers. Trout did, however, win AL Rookie of the Year honours by unanimous vote.\n\nBritannica Quiz I Am the Greatest (Athlete)\n\nTrout\u2019s second season was just as impressive. He again led the AL in runs (109) and drew 110 bases-on-balls (walks), feats that aided him in posting a .432 on-base percentage (OBP). However, his accomplishments were again overshadowed by those of Cabrera to MVP voters, and Trout once more finished second to the Detroit slugger in balloting for that award. In 2014 Trout belted a career-high 36 home runs and led the league with 111 runs batted in (RBIs) while retaining his spot atop the runs-scored leaderboard with 115. His strong play finally catapulted him past Cabrera, and in 2014 Trout was voted that season\u2019s AL MVP. He also helped the Angels reach the postseason for the first time in his career, but the team was swept in its opening playoff series by the Kansas City Royals.\n\nTrout was named to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game in 2015, where he earned game MVP honours for the second straight year and became the first player in the 82-year history of the game to win back-to-back All-Star MVP awards. Trout finished that season with a career-high 41 home runs and an AL-leading .590 slugging percentage (a statistic that measures a hitter\u2019s power production). Trout rounded out what was arguably the all-time greatest first five years of a major-league career by batting .315 and leading the AL in runs (123), walks (116), and OBP (.441) in 2016, which led to his second AL MVP award.\n\nDespite missing 39 games in 2017 because of a torn thumb ligament, Trout still amassed 33 home runs and 72 RBIs while again leading the AL in OBP (.442) that season. In 2018 he hit 39 home runs and had an AL-best 122 walks and .460 OBP, but the Angels continued to struggle despite Trout\u2019s brilliance, finishing the season with a losing record and missing the playoffs for the sixth time in Trout\u2019s seven full seasons with the team. Despite the relative lack of on-field success during his time with the Angels, in March 2019 Trout signed a 12-year extension with the team for $426.5 million, which was, at the time, the largest amount of money in a single contract in the history of professional sports. He continued his dominance in 2019, again leading the AL in OBP (.438) and slugging percentage (.645) while hitting a career-high 45 home runs. Despite the Angels\u2019 continued mediocrity on the field (posting a 72\u201390 record that season), Trout\u2019s 2019 was so dominant that he won a third career AL MVP award.\n\nDuring the 2020 season, which was shortened because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trout recorded his 300th career home run. The following year he experienced a setback when a calf injury forced him to miss most of the season. He returned in 2022, and that year he scored his 1,000th career run. However, later in the season Trout was placed on the injured list, and he was subsequently diagnosed with a \u201crare\u201d back condition."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27416504/the-top-home-run-achievement-ever-all-30-mlb-teams", "page_content": "The 2019 season reminds me of the great Mickey Mantle quote: \"Somebody once asked me if I ever went up to the plate trying to hit a home run. I said, 'Sure, every time.'\"\n\nThat should be the slogan for this entire season, with the juiced balls flying out of parks in stunning numbers: Sure, every time. Every day it seems some record is set. Just this past weekend, Pete Alonso set the National League rookie record for home runs. Before the weekend, there had been just three games in MLB history during which teams combined for at least 12 home runs (one earlier this season). It happened twice in three days. On Monday, the Nationals became just the second team in 20 years to score at least 13 runs in three straight games. The stretch of consecutive days in which at least one player has had a multihomer game just hit 36, as Tom Murphy of the Mariners had his third two-homer game of 2019 -- and he is the backup catcher.\n\nAnd so on and so on.\n\nWith the barrage of home runs the story of the season, I thought it would be fun to look at each team and pick the most impressive individual home run achievement in franchise history. This could be anything: One game, one streak, one season or something accomplished over a career. For the most part, I shied away from the four-homer games -- there have been 18 of those -- since I didn't want a list of four-homer games (although a couple of them did make the list).\n\nWith apologies to Bob Horner, Mark Whiten and Scooter Gennett, the best home run achievements for each team in order of the single-season homer record for the franchise:\n\nSan Francisco Giants\n\nFranchise record: Barry Bonds, 73 (2001)\n\nBest achievement: Bonds' 73 home runs\n\nIt is, after all, the single-season record, and the fact that Bonds did it in what was then Pac Bell Park is even more astonishing, considering how difficult it is to hit home runs there, especially for left-handed batters. That, essentially, was the problem with Bonds: He was too good. He broke the game and baseball was left with no choice but to finally confront the PED issue in the sport. His 2004 season defies reality: .362 batting average, .609 OBP, .812 slugging percentage.\n\nIn his record-breaking season, Bonds twice hit three home runs in a game and eight times hit two. His longest stretch without a home run was 13 games, from June 24 to July 8. He hit 17 home runs in May and finished by hitting .403 with 16 home runs in September/October. He actually started only 147 games that year (appearing in six others), so he might have cracked 75 if he had played a few more games. Ridiculous.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\nFranchise record: Mark McGwire, 70 (1998)\n\nBest achievement: Fernando Tatis' two grand slams in one inning (1999)\n\nMcGwire's record lasted just three seasons before Bonds broke it. Tatis' record is virtually unbreakable; even under extreme conditions, it feels impossible to imagine a player batting three times in one inning with the bases loaded and hitting a home run each time. And good luck seeing it even tied. Heck, no player has even batted twice with the bases loaded in the same inning this season; and only 12 others besides Tatis have hit two grand slams in one game.\n\nMy favorite aspect of Tatis' record: Both slams came off Chan Ho Park. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson left Park in to allow 10 baserunners in the inning -- six hits (including three home runs), two walks, a hit batter and an error. Tatis' second grand slam finally knocked Park from the game, 46 pitches after the inning began.\n\nChicago Cubs\n\nFranchise record: Sammy Sosa, 66 (1998)\n\nBest achievement: Sosa's 20 home runs in one month (June 1998)\n\nYou know the fun fact about Sosa, right? He hit 60-plus home runs three times -- and didn't lead the league in any of those seasons. When he hit 66, McGwire hit 70. When he hit 63 the next season, McGwire hit 65. When Sosa hit 64 in 2001, Bonds hit 73. Sosa did manage to lead the league with 50 in 2000 and 49 in 2002, giving him an average of 58 home runs per season over a five-year span.\n\nThe Great Home Run Race of 1998 -- the one we're now supposed to hold in disdain -- actually wasn't a great race during the first two months. McGwire hit 11 home runs in April and 17 in May, but Sosa was at just 13 home runs at that point, 15 behind McGwire. Then came one of the most incredible months in major league history. Sosa homered twice on June 1, then in five straight games from June 3 to June 8, cranked three more on June 15, hit two in back-to-back games on June 19 and 20, then hit No. 20 on the final day of the month. Sosa hit just .298 for the month in 27 games (he was hitting .343 entering June), but 20 of his 34 hits were home runs. The race was on.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nFranchise record: Roger Maris, 61 (1961)\n\nBest achievement: Don Mattingly's two home run records in 1987\n\nThere's obviously no shortage of options here for the Yankees:\n\n-- Babe Ruth hitting more home runs than any single team in 1920 (54);\n\n-- Ruth being the only player with two three-homer games in the World Series;\n\n-- Ruth hitting 60 in 1927;\n\n-- Lou Gehrig's four-homer game in 1932;\n\n-- Ruth leading the league a record 10 times (plus two more with the Red Sox);\n\n-- Mickey Mantle's World Series record of 18 home runs (good luck breaking that one);\n\n-- Reggie Jackson's three home runs on three swings in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series;\n\n-- Mattingly tying a record with home runs in eight consecutive games;\n\n-- Mattingly also setting a record (since tied) with six grand slams in one season;\n\n-- Aaron Judge setting a rookie record with 52 home runs (2017).\n\nI'll go with Judge. Wait, Mattingly. Tough one here. The only other rookie in the vicinity of Judge's 52 is McGwire with 49 in 1987, although Pete Alonso might wipe Judge from the record books next month. So let's go with Mattingly for setting two significant records in 1987.\n\nMattingly's dual records are somewhat more remarkable since he wasn't a pure slugger (he hit 30 home runs that year). His eight-game streak sandwiched the All-Star break, five before and three after, and he twice hit two in a game, giving him 10 over the eight-game span. Two of his six grand slams also came in this stretch. Cleveland's Travis Hafner would match Mattingly's six grand slams in 2006, but only four players have hit even five, so six might stand for a long time.\n\nMiami Marlins\n\nFranchise record: Giancarlo Stanton, 59 (2017)\n\nBest achievement: Stanton's 59 home runs\n\nStanton's monster season stands out not only for him -- his second-best total is 38 -- but also in Marlins history, as Gary Sheffield owns the franchise's only other 40-homer season (42 in 1996). Stanton actually hit better at Marlins Park that year, mashing 31 home runs in 272 at-bats at home, compared to 28 in 325 at-bats on the road. After mashing 18 home runs in August, Stanton entered September with an excellent chance of reaching Maris' 61 -- what many consider the \"clean\" record -- but slowed down the final month, hitting .245 with eight home runs. He entered the final three games sitting on 59 but went homerless.\n\nOakland Athletics\n\nFranchise record: Jimmie Foxx, 58 (1932)\n\nBest achievement: Mark McGwire's 538-foot home run off Randy Johnson (1997)\n\nWas it really 538 feet? I don't know, and I don't really care, but it was an absolute rocket blast into outer space (well, it would have been if it hadn't happened in the Kingdome). Plus, it's worth it just for the Dave Niehaus call:\n\nDetroit Tigers\n\nFranchise record: Hank Greenberg, 58 (1938)\n\nBest achievement: Cecil Fielder's 51 home runs in 1990\n\nGreenberg had a chance at breaking Ruth's then-record of 60 home runs, sitting on 56 with nine games to play. He would hit two in the second game of a doubleheader with five games left, but the pressure had been building and Greenberg was physically and mentally exhausted. He went 3-for-3 in the final game and banged a double off the fence, but the game was called after seven innings due to darkness.\n\nI'm going with Fielder's season in 1990, however, factoring in the state of the game then, as compared to the high-scoring 1930s. First, Fielder became just the second player since 1965 to hit 50 home runs (George Foster hit 52 in 1977). Between the rabbit-ball season of 1987 and the dawn of the steroid era in 1993, we had five seasons of a lull in offense. Only eight times from 1988 to 1992 did players reach even 40 home runs:\n\nFielder, 1990: 51\n\nKevin Mitchell, 1989: 47\n\nFielder, 1991: 44\n\nJose Canseco, 1991: 44\n\nJuan Gonzalez, 1992: 43\n\nCanseco, 1988: 42\n\nMark McGwire, 1992: 42\n\nRyne Sandberg, 1990: 40\n\nFielder's season looks even more impressive in this context. Within a few years, 50 home runs lost its shock value, but it was riveting to watch in 1990.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\nFranchise record: Ryan Howard, 58 (2006)\n\nBest achievement: Mike Schmidt leading the league eight times\n\nHoward's season was certainly one for the ages, as he hit .313/.425/.659 with 58 bombs and 149 RBIs to win MVP honors. But Schmidt managed big numbers year after year as the premier National League slugger from the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s. Schmidt first led the league in 1974, when he hit 36, and last led in 1986, when he hit 37. Only Babe Ruth had more league-leading seasons, with 12.\n\nSchmidt was one of the early prototypes of the \"three true outcomes\" slugger: Along with all the home runs, he drew 100-plus walks seven times and led in strikeouts four times. Schmidt was already a great player when he made an adjustment during batting practice at, of all places, the 1979 All-Star Game. He decided to move off the plate and drive the ball more to center field instead of pulling everything. From 1980 to 1986, when he was 30 to 36 years old, he hit .281 and led the NL six out of seven seasons in OPS+.\n\n\"I was pitched inside and consistently missed that ball or hit home runs foul,\" he once told sports columnist Thomas Boswell. \"I hated just being 'dangerous.' I hated being the guy who could be an easy out if pitched properly. It's not fun to have to battle that anxiety constantly, every at-bat.\"\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\n\nFranchise record: Luis Gonzalez, 57 (2001)\n\nBest achievement: Gonzalez's 57 home runs\n\nEveryone remembers Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson and Gonzalez's World Series-winning blooper off Mariano Rivera that year, but how many remember that Gonzalez hit .325/.428/.688 with 57 home runs, 142 RBIs and 419 total bases? Of course, he didn't lead the league in any of those categories, and it goes down as one of the most surprising home run seasons ever, as Gonzalez never hit more than 31 in any other season.\n\nAs columnist Joe Posnanski recently wrote about this time in baseball history, \"Wow, it really was the Wild West back then, wasn't it?\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nPosnanski pointed out that maybe 30 players will get to 100 RBIs this season. In 1999, 59 players had 100 RBIs. In 2000, there were 53.\n\nIn 2001, the top sluggers went nuts. Look at the total bases leaders that season:\n\nSammy Sosa, 425\n\nLuis Gonzalez, 419\n\nBarry Bonds, 411\n\nTodd Helton, 402\n\nThere were a bunch of 400 total-base seasons in the 1920s and 1930s. But from 1938 through 1996, it happened just three times (Stan Musial, Hank Aaron and Jim Rice). Then Larry Walker did it in 1997, Sosa in 1998 and Helton in 2000. Then four players did it in one season.\n\nNobody has done it since.\n\nTexas Rangers\n\nFranchise record: Alex Rodriguez, 57 (2002)\n\nBest achievement: Josh Hamilton hitting four home runs and a double in one game (May 8, 2012)\n\nHamilton went 5-for-5 in a 10-3 victory over the Orioles in the midst of a six-game span when he hit nine home runs. Hamilton was the 2010 American League MVP during a season that included a two-month stretch in June and July when he hit .437; but his first two months of 2012 might have been even better, as he hit .368/.420/.764 with 21 home runs.\n\nJust like that, however, his run of greatness was over. He tailed off the final four months, signed with the Angels, kept chasing pitches out of the strike zone, struggled, got hurt and last played in 2015, a comet sizzling out.\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\nFranchise record: Ken Griffey Jr., 56 (1997, 1998)\n\nBest achievement: Griffey with back-to-back 56-homer seasons\n\nFlip a coin here. I could have gone with Griffey tying Dale Long and Don Mattingly when he homered in eight consecutive games in 1993 (he doubled off the wall in the ninth game), but I'll go with his magical 1997 and 1998 seasons. Consider this: There have been 45 50-homer seasons, by 29 different players. Only nine of the 29 had more than one 50-homer season. Only five players have done it in consecutive seasons -- and three of those five come under the PED cloud of enhanced power hitting:\n\nBabe Ruth, 1920-21 and 1927-28\n\nMark McGwire, 1996-99\n\nGriffey, 1997-98\n\nSammy Sosa, 1998-01\n\nAlex Rodriguez, 2001-02\n\nGriffey just missed making it four in a row: He hit 49 in 1996 (when he played just 140 games) and 48 in 1999. Do you want to see Junior hitting two off David Cone on Opening Day of 1997? Of course you do:\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\n\nFranchise record: Ralph Kiner, 54 (1949)\n\nBest achievement: Kiner leading the league seven straight seasons\n\nWith apologies to Dale Long, the first player to homer eight games in a row, even Babe Ruth didn't lead his league in home runs seven consecutive seasons. Kiner led the National League from 1946 to 1952, his first seven seasons, although he was the outright leader just four times (Johnny Mize tied him in 1947 and 1948, and Hank Sauer did the same in 1952). Kiner was a controversial Hall of Fame selection in 1976. He played just 10 seasons, as he retired at 32 due to back problems, and was a poor fielder with a weak throwing arm. It was a short career, but he did hit 369 home runs as one of the game's premier sluggers.\n\nAs for Long, he is one of the more obscure holders of a major record. His record came in May 1956, when he was a 30-year-old journeyman first baseman, playing just his second full season in the majors, and the hot start (he was hitting .411 at the end of his homer streak) propelled him to an All-Star selection. He finished with 27 home runs that year and 132 in his career, but his record has yet to be broken.\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nFranchise record: David Ortiz, 54 (2006)\n\nBest achievement: Ortiz's two walk-off home runs in the same postseason (2004)\n\nThere have been 51 walk-off home runs in postseason history, but only Bernie Williams and Ortiz have two -- and Ortiz's both came in the curse-ending season of 2004. His first one was the clinching blow in the AL Division Series against the Angels. Then he beat the Yankees in the 12th inning of Game 4 of the championship series, keeping that series alive for the miracle comeback:\n\nOf course, Ortiz's heroics in the postseason didn't end there, as he also had the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5 of the 2004 ALCS. He is the only player with three walk-off hits in the postseason. He also is the career leader in postseason win probability added (granted, modern players have more games), as he hit .289/.404/.543 in his postseason career.\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\nFranchise record: Jose Bautista, 54 (2010)\n\nBest achievement: Joe Carter's World Series walk-off (1993)\n\nWith apologies to Bautista and Carlos Delgado -- for his four-homer game -- only one man has hit a World Series walk-off home run when his team trailed in the game at the time:\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\nFranchise record: Chris Davis, 53 (2013)\n\nBest achievement: Frank Robinson's 49 home runs in 1966\n\nRobinson ranks just third on the single-season leaderboard for the Orioles, behind Davis and Brady Anderson's all-time fluke season of 50 in 1996, but I give the nod to Robinson for three reasons:\n\n1. His 49 home runs helped him win the Triple Crown.\n\n2. The Orioles, who had acquired Robinson from the Reds in the offseason for Milt Pappas, won the World Series.\n\n3. Robinson's 49 homers towered over the rest of the league that year. Harmon Killebrew was second with 39, and only six players hit 30.\n\nTo be fair, Davis led by nine home runs over Miguel Cabrera in 2013, so he also towered over everyone else. His 31 home runs by the end of June had him on pace to crack 60, before he slowed in the second half. It was a monster season, but Robinson's was a little bit more monster.\n\nCincinnati Reds\n\nFranchise record: George Foster, 52 (1977)\n\nBest achievement: Ted Kluszewski's three straight seasons of 40-plus home runs, with more home runs than strikeouts (1953 to 1955)\n\nFoster's campaign was the only 50-homer season between 1965 (Willie Mays) and 1990 (Cecil Fielder), and the amazing Aristides Aquino just homered 11 times in his first 17 career games. But big Klu did something only one player has done since, hitting 40 home runs with fewer strikeouts than home runs:\n\n1953: 40 home runs, 34 strikeouts\n\n1954: 49 home runs, 35 strikeouts\n\n1955: 47 home runs, 40 strikeouts\n\nThose numbers were impressive then and look ridiculous today as players trade home runs for strikeouts. Barry Bonds hit 45 home runs and struck out just 41 times in 2004. Bonds almost achieved the feat in 2002 (46 home runs, 47 strikeouts) as well, and Albert Pujols nearly did it in 2006 (49 home runs, 50 strikeouts). Kluszewski, however, did it three seasons in a row, and it has only happened 10 times altogether -- Mel Ott, Lou Gehrig (twice), Joe DiMaggio and Johnny Mize (twice) are the others to reach the milestone.\n\nBig Klu was known for his sleeveless jersey, showing off his muscled-up biceps. His power numbers took off in 1953 when the Reds moved in the fences in center field and left field at Crosley Field -- although right field still remained 366 feet away for the left-handed slugger. Klu's peak came to a sudden end when he hurt his back in a clubhouse scuffle in 1956. He hit just 34 home runs from 1957 to 1961. (He had another imprint on the Reds, serving as the team's hitting coach for the Big Red Machine in the 1970s.)\n\nCleveland Indians\n\nFranchise record: Jim Thome, 52 (2002)\n\nBest achievement: Albert Belle's season of 50 home runs -- and 50 doubles (1995)\n\nI love Jim Thome. I love Travis Hafner matching Don Mattingly's record of six grand slams in one season. But dear lord was Belle an absolute wrecking ball in 1995. He is the only player to hit 50 home runs and 50 doubles in the same season -- and remember, 1995 was a strike-shortened season, so Belle did it in a 144-game schedule. In August and September that year, Belle played 58 games and hit an insane .350/.439/.885 with 31 home runs, 23 doubles and 62 RBIs. Belle also is the co-holder of the record for most home runs over a seven-game span (10), tied with Frank Howard (1968 Senators) and Shawn Green (2002 Dodgers).\n\nHonorable mention: Duane Kuiper had 3,379 at-bats in the major leagues -- and hit one home run. In a unique application of \"best achievement,\" maybe Kuiper deserves top honors.\n\nAtlanta Braves\n\nFranchise record: Andruw Jones, 51 (2005)\n\nBest achievement: Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth's all-time record (1974)\n\nEasy call here:\n\nI love this quote from Aaron: \"I looked for the same pitch my whole career, a breaking ball. All of the time. I never worried about the fastball. They couldn't throw it past me, none of them.\"\n\nI never noticed this before, but late in his career, Aaron did a remarkable job of cutting down on his strikeouts while maintaining his power (not that he struck out much before that). Often, older hitters strike out more as they age, as they start guessing to compensate for declining bat speed. From 1969 to 1974, his age-35 to age-40 seasons, Aaron hit 223 home runs and fanned just 303 times. He was a hitter who hit home runs.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\n\nFranchise record: Prince Fielder, 50 (2007)\n\nBest achievement: Fielder's 50 home runs\n\nIt's easy to forget how good and fun young Prince was. From 2007 to 2012, his age-23 season through his first year with the Tigers, he hit .289/.401/.549, averaging 38 home runs and a 151 OPS+. Over that span, only Albert Pujols, Miguel Cabrera and Joey Votto had a higher adjusted OPS. (Remember when first basemen were the game's best hitters?) A neck injury prematurely ended Fielder's career, although he was already in decline before the injury. I think he was one of those players affected by rising fastball velocity, as he pummeled fastballs early in his career.\n\nSan Diego Padres\n\nFranchise record: Greg Vaughn, 50 (1998)\n\nBest achievement: Nate Colbert hitting five home runs in a doubleheader (1972)\n\nThe Padres don't have an illustrious history of sluggers, in part because they've played in tough hitters' parks in Jack Murphy Stadium and Petco Park. They've had just four players hit 40 home runs in a season: Vaughn, Phil Nevin (41), Ken Caminiti (40) and Adrian Gonzalez (40). Vaughn is almost certainly the 50-homer season you least remember, since it was lost in the dust of the McGwire-Sosa chase. Imagine hitting 50 and finishing 20 behind the league leader.\n\nAnyway, Colbert was the masher on the awful Padres teams of the early 1970s, and he tied Stan Musial's record of five home runs in a doubleheader on Aug. 1, 1972. (He also knocked in 13 runs, so a pretty nice all-around day.) This was kind of a big-deal record when I was a kid, and given the few doubleheaders these days, this one might stand for a spell. Here's the fun twist: Colbert grew up in St. Louis and claimed to have been in the stands when Musial hit his five home runs in 1954.\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\nFranchise record: Harmon Killebrew, 49 (1964, 1969)\n\nBest achievement: Killebrew's eight seasons with 40-plus home runs\n\n\"There was nothing subtle about the Idaho strongboy and it was always his intention to mash a pitched ball as hard and as far as he could,\" novelist Donald Honig wrote.\n\nTwins ready to launch in 2019 Keep calm and mash: How the relaxed Twins are rewriting HR-hitting history Story \u00bb\n\nHarmon Killebrew. What a name. One of the most perfect baseball names ever, certainly the name of a slugger and not a slap-hitting second baseman who was quick on the double play. Killebrew actually wasn't as big as his name and power numbers make you think -- he was listed at 6 feet tall and 195 pounds -- but as Honig's quote suggests, he was a modern-day hitter playing in the 1960s, a \"three true outcomes\" kind of guy. Few matched his home run output. Your all-time leaders in 40-homer seasons:\n\nBabe Ruth: 11\n\nKillebrew: 8\n\nHank Aaron: 8\n\nBarry Bonds: 8\n\nAlex Rodriguez: 8\n\nThe Twins/Senators have 10 different 40-homer seasons in franchise history and one guy has eight of them. (Brian Dozier and Roy Sievers have the other two.) It's possible Max Kepler and Nelson Cruz get to 40 this season, but it's also possible the Twins will shatter the all-time single-season team record without a 40-homer guy. Everybody is hitting 'em these days.\n\nAnyway, Killebrew led his league six times.\n\n\"I found out early in life that I could hit a baseball farther than most players, and that's what I tried to do,\" he said.\n\nColorado Rockies\n\nFranchise record: Larry Walker and Todd Helton, 49 (1997, 2001)\n\nBest achievement: Mike Hampton hitting seven home runs in 2001\n\nSince 1993, the year the Rockies were born, they've had 13 seasons in which a player has hit 40 or more home runs. Only the Mariners and Rangers, with 14, have had more. While the Mariners had four players responsible for their 40-homer seasons and the Rangers six, eight different Rockies have hit 40 home runs. Vinny Castilla actually has the most with three, but Nolan Arenado could get there for a third time this year.\n\nThe point: Hitting 40 home runs for the Rockies isn't necessarily a difficult achievement (especially in the pre-humidor days, as only Arenado and Carlos Gonzalez have done it since 2001).\n\nBut hitting seven home runs as a pitcher? That's pretty awesome, no matter the park. Hampton was a tremendous athlete (he was a running back in high school) who hit .311 for the Astros in 1999, .274 for the Mets in 2000 and .344 for the Rockies in 2002. In 2001, he hit .291/.309/.582 with seven home runs (four at home, three on the road) and 16 RBIs in just 79 at-bats. The only pitcher to hit more home runs in a season was Wes Ferrell, who hit nine in 1931 (and he had 128 plate appearances, compared to 86 for Hampton).\n\nChicago White Sox\n\nFranchise record: Albert Belle, 49 (1998)\n\nBest achievement: Pat Seerey hitting four home runs in one game (1948)\n\nUntil Frank Thomas came along, nobody had hit 40 home runs for the White Sox. The record was 37, shared by Dick Allen in 1972 and Carlton Fisk in 1985. Fisk was a 37-year-old catcher who played 153 games that year -- 130 behind the plate. Get this: The White Sox didn't have a 30-homer hitter until 1970, when Bill Melton did it. Before 1970, Gus Zernial (1950) and Eddie Robinson (1951) shared the team record with 29.\n\nFour-homer games in MLB history Bobby Lowe Beaneaters May 30, 1894 Ed Delahanty Phillies July 13, 1896 Lou Gehrig Yankees June 3, 1932 Chuck Klein Phillies July 10, 1936 Pat Seerey White Sox July 18, 1948 Gil Hodges Dodgers Aug. 31, 1950 Joe Adcock Braves July 31, 1954 Rock Colavito Indians June 10, 1959 Willie Mays Giants April 30, 1961 Mike Schmidt Phillies April 17, 1976 Bob Horner Braves July 6, 1986 Mark Whiten Cardinals Sept. 7, 1993 Mike Cameron Mariners May 2, 2002 Shawn Green Dodgers May 23, 2002 Carlos Delgado Blue Jays Sept. 25, 2003 Josh Hamilton Rangers May 8, 2012 Scooter Gennett Reds June 7, 2017 J.D. Martinez D-backs Sept., 4, 2017\n\nOf the 18 players to hit four home runs in a game, only Bobby Lowe has fewer career home runs than Seerey's 86 (Scooter Gennett has 87), and Lowe accomplished his feat in 1894, when home runs weren't really a part of the game (the fans reportedly tossed $160 in silver coins on the field after his fourth home run). Seerey, however, would be considered the least accomplished of the 18, with 4.3 career WAR. He played five full seasons in the majors and led the league in strikeouts in four of them (he didn't play enough in the fifth season), so you can imagine how that went over in an era when strikeouts were frowned upon. His four-homer game came in the first game of a doubleheader on July 18, with his fourth blast coming in the top of the 11th. He would hit just eight more home runs in his major league career.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n\nFranchise record: Shawn Green, 49 (2001)\n\nBest achievement: Green's four-homer game (2002)\n\nGreen had three 40-homer seasons, one with the Blue Jays and two with the Dodgers. Do you remember Green having three 40-homer seasons? That's how crazy some of the offensive numbers were in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. A guy could hit 42, 49 and 42 home runs and fly completely under the radar. In 1998, Green had a 35-35 season -- 35 home runs and 35 stolen bases -- and didn't receive a single MVP vote, not even one 10th-place vote. Wild times.\n\nGreen hit 42 home runs in 2002, when he had the single greatest offensive day in the game's history: Against the Brewers in Milwaukee, he went 6-for-6 with four home runs and a double in a 16-3 victory, setting the record with 19 total bases.\n\nThis came in the middle of a hot streak for Green. As mentioned in the Indians comment, Green hit 10 home runs in a seven-game stretch, matching Frank Howard and Albert Belle.\n\nHouston Astros\n\nFranchise record: Jeff Bagwell, 47 (2000)\n\nBest achievement: Carlos Beltran hitting eight home runs in one postseason (2004)\n\nThree players have hit eight home runs in a single postseason: Barry Bonds in 2002, Nelson Cruz in 2011 and Beltran. The catch, of course, is that Beltran played in only two series that year, as the Astros lost to the Cardinals in the NLCS. For three weeks, Beltran was as great as any player we've ever seen, hitting .435/.536/1.022, stealing six bases in six attempts, drawing more walks than strikeouts, catching everything in center field and scoring 21 runs in 12 games. It was something else.\n\nLos Angeles Angels\n\nFranchise record: Troy Glaus, 47 (2000)\n\nBest achievement: Glaus' 47\n\nThe Angels have had just five 40-homer seasons: two by Glaus, two by Mike Trout (including this season) and one by Albert Pujols. Trout is almost certain to break Glaus' record, since he already is sitting at 41, so we'll probably have a new best achievement soon enough. By the way, the 1975 Angels hit 55 home runs. The entire season. Maybe Trout can top that all by himself with a furious finish.\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nFranchise record: Alfonso Soriano, 46 (2006)\n\nBest achievement: Bryce Harper's 42 home runs in 2015\n\nSoriano put up some video-game numbers for a few seasons, including in his one year with the Nationals when he hit 46 bombs and swiped 41 bags, one of just four 40-40 seasons, joining Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez. He also had a 39-41 season, a 38-35 season and a 36-33 season. So you could go with that 2006 season, although Soriano's 46 home runs ranked just third in the National League.\n\nHowever, Harper's 42 led the league (tied with Nolan Arenado). Just to illustrate how crazy baseball is in 2019, just five seasons ago only six players in the NL hit 30 home runs. This season, there already are 11 players with 30 homers and 26 with at least 25, so we could easily end up with 30-something players -- just in the NL -- with 30 home runs.\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\nFranchise record: Carlos Pena, 46 (2007)\n\nBest achievement: B.J. Upton hitting seven home runs in 2008 postseason\n\nPena is also No. 2 on the Rays' single-season list with 39 home runs. His 2007 season was one of the great out-of-nowhere campaigns, as the previous season he had been let go by three teams and played just 18 games in the majors. He hit .282/.411/.627 for his career season.\n\nBut I'm going with Upton, who had that improbable run for the worst-to-World Series Rays. Upton hit three home runs in the division series, then slugged four more (with 11 RBIs) in the ALCS win over the Red Sox, after hitting just nine home runs in the regular season. Unfortunately, he went homerless in the World Series as the Rays lost in five games to the Phillies.\n\nNew York Mets\n\nFranchise record: Todd Hundley and Carlos Beltran, 41 (1996, 2006)\n\nBest achievement: Daniel Murphy homering in six consecutive postseason games (2015)\n\nPete Alonso is about to surge past Hundley and Beltan and maybe challenge Aaron Judge's rookie record of 52, but Murphy is the only player to homer in six playoff games in a row (and the Mets won the final five of those games). His home runs:\n\nNLDS Game 4: Off Clayton Kershaw\n\nNLDS Game 5: Off Zack Greinke (go-ahead HR in 3-2 win)\n\nNLCS Game 1: Off Jon Lester (first inning)\n\nNLCS Game 2: Off Jake Arrieta (two-run HR in first inning)\n\nNLCS Game 3: Off Kyle Hendricks\n\nNLCS Game 4: Off Fernando Rodney\n\nAlas, Murphy hit .150 in the World Series and made a big error, and the Mets let him walk as a free agent. And he had two huge years with the Nationals.\n\nKansas City Royals\n\nFranchise record: Mike Moustakas, 38 (2017)\n\nBest achievement: George Brett's home runs off Goose Gossage\n\nWait, which one? We have this mammoth blast in the clinching game of the 1980 ALCS (note Brett's slowwwwwwww home run trot):\n\nThen we have the infamous pine tar home run, and damn right I'm going to end this with Brett bursting out of the dugout in a fury of anger, perhaps a symbolic statement for the mad blitz of home runs in 2019:\n\nBy the way, we should conclude with this.\n\nJorge Soler will soon break Moustakas' club record for home runs. Which individual team records might fall this year?\n\nLikely\n\nRoyals: Soler (currently at 35) over Moustakas (38)\n\nMets: Pete Alonso (40) over Todd Hundley and Carlos Beltran (41)\n\nAngels: Mike Trout (41) over Troy Glaus (47)\n\nDodgers: Cody Bellinger (42) over Shawn Green (49)\n\nBrewers: Christian Yelich (41) over Prince Fielder (50)\n\nPossible, but unlikely\n\nBraves: Ronald Acuna Jr. (35) over Andruw Jones (51)\n\nReds: Eugenio Suarez (34) over George Foster (52)\n\nTwins: Max Kepler (33) over Harmon Killebrew (49)"}]}
