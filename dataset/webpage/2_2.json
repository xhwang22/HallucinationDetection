The raw numbers say that he was an average or slightly below-average pitcher for the bulk of his Braves career. His ERA is worse than the league average, but that\u2019s park effects; adjust for that, and it\u2019s average. He didn\u2019t strike a lot of people out and thus allowed a lot of balls in play. Considering the defense behind him, that was not ideal. I expect that the two thoughts that crossed Mahler\u2019s mind most when he was on the mound in those years were \u201cPlease hit it to Hubbard\u201d and \u201cHow did he drop that?\u201d\n\nRick was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Trinity University in 1975. He dominated the low minors but ran into a speedbump in Richmond in 1977. He righted the ship and spent the next three years pitching the International League to a standstill with only 15 relief appearances in the majors in 1979 and two in 1980 to show for it. Bobby finally gave him a full chance in 1981 and he responded by going 8-6 with a 2.80 ERA, pitching both relief and in the rotation.\n\nRick wasn\u2019t as good in 1982 and wound up spending most of 1983 back in Richmond. From 1984 to 1988 he was the workhorse of the big league staff. He pitched very well in the first two years, a combined 30-25 with a 3.32 ERA (well below the league considering the park). The team collapsed anyway, and Mahler had a rough time the next two seasons, even falling out of the rotation in 1987. He rebounded some in 1988, putting up an ERA right about the average, but that team was so bad he went 9-16 anyway. He left as a free agent after the season, but was more or less washed up. After a couple of seasons in Cincinnati and a half season with the Expos, he was released.\n\nThe Braves brought Mahler back (middle of a pennant drive, though nobody quite believed that in June of 1991) but he really had nothing left. Mostly he pitched relief, but did make two starts. In one of them, against the Pirates on July 29, he went six innings, allowed two runs, and got the win. But he wiped out in his second start, against the Giants, and that was the last appearance of his career.\n\nSo, how does he rank? Hard to say. He pitched a lot of innings for the Braves. Only four men (you probably know who) have pitched more for the team since 1966. On the other hand, those innings were largely piled into a five-year stretch where the team went 341-465, so what good were they? He wasn\u2019t an ace, really, he was just the best that they had. The only positive category in which he ever led the league was starts, twice. On the other hand, he led the league in hits allowed four times, earned runs allowed twice, and losses once.\n\nI tend to think that given a real defense behind him, Rick Mahler would have won a lot of games. The Braves\u2019 defense was very bad, and he was a guy who needed a good defense. In a way, it\u2019s surprising that he did as well as he did. Tom Glavine couldn\u2019t have won with the defense Mahler had to work with. In point of fact, he didn\u2019t; he only became Tom Glavine when they were replaced with real infielders. Think on it: if Mahler could put up average ERAs with Bob Horner, Ken Oberkfell, and the Dysfunctional Duo (Ramirez and Thomas) behind him, what could he have done with Lemke and Pendleton?\n\nBut in the end, he didn\u2019t get that chance, and with the hand he was dealt he was ordinary. At any rate, I still don\u2019t really know where to rank him. It\u2019s possible that he really doesn\u2019t belong, but I just couldn\u2019t see it.\n\nRick Mahler Statistics \u2013 Baseball-Reference.com"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3430774/2022/07/18/atlanta-braves-mlb-draft-day-1/", "page_content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Some of Owen Murphy\u2019s hitting statistics were as absurdly good as his jaw-dropping pitching stats at his Illinois high school. And in the immediate aftermath of going to the Braves with the 20th pick of the MLB Draft on Sunday, Murphy said he intended to pursue his dream of being a two-way player, \u00e0 la Shohei Ohtani, and that the Braves had agreed to let him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall it youthful exuberance, or initial excitement over being selected higher than he thought possible before the draft began, but Murphy\u2019s assertion wasn\u2019t accurate. The Braves intend for him, like the other three right-handed pitchers they took with their four picks on the draft\u2019s first day, to pitch. And only pitch.\n\n\u201cHe loves baseball, first and foremost,\u201d Dana Brown, Braves vice president of scouting, said shortly after selecting Murphy and another hard-throwing high schooler, JR Ritchie of Bainbridge Island, Wash., with the 35th pick, a Competitive Balance selection the Braves got from Kansas City in a July 11 trade for Drew Waters and two pitching prospects.\n\n\u201cBut (Murphy) knew going in that he was more of a prospect as a pitcher, and he knew that his path to the big leagues is quicker as a pitcher, so he embraced that, and we were excited about it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe feel like we got a good one.\u201d\n\nBrown returned to the Braves\u2019 draft room after that Zoom interview to prepare for the remaining Day 1 selections: Texas high school pitcher Cole Phillips, whose fastball was clocked at 100 mph before season-ending Tommy John surgery in April that dropped him to the second round at pick No. 57; and Auburn closer Blake Burkhalter, who had 71 strikeouts with seven walks in 46 1/3 innings as a junior.\n\nWhile Brown and his staff were working to make those last two picks, Murphy did a Zoom interview with Atlanta reporters, during which he was asked how hard it would be to give up hitting, considering the Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year hit .550 with 18 home runs in 36 games as a shortstop in his senior year, and set Brookfield-Riverside High career records for homers (30), RBIs (130) and average (.548).\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to going 9-0 with an astounding 0.12 ERA as a senior, throwing four no-hitters, including two perfect games, and allowing 10 hits and four walks with 137 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings. Teams including the Braves thought of him as a potential fourth- or fifth-round pick as a position player, but the Braves saw him as a first-round pitcher.\n\nOwen Murphy, 2022 Draft prospect and @NDBaseball commit, got it done on both sides of the ball in #PDPLeague21 action. The 3B/RHP out of Illinois fanned six and swatted a two-run homer. pic.twitter.com/ZlxQhHGngh \u2014 MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) July 31, 2021\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I am\u201d giving up hitting, Murphy said, to the surprise of reporters who\u2019d heard just minutes before that he was drafted as a pitcher, not a pitcher and hitter. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to pick up the bat, too, so I\u2019m real excited about that opportunity, to try to do the two-way thing for a little bit and do all that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked if the Braves had told him he could be a two-way player, Murphy said, \u201cAbsolutely, yeah. I\u2019ve wanted to two-way forever, it\u2019s one of the biggest parts of my ask (of the team), was just to be a two-way guy and have that opportunity. I love swinging it and I love throwing, I want to do both as long as I can.\u201d\n\nAsked if Angels two-way star Ohtani was a favorite of his, Murphy said, \u201cOh, yeah, absolutely. Just his presence in the league is absolutely nuts. I know I\u2019m not the same stature as him, in all his 6-4 glory and everything. But he\u2019s a great asset to the league and he shows that you can still play the game being an athlete and doing it all. I aspire to be that way and that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d\n\nIt sounded good, including the part about how Murphy would probably \u201cbounce around\u201d all four infield positions when not pitching, or maybe go to the outfield if the team thought it less stressful on his arm.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take long for those quotes to get back to Braves officials, and an hour later Brown made it clear \u2014 again \u2014 that Murphy was drafted as pitcher, and that all parties involved were now on the same page, even if Murphy had briefly strayed from that understanding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely pitcher,\u201d said Brown, who\u2019s in his fourth year as Braves scouting chief and is regarded as one of the best and brightest in the majors at what he does. \u201cWe cleared it up with him and his agent (since Murphy\u2019s interview). The kid is very excited about being a professional player. He felt like he could do both. We made it clear that, look, we drafted you as a pitcher.\n\n\u201cI think that maybe some other clubs may have told him that (he could do both) and he thought maybe he was going to get a chance to both, but we were very clear: Look, we want you to pitch, we think you can be a fast-track-to-the-big-leagues type guy, whether it\u2019s like (Mike) Soroka and moving that fast \u2014 we really feel that good about him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown said the Braves scouted Murphy the past two summers, and it was his performance in summer showcases against top prospects \u2014 many of them drafted Sunday \u2014 that stood out, rather than his jaw-dropping stats in a high school league not nearly as competitive as some in Sun Belt states.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really athletic kid,\u201d Brown said of Murphy, a 6-foot-1, 195-pounder who was a high school quarterback. \u201cHas been up to 96 (mph), big-time strike thrower. Really athletic, clean delivery, with the makings of plus-secondary stuff. So we\u2019re really excited about him, his future, and trying to build arms. We feel like this is a good way.\u201d\n\nIn one Prospect Development Pipeline (PDP) summer game against top prospects, Murphy had 10 strikeouts in four innings.\n\n\u201cThe intriguing thing is, yes, the high school competition (in Illinois) is not equivalent to Texas, California and Florida, but it\u2019s a decent league,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut the most important is, we evaluate these guys and their stats in the summer, and he probably had the best (summer) stats of any of the pitchers, even (Buford High\u2019s Dylan) Lesko. (Murphy\u2019s) stats, his walk rate, his strikeout rate, he was at the top of the chart for all those guys. And in the summer you face the best talent, you face all of those kids that get drafted today.\u201d\n\nBrown had similar assessment of Ritchie, who throws a little harder than Murphy and was scouted by Cody Martin, who pitched for the Braves in 2015. Ritchie was a first-team prep All-American this year after going 7-0 with a 0.39 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 35 1/3 innings.\n\n\u201cWe were excited that he was still there (at No. 35),\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Martin) has seen him throw up to 98. We had Murphy higher on the board, more athletic, but we were shocked that Ritchie made it (to the Braves). His strike-throwing ability and being able to throw up to 98 as a high school kid, we were excited that he fell to us. Getting the extra pick is big. He\u2019s for sure first-round type talent.\u201d\n\nAs for taking two high school right-handers with such high picks, Brown said, \u201cWe know that high school arms are a little more risky than some of the other players, but some of the ways that we can cut down the risk is to make sure that these high school arms have really good command and that they\u2019re pretty athletic. And the common denominator seems to be that, when it comes to high school arms getting to their ability. Like (Max) Fried \u2014 he\u2019s so athletic, good arm strength, and throwing strikes is a big part of what these high school guys do that get to the big leagues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhillips, from Boerne (Texas) High, had 42 strikeouts and no earned runs in 23 1/3 innings before tearing his UCL and having Tommy John surgery in April. He showed his toughness when he tore the ligament but threw three sliders to get the batter out that he was facing at the time, before leaving the game. He fastball had been rated the best in the draft class and he was projected as a high first-rounder before the injury.\n\n\u201cSort of like the (Spencer) Strider pick, when he had Tommy John and was also up against COVID,\u201d Brown said, referring to the Braves rookie who was a fourth-round pick from Clemson in 2020. \u201cSo sometimes you have to strategically take some guys with upside. And with Cole Phillips, I saw the kid throw up to 99, my scouts have seen him throw up to 100. It\u2019s a mid-80s slider. Big-time athlete, big Texas fireballer, and we\u2019re really excited about him.\u201d\n\nBrown also mentioned Strider in relation to plans for Burkhalter, who got a strong recommendation from former Braves ace Tim Hudson, the pitching coach at Auburn.\n\n\u201cWe think he\u2019s got some Strider stuff going on in the delivery, the rise of the fastball, a hard slider, so there\u2019s some excitement there,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd worse comes to (worst), we know we\u2019ve got a big-time end-of-the-game bullpen guy. But we have some plans to try to see if this guy can start, and maybe we can kind of flip this into a Strider-type pick, where you take a college guy that doesn\u2019t have a ton of innings, but he has really good stuff and he\u2019s been up to 98, with a really hard cutter. So yeah, sometimes you have to get strategic, and it could turn into something big.\u201d\n\n(Photo of JR Ritchie: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / USA Today)"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Rick_Mahler", "page_content": "What we do.
