And he got the same end result, with the Reds making it nine points from nine since returning from the international break as they triumphed 2-0 at the City Ground.\n\nKeinan Davis and Scott McKenna found the net against the Blues to make it a perfect week for Forest. The result made it 10 league games unbeaten and saw the club climb to third in the Championship table.\n\nRead more: How the Reds rated against Birmingham\n\nRead more: Re-live the action from the City Ground\n\nBut Cooper faced a selection dilemma beforehand, having seen Joe Lolley, Sam Surridge and a fit-again Lewis Grabban impress from off the bench against both Blackpool and Coventry City. The trio did the same again in Saturday\u2019s win, leaving Cooper with another decision to make for next week's trip to Luton Town.\n\n\"I toyed with whether to make changes, because of it being a three-game week,\" he said. \"The Stoke game (a 2-2 draw in February) was in my head a little bit, because we didn't play so well that day and that was a three-game week.\n\n\"But I decided to go with momentum. I decided to go with connections on the pitch at this particular time. I don't know whether it proved to be right, but we certainly got the result we needed.\n\n\"It was tough. It was a dilemma.\n\n\"At the start of the week, I thought I would make changes at some stage. And probably, if it had gone well, it would have been this one.\n\n\"But I slept on it and decided to go with momentum. It's worked in terms of the result.

They loved it. They never stopped signing all afternoon, serenading the manager and his players as they thumped Birmingham City 3-0. By the end, they were absolutely belting out their chants - mirroring the passion shown on the pitch and the resounding nature of the victory.\n\n\u201cForest are back!\u201d\n\nFour unbeaten. Back-to-back wins. Six goals in two matches. Can it really be less than a fortnight since Cooper's style of play was being scrutinised following his appointment, and Ian Holloway aimed a thinly veiled dig in his direction?\n\nThe Reds have already made great strides.\n\nLewis Grabban, Ryan Yates and Djed Spence bagged the goals to see them off into the international break in style.\n\nWe take a look at some of the big talking points from the match in the West Midlands.\n\nFeeling good\n\nIt sounds simple, but Cooper has already shown he has a knack of getting people - and staff - to feel good about themselves. He highlighted that as something he wants to instil around the club.\n\nListen to a snippet of any of his interviews; he is clearly a natural at putting that into practice.\n\nHe talks up his players. He identifies ways in which they can show their skills on the pitch; pinpoints how they can shine. And he ensures they know he believes in them.\n\nIt is good man management. That's half the battle won.\n\nNo wonder some supporters on social media are affectionately referring to the head coach as Cooperman, impressed by his superpowers.\n\nHe also acknowledges his coaching team, often referring to the work Steven Reid did while he was in caretaker charge.\n\nThat has all helped to quickly create a sense of unity.\n\nForest look confident out on the pitch. Even when they have been tested - as in their previous two games and early on against the Blues - they have an assuredness about them which sees them weather the storm.\n\nThere will no doubt be rockier moments ahead, but Cooper has laid the groundwork.\n\nHe has got key players such as Brice Samba, Grabban and Joe Lolley starting to get back to their best.\n\nThe Bagsman\n\nAnalysis of Saturday's game cannot pass without singling out Grabban.\n\nWritten off. Dubbed 'past it'. Had his captaincy credentials questioned. He's answered his critics, and then some, in the past few games.\n\nThat's four goals in six matches now for the striker, not to mention having come on and made a difference at Barnsley.\n\nHe is benefitting from better service, looking less isolated than he has in the past. But he also has the confidence, and the quality, to go it alone - his rocket at St Andrew\u2019s is testament to that.\n\nIt was a superb goal. Jack Colback set Grabban on his way when he won the ball. The front man then raced up the pitch, his eyes lighting up when he found himself in space. And he then finished with aplomb, bending a fierce strike into the top corner, leaving Matija Sarkic with no chance.\n\nSign on to join the Reds debate We want your views, Reds fans.

Forest\u2019s captain picked the team and the game up by the scruff of the neck on Wednesday night. And he was equally influential on Saturday, setting the perfect example. Watch, too, how he interacts with some of the younger players, in particular.\n\nThe importance of his leadership role has been stressed to Grabban, and it has been reflected in his past few performances.\n\nRoom for improvement\n\nThey kept a clean-sheet, but Saturday still wasn\u2019t a completely perfect performance by the Reds (if such a thing exists). Albeit drama at the other end of the pitch only added to the entertainment value.\n\nThey survived a couple of scares before the opener, when Birmingham twice hit the post. Before the break, Scott Hogan had an effort ruled out for offside. Grabban had to clear a shot off the line. And Samba made some stunning saves, not least one right at the death to claw away Marc Roberts\u2019 header.\n\nThe Reds stopper was determined not to be beaten. Indeed, he had his best game for some time.\n\nBut the visitors did look vulnerable on occasions, particularly at set-pieces.\n\nCooper identified that as an area they need to be better at, without wanting to make too big a fuss of it.\n\nThe fortnight\u2019s break will give him a chance to work on that.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLoan rangers\n\nSometimes the commitment of loanees gets questioned - not just at the City Ground. It\u2019s not something which could be levelled at Spence, Max Lowe, Philip Zinckernagel or James Garner, however.\n\nAll four have been regulars since they signed, with fifth loanee Jordi Osei-Tutu missing out through injury problems.\n\nThe quartet are proving to be good additions for the Reds. Keep up this form and the clamour will grow to get at least some of them signed up on a permanent basis.\n\nSpence posted on social media on Saturday evening, saying: \u201cThis is all I\u2019ve ever wanted. To play and enjoy my football.\u201d\n\nBased on his last few games, it\u2019s a head-scratcher how Middlesbrough were prepared to let him go. He has been brilliant.\n\nHe and Lowe are central to Cooper\u2019s attacking style with a three-man defence - albeit the manager stressed he wants to go forward in numbers (seven is generally not enough, in his view).\n\nZinckernagel showed his class right from the word go, when he joined. It\u2019s always been clear he has bags of talent. He is getting to show that more now, as the Reds press and apply pressure.\n\nThe Watford man wasn\u2019t the standout player on the pitch at St Andrew\u2019s, but he still weighed in with a couple of assists to add to his collection, and could have got on the scoresheet.\n\nGarner, meanwhile, had to contend with a cameo role after dropping to the bench. He hasn\u2019t yet put in the kind of displays he is capable of, but if anyone can coax that form out of him, Cooper (or Cooperman) can.\n\nHow impressed have you been with Cooper?

Recruited in January 2011 to score the goals that would keep the club in the Premier League, he only found the net twice and his season was cut short by injury when he was needed most. The club was relegated in his absence. Yet something remarkable, and unexpected, happened in his fourth appearance.\n\nA late substitute in the League Cup final, Martins had only been on the pitch for six minutes when a moment of confusion between Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny led the ball spilling at his feet with the goal gaping. He couldn\u2019t miss and Arsenal had no time to recover. In the strangest of circumstances, the Nigerian striker marked his temporary stay at Birmingham City with perhaps the most significant goal in the club\u2019s history. His simple finish secured a 2-1 win and only the second major trophy for a club that had been founded in 1875.\n\n\u201cThe celebrations were huge,\u201d says Liam Ridgewell, the Birmingham left-back. \u201cThey went on for days. It was an unbelievable feeling to have actually done it when so many people said we wouldn\u2019t. That was probably a big part of it \u2013 that we wanted to prove everyone wrong: that we could win against a big team. It was a great afternoon, a great evening, a great night, a great early morning and a great next day. It was well worth celebrating.\u201d\n\nBeating Arsenal in a packed Wembley was a far cry from how the cup run began. There were only 6,431 fans at a rain-soaked St Andrew\u2019s for their second-round tie with Rochdale, which proved far from straightforward. A much-changed Blues side briefly trailed to the League One team but they rallied to win 3-2. Late in the second half, the fans were given a first glimpse of the lively Nathan Redmond, who at 16 became the club\u2019s second youngest ever player after Trevor Francis. It was one of the few notable moments of a largely forgettable and unconvincing display.\n\nA favourable draw meant Birmingham City did not face Premier League opposition until the quarter-finals and were at home throughout that run. MK Dons were beaten comfortably enough in the third round, summer signings Alexander Hleb and Nikola Zigic scoring their first goals for the club.\n\nBrentford were the third consecutive League One side to visit St Andrew\u2019s in the competition and Sam Wood\u2019s volley put them in control. The Bees were leading deep into injury time when Kevin Phillips grabbed a late equaliser. Penalties were needed to squeeze through to the next stage, where Aston Villa awaited. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well and we scraped through that,\u201d says Stephen Carr, the experienced right-back and club captain. \u201cThere are always turning points with cups. We rode our luck there and got through. There are loads of things like that in the cups. It can just change and you think: \u2018Maybe we have got an opportunity.\u2019 I think that\u2019s happened to a lot of teams.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get reminded about the Brentford game a lot because one of my best mates is Sam Wood, who scored a volley in that game,\u201d says Ridgewell. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him as well then as I do now, otherwise I\u2019d have tried to kick him a bit harder.\u201d\n\nKevin Phillips celebrates with Nikola Zigic and Liam Ridgwell after scoring against Brentford in the fourth round. Photograph: Reuters\n\nAfter three relatively understated ties, the visit of Aston Villa ratcheted up the tension considerably. The atmosphere was transformed for the first second-city derby to be played under the lights since 2003, when a Birmingham City win at Villa Park had featured a headbutt, two red cards and trouble in the stands.\n\nFrom then on, meetings between Blues and Villa had been consigned to early Sunday afternoon kick-offs in an attempt to suppress any crowd issues, but no such change could be made to the League Cup schedule. So, on a cold December night, a full-strength Blues side were buoyed by a raucous home support. Both teams meant business.\n\n\u201cBloody hell. That was unbelievable,\u201d recalls Carr. \u201cI love derby games \u2013 they already have that spice \u2013 but to have it in a cup as well \u2026 I just remember the atmosphere. How loud it was. Oh my god. My family and all my mates were there. It was just something so special, especially beating them. For players, it\u2019s about getting through to the next round. We know how big the derbies are but, for us, we have to treat it as another game. For the fans, it\u2019s more than that.\u201d\n\nBlues made the breakthrough after just 12 minutes. Cameron Jerome hunted down the ball and teed up the onrushing Lee Bowyer, who was tripped in the area by Richard Dunne. Sebastian Larsson took responsibility, stepping up to score past Brad Friedel. Gabriel Agbonlahor, who enjoyed a great record in derbies, equalised for Villa before half time. Being subjected to endless taunts and provocations never seemed to put him off his stride.\n\nJerome and Zigic, whose substantial wage and ungainly appearance often made him an easy target for frustrated supporters, combined to send Blues through as extra-time beckoned. A low pull-back from the right found Zigic, who scuffed the ball in off Luke Young to spark wild celebrations and begin his ascent to cult hero status. \u201cThe atmosphere was incredible,\u201d says Ridgewell, who had started his career at Villa. \u201cWhen we played Villa before I scored an own goal and we lost, so I didn\u2019t have great memories of playing against them. Beating them on the night went a long way to rectifying that day. After beating your rivals at home, you start to dream of Wembley.\u201d\n\nAt the final whistle there was a pitch invasion from Blues fans looking to goad their Villa counterparts. Rows of police officers tried to hold back the tide as flares were set off by both sets of supporters. Various objects, including seats, were thrown. The stadium announcer\u2019s appeal for a return to order was ignored. A \u00a320,000 fine was later imposed for the disorder but, by then, Birmingham City had already won the cup.\n\n\u201cComing to the end of the match, we sort of expected the pitch invasion, so we were quick to get down the tunnel afterwards,\u201d says Ridgewell. \u201cIt was such a big win, and the night and the occasion was unbelievable. The atmosphere was incredible, so it went hand in hand with that. It was such a great night. I didn\u2019t get to see too much of the pitch invasion, but I certainly heard about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere. The pitch invasion. It was just old-school football, like it used to be,\u201d says Carr. \u201cThe atmosphere was out of this world. You could see what it meant to beat their rivals. It was huge.\u201d\n\nRiot police try to control fans after Birmingham beat Aston Villa at St Andrews. Photograph: Reuters\n\nWest Ham were the last obstacle to overcome before the final. Birmingham City lost the first leg 2-1 and were in dire trouble when Carlton Cole struck again to put them further behind behind at St Andrew\u2019s. They were 3-1 down on aggregate, with 45 minutes to save themselves, when Alex McLeish decided to roll the dice.\n\n\u201cI still thought it was possible,\u201d says Ridgewell. \u201cI still believed we could do it because of the rounds we\u2019d already been through. I felt we were destined to get to the final and go all the way. It was an unbelievable strike from Carlton Cole. A one-in-a-million goal that was a bit of shock to the system. But it spurred us on a little bit. It gave us a little bit of balls and a bit of bite to go on and get through. At half-time we were like: \u2018Right, let\u2019s just go for it. We\u2019ve got nothing to lose. We\u2019re in the second leg of a League Cup semi-final. It\u2019s make or break. Why not just go for it and start attacking them?\u2019 The crowd was willing us on. It was hell for leather. With every goal the crowd got even louder, and the players got more belief. It was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nZigic came on for Matt Derbyshire and transformed the dynamic. As the West Ham defence dropped back to protect its lead, the substitute\u2019s height and aerial threat came to the fore. Blues went direct, seeking out Zigic at every opportunity. The pressure mounted and eventually told.\n\n\u201cYou have to make sure you don\u2019t leave anything out there,\u201d says Carr. \u201cYou had a good group of lads. They weren\u2019t flash, nothing like that. They worked tirelessly for each other and had a massive determination. This was an opportunity that you might not get again, so just give it everything, We came out and went for it. They didn\u2019t know what had hit them. We were relentless. They couldn\u2019t catch their breath. We were on them and the fans were getting behind us. We got our rewards in the end.\u201d\n\nFrom a Larsson corner, the ball fell to Lee Bowyer, who rattled in a half volley just before the hour mark. One more goal was needed to send the game to extra time, and it arrived from another corner. This time Bowyer drilled the ball in and Roger Johnson rose highest to head home. The momentum had swung in their favour.\n\nIn the first half of extra time, Carr seized possession and surged down the right. Approaching the box, he played the ball back inside to Craig Gardner, who tried his luck from distance once more. It wasn\u2019t the cleanest of efforts, but it was just enough to beat a sprawling Rob Green and send Birmingham through.\n\n\u201cWhen you have your fans behind you, driving you on, you can feel something,\u201d says Carr. \u201cYou could see all the lads had that desire to win the game. It was a special game to be involved in. You don\u2019t get them all the time. At home, to come back and get the result, fans going mad, going to a cup final. Amazing. The players were buzzing.\u201d\n\nThe ticket allocation for Blues\u2019 first Wembley final since they beat Carlisle United in the 1995 Auto Windscreens Shield sold out quickly. Thousands descended on London on a grey February afternoon. \u201cI realised what a big deal it was when me and Craig Gardner went to a forum with [local radio presenter and Blues supporter] Tom Ross,\u201d remembers Ridgewell. \u201cWe sat up on the stage and they opened it up to the fans. They were saying they\u2019d rather win the Carling Cup than stay in the Premier League. Me and Craig obviously wanted to stay in the Premier League, for the club to push forward and get better.\n\n\u201cYou always dream about getting to a cup final at Wembley but, unless you play for one of the big teams, do you ever really believe you\u2019re going to get there? Probably not. It was amazing. Getting your suits fitted, sorting tickets, sorting hotels for family. Just the excitement around it was incredible. Even the drive down to the hotel in London was amazing and something to look forward to.\u201d\n\nNikola Zigic scores for Birmingham City against Arsenal at Wembley. Photograph: Reuters\n\nDespite their recent struggles under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Arsenal were still clear favourites. There were even discussions about who would lift the trophy, with captain Cesc F\u00e0bregas ruled out through injury. A brittle yet occasionally brilliant team, Arsenal had shown the two sides to their character in the games leading up to the final. They had beaten Barcelona 2-1 in the first leg of a Champions League tie and then conceded a late equaliser to draw with Leyton Orient in the FA Cup.\n\nBirmingham City were missing the centre-back Scott Dann, so Martin Jir\u00e1nek deputised. The former Arsenal players Hleb and David Bentley were also absent, one injured and the other cup-tied. A cautious Alex McLeish went for one up front, with Zigic supported by runners from midfield.\n\nThe Birmingham City players noticed a degree of overconfidence in their opponents. \u201cArsenal winning the Carling Cup isn\u2019t the same as Blues winning the Carling Cup,\u201d says Carr. \u201cWould there have been a bit more confidence and arrogance from them? Definitely. They could say there wasn\u2019t, but there was a confidence from their fans that they only had to turn up. When you have that, it doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re playing against, it\u2019s a big mistake.\u201d\n\nRidgewell agrees. \u201cWe all turned up in our suits, went outside and looked at the pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cI always remember Liverpool doing it for the FA Cup final when they had their white suits on. So we did the same. Then I remember Arsenal walking in wearing tracksuits like it was a normal day for them. A normal Saturday game. At that point I was looking around at the boys and they all thought: \u2018Hang on a second. They just think they\u2019re going to turn up and walk all over us. That was the turning point for everybody to go: \u2018You know what, let\u2019s fucking stuff it up them. Let\u2019s go and win the game.\u2019\n\n\u201cOur instructions were to follow who you were up against to the death. You stick with them and man-mark them. Every time they got the ball, the manager wanted us to be centimetres away from them. He wanted us to be tackling them every time. The gameplan was just to get stuck into them and, when we got a chance to get the ball, to stick some crosses in. To get it into Nikola Zigic and play off him. It worked a treat.\u201d\n\nThe game started brightly for Birmingham City. Zigic sent Bowyer through on goal and he was brought down by Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Play was pulled back for offside but replays revealed it to be an incorrect decision. A penalty and a red card would surely have followed. Blues brushed off that injustice to take the lead anyway, preying on Arsenal\u2019s frailty from set pieces. Larsson hung a corner up to the edge of the box and Roger Johnson\u2019s header was flicked on well by Zigic. The blue half of the stadium erupted.\n\n\u201cIt was the perfect start,\u201d says Ridgewell. \u201cNikola Zigic was magic for us. Over the years Arsenal got weaker and weaker on set pieces. They certainly were at that point. We knew they were a better footballing team than us, but we knew they weren\u2019t going to outwork us and that we could get them on set pieces. We were playing to our strengths.\u201d\n\nThe lead wasn\u2019t to last. Arsenal engineered a brilliant equaliser, Robin van Persie scoring with a superb volley. However, he was injured in the process. Former Birmingham loanee Nicklas Bendtner came on in his place, while Marouane Chamakh replaced Arshavin. Both were kept at bay impressively by Ben Foster, who made 11 saves and won the man of the match award. At the other end, Keith Fahey rattled the post. Then, against the run of play, came Martins\u2019s moment.\n\nStephen Carr helped to alleviate the mounting pressure by winning a free-kick deep in Birmingham\u2019s half and Foster thumped it forwards speculatively. Zigic won the header and neither Koscielny nor Szcz\u0119sny were decisive enough in claiming the ball, which fell invitingly to Martins 10 yards out. His shot seemed to take an age to hit the net. Martins wheeled away, chased by ecstatic teammates, as another roar went up from the Birmingham end. A wonderfully elaborate and acrobatic celebration, one of the striker\u2019s trademarks, followed the most uncomplicated of goals. Arsenal had wilted, twice undone by a simple, direct approach.\n\n\u201cZigic is a handful,\u201d says Carr. \u201cIt\u2019s not even Zigic winning the ball, it\u2019s what you get from it, because he\u2019s awkward, not easy to play against. That was a strength for us. You\u2019ve got Lee [Bowyer] as well, running off Zigic. A clever runner, getting into positions. We\u2019d got Roger Johnson as well, who was strong in the air. We knew we could get things from set pieces, so we had to maximise that when we did have them.\u201d\n\nThe plan worked. Scenes of disbelieving joy among players, staff and supporters greeted the final whistle. This wasn\u2019t meant to happen. Not to a club like Birmingham City, in such grand surroundings, against as storied an opponent as Arsenal. They were both Premier League sides but the gulf between them was massive and made victory all the sweeter.\n\nStephen Carr, Barry Ferguson and Ben Foster celebrate at Wembley. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d says Ridgewell. \u201cEven thinking about it now puts a smile on my face. It was an unbelievable feeling to know you\u2019ve won a huge cup final against a massive team. And scoring so late on was just phenomenal. Scoring right at the death made it even better. I didn\u2019t really know where to run or who to go and celebrate with.\u201d\n\nCarr, who had come out of retirement to join the club on a short-term contract just two years before, led his team up the steps and lifted the trophy. He had won the League Cup 12 years earlier with Tottenham but this was different. \u201cI was one of the younger players in the team and was at a club where it\u2019s expected that you win things. Not that they won tonnes and tonnes, but there is more of an expectation. When you\u2019re younger you take things for granted. You enjoy the moment, but don\u2019t think about it as much. When you get older, to have another opportunity of winning it was a completely different experience for me. To get a club, come back and win a cup was like a fairytale.\n\n\u201cNo one would give me an opportunity. Ten months out of the game. No football training, just running, doing my own thing. Then coming back, being on trial at Birmingham. We went up on the last game of the season, then went on a great run in the Premier League. To not be playing and then to have that chance, with a club where I was never really thinking about winning a cup\u2026 I never thought I\u2019d have that, especially later on in my career.\u201d\n\nThere would be no open-top bus parade or civic ceremony as Blues focused on their survival effort. There were 12 league games left to beat the drop, but they won just two of them, slipping into the relegation zone on the final day. \u201cThe big problem was that we didn\u2019t have a massive squad and, the further we went in the competition, the more the boys wanted to play,\u201d says Ridgewell. \u201cIf you had a knock or were struggling, you just got through it to get to the cup final. It took more of a toll than we all realised. After the final, towards the end of the season, it was a fight. We were struggling because we had a lot of injuries. People were limping along to get to the cup final and afterwards you suddenly feel a bit drained.\n\n\u201cWe were such a good team, so to get relegated was devastating, certainly in the fashion we did. It took a long time to get over it, if you ever do. I still think about it now. We had a very good team and one we could have built on for next season. But, after that, the team was dismantled and everyone went their own way. People talk about players leaving and that it was easy to go. It wasn\u2019t. It was tough for everybody who left that team because we didn\u2019t feel that we should have gone down, or deserved to go down. But, sadly, that\u2019s football.\u201d\n\nStephen Carr holds the trophy aloft as he celebrates with team-mates after beating Arsenal. Photograph: Reuters\n\nCarr is still at a loss to explain what went wrong. \u201cI wish I had the answer,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing. It wasn\u2019t as if everyone got carried away and downed tools. We just couldn\u2019t seem to get any momentum. We had a few injuries, but even that\u2019s no excuse. It was such a low, low point in my career from one of the highest points in the club\u2019s history. It was horrible. All of a sudden, it\u2019s a different club.\u201d\n\nA summer of sweeping changes followed. McLeish defected to Aston Villa. Club owner Carson Yeung was arrested, and eventually imprisoned, on money laundering charges. Austerity measures were imposed to prevent the club from falling into administration. New owners eventually arrived but have only contributed to the uncertainty, with a raft of different managers, several near escapes from another relegation, a transfer embargo and a points deduction.\n\nYet, if you ask most supporters, they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. The concept of genuine, unalloyed success sits uneasily with Blues fans, so some painful consequences were perhaps only to be expected. Winning the League Cup felt like a seismic moment in the club\u2019s history and its significance has only grown given subsequent events.\n\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d says Ridgewell \u201cIt even gives me tingles now and puts a smile on my face just to know that we did such an amazing thing. To win a major trophy with Birmingham is unbelievable. Hopefully we can all meet up again and talk about it, and celebrate again one day, and look back on how incredible it was. It was a great time and one that I, and all the other players, really enjoyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very sad how the club has gone since then,\u201d says Carr. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. The fans don\u2019t deserve that but they\u2019ll have that memory for the rest of their lives. For us, as players, we\u2019ll always remember. I\u2019m very privileged to have had that opportunity \u2013 to captain such a great group of lads and to win a cup with them and give it to the fans.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-steve-cooper-birmingham-6929092", "page_content": "Boss Steve Cooper praised his Nottingham Forest players for meeting a challenge he had set them before their clash with Birmingham City.\n\nThe Reds celebrated a perfect week as they made it three wins from three since returning from the international break, beating the Blues 2-0. Goals from Keinan Davis and Scott McKenna made it five league victories on the spin for Cooper\u2019s men.\n\nThey are now unbeaten in 10 Championship games and are up to third in the table. But Cooper doesn\u2019t want them to stop there.\n\nRead more: How the Reds rated against Birmingham\n\nRead more: Re-live the action from the City Ground\n\n\u201cIt was a good end to a good week. That\u2019s the first time the club has won three games on the bounce after an international break,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. And it was a challenge I set to the players before the game, asking if we could do that.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been good for it throughout the week. And I think we were good for it today.\n\n\u201cWe got off to a great start. Keinan deserved his goal. He\u2019s been playing so well.\n\n\u201cHe does want to score goals. We don\u2019t get too caught up when he doesn\u2019t, but he would have wanted that. He deserved that, so I\u2019m pleased for him. It was a great goal.\n\n\u201cI felt we could have capitalised on it a bit more in the first half. From the goal until half-time, we\u2019ve played better than that this year.\n\n\u201cBut I get it, it was the third game in a week. Half-time was about stepping on a bit - \u2018come on, get back to being us in a real positive way\u2019.\n\n\u201cI thought we did that in the second half. Scott ended up getting the second goal from a corner, but we could and should have scored a few more goals, really. We got in some great positions. Defensively, I thought we were excellent throughout the game, throughout the pitch.\n\n\u201cThe players have been really, really good this week. The nine points have all been well deserved. We put it to one side now and look forward.\u201d\n\nWhat did you make of Forest's performance? Have your say in the comments below"}, {"url": "https://www.football365.com/news/steve-cooper-nottingham-forest-championship-winners-losers", "page_content": "Only one man could be top of the Championship winners this week, while one old guard manager might be on his way\u2026\n\nWinners\n\nSteve Cooper\n\nYes. Yes. Yes. That\u2019s how you do it. If Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw against Millwall was a brief taste of some of the good things to come under Steve Cooper, then Wednesday\u2019s 3-1 triumph over Barnsley was a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down.\n\nPredecessor Chris Hughton\u2019s side went into themselves after semi-decent first-half performances, most notably the opening-day defeat at Coventry City. It was turning draws into defeats time and time again. Those defeats ultimately cost Hughton his job and in just enough time to allow the right man to save Forest\u2019s season.\n\nIt is too soon to definitively prove Cooper is that man; this is no mini-task ahead of the former Swansea City manager, but he has the credentials, the experience in this division and now some tangible proof of improvement with his current employers. Trailing at the break, Forest improved in the second half, catching Barnsley\u2019s high line out time and time again and executing it to deathly perfection on three occasions in front of a jubilant away end in South Yorkshire.\n\nMillwall and Barnsley may not be the toughest of tests, but they were tests Forest had been failing with sinking colours. They are the tests that Forest needed to pass to achieve the minimum mark of staying in the second tier this season. There are grander plans to come in the long term, and it would be incredibly na\u00efve to believe this is the era that changes that, but Cooper is doing what is needed right here and right now. That\u2019s the best he, and everyone connected to Forest, can ask for.\n\nBrennan Johnson\n\nWhen a managerial change occurs, the best players from one era can disappear into the ether in the next, while a previously disbanded performer becomes a key figurehead under the new man. Boyhood Forest fan Brennan Johnson has been a bright spark in an otherwise desolate start to the season, being one of, if not, the best performer in the opening six weeks of the season under Hughton, and the young winger\u2019s performance against Barnsley \u2013 capped with an assist and a goal \u2013 bridged the gap between Hughton and Cooper. The future is beginning to look bright at the City Ground in more ways than one.\n\nLuton Town\n\nSix games without a win, followed by the most colossal of victories. Luton\u2019s last league win was followed by a 5-0 home reverse to Birmingham City. This bookended haul takes the Hatters up to ninth, despite this being their first three points of September. The season is very much wide open. For a team as varied as Luton, that could be very good or very bad. Based on this evidence, it will be the former.\n\nDeduction Derby winners Derby\n\nDerby County have already received their 12-point deduction, and came oh so close to eating into it against Sheffield United until a moment of Curtis Davies madness. At home to Reading, themselves awaiting a deduction of either six or nine points, Derby did what Derby do best under Wayne Rooney, who is fast proving himself to be amongst the best managers in the division.\n\nThe England record breaker for goals scored has put together one of the greatest defences in the second tier, and in taking the lead and holding onto it, left-back Craig Forsyth\u2019s goal ensured the Rams are the only side not to fall behind at home in the second tier this season.\n\nThree points takes Derby back to positive points. They are far from written off this season, and with Rooney at the wheel, they have every chance of defying the EFL and staying up. It might not be the most romantic of tales given what has happened to this point, but it would make Rooney one of the hottest properties in the managerial game. If Frank Lampard\u2019s job at Pride Park was enough to earn him the Chelsea gig, then a question for Manchester United fans \u2013 is Rooney a better manager than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?\n\nValerien Ismael\n\nSuch is the expectation on West Brom to make an instant return to the Premier League, head coach Valerien Ismael has come under a substantial amount of scrutiny after a \u2018tough\u2019 start to September which saw the Baggies draw three successive games in a trio of extremely winnable matches.\n\nThat Ismael was still to taste defeat in the league and yet encountered his team being booed by small sections of fans at the Hawthorns during and after games and a whole heap of negativity on social media \u2013 and yes, that does matter \u2013 spoke volumes of how much results and excitement are expected.\n\nBut we must hate the game, not the player. Clubs relegated from the Premier League are treated to the glorious riches of parachute payments, meaning expectations are always elevated. We must not attack the West Brom fans who want maximum return, but accept that those expectations arrive with good reason. Ismael has done that and guided the Baggies to two victories in very different circumstances, grinding out a home win over QPR before dismantling Cardiff City on Tuesday night in the Welsh capital.\n\nWest Brom fans will do well to remember the near miracles Ismael worked with a far inferior Barnsley squad last season. Six wins and four draws later, West Brom are every bit as capable as anyone of going one further than the Tykes.\n\nIlias Chair\n\nChair is a wonderful young player, with magic in his boots (and that genuinely might not be figuratively if you\u2019ve seen the diminutive talisman at his best). It was evident from his loan spell with League 2 Stevenage some years ago and the Moroccan now dons the number 10 shirt for QPR. But after such a great rise comes an inevitable fall and he was culpable against West Brom at the weekend.\n\nBut Chair picked himself up by scoring a double \u2013 one deflected and the other a well-taken strike \u2013 to bring to an end of three straight defeats in four winless games. Talk about redemption.\n\nAlex Mowatt\n\n\u2018Ave it. Alex Mowatt should register that left foot as a weapon of mass destruction. There are players who don\u2019t score tap-ins and then there is Alex Mowatt. His decision to follow Ismael to West Brom is looking smarter by the match. Keep this up and he\u2019s a contender for Player of the Season. He\u2019s a shoo-in for the best signing of the summer too.\n\nDanny Ward\n\nBut for injuries throughout the latter stages of his career, Danny Ward could have been one of the Championship\u2019s top marksmen, possessing all the traits needed to be a sharp shooter in the second tier. Tuesday night\u2019s double against Blackburn showcased just how good the former Cardiff and Rotherham forward can be when fit and firing.\n\nAn all-round energetic performance was capped with two well-taken second-half goals which were the difference between winning and losing. After recent results for Huddersfield, and recent years for Ward, this was just what the physio ordered.\n\nDavid Cornell\n\nWhen Wales goalkeeper David Cornell was brought into Peterborough over the summer, he was very much expected to be back-up bordering on competition for first-choice Christy Pym. But Pym has been dropped by manager Darren Ferguson in recent weeks over misconduct in the changing room after a match, leaving Cornell deputising between the sticks.\n\nEnter stage right, promotion-chasing Bournemouth. The Cherries, happy for their second bite at the Championship, rocked up at the Posh on a run of four straight wins but found no way past the former Northampton number one. A first Peterborough clean sheet, against Scott Parker\u2019s men of all teams, will be a big confidence boost for the entire team.\n\nAlexsandar Mitrovic\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before. When Mitrovic excels at this level, we are all a little guilty of not giving his output the requisite attention. A first-half hat-trick against Swansea took Mitrovic past 50 second-tier goals in just his second full season at this level. He is quite ridiculous.\n\nTom Eaves\n\nThe scorer of Hull\u2019s second goal since the opening day of the season, Eaves\u2019 strike earned what could be a crucial point in kickstarting Hull\u2019s campaign after the false start that was the 4-1 opening day victory at Preston. A home draw against fellow promoted side Blackpool is not what dreams are made of, but it may just light the touch paper of the Tigers\u2019 season.\n\nJed Wallace\n\nA penalty it might have been, but Jed Wallace\u2019s spot-kick was the only goal of a game between two sides who appear destined for mid-table come May. It was a first win in six for the draw specialists, but lifts the Londoners to a point behind Nigel Pearson\u2019s top-half side, and just four points off a play-off place. In another set of fixtures which threw up more than a few surprises, fantasies of being able to get something more from this season is cause for celebration.\n\nLosers\n\nMick McCarthy\n\nLike Chris Hughton, this is one old guard of the Championship managerial elite whose number appears to be up. He brought a serious case of new manager bounce with him to the blue corner of south Wales when he rocked up in the middle of last season, but just as Neil Harris\u2019 time with the club came to a catastrophic end, so too is his replacement\u2019s, for whom time is fast running out to make amends for successive thrashings and four straight defeats.\n\nMcCarthy never appeared to be the long-term answer; it is becoming patently clear he is no longer the right man in the immediacy either. Cardiff are dropping like a stone. They would do well to drop McCarthy too.\n\nCurtis Nelson\n\nIt takes some effort to be one of five centre-backs starting in a home match and still stand out as by far the worst on the night. While none of the quintet shone in a 4-0 drubbing at the hand of West Brom, Nelson\u2019s performances of late have been the most disastrous, culminating in getting the finishing touch for an own goal that would make even Danny Baker blush. In truth, no defenders can take solace from conceding nine goals in two games in the space of four days, but Nelson has been comically bad in both contests, so he makes the cut here.\n\nCoventry City\n\nWhere did that come from? It is of course important to remember that this is one game. Whether losing by one goal or five, and Coventry did the latter, it is still three points dropped, or zero picked up. The goal difference takes a hit, but that is of little to no consequence at this stage of the season.\n\nCoventry\u2019s superb start to the season has been borne out of their imperiously perfect home form, so defeat to Luton, albeit out of sorts themselves, should not cause great cause for concern. They are here because this is a big bump back down to Earth, and conceding five goals is never a good look. But make it six home wins from six at the weekend against Fulham and this will be a mere bump in the road and the briefest of sojourns to the losers section of this column.\n\nBarnsley\n\nTo reiterate what was said here at the weekend:\n\n\u2018Barnsley were in similar trouble at the start of last season \u2013 a poor start led to Gerhard Struber\u2019s departure and in turn, the arrival of Ismael. If the rest is history, then so too might be Schopp with more poor results and performances.\u2019\n\nAnother poor result and performance later, Schopp\u2019s position is no better. They are in the bottom three on points earned this season. They are perhaps bottom of the entire pile for optimism of changing that. Right now, Derby \u2013 with their 12-point deduction \u2013 look superior and more likely to finish above the Tykes."}]}
