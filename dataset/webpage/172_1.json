Priklju\u010duje se omladinskom sistemu Rudara, te sa 16. godina ostvaruje svoj prvi profesionalni nastup za seniorski tim. Jedna sezona u kojoj se ostvario 14 nastupa bila je dovoljna da mu austrijski Vorw\u00e4rts Steyr da \u0161ansu.\n\nOdlazak iz Kaknja ogromna pogre\u0161ka?\n\nOdlazak u Vorw\u00e4rts za Hasagi\u0107a nije bio uspje\u0161an. Dobio je ugovor na jednu godinu te iako je upisao 21 nastup nije uspio uvjeriti klub da mu produ\u017ee ugovor.\n\nNakon Austrije Hasagi\u0107 odlazi u Tursku kako bi igrao za Altay. Uspio je uvezati 42 nastupa i dvije sezone u turskom klubu bije nego \u0161to je ponovo ostao bez kluba.\n\nSa 20 godina i ve\u0107 dva kluba iza sebe Hasagi\u0107 je odlu\u010dio da se vrati u rodnu BiH kako bi ponovo vratio formu koju je pokazivao kao omladinski igra\u010d.\n\nPotpisuje za Bosnu iz Visokog za koju upisuje 8 nastupa, te narednu sezonu vra\u0107a se u Kakanj kako bi igrao za Rudar. Uspje\u0161na sezona sa Rudarom privukla je pa\u017enju \u017deljezni\u010dara za koji potpisuje 1. jula 2002. godine.\n\nSa dolaskom u FK \u017deljezni\u010dar, Hasagi\u0107 je shvatio da mu je ovo odli\u010dna prilika te je vezao odli\u010dan nastup za odli\u010dnim nastupom.\n\nU samo dvije sezone sa \u017deljezni\u010darom upisao je 55 nastupa i osvojio svoj prvi i jedini trofej u karijeru, a to je bio Kup BiH u sezoni 2002/2003.\n\nKenan Hasagi\u0107 je definitivno jedan od najboljih golamana u historiji BH fudbala\n\nKvalitetni nastupi u \u017deljezni\u010daru su naveli tada\u0161njeg selektora reprezentacije BiH da mu da \u0161ansu, te Hasagi\u0107 postaje prvi golman reprezentacije BiH.\n\nDruga \u0161ansa u Turskoj koju nije propustio\n\nKenan Hasagi\u0107 sredinom 2004. godine ponovo se seli u Tursku, ali ovaj put obla\u010di dres Gaziantepspora, te postaje standardan u startnoj postavi.\n\nKroz tri godine sa Gaziantepsporom pokazao je koliko je konstantan i pouzdan golman te tako\u0111er da povrede ne uti\u010du mnogo na njega. Upisao je 86 nastupa i postao favorit turskog kluba.\n\nU 2007. godini \u010dini svoj posljednji transfer u karijeri i prelazi u Istanbul Basaksehir. Iako se tada Basaksehir nije borio za titulu i nije predstavljao preveliku prijetnju velikoj trojci Hasagi\u0107 se uvijek trudio da svoj klub stavi u najbolju mogu\u0107u poziciju.\n\n\u010cinjenica da je Hasagi\u0107 nakon zavr\u0161etka svoje karijere ostao u fudbalu kao trener golmana pokazuje koliko voli ovaj sport i koliko voli golmansku poziciju.\n\nOdlazi iz Basaksehira kao omiljen me\u0111u navija\u010dima i svojim kolegama igra\u010dima.
