They enjoy global fame and a worldwide following. Hundreds of millions of people watch each of the game\u2019s four Major men's tournaments and the winners of these most prestigious events become household names. Golf fans would recognise tens, if not hundreds, of current professional players and, even non-golfing sports fans would be able to recall a decent number.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the case and there are many great golfing champions who have been consigned to the dustbin of history.\n\nNow, winning a single Major championship is enough to set a player up for life, whereas in days gone by it might have earned them a few hundred pounds and a pat on the back at their local club.\n\nBelow we take a look at the fascinating stories of some of those Major champions whose achievements have been forgotten, or perhaps disregarded, by all but the most enthusiastic golf statisticians.\n\nRalph Guldahl (1911 \u2013 1987)\n\nRalph Guldahl (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBorn the year before Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, Ralph Guldahl\u2019s playing career peaked and troughed twice before either of those golfing legends reached their prime. The Texan turned pro in 1931 and quickly won the Santa Monica Open; he took the Arizona Open title the following season. In the 1933 US Open, the 6 foot 2 inch 21-year-old made up nine shots on Johnny Goodman in just 11 holes at the end of the final round. Guldahl faced a four-foot putt on the last green to force a playoff. He missed and effectively gave up competitive golf for three years, returning to his home in Dallas and becoming a used car salesman. But he took up the game again in 1936 and, between 1937 and 1939 Guldahl was arguably the best player in the world. He was second in the 1937 Masters before winning the US Open at Oakland Hills by two shots. He was second again in the 1938 Masters and successfully defended his US Open title, winning this time by six strokes at Cherry Hills. In 1939 he finally got his victory at Augusta and claimed three further titles that season.\n\nFor that brief spell, Guldahl was at the very pinnacle of the sport. But from 1940 onwards he lost his game and he quit tournament golf. He played his last US Open in 1949.\n\nMany believed his involvement in the writing of an instructional book was the reason for his golfing collapse \u2013 it caused him to over-analyse his game. Guldahl put it down to a lack of competitive drive and weariness because of the travelling.\n\nHe became a teaching professional at Braemar Country Club in California in 1959 where he worked until his death in 1987. Among many others, one of his students at Braemar was eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.\n\nJack Fleck (1921 \u2013 2014)\n\nJack Fleck - 1955 US Open champion\n\nWith Ben Hogan safely in the clubhouse two clear of little-fancied Jack Fleck, almost everyone had given \u201cThe Hawk,\u201d the 1955 US Open title. NBC television finished their coverage before Fleck had completed his round, ending with a shot of Gene Sarazen congratulating Hogan on another US Open title.\n\nBut Fleck still had four to play. He birdied the 15th and 18th holes to fire a 67 and tie Hogan at the top. The following day, Fleck beat the great champion in an 18-hole playoff.\n\nFor many years after Fleck\u2019s surprise victory at Olympic Club, his triumph was dismissed as a fluke. He was portrayed as a club pro or journeyman, a one-hit-wonder. It\u2019s true he didn\u2019t exactly become a world-beater, but he won twice more on the PGA Tour, recorded 41 top-10s on the circuit and made the cut in 261 of the 271 tournaments he entered.\n\nThe truth is Fleck was not the man the vast majority of golf fans wanted to win at Olympic Club. His triumph over Hogan could be compared to Stewart Cink\u2019s playoff victory over Tom Watson at Turnberry in 2009: The golfing public longed for a different result.\n\nAt the presentation ceremony in 1955, Hogan announced he was, \u201cthrough with competitive golf.\u201d Many of those watching began crying. Even Fleck\u2019s own son said to him, \u201cI rooted for you dad but I was sorry Hogan lost.\u201d\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t until recently, and particularly with the US Open returning to Olympic Club in 2012, that Fleck\u2019s achievement was more fully appreciated.\n\nFleck drove for 49 hours from his home in Iowa to San Francisco in June 1955. He opened his US Open campaign with a 76, nine shots worse than leader Tommy Bolt.\n\nBut he bounced back with a 69 to be in contention with two rounds to play. His closing 67 was one of the great Major rounds and his playoff win over the world\u2019s best player was a phenomenal display of ability and self-belief.\n\nDick Burton (1907 \u2013 1974)\n\nDick Burton (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nRichard \u201cDick\u201d Burton held the title of Open Champion longer than any man in the history of the tournament. He lifted the Claret Jug at St Andrews in 1939 and the competition was not held again until 1946, after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nWhen sending his application to the R&A in 1946, he included a short letter - \u201cDear Sirs, Please find enclosed my fee of five guineas for this year\u2019s Open. I will bring the trophy back when I come.\u201d\n\nBurton was no flash in the pan. Club professional at Ellesmere Port (then called Hooton) Golf Club and latterly Sale Golf Club, he won his first title at the 1934 Northern Professional Championship. He won seven professional tournaments and played three times in the Ryder Cup.\n\nBut his Open victory in the home of golf was his finest moment. Needing to shoot 72 in the final round to win, Burton birdied the 18th to beat Johnny Bulla by two strokes. Just a few weeks later war broke out and Burton enlisted in the RAF.\n\nIn later life, Burton was asked if he felt regret at not being able to take advantage of his Open triumph.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough,\u201d he replied. \u201cA lot of those who watched me at St Andrews also went off to war and they never came back. Some of my friends didn\u2019t make it either, I did.\u201d\n\nLionel Hebert (1928 \u2013 2000)\n\nLionel Hebert (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs a young adult, Lionel Hebert had to make a decision whether to be a golfer or a musician. He was an excellent trumpet player and had gone to Louisiana State University to study music.\n\nBut, following in his brother Jay\u2019s footsteps, Lionel decided to embark on a career as a pro golfer.\n\nThe Heberts (pronounced A-bear) were Cajuns \u2013 an ethnic group found mainly in Louisiana, descended from French speaking Acadians (now a part of Canada.)\n\nLionel and Jay are the only brothers to have won the USPGA Championship. Lionel was the last match-play winner in 1957, while Jay took the title in stroke-play format in 1960.\n\nLionel played an incredible 580 events on the PGA Tour and senior tour. He was twice chairman of the PGA tournament committee and a founding member of the senior tour. But he never travelled to play in the Open championship as he maintained the trip was, \u201ctoo pricey.\u201d\n\nHerman Keiser (1914 \u2013 2003)\n\nHerman Keiser (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe 1946 Masters marked the re-start of significant professional golf following the Second World War. The stars of the day had gathered and the Augusta patrons anticipated a great battle between Hogan, Snead and Nelson.\n\nBut, after three rounds it was a relatively unknown pro from Missouri \u2013 Herman Keiser \u2013 who held a five-shot lead.\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe Missouri Mortician\u201d for the somber expression he wore on the golf course, Keiser had served 31 months at sea during the war, aboard the U.S.S Cincinnati.\n\nHogan caught Keiser with one hole to play at Augusta but \u201dThe Hawk\u201d three-putted the final green and Keiser was the champion.\n\nKeiser played in the Ryder Cup of 1947 when the US won by 11-1. That one point for Britain came courtesy of Keiser\u2019s singles defeat by Sam King. \u201cThe Mortician\u201d quit competitive golf in the mid 1950s and bought a driving range in Ohio.\n\nAndy North (born 1950)\n\nAndy North - Twice US Open champion\n\nBest known to golf fans as a television commentator, Andy North won three events on the PGA Tour. There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about that, except two of those titles were the US Open.\n\nNorth had won the 1977 Westchester Classic, but coming into the 1978 US Open at Cherry Hills he could have been fairly described as a good journeyman. He wasn\u2019t considered a contender, but he outlasted Nicklaus, Watson, Miller and Player to win by a stroke.\n\nHe disappeared off the golfing radar again through the early 80s, recording just nine top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour between 1979 and 1984. But he reappeared in 1985 to win the US Open again, this time at Oakland Hills. After 1985, North recorded just three more top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.\n\nBilly Burke (1902 \u2013 1972)\n\nBilly Burke - 1931 US Open champion\n\nBilly Burke\u2019s victory in the 1931 US Open was notable for two reasons: He was the first Major champion to use steel-shafted clubs and his triumph came after the longest playoff in Major history.\n\nAfter four rounds at the Inverness Golf Club in Toledo, Burke was tied at the top of the leaderboard with George Von Elm. They returned for a 36-hole playoff the following day and were still tied after that. Another 36-hole playoff ensued and, this time Burke won by one \u2013 144 holes and 589 strokes, compared to Von Elm\u2019s 590.\n\nHaving lost a finger working in a foundry as a teenager, Burke used an unorthodox grip with considerable success. He recorded 80 top-10 finishes during his PGA Tour career. The son of Polish immigrants, Burke (born Burkowski) played in the Ryder Cups of 1931 and 33 and was undefeated.\n\nOther Forgotten Major Winners\n\nThe forgotten Major winners talked about above were just some of those considered in the research for this piece. There are numerous others, and too many to cover in detail.\n\nFor example, Walter Burkemo, the 1953 USPGA champion. He had only one other PGA Tour win during his career and quit the tour in 1954 to go back to life as a club pro.\n\nDick Mayer won the 1957 US Open, and was PGA Tour player of the year. But he battled with alcoholism and it\u2019s generally viewed this prevented him winning more. He died aged 64.\n\nDick Mayer - 1957 US Open champion\n\nAccording to Sam Snead and Ben Hogan, 1950 USPGA champion Chandler Harper was the best putter in the world. He was a great friend of Bobby Jones and, in later life, became a mentor to Curtis Strange.\n\nHow about back-to-back English winners of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1936 \u2013 Alf Perry and Alf Padgham? Perry\u2019s best Open finish was a tie for 17th prior to winning at Muirfield in 1935 while Padgham, having left his clubs in the Hoylake pro-shop overnight, had to break a window to retrieve them in time for his third round in 1936.\n\nAlf Perry - 1935 Open Champion\n\nAll these men earned some sort of fame from golf, no matter how briefly. But none were rewarded financially to anywhere near the extent of today\u2019s Major winners whose lives are changed for good by the endorsements and invitations that flow in. So when the green jacket is presented next April, spare a thought for Ralph Guldahl. When the Claret Jug is lofted at Royal Troon, consider Dick Burton and the two Alfs.\n\nThese great old warriors make up an important part of golf\u2019s rich tapestry, it\u2019s just the patch they occupy has become a touch faded."}, {"url": "https://earlyaviators.com/eburke.htm", "page_content": "WICHITA: AVIATION CAPITAL.\n\nHOW DID IT ALL BEGIN?\n\nWAVELINK News Magazine\n\nELLIOTT AVIATION\n\n\n\nYou will find several references to Billie, as well as several other pioneers in this article from the Magazine.\n\nThe following paragraphs refer specifically to Billie:\n\n\"There can\u2019t be an aviator in this land who has not heard about Walter Beech and Clyde Cessna. But how many are familiar with these other names that were so important to the early days of aviation ? Jake Moellendick, Lloyd Stearman, Billy Burke, Matty Laird, and a 90-horsepower, water-cooled powerplant named the OX5?\n\nThe history of aviation in Wichita is a long and complex story involving many pioneering pilots, aviation enthusiasts and companies, some short lived. In our limited space, this article will focus on just a few of the early highlights and seminal events that started Wichita on a flight plan to world prominence.\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\n\nEarly in 1911, Clyde V. Cessna, from tiny Rago, Kansas, went to New York and stayed for a brief period learning how airplanes were built. He then went to Enid, Oklahoma where he built one airplane a year and started his barnstorming career. In the Fall of 1916, he moved to Wichita, and his first airplane built there took to the air in 1917. It wasn\u2019t until after 1919, however, when there was a multitude of aviators who had been taught to fly during World War I, that aircraft manufacturing was of any consequence. That year marked the start of the aircraft industry in a most unlikely place - Wichita, Kansas.\n\nMany of those familiar with early Wichita aviation history consider a wealthy oil man from the East to be the \"Father of Aerospace in Wichita.\" His name was Jake Moellendick, and he had migrated to Wichita by way of Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Among other business interests, Jake was the financial \"angel\" behind the Wichita Airplane Company, a barnstorming, joy hopping, flight training and taxi service. After becoming dissatisfied with the direction the company was going, Jake sent for Billy Burke, head of the National Exhibition Flyers, and made him the new manager. Burke then brought in airplane designer E.M. \"Matty\" Laird from Chicago, about the same time that Jake got a ride in a Curtis Hisso. That ride crystallized Jake\u2019s vision of the mammoth potential for aircraft in business and commerce. Shortly thereafter, the E. M. Laird Company, an airplane manufacturing business, was born.\n\nMatty, his cohort Buck Weaver and Billy Burke set about building an OX5 powered three-place, open cockpit aircraft. The OX5 was a proven powerplant, and war surplus OX5\u2019s were plentiful and cheap. This was a most important consideration in early aircraft manufacturing, and therefore the OX5 engine was key to Wichita\u2019s first steps toward aviation glory.\n\nAfter several successful tests of Matty\u2019s creation, they decided to build 10 aircraft per year, constituting the first solid action in commercial aircraft manufacturing. From that point on, Wichita\u2019s die was cast.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Permission to reproduce these paragraphs from the article was granted by Mike Turner of WAVELINK Nes Magazine.

He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/Billy_Burke_(golfer)", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nWilliam John Burke, Burkauskas (polonized Burkowski) (December 14, 1902 \u2013 April 19, 1972) was a prominent Lithuanian American professional golfer of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nBurke was born in Naugatuck, Connecticut. His greatest season was 1931, when he won the U.S. Open, reached the semi-finals of the PGA Championship, and won four events on the professional circuit, plus appeared on the Ryder Cup team where he was undefeated in two matches. He was also selected for the 1933 Ryder Cup team but not before some agitation by Gene Sarazen was done on his behalf.[1] Burke won his only match in the 1933 competition.\n\nBurke's 1931 U.S. Open win came in a marathon playoff. He and George Von Elm were tied at 292 (8-over-par) after regulation play. They played a 36-hole playoff the next day and tied again at 149 (7-over-par). The following day they played 36 more holes and Burke emerged victorious 148 to 149.\n\nThroughout Burke's golf career he used an unorthodox grip due to the loss of two fingers on his left hand.[2] In 2005, Burke was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.[3] Burke died in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nProfessional wins (17)\n\nPGA Tour wins (13)\n\nMajor championship is shown in bold.\n\nOther wins (4)\n\nthis list may be incomplete\n\nMajor championships\n\nWins (1)\n\nYear Championship 54 holes Winning score Margin Runner-up 1931 U.S. Open 2 shot deficit +8 (73-72-74-73=292) Playoff 1 George Von Elm\n\n1 Defeated George Von Elm in a playoff.

It remains as remarkable a tale today as it was 81 years ago.\n\nBurke -- born Burkowski -- was the son of a Polish immigrant blue-collar worker. He fell in love with golf when, as a frail 12-year-old, he caddied for the first time at Naugatuck Golf Club.\n\nHis teenage years were spent lugging bags for club members. When the rounds were finished, Burke would ask to borrow members' clubs so he could practice. At 16, playing in a driving rain, he won the club championship.\n\nUpon graduating Naugatuck High, he worked at a rubber factory and later the iron foundry, practicing his golf game when the 5 p.m. whistle blew. A foundry accident cost him two fingers on his left hand, leaving Burke with an awkward swing. Still, his golf game thrived. By 1923, he was the Connecticut amateur champion.\n\nIt all led to his historic victory at the '31 Open, held at the Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio. If a scorching heat wave wasn't enough -- temperatures exceeded 100 degrees that week -- Burke had to endure a marathon playoff with George Von Elm.\n\nThe two were tied after four rounds. Playoff rules at the time required another 36 holes. Still deadlocked, officials called for an additional 36 holes. Burke burned through 32 cigars over the grueling 144 holes, but wound up winning by a single stroke to earn the grand prize -- a whopping $1,000.\n\nRules were quickly changed to avoid a similar playoff marathon. Burke, hailed as the next Bobby Jones, returned to Naugatuck a conquering hero. He was a semifinalist at the PGA Championship later that year. But he never won another major, placing third at the Masters twice (1934 and '39) and had two more top 10 finishes at the U.S. Open. He retired with 17 tour victories and played on a pair of Ryder Cup teams.\n\nBurke died in Clearwater, Fla., at age 69 in 1972."}, {"url": "https://www.thegolfauction.com/1931_us_open_scorecard-lot3205.aspx", "page_content": "2011 Fall Golf Memorabilia Auction\n\nThis lot is closed for bidding.

She is best known to modern audiences as Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie musical The Wizard of Oz (1939).Burke was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938). She is also remembered for her appearances in the Topper film series. Her unmistakable high-pitched, quivering and aristocratic voice, made her a frequent choice to play dimwitted or spoiled society types.She was married to Broadway producer and impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. from 1914 until his death in 1932.Early lifeBurke was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Blanche (n\u00e9e Beatty) and her second husband, William \"Billy\" Ethelbert Burke. She toured the United States and Europe with her father, a singer and clown who worked for the Barnum & Bailey Circus. Her family settled in London where she attended plays in the West End. She began acting on stage in 1903, making her debut in London in The School Girl. Her other London shows included The Duchess of Dantzic (1903) and The Blue Moon (1904). She eventually returned to America to star in Broadway musical comedies.CareerBurke went on to play leads on Broadway in Mrs. Dot, Suzanne, The Runaway, The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, and The Land of Promise from 1910 to 1913, along with a supporting role in the revival of Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's The Amazons. There she met producer Florenz Ziegfeld, marrying him in 1914. Two years later they had a daughter, author Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson (1916\u20132008).Burke was signed for the movies and made her cinematic debut in the title role of Peggy (1915). Her success was phenomenal, and she was soon earning what was reputedly the highest salary of any film actress up to that time. She followed her first feature with the 15-part serial Gloria's Romance (1916), another popular and critically acclaimed vehicle. By 1917, she was a favorite with silent-movie fans, rivaling Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Clara Kimball Young and Irene Castle. She starred primarily in provocative society dramas and comedies, similar in theme to The \"Mind-the-Paint\" Girl, her most successful American play. Her girlish charm rivaled her acting ability, and as she dressed to the hilt in fashionable gowns, furs and jewelry, her clothes sense also won her the devotion of female audiences. Among the films in which she appeared during this period were Arms and the Girl (1917), The Mysterious Miss Terry, Let's Get a Divorce (1918), Good Gracious, Annabelle (1919), Away Goes Prudence (1920) and The Frisky Mrs. Johnson (1920). As a nod to himself for his wife appearing for Zukor and Lasky, Ziegfeld insisted on promotions for each of the films to carry the tag 'By Special Arrangement with Florenz Ziegfeld'.Burke's beauty and taste made her a major trendsetter throughout the 1910s and 20s. As early as 1909, following her Broadway performance in My Wife (1909), department stores began carrying the \"Billie Burke Dress\" with a signature flat collar and lace trim. During this time, much of Burke's on- and off-screen wardrobe was provided by the leading European couturier Lucile (in private life, Lady Duff Gordon), whose New York branch was the fashion Mecca of socialites and entertainment celebrities. Burke reflected on her reputation as \"a new kind of actress, carefree, and red-headed, and I had beautiful clothes.\"In 1916, Burke had a daughter. In 1917, Burke endorsed Pond\u2019s Vanishing Cream.Despite her success in film, Burke eventually returned to the stage, appearing in Caesar's Wife (1919), The Intimate Strangers (1921), The Marquise (1927) and The Happy Husband (1928).When the family's investments were wiped out in the Wall Street Crash the following year, she resumed screen acting to aid her husband.Burke made her Hollywood comeback in 1932, when she starred as Margaret Fairfield in A Bill of Divorcement, which was directed by George Cukor. She played Katharine Hepburn's mother in the film, which was Hepburn's debut. Despite the death of her husband Florenz Ziegfeld during the film's production, she resumed acting shortly after his funeral.In 1933, Burke was cast as Millicent Jordan, a scatterbrained high-society woman hosting a dinner party in the comedy Dinner at Eight, directed by George Cukor, co-starring with Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, John Barrymore, Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery. The movie was a great success and revitalized her career. She subsequently starred in many comedies and musicals, typecast as a ditzy, feather-brained upper-class matron, with her high-pitched voice.In 1936, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filmed a biopic of Florenz Ziegfeld (The Great Ziegfeld), a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Luise Rainer as Ziegfeld's common-law wife, Anna Held). William Powell played Ziegfeld and Myrna Loy played Burke; this infuriated Burke, who was under contract to the studio and believed she could have played herself, however, MGM considered her too old to cast in the part of her younger self.Burke appeared in Topper (1937) in which she played the twittering and puritanical Clara Topper, who is married to a man haunted by socialite ghosts played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. She returned to the role in the film's sequels. Her next performance as Emily Kilbourne in Merrily We Live (1938) resulted in her only Oscar nomination. In 1938, she was chosen to play Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the musical The Wizard of Oz (1939), directed by Victor Fleming, starring Judy Garland. She had previously worked with Garland in the film Everybody Sing, in which she played Judy's histrionically hysterical actress-mother. Director George Cukor offered her the role of Aunt Pittypat in Gone With the Wind (1939), but she declined it. The role went to Laura Hope Crews, in a performance that Cukor wanted to be played in a \"Billie Burke-ish manner\" with \"the same zany feeling\". Another successful film series followed with Father of the Bride (1950) and Father's Little Dividend (1951), both directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor. Burke also portrayed Mrs. Ernest (Daisy) Stanley in the 1942 film The Man Who Came to Dinner.Burke wrote two autobiographies, both with Cameron Shipp, With a Feather on My Nose (Appleton 1949) and With Powder on My Nose (Coward McCann, 1959).Radio and televisionOn CBS Radio, The Billie Burke Show was heard on Saturday mornings from April 3, 1943, until September 21, 1946. Sponsored by Listerine, this situation comedy was initially titled Fashions in Rations during its first year. Portraying herself as a featherbrained Good Samaritan who lived \"in the little white house on Sunnyview Lane,\" she always offered a helping hand to those in her neighborhood. She worked often in early television, appearing in the short-lived sitcom Doc Corkle (1952). She was a guest star on several TV and radio series, including Duffy's Tavern.On television, Burke starred in her own talk show, At Home With Billie Burke, which ran on the DuMont Television Network from June 1951 through the spring of 1952. She was one of the first female talk show hosts, after the hostesses of the earlier DuMont series And Everything Nice (1949\u201350) and Fashions on Parade (1948\u201349) which both included some talk show segments.Billie Burke starred in an adaptation of Dr. Heidegger's Experiment on the TV version of Lights Out on November 20, 1950.Return to stage and final filmBurke tried to make a comeback on the New York stage. She starred in two short-lived productions: This Rock and Mrs. January and Mr. X. Although she got good reviews, the plays did not. She also appeared in several plays in California, although her mind became clouded, and she had trouble remembering lines. In the late 1950s, her failing memory led to her retirement from show business, although her explanation at the time was, \"Acting just wasn't any fun anymore.\"Burke made her final screen appearance in Sergeant Rutledge (1960), a western directed by John Ford.Personal lifeAmong Burke's early suitors was the operatic tenor Enrico Caruso.In 1910, Burke bought the Kirkham estate on Broadway in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and renamed the mansion, Burkeley Crest.In April 1914, Burke married Florenz Ziegfeld.In 1921, Burke retired to raise her daughter Patricia, but resumed work after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.In 1932, Burke moved from New York to Beverly Hills, California, after the death of Ziegfeld.Burke died in Los Angeles of natural causes on May 14, 1970, at the age of 85, and she was interred besideZiegfeld at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Westchester County, New York.LegacyFor many years, Burke's framed photo was displayed above the exit staircase at New York City's Ziegfeld Theatre, but it disappeared after renovations. An opening-night program bearing a picture of her from her 1912 triumph The Mind The Paint Girl (Sir Arthur Wing Pinero) is displayed in the lobby of the Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan.For her contributions to the film industry, Burke was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star at 6617 Hollywood Boulevard.The Academy Film Archive houses the Florenz Ziegfeld-Billie Burke Collection, which consists primarily of home movies.On November 4, 2015, the crater Burke, near the north pole of the planet Mercury, was named after Billie Burke.Performance careerRadioThe Ziegfeld Follies of the Air \u2013 1932Doubting Thomas - 1935Good News of 1939 \u2013 1938The Rudy Vallee Hour \u2013 1939The Gulf Screen Guild Theater \u2013 1939The Rudy Vallee Sealtest Show \u2013 1940\u201341The Pepsodent Show \u2013 1941The Billie Burke Show \u2013 1943\u20131946Duffy's Tavern \u2013 1944The Sealtest Village Store \u2013 1944Mail Call \u2013 1944The Charlie McCarthy Show \u2013 1944\u201347Tribute to Ethel Barrymore \u2013 1945The Rudy Vallee Show \u2013 1945Show Stoppers \u2013 1946The Danny Kaye Show \u2013 1946WOR 25th Anniversary \u2013 1947Your Movietown Radio Theatre \u2013 1948The Eddie Cantor Pabst Blue Ribbon Show \u2013 1948Family Theater \u2013 1948\u201352This Is Show Business \u2013 CBS-TV, 1949The Martin and Lewis Show \u2013 1949The Bill Stern Colgate Sports Newsreel \u2013 1949Stagestruck \u2013 1954Biography in Sound \u2013 1955\u201356BroadwayMy Wife \u2013 1907Love Watches \u2013 1908Mrs. Dot \u2013 1910Suzanne \u2013 1910The Philosopher in the Apple Orchard \u2013 1911The Runaway \u2013 1911The Amazons \u2013 1913The Land of Promise \u2013 1913Jerry \u2013 1914The Rescuing Angel \u2013 1917A Marriage of Convenience \u2013 1918Caesar's Wife \u2013 1919The Intimate Strangers (musical)|The Intimate Strangers \u2013 1921Rose Briar \u2013 1922Annie Dear \u2013 1924The Marquise \u2013 1927The Happy Husband \u2013 1928Family Affairs \u2013 1929The Truth Game \u2013 1930Ziegfeld Follies of 1934 \u2013 1934 (producer)Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 \u2013 1936 (producer)This Rock \u2013 1943Ziegfeld Follies of 1943 \u2013 1943 (producer)Mrs. January and Mr. X - 1944FilmographySee alsoAcademy of Music/Riviera TheatreList of actors with Academy Award nominationsReferencesFurther readingAlistair, Rupert (2018). \"Billie Burke\".
