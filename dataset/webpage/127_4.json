All that changed with the lockdown in March 2020, when Dragonette, Sorbara\u2019s indie-pop project, was put on hold, and Vitiello, founder of elevated-takeout-rotisserie-chicken joint Flock Rotisserie + Greens, faced a wave of heartbreaking April cancellations, including Biblio Bash, the Toronto Public Library fundraiser with his catering partner 10Tation, and his annual fundraising dinner for children\u2019s cancer charity Camp Ooch at Cactus Club Caf\u00e9, where he is head of culinary development for Toronto.\n\nBut the silver lining has been the extra time at home with their son. Right now, Barlow is learning to talk (\u201cHe calls me \u2018hon\u2019 and \u2018babe,\u2019\u201d Sorbara says with a laugh), and he graduated early from potty training, which the couple initiated once they realized that their normally packed schedules had dramatically freed up.\n\nIt\u2019s created plenty of time for lazy Sundays. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Sundays about us,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special. We lock ourselves in, do our crosswords and cook.\u201d On a typical weekend, the family will get up early and go for a stroll through High Park or Roncesvalles Village. They\u2019re regulars at the Roncy caf\u00e9 Reunion Island, sometimes scooping up a legendary breakfast sandwich from the Gold Standard takeout window. \u201cThey treat Barlow like a VIP,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nVitiello, a chef since he was 15, spent most Sundays during the first two decades of his 25-year career working hectic shifts in kitchens. After closing his acclaimed Harbord Room restaurant in 2016, his life changed. Now, in contrast to the harried pace of a restaurant kitchen, Vitiello savours the slower speed of cooking at home. He starts the day by picking up fresh ingredients from local merchants, such as fish market Hooked or Roncesvalles produce stand Ko Fruit Market.\n\nThough veggies and fish are usually the core ingredients of his mains, a high-quality cut of meat constitutes a special Sunday treat. Braised meats, especially short ribs, have been a favourite comfort food over the winter. While Sorbara is a pescatarian, Vitiello says he has \u201cno problem spending the whole Sunday cooking this braise that could feed 15 people, even though there is only one person in the house who eats it.\u201d Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to find some outside assistance. \u201cI usually take some to the neighbours [as a] surprise,\u201d he says.\n\nSorbara is a whiz in the kitchen, too, whipping up pastries to satisfy Vitiello\u2019s sweet tooth. She\u2019s happiest, however, spending a cosy Sunday working away on a crossword, a pastime Vitiello has picked up as well, along with his Sudoku habit.\n\nSorbara is a veteran puzzle master \u2014 she enjoys making crosswords as birthday gifts for her father, York University chancellor Gregory Sorbara. A highlight of her 2020 was receiving a thoughtful rejection from the New York Times for a crossword she\u2019d submitted that had the theme of shape-shifting. \u201cI\u2019m going to submit another one, and I have high hopes!\u201d she says.\n\nTo carve out time for themselves, they take turns putting Barlow down for his nap and to bed at night. \u201cAnd our glory time is when we finally get him down to bed and we have our evening to ourselves,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nThat\u2019s when the strategy board games come out. Their current favourite is A Few Acres of Snow, an out-of-print two-player game from 2011 based on the struggle between the French and the British to occupy Canada. Sorbara learned the game from her cousin, a board-game collector. \u201cIt\u2019s hilariously nerdy,\u201d she says. Vitiello also juggles three ongoing poker groups on Zoom: a game with friends, a game with fellow chefs and a game with \u201cthe old-timers, Martina\u2019s father and his friends.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight remains watching their baby boy grow. \u201cIn the past year, I think we have seen three different versions of him and had to say goodbye to some really sweet versions only to [witness the] birth [of] the next incarnation of who this child is,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cIt\u2019s been so special to see that growth together.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://nowtoronto.com/news/martina-sorbara/", "page_content": "MARTINA SORBARA with SID SIX at Ted\u2019s Wrecking Yard (549 College), Monday (December 18), $7. 928-5012. Rating: NNNNN\n\nmartina sorbara\u2019s wildly colour-ful, whimsically decorated loft in downtown Toronto is a bit like Pee- wee\u2019s Playhouse. There\u2019s the orange drum kit and two pianos. There are two guitars crafted from scratch by Sorbara herself, each bearing intricate designs matching tattoos on her neck and right hip.\n\nAdd a vintage mint-green Singer her grandma gave her, her sketches, photography and clothing \u00ad\u2013 yes, also created by Sorbara \u00ad\u2013 and you get the sense that this is an artist with uncommon range.\n\nBut at the moment, it\u2019s the rainy-day pop on her charmingly understated second disc, The Cure For Bad Deeds, that\u2019s generating attention. And that\u2019s because Sorbara \u00ad\u2013 when teamed with percussionist sidekick Adam Hay \u00ad\u2013 holds a funny sway over people.\n\nA recent Rivoli showcase, stuffed to brimming with habitually blabby agents, publicists, record company reps and other industry types, was a marvel of good behaviour. Sorbara, moving between guitar and keyboard, silenced the room and kept it silenced until the end.\n\nSorbara\u2019s upper-register voice, even when breezily relaying everyday scenarios, carries the pathos of a torch singer six bourbons into her night.\n\nYet the 22-year-old insists, \u201cI don\u2019t know where that sadness comes from, because I have such a satisfying career and life. I don\u2019t mean to write sad songs. They just seem to come out that way.\u201d\n\nSigning a record deal, then endlessly touring and promoting herself \u00ad\u2013 the obvious next step \u00ad\u2013 isn\u2019t a notion Sorbara is entirely comfortable with.\n\nSinger sewing machines and Sorbara\u2019s much-loved fuchsia couch (where visitors to her pad must sit for a photograph while wearing a matching pink coat) don\u2019t travel well in the back of a U-haul.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the road, I just think about going home,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut then as soon as I get home, I want to play for more people.\n\n\u201cI have this faith that everything I\u2019m doing, whether it\u2019s sewing or making a lamp, feeds the songwriting, even if it just provides a form of meditation,\u201d Sorbara says, curling up in her kitchen chair.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be able to support myself doing something I love. That way I can continue to do other things that won\u2019t bring in money, like guitar-making,\u201d which she says she does not so much to achieve a unique sound but because she grooves on sculpting mahogany.\n\nThanks to her progressive parents, Sorbara has been immersed in music and art literally forever. She, her twin brother and four other siblings attended the Waldorf alternative school in Thornhill from kindergarten on. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most well-rounded school,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I would definitely send a kid of mine there. What they teach is what I consider most important \u00ad\u2013 art.\u201d\n\nHer launch into professional music happened coincidentally enough. According to Sorbara, her dad \u00ad\u2013 an MPP with no connections to the music world but a passing acquaintance through his political office with TV hosts Paula Todd and Steve Paikin \u00ad\u2013 asked for their recommendation of someone \u201cnot too weaselly\u201d in the business to forward an early demo tape to. The Studio 2 hosts suggested Sony A&R senior VP Mike Roth.\n\n\u201cAround three or four years ago, I met with Mike Roth and he said he liked my stuff and mentioned a development deal, but nothing ever happened,\u201d Sorbara says.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw Martina perform,\u201d Roth recalls, \u201cshe played guitar like Bruce Cockburn, sang like Kate Bush and then she told me she had built the guitar she was playing. I was, like, \u201cOh, my god.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to be a musician. She was going to spend a year in Europe, and so my attitude was \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m here.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the wake of that,\u201d Sorbara continues, \u201cI made Unplaceables (her now-unavailable debut) just to have something on hand and to get a sense of what\u2019s involved in making records. It was very low-key, just me and my guitar and piano.\u201d\n\nFollowing the development deal, signed in 98, Sorbara, at Sony\u2019s request, paired with several producers \u00ad\u2013 Philosopher King Jon Levine, Matt DeMatteo and Dave Martin \u00ad\u2013 to lay down demos. Sorbara recalls the experience as enlightening, saying she especially enjoyed the sessions cut with DeMatteo, which included a cover of Madonna\u2019s Like A Virgin.\n\n\u201cI learned that the stuff I write can go in a million different places,\u201d Sorbara says. But both Roth and Sorbara agree the results weren\u2019t electrifying. Roth says a Sony-Sorbara pact \u201cmight still develop. I\u2019m keeping close tabs on what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Sorbara says maybe, maybe not.\n\nSorbara\u2019s fast track might have paused there had it not been for the 99 Blue Skies Folk Festival just outside Kingston, which both Sorbara and Moxy Fr\u00fcvous singer/percussionist Jian Ghomeshi were playing. At that moment, Sorbara was ready to get serious with another record while Ghomeshi, already a veteran performer, was looking to explore other areas of the business.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s unique about my relationship with Martina,\u201d says Ghomeshi, who also manages the singer, \u201cis that before it became more formal, we had a chance to interact as performers, so it was very organic. And even though I was interested in getting into other sides of the business, it had to be a labour of love to keep me interested.\u201d\n\nGhomeshi\u2019s impact has been two-fold. As a producer, he focused on Sorbara\u2019s vocal performance while keeping effects to a minimum in order to showcase her guitar and piano playing. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t take my music to some big production level I wasn\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d Sorbara confirms. \u201cThat was my fear with Sony, that I\u2019d just take this big jump and there would be no logical progression that anyone could see.\u201d\n\nAnd as a manager, Ghomeshi has provided Sorbara with a realistic portrait of how the business functions and a point of entry into the local scene.\n\nArtists such as Andy Stochansky, Danny Michel and Maury LaFoy, ex-posed to Sorbara through Ghomeshi\u2019s considerable cheerleading, have helped by teaming up for gigs or guesting on the album. All the songs on Cure For Bad Deeds, however, were authored by Sorbara alone. Which makes people\u2019s response really matter to her.\n\n\u201cOne of the most meaningful compliments I ever got came from a man who used to visit the cafe I used to work at, the Little York on King East, every morning. My CD was for sale there, and one day I pointed it out to him. He said, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll buy it\u2019 \u00ad\u2013 you know, sort of to support the little coffee-house chick.\n\n\u201cShortly after that, I got an e-mail from him that said something like, \u201cI thought I was doing you a favour by buying your CD, but in fact it was you who did me the favour.'\u201dMARTINA SORBARA with SID SIX at Ted\u2019s Wrecking Yard (549 College), Monday (December 18), $7. 928-5012."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/martina-sorbara-mn0000312515/credits", "page_content": "Credits Martina Sorbara Follow Artist +\n\nCanada has long been known for raising amazing female singer-songwriters.

Fortunately, Martina Sorbara, Dragonette\u2019s frontwoman, lyricist and creative director, came along. She changed the EDM-challenged and glamour-deficient musical landscape of CanCon for the better.\n\nDragonette \u2013 which went from a trio to a solo act, owing to Sorbara\u2019s divorce with the band\u2019s former bassist \u2013 reframed Canadian music culture as a chic hub that went beyond the plaid-plagued, Sk8er Boi aesthetic of the time. Sorbara\u2019s slick video concepts (think Bj\u00f6rk meets BTS), highly danceable choruses (Cyndi Lauper once dubbed Dragonette, \u201cthe future of pop\u201d) and forward-fashion sense (which prompted a collab with designer Jean Paul Gaultier) presented the world with a fresh example of Canada\u2019s musical DNA \u2013 one that integrated dance, soul, visual art and fashion.\n\nOn the cusp of Dragonette\u2019s fifth album, Twennies, and the album release party at the Axis Club in Toronto on Nov. 16, the Italian-Canadian talent dishes on motherhood, her new-found creative control and making art in the digital age.\n\nWhat is motivating you most while fronting Dragonette alone postdivorce?\n\nI\u2019m realizing how much I have to offer and all the self-worth that comes with that. I had an eye-opening experience with a big producer \u2013 who I won\u2019t name. I was in the studio with him and he couldn\u2019t play chords to a certain song, he just wasn\u2019t getting it. I had so much patience for him fumbling around. In the old days, I wouldn\u2019t dream of showing a guy how to play something but at a certain point, I asked, \u201cCan I try?\u201d and played the chords easily. I realized that for some reason, I had to dim myself in the past because I was presuming knowledge that isn\u2019t even there \u2013 presuming he knows better than me. I realize that this experience with the producer was just PTSD. Now, I\u2019m just taking ownership and not being the host for any parasites any more.\n\nThis album possesses nostalgia for a time with no social media. Why is this theme important to you?\n\nWell, the digital onslaught happening right now does make you nostalgic, doesn\u2019t it? Remember a night out with no photos and just a flip phone? Think of the hours of your life unaccounted for because you\u2019re just looking at your phone. Not having your mind think in a digital way is kind of a relief too. The angle that we\u2019re looking at things [with] is warped \u2013 our experience is constantly shifting into that question: \u201cIs this social media? Or real life?\u201d I feel like we\u2019re constantly flipping from our brain eyes to our screen eyes.\n\nDragonette\u2019s album covers and videos look like they were born for Instagram and TikTok. Does the vast number of references you see now cultivate or confuse your vision?\n\nYou can have your mind blown away multiple times a day online but sometimes, you have to realize that your mind doesn\u2019t actually get blown away because you\u2019re just desensitized to the amount of colour and action you see on screen. Artists have this double-edged sword with social media because there\u2019s just so much of it and it\u2019s hard to put it in any kind of mental Rolodex and think, oh this is so inspiring! A certain aesthetic on Instagram and TikTok might be hard to get excited about because once it\u2019s out there you feel like it\u2019s already been done.\n\nWhich pieces of art in your own collection fuel you?\n\nA piece of work from [Toronto-based artist duo] the Broadbent Sisters. I found out about it because I worked with their brother, [artist] Justin Broadbent, for album cover art and he had a photo of their work on his computer. The image is a rainbow staircase decorated with all these flowers around it. I\u2019m also obsessed [Mallorca-based] artist Louise Despont \u2013 who uses ink and pencil on repurposed ledger paper \u2013 I have a piece that looks very tribal. I also have a portrait of a cat by [London-based] artist Christopher Page.\n\nAside from creating songs, you also make art. What mediums have you been in to lately?\n\nI\u2019m working toward having my own exhibit. I\u2019m working on drawings and sculptures. I have a series of faces with numbers on them. It\u2019s almost like hidden faces and expressions. I have line drawings \u2013 one is of a disco ball and I\u2019m doing these big pen drawings that are taking more than 12 hours to finish. I\u2019m also making ceramic necklaces and before the pandemic I made a piggy bank shaped like a vagina.\n\nYou grew up in what you called a hippie commune in British Columbia and made guitars with your hands. Are you doing DIY craft lessons with your son?\n\nI\u2019m so obsessed with making things. It\u2019s my whole reason of living. I try to do crafts with my kid but I also don\u2019t want to force him enjoy the same things that I enjoy, but I would love it if he was an obsessive maker too. I\u2019m still learning about how to be a mom. In terms of inhabiting the music-making persona of Dragonette \u2013 having a baby was also not clear to me. I didn\u2019t understand. I felt like my body cleaved into two different people.\n\nHaving [Chef] Corey Vitello as a partner must come with perks. What are the best dishes he\u2019s made you so far?\n\nWe had morels growing in our garden and I picked them and made him make me just a very simple morel pasta \u2013 that felt very special because they are so hard to find. He was developing a dish of miso, trout with asparagus and enoki mushrooms that was beautiful. He\u2019s finishing his cookbook soon so a lot of the food we eat is in that. This spring at our house he was doing food shoots downstairs and I was in the studio making music, so it was intense.\n\nYou have a slew of fashion-inspired songs like Fire In Your New Shoes, Big Sunglasses, New Suit and T-Shirt. Where do you like to shop?\n\nVSP Consignment. I like treasure hunting because it\u2019s so hard to shop for new clothes. When I see five of the same outfit on a sales rack, it\u2019s a real turn-off \u2013 that\u2019s why I buy vintage. I wasn\u2019t watching Beverly Hills, 90210, Sex and the City or reading Cosmo and getting socialized to be obsessed with the shoe and the purse or any accessories when I was growing up, so that affects the way I do things. I have such a different relationship with fashion. I have a lot of fun putting together quirky, unique outfits but I\u2019m not looking at trends."}, {"url": "https://vpa.syr.edu/academics/music/", "page_content": "The Setnor School of Music offers the highest level of musical development within a major research university and supportive student body.\n\nWe encourage the widest possible range of creative options for our students, recognizing that the Western classical tradition continues to grow and expand and that it is only one in a world of myriad others.\n\nWhy Choose Setnor?\n\nMusic has thrived at Syracuse University since 1877, when the Department of Music was founded and Syracuse became the first university in the United States to grant a degree in music and require four years\u2019 study in both music and theory.\n\nWhat makes the Setnor School a great place for you to study music?\n\nOur students: they are curious, self-motivated, and driven.\n\nthey are curious, self-motivated, and driven.

If you submit your application late, you will need to wait until the following year to walk.\n\n\n\nWe ask all students planning to graduate within the current academic year to apply for graduation by December 1, regardless of their plans to participate in Commencement. Late application for students who do not wish to walk will result in processing delays for your academic record and diploma, and your name may not be listed in the ceremony program.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between graduating and walking in Commencement?\n\n\n\nYou can walk in Commencement when you are nine (9) credits or less away from completing your degree requirements by the end of the spring term. Please note: Berklee Online degree students are not required to walk in Commencement in Boston.\n\n\n\nYou graduate when you have met all of the following criteria: Attained at least a 2.70 cumulative GPA in concentrate courses\n\nHave a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00\n\nFulfilled all program requirements AND completed a minimum of 120 credits for a single major or 165 for a dual major\n\nCompleted a minimum of 60 institutional credits for a single major or 105 institutional credits for a dual major\n\nFulfilled all financial obligations to the college Note Walking across the stage in Commencement does not mean that you have graduated. You will not officially graduate and receive your diploma until you meet all of the eligibility requirements. Great question! Walking in Commencement and graduating are two separate things.You can walk in Commencement when you are nine (9) credits or less away from completing your degree requirements by the end of the spring term. Please note: Berklee Online degree students are not required to walk in Commencement in Boston.You graduate when you have met all of the following criteria:Walking across the stage in Commencementmean that you have graduated. You will not officially graduate and receive your diploma until you meet all of the eligibility requirements.\n\nI just finished my last term at Berklee Online! What happens next? Is there anything I need to do? Congratulations on finishing! If you have already filled out a graduation application, you will want to double-check the \" Graduation Checklist \" to ensure you have taken care of all of the various items associated with graduating.

If your mailing address changes after you have submitted your graduation application, be sure to update us at\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that if you are walking in Commencement, you will not receive your official diploma at the ceremony. You will receive your diploma within 6-8 weeks of completing your degree requirements. Please keep in mind that instructors have up to two (2) weeks to submit final grades after the term concludes.Diplomas are mailed to the address you include on your graduation application. If your mailing address changes after you have submitted your graduation application, be sure to update us at graduation@online.berklee.edu Keep in mind that if you are walking in Commencement, you will not receive your official diploma at the ceremony.\n\nTransfer Credits\n\nCan I find out how many transfer credits I am eligible for before I apply to the degree program? If you are interested in applying to the Bachelor of Arts degree program and would like an estimate of the amount of transfer credit you would receive, you can request an unofficial transfer evaluation by emailing a copy of your transcript(s) to the Berklee Online Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu . Be sure to include your name, major of interest, and any additional questions you may have. You can expect to receive your assessment within 7-10 business days.\n\nI didn\u2019t receive credit on my Official Evaluation for all of the courses that I thought I would. What should I do? The earlier you contact us with questions or concerns regarding your evaluation, the easier it will be for us to address any issues. Therefore, it is very important when you first receive your official transfer evaluation that you review the information carefully.\n\n\n\nIf you notice a remaining requirement that you believe you\u2019ve already fulfilled, first consult our document on Common Reasons Credit Does Not Transfer. It\u2019s possible that the course you are thinking of didn\u2019t meet our eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\nIf none of those exclusions apply, please fill out a Transfer Credit Equivalency Re-evaluation form for the courses you wish to have reconsidered.\n\n\n\nSometimes, we are not able to locate specific information for a course online and we are not able to determine an equivalency, but we are always happy to review additional material which will help us make that determination.\n\nDo my Berklee Online, Berklee campus, or Prior Learning Credit coursework count towards the 60 transfer credit limit? No, credits completed at Berklee or through the prior learning process do not count towards the 60 transfer credit limit. This maximum is for credit-bearing exams and undergraduate-level coursework completed externally.\n\nWhat is a credit deficiency and why do I need to make up credit? Credit deficiencies are caused by transferring a course that is less than three (3) credits to fulfill a three (3) credit Berklee Online requirement. Students with a credit deficiency will be short of the minimum number of credits required to graduate once they have completed their program requirements. In order to be eligible to graduate, you will need to make up the credits you are deficient in.\n\n\n\nWhile the Transfer Team does their best to avoid giving students credit deficiencies, it is not always possible. You can make up the credits you are deficient in by completing additional Berklee Online coursework, by applying for prior learning credit, or by completing additional external coursework in the area in which you are deficient.\n\n\n\nNote all external courses will first need to be approved by the Transfer Team.\n\nCan transfer credit fulfill prerequisites? It depends. Generally, transfer credit cannot be used to fulfill prerequisites unless we determine that the course you completed is a direct equivalent to one of the courses we offer at Berklee Online. Keep in mind that there are some courses which require you to pass a placement exam. For these you will need to achieve a passing grade on the test to fulfill the prerequisite, otherwise you will need to complete the appropriate Berklee Online course.\n\nCan I transfer credits to Berklee Online after I have started the degree program? Yes, you can. To determine if the coursework you already completed or are considering taking is eligible to fulfill your remaining degree requirements, contact the Transfer Team at transfer@online.berklee.edu\n\nI am a Berklee campus student. Can I transfer courses from Berklee Online to my campus-based program?\n\n\n\nFor additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at View a list of transferable courses to Berklee\u2019s campus programs.For additional questions about transferring courses from Berklee Online to Berklee's campus programs please contact the campus transcript evaluator at transfercredits@berklee.edu\n\nAre Berklee Online courses transferable to other institutions? Berklee Online is regionally accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), the same association that accredits our main campus and other leading academic institutions such as Harvard University and MIT. Our courses are transferable to other institutions, but it's up to the receiving institution to decide the number and types of courses that may transfer. We recommend getting a course pre-approved by an institution before enrolling.\n\nTuition\n\nHow do Berklee Online\u2019s costs compare to other education options? Berklee Online\u2019s programs have a tuition cost that is approximately 64 percent less than on-campus tuition at Berklee\u2019s Boston campus. Moreover, a recent study revealed that the average annual tuition at for-profit colleges is more than twice as expensive as Berklee Online. Even average annual tuition at other accredited non-profit online universities is roughly $11,000 more expensive than tuition for a year with Berklee Online!\n\nHow much does a certificate program cost? There is a one time $175 registration fee per certificate program. Students may either pay per course term (at the $1,515 per credit course cost) or pay in full to receive a 10 percent discount. The registration fee and all courses for the term you wish to begin in must be paid in full in order to begin.\n\nHow much does an online Bachelor\u2019s degree cost? Online undergraduate degree tuition is $59,160 for 120 credits for all majors except the guitar major. Tuition for the guitar major is $63,660. Students taking 10 courses per year can complete the degree in four years at a cost of $14,790 per year. (Note: Tuition and fees are subject to change.)\n\nHow much does an online master's degree cost? Online graduate degree tuition is $33,120 for 36 credits. The Master of Music in Music Production and Master of Arts in Music Business programs are designed to be completed in one year of study. Both programs are comprised of 12 three-credit courses that can be taken during four 12-week semesters."}, {"url": "https://www.openculture.com/2018/09/brains-jazz-classical-musicians-work-differently-new-research-shows.html", "page_content": "All of the musicians I\u2019ve played with have been improvisers, whether they came from jazz, rock, folk, or whatever. As a loose improvisor myself, I\u2019ve found it difficult to collaborate with trained classical players. It\u2019s not for lack of trying, but\u2014while we like to think of music as a universal language\u2014the means of communication were strained at best. Classical musicians have a hard time with spontaneous composition; jazz players are generally comfortable with loose technique and can adapt to experiments and unexpected shifts.\n\nI\u2019d always chalked this difference up to different kinds of training (or lack thereof in my case), but a new study by researchers in Leipzig suggests a deeper neurological basis, at least when it comes strictly to jazz versus classical musicians. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences studied the brains of thirty pianists\u2014half jazz players, half classical. They found, the Institute reports, that \u201cdifferent processes occur in jazz and classical pianists\u2019 brains, even when performing the same piece.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a conclusion players themselves intuitively understand. As jazz pianist Keith Jarrett once said, when asked if he would ever play both jazz and classical in concert, \u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s [because of] the circuitry. Your system demands different circuitry for either of those two things.\u201d This isn\u2019t due to hard-wired biological differences, but to the way the brain creates pathways over time in response to different musical activities. As neuroscientist Daniela Sammler puts it:\n\nThe reason could be due to the different demands these two styles pose on the musicians\u2014be it to skillfully interpret a classical piece or to creatively improvise jazz. Thereby, different procedures may have established in their brains while playing the piano which makes switching between the styles more difficult.\n\nOn its face, the study may hardly seem illuminating. We have long known that repeated actions change the structure of the brain, so why should it be different for musicians? Things get a little more interesting as we dig into the details. One finding, study author Robert Bianco notes, shows that jazz pianists \u201creplan\u2026 actions faster than classical pianists\u201d and were \u201cbetter able to react and continue their performance\u201d when asked to play a harmonically unexpected chord within a standard progression (see graph below).\n\nOn the other hand, Science Daily reports, classical pianists\u2019 brains showed, \u201ca stronger awareness of fingering, and consequently they made fewer errors while imitating the chord sequence.\u201d The critical distinction between the two relates to how they plan movements, with classical pianists focusing on the \u201cHow\u201d of technique and jazz players on the \u201cWhat\u201d of adaptation to the unexpected.\n\nOther studies substantiate the findings. Researchers at Wesleyan University focused on the role of what they call \u201cexpectancy\u201d in three groups: jazz improvisers, \u201cnon-improvising musicians,\u201d and non-musicians. Jazz players trained to improvise not only preferred unexpected chords in a progression, but their brains reacted and recovered more quickly to the unexpected, suggesting a higher degree of creative potential than both classically trained musicians and non-musicians.\n\n\u201cThe improvisatory and experimental nature of jazz training,\u201d the study\u2019s authors write, \u201ccan encourage musicians to take notes and chords that are out of place, and use them as a pivot to transition to new tonal and musical ideas.\u201d However, the comparison between the two groups does not place value on one over the other.\n\nWhile jazz improvisation may better teach creativity, classical training, as neuroscientist Ardon Shorr argues in his TEDx talk above, may better train the brain in information processing. These studies show that the effect of music on the brain cannot be studied without regard for the differing neurological demands of different kinds of music, just as the study of language processing cannot be limited to just one language.\n\nSuch studies can also give us an even greater appreciation for the rare musician who can easily switch between jazz and classical in the same performance, like the late, great Nina Simone. See her work a Bach-influenced fugue into \u201cLove Me or Leave Me,\u201d at the top.\n\nRelated Content:\n\nMusic in the Brain: Scientists Finally Reveal the Parts of Our Brain That Are Dedicated to Music\n\nNew Research Shows How Music Lessons During Childhood Benefit the Brain for a Lifetime\n\nThe Neuroscience of Bass: New Study Explains Why Bass Instruments Are Fundamental to Music\n\nJosh Jones is a writer and musician based in Durham, NC.

There are many things that make their culture so beautiful, including but not limited to their cuisine, architecture, and one of the most important aspects of this country\u2019s culture is of course music.\n\nA lot of famous composers came from Spain and in this post, we\u2019re going to look at 10 of the greatest Spanish composers. Let\u2019s get started.\n\n1. Isaac Albeniz\n\nIsaac Albeniz\n\nWe begin our list with one of the post-romantic era\u2019s greatest composers and pianists, Isaac Albeniz.\n\nAlbeniz was born on May 29, 1860, in a small town near Girona, Spain.\n\nHe influenced Spain\u2019s national composition style and led the country\u2019s nationalist school of musicians.\n\nA piano prodigy, Albeniz\u2019s talent was apparent from the time he was four years old.\n\nHe had run away from home twice before he was 12 years old, using his music to support himself financially.\n\nHis father would eventually agree to let him go on the road with his music.\n\nHe moved to Paris in 1893 after studying under Felipe Pedrell, the father of Spain\u2019s nationalist music movement.\n\nHe infused his work with elements from Spanish folk music, including rhythms, harmonies, and melodic styles.\n\nAlbeniz\u2019s piano pieces brought him fame, with Iberia, a suite of 12 virtuoso piano pieces, being his most celebrated work:\n\nIsaac Albeniz \u2013 \u2018Iberia\u2019\n\n2. Manuel de Falla\n\nManuel de Falla\n\nNext on our list is a Spanish composer and pianist Manuel De Falla.\n\nConsidered by many to be the best Spanish composer of the 20th century, De Falla was born on November 23, 1876, in Cadiz, Spain.\n\nAndalusian Flamenco and other sounds from his home region had a profound influence on his music.\n\nFalla\u2019s mother taught him to play the piano.\n\nHe later studied with Felipe Pedrell in Madrid.\n\nHis music was known for its fusion of poetry, asceticism, and the enthusiasm of Spain\u2019s national spirit, which is apparent in many of his works, including the ballet El Amor Brujo, Noches en Los Jardines de Espa\u00f1a, and the one-act opera La Vida Breve.\n\nDuring his lifetime, De Falla lived in Paris, Madrid, Granada, and finally, Argentina.\n\nDe Falla produced his first compositions in Paris, where he got to know French classical composers Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, and Maurice Ravel.\n\nHere\u2019s a performance of Noches en Los Jardines de Espa\u00f1a:\n\n\u2018Noches en Los Jardines de Espa\u00f1a\u2019 by Manuel de Falla\n\nHe died in exile in Argentina on November 14, 1946.\n\n3. Joaquin Rodrigo\n\nBlinded after contracting diphtheria at the age of three, Juaquin Rodrigo would go on to become one of the greatest Spanish composers in history.\n\nBorn in the province of Valencia on November 22, 1901, Rodrigo credited his blindness with inspiring his musical career.\n\nHe spent his youth studying in a school for the blind, where he developed an interest in music and literature.\n\nHe took music lessons at the Valencia Conservatoire.\n\nHe studied in Paris and Germany during the Spanish Civil War, where he refined his musical style.\n\nHe married Turkish pianist Victoria Kamhi in 1933, who would go on to manage his career.\n\nRodrigo produced his first major work, Concierto De Aranjuez, for guitar and orchestra in 1939.\n\nThe composition was a runaway success that he was never able to surpass.\n\nHe was best known for his guitar compositions but also produced concerti for other instruments.\n\nThis is one of Rodrigo\u2019s most recognized pieces, Adagio:\n\nJuaquin Rodrigo \u2013 \u2018Adagio\u2019\n\n4. Francisco Tarrega\n\nFrancisco Tarrega\n\nOften referred to as the father of guitar, Francisco Tarrega was born on November 21, 1852, in Castellon, Spain.\n\nConsidered by many to be one of the greatest guitarists of all time, he lived at the peak of the Romantic era.\n\nTarrega badly injured his eyes when he ran away from home as a child.\n\nAfter this incident, his parents took him to study with blind musicians Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez and Eugeni Ruiz, so he could continue his music career even if he went blind.\n\nTarrega played the guitar and piano proficient by the time he reached his teen years.\n\nBy the 1870s, Tarrega was teaching the guitar and performing throughout Spain.\n\nHis unique mix of romanticism with elements of Spanish folk music delighted audiences.\n\nHis most famous composition was Recuerdos de la Alhambra.\n\nHe produced his last work, Oremus, in 1909 after becoming paralyzed on his right side and died in Barcelona shortly after that.\n\nOne of my personal favorites is Tarrega\u2019s Capricho Arabe:\n\n\u2018Capricho Arabe\u2019 by Francisco Tarrega\n\n5. Francisco Guerrero\n\nFrancisco Guerrero\n\nRenaissance composer and Catholic Priest Francisco Guerrero was born on October 4(?), 1528, in Seville, Spain.\n\nA leading 16th-century Spanish composer, Guerrero\u2019s introduction to music came as a choirboy.\n\nHis brother trained him, and he became proficient at many instruments and began composing during his early years.\n\nJaen Cathedral in Andalusia, Spain, made him the chapel master when he was 18 years old.\n\nHe moved onto the Seville Cathedral in 1546, becoming its musical director five years later and chapel master in 1574.\n\nHe spent most of his music career in Seville, besides a trip to Rome and Jerusalem.\n\nHis music includes powerful Spanish features and is supremely vocal.\n\nHe produced secular and sacred music during his career.\n\nHis compositions include two requiems, 19 masses, and instrumental music for the vihuela.\n\nHe captured various moods in his work, from sadness and despair to rapture and euphoria.\n\nYou can listen to Guerrero\u2019s Requiem here:\n\nFrancisco Guerrero \u2013 \u2018Requiem\u2019\n\n6.
