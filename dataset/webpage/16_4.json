His oldest son Ben (Lancaster) and his mother Mattilda (Lillian Gish) are protective of the Zacharys\u2019 adopted daughter, Rachel (Hepburn), and her brothers, Cash (Audie Murphy) and Andy (Doug McClure) also like Rachel.\n\nThe family is supported by their neighbor, Zeb Rawlins (reliable character actor Charles Bickford), the head of a racist family, whose son Charlie (Albert Salmi) wishes to marry Rachel. Problem is, Ben, aware that she is not actually his blood sister, also loves Rachel.\n\nAs the ranchers prepare for cattle drive to Wichita, Kansas, an old \u201ccrazy\u201d man, Abe Kelsey (Joseph Wiseman) claim that Rachel is an Indian. Refusing to believe, Ben and Cash try to kill Kelsey, but he steals a horse from them.\n\nSome Kiowas appear one night, led by Lost Bird, offering to trade horses to Ben in return for Rachel, presumably Bird\u2019s actual sister. The Kiowa kill Charlie when he returns to his ranch from courting Rachel, and his grieving mother accuses Rachel of being a \u201cdirty Injun.\u201d Ben tracks down Kelsey and brings him back to the Rawlins ranch to be hanged as a thief.\n\nKelsey then tells the mob that, on a retaliatory raid against the Kiowa, he found a baby. Claiming that his son was captured by the Kiowa, he now demands that Will return Rachel in exchange for him.\n\nBen refusing, arguing that Kelsey\u2019s son was killed in the fighting, and that Kelsey made up the story to justify vengeance against the Zacharys. Mattilda reacts to Kelsey\u2019s rant by striking the horse Kelsey is on, causing his hanging. As a result, Zeb and the ranchers turn their backs on the Zacharys.\n\nMattilda admits to her family that Will had taken the Kiowa baby and brought it to her to replace an infant daughter they had just lost. Unable to deal with his sister being a \u201cred-hide nigger,\u201d Cash abandons the family. The Kiowa return, demanding Rachel, who tries to save her family by going over to the Kiowa.\n\nBen deliberately breaks the truce by killing a Kiowa, forcing a fight, during which his mother gets killed. In the end, Cash returns and turns the tide. Aware of Ben\u2019s true love, Rachel kills her brother during a confrontation, thus showing her commitment to the white men.\n\nThe casting of Hepburn as Native American stirred controversy. Additionally, production was halted after the star broke her back when she fell off a horse; the accident was blamed for a subsequent miscarriage. Upon recovery, she completed the movie.\n\nFor his part, Huston was in conflict with Rick Height company, which financed the movie.
