This heroic defence was rewarded by Queen Victoria's government with no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses, and was later immortalised by the film Zulu (1964), directed by Cy Endfield. Few ... remember that it was fought on the same day that the British Army suffered its most humiliating defeat ... Few, however, remember that it was fought on the same day that the British Army suffered its most humiliating defeat at nearby Isandlwana. Why? Because it suited those responsible for the disaster to exaggerate the importance of Rorke's Drift in the hope of reducing the impact of Isandlwana. The true story of 22 January 1879 - the Empire's longest day - is one of unprovoked slaughter, of heroes being ignored and of the guilty being protected. And the responsibility for this lay with Queen Victoria herself. Top\n\nAn unnecessary war Like so many imperial conflicts of the period, the Zulu War was not initiated from London. Instead, Benjamin Disraeli's government - preoccupied with the Russian threat to Constantinople and Afghanistan - made every effort to avoid a fight. 'We cannot now have a Zulu war, in addition to other greater and too possible troubles', wrote Sir Michael Hicks Beach, the colonial secretary, in November 1878. The man to whom this letter was addressed - Sir Bartle Frere - had others ideas, however. Frere had been sent out to to Cape Town with the specific task of grouping South Africa's hotch-potch of British colonies, Boer republics and independent black states into a Confederation of South Africa. But he quickly realised that the region could not be unified under British rule until the powerful Zulu kingdom - with its standing army of 40,000 disciplined warriors - had been suppressed. So he exaggerated the threat posed by the Zulus to the British, and, when the home government refused to sanction war, took matters into his own hands in December 1878 by presenting the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, with an unacceptable ultimatum. This required, among other things, the disbandment of the Zulu Army, and war was the inevitable result. Such unilateral action by an imperial pro-consul was not unusual during the Victorian period. Such unilateral action by an imperial pro-consul was not unusual during the Victorian period. So great were the distances involved, and so slow the methods of communication, that British governors often took it upon themselves to start wars and annex provinces. Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India, was about to invade Afghanistan without reference to London. But the Zulu conflict was unique in that it was to be the last pre-emptive war launched by the British, prior to the recent campaign in Iraq. Top\n\nIsandlwana The war began on 11 January 1879, when the 5,000-strong main British column invaded Zululand at Rorke's Drift. It was commanded by the ambitious Lord Chelmsford, a favourite of the Queen, who had little respect for the fighting qualities of the Zulu. 'If I am called upon to conduct operations against them,' he wrote in July 1878, 'I shall strive to be in a position to show them how hopelessly inferior they are to us in fighting power, altho' numerically stronger.' This dangerous mixture of self-confidence and contempt for their foes infected the whole British force. But their misjudgement came to rebound on them badly. By 20 January - hampered by minor skirmishes and poor tracks - Chelmsford's column had only advanced 11 miles to the rocky lower slopes of a distinctive, sphinx-like hill called Isandlwana. There it set up camp. But at 4am on 22 January, Chelmsford made the first of a series of blunders by taking two-thirds of his force off to pursue what he believed was the main Zulu army. He was convinced that the Zulus were gathering to the south-east, and so failed to reconnoitre adequately the broken ground to the north-east. There, lying in wait just five miles from the exposed camp at Isandlwana, were 20,000 Zulu warriors. At around 8am, mounted vedettes reported large numbers of Zulus on the high ground to the left of the camp. Colonel Pulleine, in command at Isandlwana, dashed off a quick note to Chelmsford, reading: 'Report just come in that the Zulus are advancing in force from Left front of Camp.' Chelmsford read it shortly after 9.30am, and he returned it to his staff officer, Major Clery, without a word, and would not be deflected from his original plan. This dangerous mixture of self-confidence and contempt for their foes infected the whole British force. At 11am, by which time the 1,300 men remaining in the camp had been swelled by 450 reinforcements, mounted scouts stumbled upon the concealed Zulu impi. Realising they had been spotted, the Zulus rose as one and began their attack, using their traditional tactic of encirclement known as the izimpondo zankomo ('horns of the buffalo'). An hour later, as the hard-pressed British defenders fought for their lives, a portion of Chelmsford's force at Mangeni Falls received word that the camp was in danger of being overrun. On his own initiative a Colonel Harness gave orders for his small force of artillery and infantry to return to camp. But it had only progressed half a mile when a staff officer rode up with express orders from Chelmsford to resume its original march because the message was a false alarm. The last chance to save the camp had been thrown away. By 3pm, despite severe losses, the Zulus had captured the camp. The culmination of Chelmsford's incompetence was a blood-soaked field littered with thousands of corpses. Of the original 1,750 defenders - 1,000 British and 750 black auxiliaries - 1,350 had been killed. Top\n\nThe cover-up Word of the disaster reached Britain on 11 February 1879. The Victorian public was dumbstruck by the news that 'spear-wielding savages' had defeated the well equipped British Army. The hunt was on for a scapegoat, and Chelmsford was the obvious candidate. But he had powerful supporters. On 12 March 1879 Disraeli told Queen Victoria that his 'whole Cabinet had wanted to yield to the clamours of the Press, & Clubs, for the recall of Ld. Chelmsford'. He had, however, 'after great difficulty carried the day'. Disraeli was protecting Chelmsford not because he believed him to be blameless for Isandlwana, but because he was under intense pressure to do so from the Queen. Meanwhile Lord Chelmsford was urgently burying all the evidence that could be used against him. He propagated the myth that a shortage of ammunition led to defeat at Isandlwana. He ensured that potential witnesses to his errors were unable to speak out. Even more significantly, he tried to push blame for the defeat onto Colonel Durnford, now dead, claiming that Durnford had disobeyed orders to defend the camp. Many generals blunder in war, but few go to such lengths to avoid responsibility. The truth is that no orders were ever given to Durnford to take command. Chelmsford's behaviour, in retrospect, is unforgivable. Many generals blunder in war, but few go to such lengths to avoid responsibility. Top\n\nRorke's Drift Chelmsford had, in any event, another weapon to use against his critics - that of Rorke's Drift. Though undeniably heroic, the importance of the defence of Rorke's Drift was grossly exaggerated by both the generals and politicians of the period, to diminish the impact of Isandlwana. 'We must not forget,' Disraeli told the House of Lords on 13 February, 'the exhibition of heroic valour by those who have been spared.' In truth, the real hero of Rorke's Drift was Commissary Dalton. Within days of Rorke's Drift, Chelmsford was urging the speedy completion of the official report because he was 'anxious to send that gleam of sunshine home as soon as possible'. When it finally arrived, he added two names to the six recommended VCs - the names of lieutenants Chard and Bromhead. Many of their fellow officers were amazed by these two additions. One senior officer wrote: 'Bromhead is a great favourite in his regiment and a capital fellow at everything except soldiering ... He had to be reported confidentially as hopeless.' Another described Chard as 'a most useless officer, fit for nothing'. In truth, the real hero of Rorke's Drift was Commissary Dalton. It was Dalton who persuaded Chard and Bromhead to remain at Rorke's Drift when their first instinct was to abandon the post, and it was Dalton who organised and inspired the defence. But Dalton, an ex-NCO, came from what was considered the wrong background, and was ignored for almost a year. He was eventually awarded a VC after intensive lobbying by the press - but not until January 1880, by which time the celebrations had died down. Top\n\nChelmsford's recall Back in England meanwhile - with the Zulu War no nearer to being won - the cries for Chelmsford's recall intensifying. On 23 May, realising that his political future was on the line, Disraeli told the queen that his government was replacing Chelmsford with Wolseley. She replied frostily: 'I will not withhold my sanction though I cannot approve it.' It was one of the few serious breeches she and Disraeli had during their political relationship. Most of what Chelmsford told the Queen was a pack of lies. In early September, shortly after his return from South Africa, Lord Chelmsford was given an audience with the Queen. She recorded the conversation in her journal: 'Ld. Chelmsford said no doubt poor Col. Durnford had disobeyed orders, in leaving the camp as he did... Ld. Chelmsford knew nothing, Col. Durnford never having sent any message to say he was in danger... This much is clear to me: viz. that it was not his fault, but that of others, that this surprise at Sandlwana took place... I told Ld. Chelmsford he had been blamed by many, and even by the Government, for commencing the war without sufficient cause. He replied that he believed it to have been quite inevitable; that if we had not made war when we did, we should have been attacked and possibly overpowered.' Most of what Chelmsford told the Queen was a pack of lies. Durnford, as we have seen, did not disobey orders. And Chelmsford ignored at least two warnings to the effect the camp 'was in danger'. In addition, the war was not one of self-defence but of conquest. Queen Victoria, however, would not see the truth. Top\n\nOnly one winner The British captured King Cetshwayo in August 1879, and the war, to all intents and purposes, was over. But few emerged on the British side with any credit, nor did ordinary Zulus benefit. Cetshwayo was exiled, Zululand was broken up and eventually annexed. Frere never achieved his ambition to confederate South Africa. That would have to wait until the aftermath of an even bloodier conflict, that of the Boer War. James Dalton died in 1887, a broken man. Disraeli lost the 1880 election and died the following year. James Dalton died in 1887, a broken man. Many of the lower-rank VC winners from Rorke's Drift were also forgotten when the media circus moved on. But one man prospered - Lord Chelmsford. The Queen showered honours on him, promoting him to full general, awarding him the Gold Stick at Court and appointing him Lieutenant of the Tower of London. He died in 1905, at the age of 78, playing billiards at his club.

The BBC and the National Army Museum put the question to the public at the end of last year. The public declared the Duke of Wellington Britain\u2019s best, together with William Slim.\n\nProfessor Saul David is not so sure. His latest book, All The King\u2019s Men: The British soldier from the Restoration to Waterloo, sketches the beginnings of a revision of Wellington. I asked him about this rather bold move.\n\n\u2018I certainly did not set out writing the rather large section [in the book] on Wellington to bash him, but the more detail I got into about his career and how he reacted to certain situations, the more convinced I thought that he has been slightly overrated by historians.\n\n\u2018Even the battle of Waterloo, where of course he undoubtedly does a number of things incredibly well, but he also made some mistakes. It has been seen as the piece de resistance of his wonderful defensive planning, but the disposition of his soldiers was a weakness. He deliberately denuded his left wing, but that was the wing Napoleon attacked. He wasn\u2019t to know that, but you have to into account of all eventualities.\u2019\n\nMost popular Brendan O\u2019Neill Prince Harry the Tyrannical\n\nWellington gambled on the arrival of the Prussians on his left, but David thinks that it was a needless risk given Wellington\u2019s strength and the ground.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s often forgotten that Wellington had nearly 73,000 men in a very strong defensive position and he was almost defeated by 75,000 Frenchmen. That tells you he didn\u2019t fight anything like as effective a battle as we might have assumed, and it required 50,000 Prussians, eventually, to save his skin.\u2019\n\nWellington was not at his best, David suspects, because he was \u2018genuinely worried about fighting Napoleon, the alleged greatest commander of the era.\u2019 David refers to Wellington\u2019s confession at the end of the Peninsula campaign in 1814 that he was relieved not to have encountered Bonaparte in Spain.\n\nIf not Wellington, who then was Britain\u2019s greatest? David has just written an eBook on generalship, comparing the careers of Wellington, Slim and John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough. David is in no doubt that \u2018Marlborough is the greatest of those three greats\u2019.\n\nMarlborough had \u2018moral courage\u2019 and extraordinary political acumen, in addition to the requisite battlefield skill. David cites his decision to march from Holland to the Danube in the summer of 1704, an aggressive manoeuvre calculated to preserve the Grand Alliance of European nations by defeating Louis XIV\u2019s armies, which were threatening England\u2019s key ally, Austria.\n\nWith awed enthusiasm, David describes the march of 40,000 men over hundreds of miles of rough terrain. To put this in context, Bristol, then England\u2019s second city, had a population of less than 30,000 people. The march was an unprecedented logistical operation, yet the army arrived in tact and won the crushing victory at Blenheim for which Marlborough is remembered. It was a military risk taken for political and moral ends; Wellington attempted nothing comparable in his very illustrious career.\n\nDavid softens the high politics in All the King\u2019s Men with the accounts of ordinary redcoats. They are a colourful cast: a woman masquerading as a dragoon in Marlborough\u2019s army, the campaigner William Cobbett, and an amazingly eloquent Edinburgh pauper named Thomas Pococke, who served in the Napoleonic Wars. This extract from Pococke\u2019s account of the retreat from Corunna is poetic:\n\n\u2018The silence was only interrupted by the groans of the men, who, unable to proceed farther, laid themselves down in despair to perish in the snow, and where the report of a pistol told the death of a horse, which had fallen dead, unable to proceed. I felt an unusual listlessness steal over me. Many times I have said, \u201cThese men who have resigned themselves to their fate are happier than I. What have I to struggle for? Welcome death! Happy deliverer!\u201d These thoughts passed into my mind involuntarily\u2026 The rain poured in torrents; the melted snow was half knee-deep in places, and stained by the blood that flowed from our wounded and bruised feet. To add to our misery, we were forced by turns to drag the baggage. This was more than human nature could sustain. Many wagons were abandoned and much ammunition destroyed.\u2019\n\nI was gripped by Pococke, and asked David what happened to him. It is a tragic story:\n\nThe best things in life are free (for a month) Unlock a month\u2019s worth of unlimited online and app access by subscribing today for free.

He survives the Peninsula and Waterloo and leaves the army. But because he served less than twenty years and has not been wounded, he is ineligible for a pension, not a single penny. He is thrust back into life in Scotland with no particular talents other than those learned in the army. He is last heard of \u2013 having written the book which he writes and gets published and probably receives a pittance for, and we\u2019re not even sure that he\u2019s the person who sold the book \u2014 working as an itinerant road mender, a job at the very bottom of the employment ladder. You got taken on for a few days\u2019 work and were redundant when the road was repaired. He probably died a pauper.\u2019\n\nPococke\u2019s fate was not uncommon among demobbed redcoats. Soldiers were loathed by the public as unruly brigands, so charity was sporadic. It\u2019s an indictment on Georgian society that the heroes of Blenheim, Quebec and Waterloo were cast adrift, as well as a sign that military glory and imperial conquest left the public cold."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passed-failed-an-education-in-the-life-of-saul-david-historian-and-broadcaster-844773.html", "page_content": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He will discuss Victoria's Wars, his latest book out in paperback, at this weekend's Althorp Literary Festival in Northampton\n\nTo get to Welsh Newton Primary School, which was (just) in England, my cousins and I would walk over the fields in a straggling line, across the border into Wales, and back again into England. We lived near Monmouth in lots of different buildings on my grandparents' big farm. At school there were more Davids than any other name: more than 20 of us cousins out of 40 pupils. When my older cousins moved on, the school had to close.\n\nIt was very old-fashioned. My brother was dyslexic and the headmaster was pretty tough on him: \"He's not really trying.\" When I was six or seven, we went to the nearest English primary school, St Weonards, about seven miles away. The teaching was good and this was the start of my beginning to shine as a student. I can trace my love of history to that school thanks to the fascinating classes of Mrs Tabor \u2013 history was her favourite subject. I think I also got the telly bug at that time when two series of The Survivors [a cult TV sci-fi] were filmed at my house and we all appeared as extras. I felt I was a star!\n\nI passed the 11-plus but it was decided that I should take the Common Entrance exam to Monmouth School, the nearest independent. I was never entirely comfortable there as they didn't have girls and they played rugby instead of football. After two years, I made a deal with my dad that if I went to the local comprehensive for three years, I would then go to his old boarding school, Ampleforth, for my sixth form.\n\nMy aunt was deputy head of John Kyrle High School, and she has always been slightly miffed that I don't mention it in my CV. I had a great time but it was the early days of it going comprehensive and, in retrospect, I realise that the education was pretty poor. It has improved hugely, I gather. I left with only seven O-levels, yet had the second- best results. I got an A in English language, but failed literature: a D. I asked for it to be re-marked and the report said: \"We think we marked you too highly.\"\n\nI died my hair blond in the summer, and at Ampleforth they said, \"You look like the guy in Bucks Fizz\", so that became my nickname. Once I'd adapted to being away from home, I loved Ampleforth. I thought then that the best history master was the one who spoon-fed us, but in fact the other master was the clever one: he made us think for ourselves. I got ABC in my A-levels and distinction in my history S-level.\n\nI got in to Trinity College, Dublin, but my LEA changed its policy of paying fees at \"foreign\" universities, so I chose Edinburgh instead, another Celtic capital. I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the teaching, although it had some fabulous historians. I worked hard at my four-year MA, but got a 2.1. That was a big disappointment as I wanted to write about history and thought I needed a First.\n\nBut I did it anyway, and at 31 I got fantastic reviews for my fourth book, The Homicidal Earl: I was a \"rising star\". On the same day I was offered a scholarship for a doctorate at Glasgow University. My best book came out of the research I did there, The Indian Mutiny.

A couple of years ago I was contacted by my agent, who asked me if I would be interested in writing the authorised history of the Special Boat Service (SBS). And of course my initial reaction was: who wouldn\u2019t? But the reason my agent asked me is that they also happened to represent Paddy Ashdown, who was a former member of the SBS and had been commissioned to write the book. Very sadly, Paddy died rather suddenly towards the end of 2018, before the book was finished. So the question was: what happens next? Does someone finish Paddy\u2019s text or write a new version?\n\nRob Attar: Could we begin by discussing the genesis of this book? The story of how it came about is a little unusual.\n\nMy agent approached me with both possibilities, and sent me the manuscript. It was very good but it was not what I would have written. Paddy came from the perspective of a practitioner \u2013 he was very close to the unit. His writing was very emotive, whereas I\u2019ve always tried to keep an objective distance, as any historian does. Having read his early chapters, I decided it would make more sense to start from scratch. So we agreed that I would write the book in my own way, but would give due acknowledgement to Paddy in terms of the genesis.\n\nThis is an authorised history of a secretive organisation. How much access did you get? Were any aspects off limits?\n\nThey weren\u2019t, actually. If there was a problem at all it was that the archives could have been fuller. One thing about a secret organisation is that it doesn\u2019t encourage its members to keep first-hand accounts \u2013 certainly not at the time. Writing diaries and even letters during operations is considered a bit of a no-no. But, as far as the unit was concerned, and in terms of access to its archives down in Poole, I was given carte blanche to see everything.\n\nThe other important thing is that I decided what to put in the book. There was no \u201cYou can\u2019t put that in\u201d from the SBS\u2019s perspective.

Find out more and book tickets\n\nA basic but important question: what exactly is the SBS?\n\nToday it\u2019s known as the Special Boat Service. In the Second World War, it went by a number of different names. If we go back to the beginning, a key player in the story was Roger \u201cJumbo\u201d Courtney, recognised today by the SBS as the father of the unit. He\u2019s the one who, towards the end of 1940, created the first maritime special operations unit, known as the Folbot Troop. (Folbots are folding canoes, which are incredibly useful for special operations because they allow you to move very low to the water and stealthily into your objective.) Gradually, as the war developed, not only was the SBS created, but also sister organisations: the COPPists [Combined Operations Pilotage Parties] and, later, the RMBPD [Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment].\n\nMore like this\n\nWhy was the SBS needed in the Second World War?\n\nIt came directly out of the Army Commandos, so we have to first explain why they were needed. If you think about the situation in June 1940, Britain was really in a hole. We\u2019d been chased off the continent, so how on Earth were we going to stop the Germans from dominating Europe on the one hand and invading the UK on the other?\n\nChurchill, being the pugnacious and rather optimistic character he was, quickly came to the understanding that we needed a force to strike back. Even if it wasn\u2019t going to achieve huge material damage, it would be a major psychological and PR success if we could show that we were still taking the fight to the enemy. So he came up with this idea of Army Commandos \u2013 this huge force of raiders who you could land on the coast anywhere around Europe. One of them was \u201cJumbo\u201d Courtney, who thought: \u201cOK, we can land in big groups and we can do a lot of damage, but we can also land in small groups \u2013 really small groups.\u201d Because if you think about it, a canoe has at most two people in it. And those canoes would enable people to get in and get out almost unseen. He believed that, even with a small number of people, you could create an awful lot of havoc.\n\nWhat kind of men joined the SBS?\n\nThe type of person Courtney was looking for then is very much the type of person the SBS recruits today. You want unshowy, determined problem-solvers. They\u2019re not big, muscular, shouty, punching types; rather, they are the type of people you wouldn\u2019t notice in a crowd, but they have a very particular skill set. They are very self-disciplined.\n\nListen: Saul David discusses his new history of the Special Boat Service \u2013 a daring maritime unit that played a crucial role in Allied victory in WW2:\n\nWhen was the SBS first properly tested?\n\nThe unit was formed towards the end of 1940 and, a few months later, it was taken out into the Mediterranean with the rest of 8th Commando. Courtney was looking around for opportunities, and he came across a man called Nigel Willmott. Now, Willmott is the second of the three key figures in the story of the SBS. Having been a veteran of the Narvik Operation in Norway, he always realised the importance of beach reconnaissance. In the early days, Courtney was thinking of SBS soldiers as saboteurs \u2013 as people who were going to cause havoc on a coastline. But Willmott was of the opinion that you go in quietly, you get information and then you leave. He told Courtney what he was planning and that he\u2019d been given the job of getting as much information as possible about the beaches on Rhodes, because a big operation was planned to land there. And Courtney said: \u201cI think we can do it with canoes.\u201d\n\nSo the first operation, in the spring of 1941, was carried out by Courtney and Willmott, these two giants of the story. They accomplished the mission, though it was daredevil stuff. Courtney almost drowned, they almost got bumped by German sentries, but they came back with this amazing cache of material that allowed the British to begin to prepare the invasion. Now, as it happened, the invasion never took place, but that didn\u2019t matter \u2013 it was proof of concept. They could now use canoes launched off submarines \u2013 and, of course, submarines could get anywhere in the world.\n\nOperation Frankton must be the most dramatic episode in the story of the SBS. What happened there?\n\nI\u2019d better say a word first about the leader of the operation, Herbert \u201cBlondie\u201d Hasler, the third of the giants in the story. He was a regular Royal Marine who was very fit, very determined and very single-minded. Hasler was interested in blowing up ships in harbour, and in mid-1942 he was given the go-ahead to create the RMBPD. It was effectively a cover name for a secret Royal Marine commando unit whose job was to destroy shipping.\n\nFrankton was an unbelievably optimistic operation. They were going to drop off six canoes, each manned by two people, at the entrance to the Gironde estuary [near Bordeaux, then in occupied France]. They would then paddle, over a period of three days in December 1942, 60 miles up the estuary, deep into enemy territory. And when they got to Bordeaux harbour they would sink some fast merchant ships that had been moving vital supplies back and forth between Axis ports.\n\nYour guide to National Service in Britain\n\nOnly five pairs of men started the mission from the submarine, about five miles off the coast, because one of the canoes got damaged. And only two got all the way to Bordeaux. The fate of the others didn\u2019t become known until after the operation: two of those canoes had overturned, and another pair were captured on their way in.\n\nSo just two pairs reached Bordeaux. When it got dark, they began their attack. It was an incredibly dangerous operation: they were almost spotted on a number of occasions, and there were moments when they almost gave the game away \u2013 but they didn\u2019t, and they managed to put limpet mines on five ships. And then they began their exfiltration.\n\nThis was where things got particularly tricky, because they had to escape through occupied France into Spain. Given that very few of the men could speak foreign languages, there was little chance of success. And so it proved: of the two crews who carried out the operation, only Hasler and his canoeist, Bill Sparks, after more amazing drama, managed to get to Spain.\n\nDoes this highlight just how dangerous SBS missions were?\n\nIt was arguably one of the most dangerous things to do in the Second World War. Just imagine being on one of these canoes, one of two men heading to lonely shores to carry out missions, with no backup and hardly any firepower. And, from October 1942 [following Adolf Hitler\u2019s Commando Order], they faced the likelihood that if they were caught, they would be executed \u2013 which is exactly what happened to six of Hasler\u2019s men.\n\nYet I haven\u2019t found a single instance, all the way through the Second World War, in which someone said: \u201cDo you know what? I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d It was astonishing bravery \u2013 and cold-blooded bravery, too. There was rarely a big firefight; you were just moving slowly into a coast.\n\nThe beach reconnaissance aspect came to the fore in the invasions of Sicily and Normandy. What was the role of the SBS in those two operations?\n\nThis was really the job of the COPPists. By the end of 1942, Nigel Willmott was given authorisation to create a dedicated unit that would be involved in beach reconnaissance. He\u2019d argued that we needed proper information about what was on the beaches, the exits, the firmness of the beaches, and of course the gradients leading into the beaches and any defences that were there.\n\nSo they created this amazing unit, COPP. Within COPP there were navigators like Willmott, but also SBS-trained engineers who would go in and get all the military information from the beaches. It was an all-purpose unit that began to prove its worth in Sicily, which was its first deployment.\n\nThough the invasion of Sicily took place in July 1943, the COPPists had been on the coast as early as March. They need to be doing this work months in advance and, though a lot of them were lost in the early operations \u2013 they drowned, they were captured, they were killed in firefights \u2013 there was very much a sense that it worked. If it was done properly, it could get the information to guarantee, as far as possible, that the huge landings planned for D-Day would succeed.\n\nHow much did the SBS shape the planning for D-Day?\n\nThis would be the greatest amphibious invasion in history, so the Allies needed to know that those beaches were firm enough to take all the wheeled transport and tanks that would be rolling over them within hours of the first troops landing. So the first and most crucial job given to the COPPists was to land on a couple of those beaches \u2013 the ones at the intersection between Juno and Gold, where the Canadian and British soldiers were going to land \u2013 and find out whether the beaches were firm enough. There was a suspicion they might not be, and until they knew for sure, all planning was on hold.\n\nWillmott picked two of his best people \u2013 Major Logan Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Bruce Ogden-Smith \u2013 to swim into the heavily guarded beaches of Normandy and gather information during the night of New Year\u2019s Eve 1943. They did a pretty good survey of the beaches and their defences, and obtained the most important information of all: that those beaches would hold the wheeled traffic.\n\nA month later, they carried out a second beach reconnaissance surveying the defences at Omaha. There they got crucial information about the sophistication of the German defences.\n\nAs well as gathering information in advance, COPP also guided in the forces during the actual landings, both as pilots on the landing craft and also, even more importantly, using Midget submarines to put up markers to show the landing craft the right way to go.\n\nOn D-Day itself, in places where they used these Midget submarines \u2013 that is, in the Canadian and British sectors \u2013 everyone got to the right place and landed properly. But the carnage on Omaha, in my view and in the view of the SBS at the time, was partly the result of the Americans not trusting the SBS to put up markers prior to the arrival of their landing craft. The result of this, combined with the bad weather and strong tides, was that enormous numbers of American troops at Omaha landed at the wrong place.\n\nThe carnage on Omaha, in my view and in the view of the SBS, was partly the result of the Americans not trusting the SBS to put up markers prior to the arrival of their landing craft\n\nThe Americans were worried that these markers would give the game away, which of course was a very serious danger. But there was a calculation among the British in their planning for D-Day that it was better to get to the right place and risk the chance of the operation being discovered. And they were proved right.\n\nOverall, how important was the SBS to the Allied war effort?\n\nIt is a hugely underestimated contribution that made a real difference in a number of ways. In a psychological sense, it really gave the British a chance to strike back, from the earliest days. These operations were happening all the time, and they were heavily publicised: if there was a major success, you can be damn sure people were told about it. And there was also the material effect they had, particularly in the Mediterranean, where a lot of railways and coastal infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nBut the single most important contribution was the beach reconnaissance, because it had a major impact on all the big landings \u2013 Sicily, Italy, Normandy \u2013 and also in the far east. If there\u2019s one thing I hope my book does, it\u2019s to give due recognition, particularly to the COPPists but to all those who come under the broader SBS banner, for the contribution they made, which has not been properly recognised up to now.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting point \u2013 because an equivalent service, the SAS, is very well known today. Why do you think the SBS seems to have lived in that unit\u2019s shadow?\n\nIt\u2019s partly because of the ways they operated. There\u2019s this great comparison between the SAS and the SBS, then and now: the SAS likes to burst in through the front door, making a lot of noise, whereas the SBS comes in the back door \u2013 stealthily, and leaving without being known. I think the sort of people who go into a unit like that are the sort of people who don\u2019t like shouting about their achievements. They didn\u2019t in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t after the war, and arguably they still don\u2019t even today.\n\nI think one of the reasons this book has been authorised is because the SBS certainly does want its history to be acknowledged. It\u2019s been long enough now. They want to be recognised for what they did then, and I think there\u2019s a sense that there will be a bit of reflected glory for what they do now.\n\nSaul David is a historian, broadcaster and author of several acclaimed works of fiction and non-fiction, including Crucible of Hell: Okinawa.

They landed on the beaches of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in 1942 \u2013 the first US ground offensive of the war \u2013 and were present when Okinawa, Japan\u2019s most southerly prefecture, finally fell to American troops after a bitter struggle in June 1945. In between they fought in the \u2018Green Hell\u2019 of Cape Gloucester on the island of New Britain, and across the coral wasteland of Peleliu in the Palau Islands, a campaign described by one K Company veteran as \u2018thirty days of the meanest, around-the-clock slaughter that desperate men can inflict on each other.\u2019\n\nOrdinary men from very different backgrounds, and drawn from cities, towns, and settlements across America, the Devil Dogs were asked to do something extraordinary: take on the victorious Imperial Japanese Army, composed of some of the most effective soldiers in world history \u2013 and defeat it. This is the story of how they did just that and, in the process, forged bonds of brotherhood that still survive today.\n\nRemarkably, the company contained an unusually high number of talented writers, whose first-hand accounts and memoirs provide the colour, emotion, and context for this extraordinary story.

COPPists \u2014 a combination of naval navigators and submariners with SBS (Special Boat Service) swimmers \u2014 played a key role in the planning and execution of Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of Europe. Admiral Ramsay, the architect of the naval element, said: \u2018On their operations depended to a very great extent the final success of Operation Overlord.\u2019\n\nWho were these people, and what exactly did they do? Saul David provides the answers in a detailed analysis of the development of seaborne special forces formed in Britain\u2019s darkest hour to take the offensive against the seemingly invincible German war machine. He has shown great skill in pulling the disparate threads of unit reports into a cohesive story. Many of these reports of operations from secret SBS archives were embargoed until now, and it is unsurprising that today\u2019s SBS considers the book the authorised wartime history.\n\nIt is a riveting story, and very British. In 1940 a few visionary men who saw the potential for clandestine marine operations against our land-focused German enemy came up with plans for using collapsible canoes or Folbots. Men from all parts of society and from all over the empire made up select groups of canoeists. We get a vibrant picture of them, their backgrounds and foibles. Those recruited were generally quiet and understated. Roger Courtney, the father of the SBS, had a sign on his desk that read: \u2018Are you tough? If so get out. I need buggers with intelligence.\u2019 They were without exception daring and brave.\n\nMost popular Brendan O\u2019Neill Prince Harry the Tyrannical\n\nOften deployed in submarines, Folbotists were given this advice in the event of being depth-charged:\n\nPay no attention, read an improving book (it might be held upside down but it doesn\u2019t matter, it is the impression that counts), everyone is just as tense as you are and nothing can be done about it.\n\nBesides the well-known operations featured in this book, how many readers were aware of the failed attempt to capture or kill Rommel, or knew of the machinations involving senior French officers before Operation Torch (the invasion of North Africa)? At the planning conference for Torch it was pointed out that, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how many compasses you give the landing craft. They won\u2019t find the beaches unless someone guides them in.\u2019 The Folbotists were set this task and performed it very successfully.\n\nAs all this was going on, back in Britain Major Blondie Haslar was forming the Royal Marine Boom Patrol Detachment (RMBPD) to attack ships in harbour. The name was designed to confuse the enemy as to its purpose. David cleverly weaves the narrative strands of this group as it develops into Operation Frankton, better known as \u2018The Cockleshell Heroes\u2019. It is a gripping story, and riveting in its detail. Under Hitler\u2019s infamous Commando Order of 18 October 1942 (that any commando captured would be shot), some of these men lost their lives.\n\nAfter their success in Operation Torch, Nigel Willmott was able to form the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPP). These canoeists could provide beach intelligence. In addition to reconnaissance, they would be required to act as pilots and markers in landing operations. For the Normandy landings, however, a new modus operandi using midget submarines had to be learned. It was, and with startling success.\n\nDavid provides a comprehensive description of the operations leading up to D-Day and the action itself. It is particularly fascinating that our COPPists warned General Omar Bradley about Omaha Beach on the strength of their recces: \u2018Sir, I hope you don\u2019t mind me saying it, but this beach is a very formidable proposition indeed.\u2019 Omaha was the most bloody beach on D-Day.\n\nThe last section of the book covers clandestine operations in Burma, Thailand, Malaya and Sumatra, carried out with the same bravery and panache as those in Europe. Throughout, David touches on the wrangling over who should have control of the various groups of special forces. Today UK Special Forces consist of the Special Air Service (Army) and Special Boat Service (Royal Navy/Royal Marines).\n\nThe best things in life are free (for a month) Unlock a month\u2019s worth of unlimited online and app access by subscribing today for free.

They worked deep inside enemy territory and were likely to be executed if caught. Many drowned in freezing water after hours of attempting to complete their mission. It demanded cool, calculated valour of a very high order. Not surprisingly, therefore, many were highly decorated.\n\nThis book is a must for naval and military historians. Beyond that, the knowledge of those involved, their bravery and jeopardy, will grip the general reader."}, {"url": "https://historyreclaimed.co.uk/events/the-eighteenth-century-origins-of-the-british-empire/", "page_content": "Make sure to RSVP to this amazing event!\n\nPlease let us know if you can make it to the event.\n\nYes\n\nOpenSpaces Still Available"}], "Saul David is a historian.": [{"url": "https://sauldavid.co.uk/", "page_content": "Saul David is a Sunday Times bestselling military historian, novelist and broadcaster.\n\nHis history books include The Indian Mutiny (shortlisted for the Westminster Medal for Military Literature), Zulu (a Waterstone's Military History Book of the Year), and Operation Thunderbolt: Flight 139 and the Raid on Entebbe Airport (an Amazon History Book of the Year).

We lived near Monmouth in lots of different buildings on my grandparents' big farm. At school there were more Davids than any other name: more than 20 of us cousins out of 40 pupils. When my older cousins moved on, the school had to close.\n\nIt was very old-fashioned. My brother was dyslexic and the headmaster was pretty tough on him: \"He's not really trying.\" When I was six or seven, we went to the nearest English primary school, St Weonards, about seven miles away. The teaching was good and this was the start of my beginning to shine as a student. I can trace my love of history to that school thanks to the fascinating classes of Mrs Tabor \u2013 history was her favourite subject. I think I also got the telly bug at that time when two series of The Survivors [a cult TV sci-fi] were filmed at my house and we all appeared as extras. I felt I was a star!\n\nI passed the 11-plus but it was decided that I should take the Common Entrance exam to Monmouth School, the nearest independent. I was never entirely comfortable there as they didn't have girls and they played rugby instead of football. After two years, I made a deal with my dad that if I went to the local comprehensive for three years, I would then go to his old boarding school, Ampleforth, for my sixth form.\n\nMy aunt was deputy head of John Kyrle High School, and she has always been slightly miffed that I don't mention it in my CV. I had a great time but it was the early days of it going comprehensive and, in retrospect, I realise that the education was pretty poor. It has improved hugely, I gather. I left with only seven O-levels, yet had the second- best results. I got an A in English language, but failed literature: a D. I asked for it to be re-marked and the report said: \"We think we marked you too highly.\"\n\nI died my hair blond in the summer, and at Ampleforth they said, \"You look like the guy in Bucks Fizz\", so that became my nickname. Once I'd adapted to being away from home, I loved Ampleforth. I thought then that the best history master was the one who spoon-fed us, but in fact the other master was the clever one: he made us think for ourselves. I got ABC in my A-levels and distinction in my history S-level.\n\nI got in to Trinity College, Dublin, but my LEA changed its policy of paying fees at \"foreign\" universities, so I chose Edinburgh instead, another Celtic capital. I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the teaching, although it had some fabulous historians. I worked hard at my four-year MA, but got a 2.1.

On 6 June 1944, the largest armada the world had ever seen appeared on the shores of northern France to open the \u201csecond front\u201d and defeat the Wehrmacht. The fighting was hard and bloody for both sides, and it was not until August that the German defensive line could be broken. Allied material superiority was facing a numerically weaker German force which, however, often showed a fanatical will to fight \u2013 and die. In contrast to most tours, which concentrate very much on the Allied experience of the campaign, we will be looking at \u201cboth sides of the hill\u201d and analyse both the Allied and German armies, their strategies and operational plans, and we will see how these played out on the (tactical) ground for the GI, the Tommy, and the Landser in Normandy in the summer of 1944.\n\nThe tour will be led by Prof Matthias Strohn, Visiting Professor of Military Studies at the Humanities Research Institute at the University of Buckingham, and, as Senior Associate Fellow, Head of Historical Analysis at the British Army\u2019s think tank, CHACR. Matthias holds a commission in the German Army and has, among other deployments, served on the defence attach\u00e9 staffs at the German embassies in Paris, London and Madrid. He has led over 100 battlefield tours and staff rides. In a previous deployment at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was responsible for Normandy Scholar, a joint academic-military exercise, which takes about 750 Army cadets to Normandy.\n\nDay One:\n\nMeet at Ashford International station, travel on Coach via Eurotunnel to Bayeux. Walking tour of Bayeux and introduction to the Normandy campaign\n\nDay Two:\n\nThe British Sector:\n\nWe explore the airborne attacks on Merville Battery and Pegasus Bridge. We then move on to Gold Beach to analyse the British landings and German counter-measures, and hear about the only VC won on D-Day. We finish the day at the new British D-Day memorial\n\nDay Three:\n\nThe British Sector:\n\nWe visit the German radar station at Douvres, which held out against British attacks until 17 June. We explore the German battery at Longues sur Mer and the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches before moving inland and analysing the battles at Hill 122, the \u2018Verdun of Normandy\u2019. Visit the Bayeux Tapestry Museum\n\nDay Four:\n\nThe American Sector:\n\nTravel to Omaha beach where we learn about the difficult landings and \u201cthe beast of Omaha\u201d. Visit the US cemetery before moving on to Pointe du Hoc to learn about the US Ranger attack on the formidable German defensive position. We visit the German military cemetery at La Cambe and finish the day at the Bayeux Battle of Normandy Museum\n\nDay Five:\n\nReturn to England\n\nThroughout the tour we will be staying in the Hotel Churchill in Bayeux (http://www.hotel-churchill.fr/en/). We considered booking a chateau hotel in the countryside. But the Churchill has the advantage of being situated in the centre of Bayeux, which makes it easy to explore the city on foot.

In Okinawa, the death toll included thousands of civilians lost to mass suicide, convinced by Japanese propaganda that they would otherwise be raped and murdered by the enemy.

They landed on the beaches of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in 1942 \u2013 the first US ground offensive of the war \u2013 and were present when Okinawa, Japan\u2019s most southerly prefecture, finally fell to American troops after a bitter struggle in June 1945. In between they fought in the \u2018Green Hell\u2019 of Cape Gloucester on the island of New Britain, and across the coral wasteland of Peleliu in the Palau Islands, a campaign described by one K Company veteran as \u2018thirty days of the meanest, around-the-clock slaughter that desperate men can inflict on each other.\u2019\n\nOrdinary men from very different backgrounds, and drawn from cities, towns, and settlements across America, the Devil Dogs were asked to do something extraordinary: take on the victorious Imperial Japanese Army, composed of some of the most effective soldiers in world history \u2013 and defeat it.

A couple of years ago I was contacted by my agent, who asked me if I would be interested in writing the authorised history of the Special Boat Service (SBS). And of course my initial reaction was: who wouldn\u2019t? But the reason my agent asked me is that they also happened to represent Paddy Ashdown, who was a former member of the SBS and had been commissioned to write the book. Very sadly, Paddy died rather suddenly towards the end of 2018, before the book was finished. So the question was: what happens next? Does someone finish Paddy\u2019s text or write a new version?\n\nRob Attar: Could we begin by discussing the genesis of this book? The story of how it came about is a little unusual.\n\nMy agent approached me with both possibilities, and sent me the manuscript. It was very good but it was not what I would have written. Paddy came from the perspective of a practitioner \u2013 he was very close to the unit. His writing was very emotive, whereas I\u2019ve always tried to keep an objective distance, as any historian does. Having read his early chapters, I decided it would make more sense to start from scratch. So we agreed that I would write the book in my own way, but would give due acknowledgement to Paddy in terms of the genesis.\n\nThis is an authorised history of a secretive organisation. How much access did you get? Were any aspects off limits?\n\nThey weren\u2019t, actually. If there was a problem at all it was that the archives could have been fuller. One thing about a secret organisation is that it doesn\u2019t encourage its members to keep first-hand accounts \u2013 certainly not at the time. Writing diaries and even letters during operations is considered a bit of a no-no. But, as far as the unit was concerned, and in terms of access to its archives down in Poole, I was given carte blanche to see everything.\n\nThe other important thing is that I decided what to put in the book. There was no \u201cYou can\u2019t put that in\u201d from the SBS\u2019s perspective. Even so, I did get good access to documents and also to people, which was invaluable because it helped me understand where the unit is today and how it takes its bloodline from the Second World War very seriously.\n\nSBS: Silent Warriors in a virtual HistoryExtra LIVE event on Thursday 21 October, at 7pm BST. Saul David will be talking aboutin a virtual HistoryExtra LIVE event on Thursday 21 October, at 7pm BST. Find out more and book tickets\n\nA basic but important question: what exactly is the SBS?\n\nToday it\u2019s known as the Special Boat Service. In the Second World War, it went by a number of different names. If we go back to the beginning, a key player in the story was Roger \u201cJumbo\u201d Courtney, recognised today by the SBS as the father of the unit. He\u2019s the one who, towards the end of 1940, created the first maritime special operations unit, known as the Folbot Troop. (Folbots are folding canoes, which are incredibly useful for special operations because they allow you to move very low to the water and stealthily into your objective.) Gradually, as the war developed, not only was the SBS created, but also sister organisations: the COPPists [Combined Operations Pilotage Parties] and, later, the RMBPD [Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment].\n\nMore like this\n\nWhy was the SBS needed in the Second World War?\n\nIt came directly out of the Army Commandos, so we have to first explain why they were needed. If you think about the situation in June 1940, Britain was really in a hole. We\u2019d been chased off the continent, so how on Earth were we going to stop the Germans from dominating Europe on the one hand and invading the UK on the other?\n\nChurchill, being the pugnacious and rather optimistic character he was, quickly came to the understanding that we needed a force to strike back. Even if it wasn\u2019t going to achieve huge material damage, it would be a major psychological and PR success if we could show that we were still taking the fight to the enemy. So he came up with this idea of Army Commandos \u2013 this huge force of raiders who you could land on the coast anywhere around Europe. One of them was \u201cJumbo\u201d Courtney, who thought: \u201cOK, we can land in big groups and we can do a lot of damage, but we can also land in small groups \u2013 really small groups.\u201d Because if you think about it, a canoe has at most two people in it. And those canoes would enable people to get in and get out almost unseen. He believed that, even with a small number of people, you could create an awful lot of havoc.\n\nWhat kind of men joined the SBS?\n\nThe type of person Courtney was looking for then is very much the type of person the SBS recruits today. You want unshowy, determined problem-solvers. They\u2019re not big, muscular, shouty, punching types; rather, they are the type of people you wouldn\u2019t notice in a crowd, but they have a very particular skill set. They are very self-disciplined.\n\nListen: Saul David discusses his new history of the Special Boat Service \u2013 a daring maritime unit that played a crucial role in Allied victory in WW2:\n\nWhen was the SBS first properly tested?\n\nThe unit was formed towards the end of 1940 and, a few months later, it was taken out into the Mediterranean with the rest of 8th Commando. Courtney was looking around for opportunities, and he came across a man called Nigel Willmott. Now, Willmott is the second of the three key figures in the story of the SBS. Having been a veteran of the Narvik Operation in Norway, he always realised the importance of beach reconnaissance. In the early days, Courtney was thinking of SBS soldiers as saboteurs \u2013 as people who were going to cause havoc on a coastline. But Willmott was of the opinion that you go in quietly, you get information and then you leave. He told Courtney what he was planning and that he\u2019d been given the job of getting as much information as possible about the beaches on Rhodes, because a big operation was planned to land there. And Courtney said: \u201cI think we can do it with canoes.\u201d\n\nSo the first operation, in the spring of 1941, was carried out by Courtney and Willmott, these two giants of the story. They accomplished the mission, though it was daredevil stuff. Courtney almost drowned, they almost got bumped by German sentries, but they came back with this amazing cache of material that allowed the British to begin to prepare the invasion. Now, as it happened, the invasion never took place, but that didn\u2019t matter \u2013 it was proof of concept. They could now use canoes launched off submarines \u2013 and, of course, submarines could get anywhere in the world.\n\nOperation Frankton must be the most dramatic episode in the story of the SBS. What happened there?\n\nI\u2019d better say a word first about the leader of the operation, Herbert \u201cBlondie\u201d Hasler, the third of the giants in the story. He was a regular Royal Marine who was very fit, very determined and very single-minded. Hasler was interested in blowing up ships in harbour, and in mid-1942 he was given the go-ahead to create the RMBPD. It was effectively a cover name for a secret Royal Marine commando unit whose job was to destroy shipping.\n\nFrankton was an unbelievably optimistic operation. They were going to drop off six canoes, each manned by two people, at the entrance to the Gironde estuary [near Bordeaux, then in occupied France]. They would then paddle, over a period of three days in December 1942, 60 miles up the estuary, deep into enemy territory. And when they got to Bordeaux harbour they would sink some fast merchant ships that had been moving vital supplies back and forth between Axis ports.\n\nYour guide to National Service in Britain\n\nOnly five pairs of men started the mission from the submarine, about five miles off the coast, because one of the canoes got damaged. And only two got all the way to Bordeaux. The fate of the others didn\u2019t become known until after the operation: two of those canoes had overturned, and another pair were captured on their way in.\n\nSo just two pairs reached Bordeaux. When it got dark, they began their attack. It was an incredibly dangerous operation: they were almost spotted on a number of occasions, and there were moments when they almost gave the game away \u2013 but they didn\u2019t, and they managed to put limpet mines on five ships. And then they began their exfiltration.\n\nThis was where things got particularly tricky, because they had to escape through occupied France into Spain. Given that very few of the men could speak foreign languages, there was little chance of success. And so it proved: of the two crews who carried out the operation, only Hasler and his canoeist, Bill Sparks, after more amazing drama, managed to get to Spain.\n\nDoes this highlight just how dangerous SBS missions were?\n\nIt was arguably one of the most dangerous things to do in the Second World War. Just imagine being on one of these canoes, one of two men heading to lonely shores to carry out missions, with no backup and hardly any firepower. And, from October 1942 [following Adolf Hitler\u2019s Commando Order], they faced the likelihood that if they were caught, they would be executed \u2013 which is exactly what happened to six of Hasler\u2019s men.\n\nYet I haven\u2019t found a single instance, all the way through the Second World War, in which someone said: \u201cDo you know what? I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d It was astonishing bravery \u2013 and cold-blooded bravery, too. There was rarely a big firefight; you were just moving slowly into a coast.\n\nThe beach reconnaissance aspect came to the fore in the invasions of Sicily and Normandy. What was the role of the SBS in those two operations?\n\nThis was really the job of the COPPists. By the end of 1942, Nigel Willmott was given authorisation to create a dedicated unit that would be involved in beach reconnaissance. He\u2019d argued that we needed proper information about what was on the beaches, the exits, the firmness of the beaches, and of course the gradients leading into the beaches and any defences that were there.\n\nSo they created this amazing unit, COPP. Within COPP there were navigators like Willmott, but also SBS-trained engineers who would go in and get all the military information from the beaches. It was an all-purpose unit that began to prove its worth in Sicily, which was its first deployment.\n\nThough the invasion of Sicily took place in July 1943, the COPPists had been on the coast as early as March. They need to be doing this work months in advance and, though a lot of them were lost in the early operations \u2013 they drowned, they were captured, they were killed in firefights \u2013 there was very much a sense that it worked. If it was done properly, it could get the information to guarantee, as far as possible, that the huge landings planned for D-Day would succeed.\n\nHow much did the SBS shape the planning for D-Day?\n\nThis would be the greatest amphibious invasion in history, so the Allies needed to know that those beaches were firm enough to take all the wheeled transport and tanks that would be rolling over them within hours of the first troops landing. So the first and most crucial job given to the COPPists was to land on a couple of those beaches \u2013 the ones at the intersection between Juno and Gold, where the Canadian and British soldiers were going to land \u2013 and find out whether the beaches were firm enough. There was a suspicion they might not be, and until they knew for sure, all planning was on hold.\n\nWillmott picked two of his best people \u2013 Major Logan Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Bruce Ogden-Smith \u2013 to swim into the heavily guarded beaches of Normandy and gather information during the night of New Year\u2019s Eve 1943. They did a pretty good survey of the beaches and their defences, and obtained the most important information of all: that those beaches would hold the wheeled traffic.\n\nA month later, they carried out a second beach reconnaissance surveying the defences at Omaha. There they got crucial information about the sophistication of the German defences.\n\nAs well as gathering information in advance, COPP also guided in the forces during the actual landings, both as pilots on the landing craft and also, even more importantly, using Midget submarines to put up markers to show the landing craft the right way to go.\n\nOn D-Day itself, in places where they used these Midget submarines \u2013 that is, in the Canadian and British sectors \u2013 everyone got to the right place and landed properly. But the carnage on Omaha, in my view and in the view of the SBS at the time, was partly the result of the Americans not trusting the SBS to put up markers prior to the arrival of their landing craft. The result of this, combined with the bad weather and strong tides, was that enormous numbers of American troops at Omaha landed at the wrong place.\n\nThe carnage on Omaha, in my view and in the view of the SBS, was partly the result of the Americans not trusting the SBS to put up markers prior to the arrival of their landing craft\n\nThe Americans were worried that these markers would give the game away, which of course was a very serious danger. But there was a calculation among the British in their planning for D-Day that it was better to get to the right place and risk the chance of the operation being discovered. And they were proved right.\n\nOverall, how important was the SBS to the Allied war effort?\n\nIt is a hugely underestimated contribution that made a real difference in a number of ways. In a psychological sense, it really gave the British a chance to strike back, from the earliest days. These operations were happening all the time, and they were heavily publicised: if there was a major success, you can be damn sure people were told about it. And there was also the material effect they had, particularly in the Mediterranean, where a lot of railways and coastal infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nBut the single most important contribution was the beach reconnaissance, because it had a major impact on all the big landings \u2013 Sicily, Italy, Normandy \u2013 and also in the far east. If there\u2019s one thing I hope my book does, it\u2019s to give due recognition, particularly to the COPPists but to all those who come under the broader SBS banner, for the contribution they made, which has not been properly recognised up to now.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting point \u2013 because an equivalent service, the SAS, is very well known today. Why do you think the SBS seems to have lived in that unit\u2019s shadow?\n\nIt\u2019s partly because of the ways they operated. There\u2019s this great comparison between the SAS and the SBS, then and now: the SAS likes to burst in through the front door, making a lot of noise, whereas the SBS comes in the back door \u2013 stealthily, and leaving without being known. I think the sort of people who go into a unit like that are the sort of people who don\u2019t like shouting about their achievements. They didn\u2019t in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t after the war, and arguably they still don\u2019t even today.\n\nI think one of the reasons this book has been authorised is because the SBS certainly does want its history to be acknowledged. It\u2019s been long enough now. They want to be recognised for what they did then, and I think there\u2019s a sense that there will be a bit of reflected glory for what they do now.\n\nSaul David is a historian, broadcaster and author of several acclaimed works of fiction and non-fiction, including Crucible of Hell: Okinawa.

In between they fought in the \u2018Green Hell\u2019 of Cape Gloucester on the island of New Britain, and across the coral wasteland of Peleliu in the Palau Islands, a campaign described by one K Company veteran as \u2018thirty days of the meanest, around-the-clock slaughter that desperate men can inflict on each other.\u2019\n\nOrdinary men from very different backgrounds, and drawn from cities, towns, and settlements across America, the Devil Dogs were asked to do something extraordinary: take on the victorious Imperial Japanese Army, composed of some of the most effective soldiers in world history \u2013 and defeat it. This is the story of how they did just that and, in the process, forged bonds of brotherhood that still survive today.\n\nRemarkably, the company contained an unusually high number of talented writers, whose first-hand accounts and memoirs provide the colour, emotion, and context for this extraordinary story.

In a fast-moving narrative ranging from London to the harsh terrain of India, Russia and the Far East, Saul David shows how Britain ruthlessly exploited her position as the world's only superpower to expand her empire. Yet little of this territorial acquisition was planned or sanctioned by the home government. Instead it was largely the work of the men on the ground, and to those at home it really did seem that the empire was acquired in a 'fit of absence of mind'. Saul David creates a vivid portrait of life on the violent fringes of empire, and of the seemingly endless and brutal wars that were fought in the name of trade, civilization and the balance of power.\n\n\n\n'Splendid . . . a terrific treasure-chest of anecdotes . . . a splendidly brisk, cool and judicious narrator' Daily Telegraph\n\n\n\n'Incisive and acute . . . thorough and occasionally revelatory, [David] always finds a telling phrase, an eye-catching detail or a human story' Sunday Times\n\n\n\nSaul David is Professor of War Studies at the University of Buckingham and the author of several critically acclaimed history books, including The Indian Mutiny: 1857 (shortlisted for the Westminster Medal for Military Literature), Zulu: The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879 (a Waterstone's Military History Book of the Year) and, most recently, Victoria's Wars: The Rise of Empire."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indian_Mutiny.html?id=eULXUXXc2NQC", "page_content": ": 1857 Saul David Penguin UK , 4 Sept 2003 - History - 544 pages 3 Reviews Reviews aren't verified, but Google checks for and removes fake content when it's identified 'A fine achievement by a huge new talent' William Dalrymple, Sunday Times\n\n\n\nIn 1857 the native troops of the Bengal army rose against their colonial masters.

David is right to stress that the mutiny stemmed from the men's reluctance to fight amongst strangers rather than their reluctance to fight at all, and that many of the mutineers preserved a dignified and soldierly attitude throughout the proceedings.' Richard Holmes, TLS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late September 1943, almost 200 veterans of General Montgomery\u2019s Eighth Army were arrested for refusing repeated orders to join units of the US Fifth Army at the Salerno beachhead in southern Italy. Within six weeks, all but one had been found guilty of mutiny, their sentences ranging from five years\u2019 penal servitude to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nFifty years on, Saul David became the first military historian to gain access to the court martial papers \u2013 normally restricted for 75 years. In addition to crucial defence documents and the testimony of eye-witnesses, these papers have enabled Saul David to expose:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow poorly-equipped Eighth Army veterans, some still recovering from wounds and illness, were needlessly sent as reinforcements to Salerno when Fifth Army men were available.\n\n\n\nHow transit camp authorities deliberately deceived the reinforcements as to their destination.\n\n\n\nHow the defence team at the trial was forced, by lack of time, lack of witnesses and the hostility of the court, to offer a case based on no evidence and doomed to fail.\n\n\n\nHow, after the humane intervention of the adjutant-general and the suspension of the sentences, insensitive staff officers and victimization in their new units caused many mutineers to desert.\n\n\n\nHow, as a result of their convictions, the former war heroes were stripped of their campaign and gallantry medals and branded as cowards.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcluding that the men were victims of a terrible injustice, Mutiny at Salerno provides a compelling case for a free pardon.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a book that no one interested in World War Two will want to miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Mutiny' has been critically acclaimed:\n\n\n\n\n\n'An important book' (Military Illustrated)\n\n\n\n\n\n'Mr David has added considerably to the knowledge of the Salerno mutiny.

He will discuss Victoria's Wars, his latest book out in paperback, at this weekend's Althorp Literary Festival in Northampton\n\nTo get to Welsh Newton Primary School, which was (just) in England, my cousins and I would walk over the fields in a straggling line, across the border into Wales, and back again into England. We lived near Monmouth in lots of different buildings on my grandparents' big farm. At school there were more Davids than any other name: more than 20 of us cousins out of 40 pupils. When my older cousins moved on, the school had to close.\n\nIt was very old-fashioned. My brother was dyslexic and the headmaster was pretty tough on him: \"He's not really trying.\" When I was six or seven, we went to the nearest English primary school, St Weonards, about seven miles away. The teaching was good and this was the start of my beginning to shine as a student. I can trace my love of history to that school thanks to the fascinating classes of Mrs Tabor \u2013 history was her favourite subject. I think I also got the telly bug at that time when two series of The Survivors [a cult TV sci-fi] were filmed at my house and we all appeared as extras. I felt I was a star!\n\nI passed the 11-plus but it was decided that I should take the Common Entrance exam to Monmouth School, the nearest independent. I was never entirely comfortable there as they didn't have girls and they played rugby instead of football. After two years, I made a deal with my dad that if I went to the local comprehensive for three years, I would then go to his old boarding school, Ampleforth, for my sixth form.\n\nMy aunt was deputy head of John Kyrle High School, and she has always been slightly miffed that I don't mention it in my CV. I had a great time but it was the early days of it going comprehensive and, in retrospect, I realise that the education was pretty poor. It has improved hugely, I gather. I left with only seven O-levels, yet had the second- best results. I got an A in English language, but failed literature: a D. I asked for it to be re-marked and the report said: \"We think we marked you too highly.\"\n\nI died my hair blond in the summer, and at Ampleforth they said, \"You look like the guy in Bucks Fizz\", so that became my nickname. Once I'd adapted to being away from home, I loved Ampleforth. I thought then that the best history master was the one who spoon-fed us, but in fact the other master was the clever one: he made us think for ourselves. I got ABC in my A-levels and distinction in my history S-level.\n\nI got in to Trinity College, Dublin, but my LEA changed its policy of paying fees at \"foreign\" universities, so I chose Edinburgh instead, another Celtic capital. I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the teaching, although it had some fabulous historians. I worked hard at my four-year MA, but got a 2.1. That was a big disappointment as I wanted to write about history and thought I needed a First.\n\nBut I did it anyway, and at 31 I got fantastic reviews for my fourth book, The Homicidal Earl: I was a \"rising star\". On the same day I was offered a scholarship for a doctorate at Glasgow University. My best book came out of the research I did there, The Indian Mutiny. Now that I'm Visiting Professor in Military History at Hull University, I'll be telling my PhD students, \"Choose an original subject \u2013 but one that you can also sell as a book.\""}, {"url": "https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/saul-david-special-boat-service-history-sbs-ww2/", "page_content": "Saul David: It\u2019s very unusual. A couple of years ago I was contacted by my agent, who asked me if I would be interested in writing the authorised history of the Special Boat Service (SBS). And of course my initial reaction was: who wouldn\u2019t? But the reason my agent asked me is that they also happened to represent Paddy Ashdown, who was a former member of the SBS and had been commissioned to write the book. Very sadly, Paddy died rather suddenly towards the end of 2018, before the book was finished. So the question was: what happens next? Does someone finish Paddy\u2019s text or write a new version?\n\nRob Attar: Could we begin by discussing the genesis of this book? The story of how it came about is a little unusual.\n\nMy agent approached me with both possibilities, and sent me the manuscript. It was very good but it was not what I would have written. Paddy came from the perspective of a practitioner \u2013 he was very close to the unit. His writing was very emotive, whereas I\u2019ve always tried to keep an objective distance, as any historian does. Having read his early chapters, I decided it would make more sense to start from scratch. So we agreed that I would write the book in my own way, but would give due acknowledgement to Paddy in terms of the genesis.\n\nThis is an authorised history of a secretive organisation. How much access did you get? Were any aspects off limits?\n\nThey weren\u2019t, actually. If there was a problem at all it was that the archives could have been fuller. One thing about a secret organisation is that it doesn\u2019t encourage its members to keep first-hand accounts \u2013 certainly not at the time. Writing diaries and even letters during operations is considered a bit of a no-no. But, as far as the unit was concerned, and in terms of access to its archives down in Poole, I was given carte blanche to see everything.\n\nThe other important thing is that I decided what to put in the book. There was no \u201cYou can\u2019t put that in\u201d from the SBS\u2019s perspective. Even so, I did get good access to documents and also to people, which was invaluable because it helped me understand where the unit is today and how it takes its bloodline from the Second World War very seriously.\n\nSBS: Silent Warriors in a virtual HistoryExtra LIVE event on Thursday 21 October, at 7pm BST. Saul David will be talking aboutin a virtual HistoryExtra LIVE event on Thursday 21 October, at 7pm BST. Find out more and book tickets\n\nA basic but important question: what exactly is the SBS?\n\nToday it\u2019s known as the Special Boat Service. In the Second World War, it went by a number of different names. If we go back to the beginning, a key player in the story was Roger \u201cJumbo\u201d Courtney, recognised today by the SBS as the father of the unit. He\u2019s the one who, towards the end of 1940, created the first maritime special operations unit, known as the Folbot Troop. (Folbots are folding canoes, which are incredibly useful for special operations because they allow you to move very low to the water and stealthily into your objective.) Gradually, as the war developed, not only was the SBS created, but also sister organisations: the COPPists [Combined Operations Pilotage Parties] and, later, the RMBPD [Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment].\n\nMore like this\n\nWhy was the SBS needed in the Second World War?\n\nIt came directly out of the Army Commandos, so we have to first explain why they were needed. If you think about the situation in June 1940, Britain was really in a hole. We\u2019d been chased off the continent, so how on Earth were we going to stop the Germans from dominating Europe on the one hand and invading the UK on the other?\n\nChurchill, being the pugnacious and rather optimistic character he was, quickly came to the understanding that we needed a force to strike back. Even if it wasn\u2019t going to achieve huge material damage, it would be a major psychological and PR success if we could show that we were still taking the fight to the enemy. So he came up with this idea of Army Commandos \u2013 this huge force of raiders who you could land on the coast anywhere around Europe. One of them was \u201cJumbo\u201d Courtney, who thought: \u201cOK, we can land in big groups and we can do a lot of damage, but we can also land in small groups \u2013 really small groups.\u201d Because if you think about it, a canoe has at most two people in it. And those canoes would enable people to get in and get out almost unseen. He believed that, even with a small number of people, you could create an awful lot of havoc.\n\nWhat kind of men joined the SBS?\n\nThe type of person Courtney was looking for then is very much the type of person the SBS recruits today. You want unshowy, determined problem-solvers. They\u2019re not big, muscular, shouty, punching types; rather, they are the type of people you wouldn\u2019t notice in a crowd, but they have a very particular skill set. They are very self-disciplined.\n\nListen: Saul David discusses his new history of the Special Boat Service \u2013 a daring maritime unit that played a crucial role in Allied victory in WW2:\n\nWhen was the SBS first properly tested?\n\nThe unit was formed towards the end of 1940 and, a few months later, it was taken out into the Mediterranean with the rest of 8th Commando. Courtney was looking around for opportunities, and he came across a man called Nigel Willmott. Now, Willmott is the second of the three key figures in the story of the SBS. Having been a veteran of the Narvik Operation in Norway, he always realised the importance of beach reconnaissance. In the early days, Courtney was thinking of SBS soldiers as saboteurs \u2013 as people who were going to cause havoc on a coastline. But Willmott was of the opinion that you go in quietly, you get information and then you leave. He told Courtney what he was planning and that he\u2019d been given the job of getting as much information as possible about the beaches on Rhodes, because a big operation was planned to land there. And Courtney said: \u201cI think we can do it with canoes.\u201d\n\nSo the first operation, in the spring of 1941, was carried out by Courtney and Willmott, these two giants of the story. They accomplished the mission, though it was daredevil stuff. Courtney almost drowned, they almost got bumped by German sentries, but they came back with this amazing cache of material that allowed the British to begin to prepare the invasion. Now, as it happened, the invasion never took place, but that didn\u2019t matter \u2013 it was proof of concept. They could now use canoes launched off submarines \u2013 and, of course, submarines could get anywhere in the world.\n\nOperation Frankton must be the most dramatic episode in the story of the SBS. What happened there?\n\nI\u2019d better say a word first about the leader of the operation, Herbert \u201cBlondie\u201d Hasler, the third of the giants in the story. He was a regular Royal Marine who was very fit, very determined and very single-minded. Hasler was interested in blowing up ships in harbour, and in mid-1942 he was given the go-ahead to create the RMBPD. It was effectively a cover name for a secret Royal Marine commando unit whose job was to destroy shipping.\n\nFrankton was an unbelievably optimistic operation. They were going to drop off six canoes, each manned by two people, at the entrance to the Gironde estuary [near Bordeaux, then in occupied France]. They would then paddle, over a period of three days in December 1942, 60 miles up the estuary, deep into enemy territory. And when they got to Bordeaux harbour they would sink some fast merchant ships that had been moving vital supplies back and forth between Axis ports.\n\nYour guide to National Service in Britain\n\nOnly five pairs of men started the mission from the submarine, about five miles off the coast, because one of the canoes got damaged. And only two got all the way to Bordeaux. The fate of the others didn\u2019t become known until after the operation: two of those canoes had overturned, and another pair were captured on their way in.\n\nSo just two pairs reached Bordeaux. When it got dark, they began their attack. It was an incredibly dangerous operation: they were almost spotted on a number of occasions, and there were moments when they almost gave the game away \u2013 but they didn\u2019t, and they managed to put limpet mines on five ships. And then they began their exfiltration.\n\nThis was where things got particularly tricky, because they had to escape through occupied France into Spain. Given that very few of the men could speak foreign languages, there was little chance of success. And so it proved: of the two crews who carried out the operation, only Hasler and his canoeist, Bill Sparks, after more amazing drama, managed to get to Spain.\n\nDoes this highlight just how dangerous SBS missions were?\n\nIt was arguably one of the most dangerous things to do in the Second World War. Just imagine being on one of these canoes, one of two men heading to lonely shores to carry out missions, with no backup and hardly any firepower. And, from October 1942 [following Adolf Hitler\u2019s Commando Order], they faced the likelihood that if they were caught, they would be executed \u2013 which is exactly what happened to six of Hasler\u2019s men.\n\nYet I haven\u2019t found a single instance, all the way through the Second World War, in which someone said: \u201cDo you know what? I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d It was astonishing bravery \u2013 and cold-blooded bravery, too. There was rarely a big firefight; you were just moving slowly into a coast.\n\nThe beach reconnaissance aspect came to the fore in the invasions of Sicily and Normandy. What was the role of the SBS in those two operations?\n\nThis was really the job of the COPPists. By the end of 1942, Nigel Willmott was given authorisation to create a dedicated unit that would be involved in beach reconnaissance. He\u2019d argued that we needed proper information about what was on the beaches, the exits, the firmness of the beaches, and of course the gradients leading into the beaches and any defences that were there.\n\nSo they created this amazing unit, COPP. Within COPP there were navigators like Willmott, but also SBS-trained engineers who would go in and get all the military information from the beaches. It was an all-purpose unit that began to prove its worth in Sicily, which was its first deployment.\n\nThough the invasion of Sicily took place in July 1943, the COPPists had been on the coast as early as March. They need to be doing this work months in advance and, though a lot of them were lost in the early operations \u2013 they drowned, they were captured, they were killed in firefights \u2013 there was very much a sense that it worked. If it was done properly, it could get the information to guarantee, as far as possible, that the huge landings planned for D-Day would succeed.\n\nHow much did the SBS shape the planning for D-Day?\n\nThis would be the greatest amphibious invasion in history, so the Allies needed to know that those beaches were firm enough to take all the wheeled transport and tanks that would be rolling over them within hours of the first troops landing. So the first and most crucial job given to the COPPists was to land on a couple of those beaches \u2013 the ones at the intersection between Juno and Gold, where the Canadian and British soldiers were going to land \u2013 and find out whether the beaches were firm enough. There was a suspicion they might not be, and until they knew for sure, all planning was on hold.\n\nWillmott picked two of his best people \u2013 Major Logan Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Bruce Ogden-Smith \u2013 to swim into the heavily guarded beaches of Normandy and gather information during the night of New Year\u2019s Eve 1943. They did a pretty good survey of the beaches and their defences, and obtained the most important information of all: that those beaches would hold the wheeled traffic.\n\nA month later, they carried out a second beach reconnaissance surveying the defences at Omaha. There they got crucial information about the sophistication of the German defences.\n\nAs well as gathering information in advance, COPP also guided in the forces during the actual landings, both as pilots on the landing craft and also, even more importantly, using Midget submarines to put up markers to show the landing craft the right way to go.\n\nOn D-Day itself, in places where they used these Midget submarines \u2013 that is, in the Canadian and British sectors \u2013 everyone got to the right place and landed properly. But the carnage on Omaha, in my view and in the view of the SBS at the time, was partly the result of the Americans not trusting the SBS to put up markers prior to the arrival of their landing craft. The result of this, combined with the bad weather and strong tides, was that enormous numbers of American troops at Omaha landed at the wrong place.\n\nThe carnage on Omaha, in my view and in the view of the SBS, was partly the result of the Americans not trusting the SBS to put up markers prior to the arrival of their landing craft\n\nThe Americans were worried that these markers would give the game away, which of course was a very serious danger. But there was a calculation among the British in their planning for D-Day that it was better to get to the right place and risk the chance of the operation being discovered. And they were proved right.\n\nOverall, how important was the SBS to the Allied war effort?\n\nIt is a hugely underestimated contribution that made a real difference in a number of ways. In a psychological sense, it really gave the British a chance to strike back, from the earliest days. These operations were happening all the time, and they were heavily publicised: if there was a major success, you can be damn sure people were told about it. And there was also the material effect they had, particularly in the Mediterranean, where a lot of railways and coastal infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nBut the single most important contribution was the beach reconnaissance, because it had a major impact on all the big landings \u2013 Sicily, Italy, Normandy \u2013 and also in the far east. If there\u2019s one thing I hope my book does, it\u2019s to give due recognition, particularly to the COPPists but to all those who come under the broader SBS banner, for the contribution they made, which has not been properly recognised up to now.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting point \u2013 because an equivalent service, the SAS, is very well known today. Why do you think the SBS seems to have lived in that unit\u2019s shadow?\n\nIt\u2019s partly because of the ways they operated. There\u2019s this great comparison between the SAS and the SBS, then and now: the SAS likes to burst in through the front door, making a lot of noise, whereas the SBS comes in the back door \u2013 stealthily, and leaving without being known. I think the sort of people who go into a unit like that are the sort of people who don\u2019t like shouting about their achievements. They didn\u2019t in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t after the war, and arguably they still don\u2019t even today.\n\nI think one of the reasons this book has been authorised is because the SBS certainly does want its history to be acknowledged. It\u2019s been long enough now. They want to be recognised for what they did then, and I think there\u2019s a sense that there will be a bit of reflected glory for what they do now.\n\nSaul David is a historian, broadcaster and author of several acclaimed works of fiction and non-fiction, including Crucible of Hell: Okinawa.

He will discuss Victoria's Wars, his latest book out in paperback, at this weekend's Althorp Literary Festival in Northampton\n\nTo get to Welsh Newton Primary School, which was (just) in England, my cousins and I would walk over the fields in a straggling line, across the border into Wales, and back again into England. We lived near Monmouth in lots of different buildings on my grandparents' big farm. At school there were more Davids than any other name: more than 20 of us cousins out of 40 pupils. When my older cousins moved on, the school had to close.\n\nIt was very old-fashioned. My brother was dyslexic and the headmaster was pretty tough on him: \"He's not really trying.\" When I was six or seven, we went to the nearest English primary school, St Weonards, about seven miles away. The teaching was good and this was the start of my beginning to shine as a student. I can trace my love of history to that school thanks to the fascinating classes of Mrs Tabor \u2013 history was her favourite subject. I think I also got the telly bug at that time when two series of The Survivors [a cult TV sci-fi] were filmed at my house and we all appeared as extras. I felt I was a star!\n\nI passed the 11-plus but it was decided that I should take the Common Entrance exam to Monmouth School, the nearest independent. I was never entirely comfortable there as they didn't have girls and they played rugby instead of football. After two years, I made a deal with my dad that if I went to the local comprehensive for three years, I would then go to his old boarding school, Ampleforth, for my sixth form.\n\nMy aunt was deputy head of John Kyrle High School, and she has always been slightly miffed that I don't mention it in my CV. I had a great time but it was the early days of it going comprehensive and, in retrospect, I realise that the education was pretty poor. It has improved hugely, I gather. I left with only seven O-levels, yet had the second- best results. I got an A in English language, but failed literature: a D. I asked for it to be re-marked and the report said: \"We think we marked you too highly.\"\n\nI died my hair blond in the summer, and at Ampleforth they said, \"You look like the guy in Bucks Fizz\", so that became my nickname. Once I'd adapted to being away from home, I loved Ampleforth. I thought then that the best history master was the one who spoon-fed us, but in fact the other master was the clever one: he made us think for ourselves. I got ABC in my A-levels and distinction in my history S-level.\n\nI got in to Trinity College, Dublin, but my LEA changed its policy of paying fees at \"foreign\" universities, so I chose Edinburgh instead, another Celtic capital. I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the teaching, although it had some fabulous historians. I worked hard at my four-year MA, but got a 2.1. That was a big disappointment as I wanted to write about history and thought I needed a First.\n\nBut I did it anyway, and at 31 I got fantastic reviews for my fourth book, The Homicidal Earl: I was a \"rising star\". On the same day I was offered a scholarship for a doctorate at Glasgow University. My best book came out of the research I did there, The Indian Mutiny. Now that I'm Visiting Professor in Military History at Hull University, I'll be telling my PhD students, \"Choose an original subject \u2013 but one that you can also sell as a book.\""}, {"url": "https://petersfraserdunlop.com/clients/saul-david/", "page_content": "Saul David was born in Monmouth in 1966 and educated at Ampleforth College and Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities (History MA and PhD).\n\nHe began writing his first history book when he was twenty-five and has now completed fifteen (one edited).

David suffered his first stroke at the end of March 2017 and another one at the end of April. He was buried at sea on May 18th - a beautiful Bermuda day, surrounded by a small handful of family and friends. David is survived by his wife Christine, son Jonathan (Elyane) daughter Robin (Will) and four grandchildren.\n\nDavid John Saul was born at home on Keith Hall Road in Bermuda on November 27, 1939. David studied Physical Education with History at Loughborough University, graduating in 1962. David received an Honorary Doctorate from the Institution in 2012 for his outstanding career in education, politics and international business. David returned to Bermuda from Loughborough to teach before spending a period in Canada where he earned his MA and PhD. He then worked at the University of Toronto and for the Ontario board of Education. With this experience he returned to Bermuda where he was asked to review and dramatically modernise Bermuda's education system. In 1977 he took a job in the Ministry of Finance and from there moved into a financial career that led him to become President of Fidelity Bermuda and Executive Vice-President of Fidelity International. David\u2019s political career was also notable; he won the United Bermuda Party\u2019s seat in Devonshire South in a primary, and followed it up in the General Election of 1989, serving as Minister of Finance. David then went on to serve as Premier of Bermuda from 1995 to 1997.\n\nDavid had varied interests, a keen oceanographer with a passion for shipwrecks and the sea; he was a founding Trustee of the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute and a founding Director of the Professional Shipwreck Explorers Association. He was on the Board of US company Odyssey Marine Exploration which specialises in finding valuable shipwrecks around the world in deep waters. An extraordinary find was the long-lost wreck of HMS Victory in the English Channel. David was an enthusiastic participant in water sports, including scuba diving, fishing and kayaking. His kayaking adventures have taken him from Panama to Alaska, and from NE Greenland to Tasmania. David was also a dedicated long distance runner, holding every Bermuda record from 1 to 10 miles. He completed the Boston Marathon in 2 hours, 47 minutes at age 40 and in 2001 he won the \"over 60\" age group in Bermuda's annual half marathon. Finally, David owned a fully equipped carpentry shop and specialised in carving items out of old cedar roots. He became famous for carving whales and gave a private showing to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during their official visit to Bermuda in 2009.\n\nDavid was a much loved philanthropic supporter of Loughborough University, having given generously to support the University in a variety of areas including the transformation of the Pilkington Library and research into chronic disease in the National Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine located on the Loughborough Campus."}, {"url": "http://dawnbible.com/1962/6205tbs1.htm", "page_content": "Topical Bible Study May 1962\n\nThe People in God\u2019s Plan\u2014Lesson X\n\nKing David\n\nDAVID, who at heart was thoroughly devoted to God, was the second king of Israel, Saul being the first. For a period of 450 years prior to the time when Saul became king, the nation was under the jurisdiction of judges whom the Lord raised up from time to time as needed. Samuel was the last of these judges, and he also was a prophet. Toward the close of his judgeship the Israelites clamored for a king to rule over them, so as to be like their neighbor nations. The Lord instructed Samuel to accede to the request of the people.\u2014I Sam. 8:4-7\n\nThe Lord indicated by his providences that Saul was to be Israel\u2019s first king, and Samuel anointed him to this position. (I Sam. 10:1) But Saul did not continue to obey the Lord, so he was rejected as king, (I Sam. 15:17-23) and David was anointed to this high position. (I Sam.16:11-13) However, the Lord did not immediately remove Saul from his status as king; and David did not become king until after the death of Saul. Even then, it was some time before David was accepted as king over all Israel.\u2014II Sam. 5:1-3\n\nDavid had weaknesses of character, but at heart he was thoroughly loyal to the Lord. Indeed, the Lord referred to David as a man after his own heart. (I Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22) In devotion to the Lord, and with a great desire to honor him, David aspired to build a \u201chouse,\u201d a temple for him. The Prophet Nathan gave his consent to this undertaking.\u2014II Sam. 7:1-3\n\nBut Nathan spoke too hastily in this matter, and without consulting the Lord. That night the Lord spoke to Nathan, instructing him to inform David that he was not to build a temple, although he was permitted to gather much material for it. Instead, Nathan was to inform David that the Lord would establish his family, symbolically called a \u201chouse,\u201d forever as the ruling family of Israel. In this prophetic message which Nathan was to deliver reference is made to David\u2019s first successor, his son Solomon, arid the promise made that even though he \u201ccommit iniquity,\u201d which he did, the kingdom would not be wrested from him as it had been taken from the family of Saul.\u2014II Sam. 7:4-17\n\nDavid was greatly moved by the far-reaching promise which the Lord had made to him. He recognized that he was not worthy of so high an honor in the Lord\u2019s arrangement. While he did not understand all the implications of the prophetic promise, he sensed that it had to do with his family and with Israel for \u201ca great while to come.\u201d In recognition of the Lord\u2019s promise, David uttered one of the outstanding prayers recorded in the Old Testament.\u2014II Sam. 7:18-29\n\nDavid did not understand that this covenant which the Lord had made with him would have its real fulfillment in the coming reign of Israel\u2019s Messiah. (Luke 1:31-33) So far as the immediate and natural house of David was concerned, God did show a great deal of mercy in maintaining the rulership of its successive kings. Solomon, who received the kingdom from his father David, was faithful to the Lord for a while, but in his latter years permitted his idolatrous wives to lead him away from the pure worship of Jehovah. The Lord foretold that he would chasten Solomon for this, but would not take the kingdom from him.\u2014II Sam. 7:13-15\n\nAfter Solomon\u2019s death the kingdom was divided. Ten of Israel\u2019s tribes revolted against Solomon\u2019s son Rehoboam. The revolt was led by Jeroboam, who during Solomon\u2019s reign had fled to Egypt to escape punishment by the king. Two of the tribes, however, clung to Rehoboam, and the Davidic line of rulers was maintained in this tiny two-tribe kingdom until 606 B.C., when its last king was overthrown by King Nebuchadnezzar, and together with the people, taken captive to Babylon.\n\nSome of these kings did their best to serve the Lord faithfully; others did not. But throughout this long period God continued to show his mercy in maintaining the house of David, as he had promised. But finally a change came\u2014not the destruction of the house of David\u2014but a suspension of its active rulership until the real heir to the Lord\u2019s covenant with David should come. This One is referred to as he \u201cwhose right it is.\u201d\u2014Ezek. 21:25-27\n\nIn the prophecies of the Bible the fact is recognized that a great change would take place in the \u201chouse of David,\u201d or in connection with David\u2019s throne.\u201d In a prophecy of the birth of Jesus, and the purpose of his birth, the declaration is made that this great King would \u201corder\u201d and \u201cestablish\u201d David\u2019s throne and kingdom. (Isa.9:6,7) The One who was to do this was, of course, Jesus. (Luke 1:31-33) David\u2019s throne and kingdom needed to be put in order and \u201cestablished,\u201d for its rulership ceased in 606 B.C. when Zedekiah, its last natural king, was overthrown.\n\nWhile there is a vast difference between the typical kingdom of David and the antitypical, nevertheless the Scriptures show that Jesus, by birth, was of the family of David. (Matt. 1:1-17) Jesus\u2019 kingdom will, in reality, be the kingdom of the Lord in the earth, and the Scriptures refer to the typical kingdom of David as also \u201cthe throne of the Lord.\u201d\u2014I Chron. 29:23\n\nWhile Jesus was born to be the great King of promise, his actual rulership is not established in the earth until the time of his second presence. (John 18:37) Unlike the typical kings in David\u2019s ruling house, the antitypical David will not reign over dying subjects, for one of the important functions of his kingdom will be to give health and life to the people. In order that this might be possible it was first necessary for this future King to die for his subjects, thus becoming the Redeemer from sin and death. This essential part of the divine plan of salvation was accomplished at Jesus\u2019 first advent.\u2014John 6:51; Matt 20:28; I Tim. 2:6\n\nHowever, the fact that Jesus died to redeem the world of mankind from death did not interfere with the divine plan for him to be the great antitypical David to reign over the re-ordered kingdom of David, for God raised him from the dead. This is referred to by the Apostle Paul as \u201cglad tidings.\u201d\u2014Acts 13:32-34\n\nKing David established his throne in Mount Zion of Jerusalem, so Zion is used in the Bible as a symbol of the antitypical throne, or kingdom of David. In one prophecy Jesus, who first died for the people, is appropriately referred to as a \u201clamb,\u201d the Lamb that was slain, and is pictured as being on Mount Zion [Greek, mount Sion]. In this prophecy Jesus\u2019 footstep followers are shown to be with him, sharing his rulership in symbolic Mount Zion.\u2014Rev. 14:1-4\n\nDavid, the typical ruler who sat on the throne of the Lord, was earthly, a natural man; the anti-typical David is spiritual, a glorious divine being. The re-establishment of the house of David in the hands of Jesus does not, therefore, refer to the material status of the past, such as a literal mountain, or a literal palace, but to the rulership itself. It was divine rulership in the case of the typical, and it is divine rulership in the case of the antitypical. Thus it is referred to as a building again of the tabernacle, or house of David. \u2014Acts 15:15-17; Isa. 16:5; Amos 9:11\n\nJesus describes himself as both the \u201croot\u201d and the \u201coffspring\u201d of David. (Rev. 22:16) Jesus was the offspring of David in the sense that his mother was a direct descendent of David. He will be the root of David, in that David will receive life from Christ in the resurrection, and will be one of the princes in all the earth\u2014the earthly ruling phase of the messianic kingdom.\u2014Ps. 45:16\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nRELATE the circumstances which led up to Israel\u2019s becoming a kingdom.\n\nWho was the first king of Israel, and why was David anointed to take his place?

This was a typical kingdom in which the Lord was the real ruler. This typical kingdom ceased in 606 B.C., when Israel\u2019s last king was overthrown by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The antitypical began with Christ who, through his mother, was a descendant of David. The antitypical kingdom of David is established in power and great glory at Christ\u2019s second presence. During his first presence he died as the Redeemer and Savior of the world."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/saul", "page_content": "(1050-1000)\n\nWho Was Saul?\n\nThe Hebrew Bible (referred to as the Old Testament by Christians) names Saul (Hebrew Sha'ul) as the first king of Israel, who reigned circa 1020 to 1000 BCE. According to the Bible, as king, Saul marshaled military forces to fight the Ammonites, Edomites, Moabites, Amalekites and Philistines. In one version of Saul's death, he took his own life following an unsuccessful battle against the Philistines circa 1000. Saul was eventually succeeded by David, a formerly valued member of his court who had become a rival. There are no non-biblical sources that recount Saul's life, but some archeological discoveries have corroborated aspects of his reign.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSaul's exact date of birth is unknown. Under the assumption that he became king at the age of 30 circa 1020 BCE, he would have been born circa 1050 BCE. He was a member of the northern tribe of Benjamin.\n\nKing of Israel\n\nThe Hebrew Bible offers three different versions of Saul's ascension to the kingship of Israel. In one, Saul is anointed as king by the judge Samuel; a selling point is Saul's notable height. In another, Saul is chosen by lots when Israelites seek a king to unite different tribes and confront external threats. The third version links Saul's selection to his rescue of the town of Jabesh-Gilead from besieging Ammonites.\n\nFor some, the third story is the most believable. Having military ability could have helped Saul build power, and would explain his later successes fighting the Philistines.\n\nThe small kingdom that Saul ruled likely included Mt. Ephraim, Benjamin and Gilead.\n\nThe time that Saul served as king of Israel is generally approximated as about 20 years, circa 1020 to 1000 BCE. However, the Hebrew text of the Bible reads that Saul became king at the age of 1 and ruled for two years, which is obviously unlikely. Some early Greek translations of the Bible state that Saul took power when he was 30 years old.\n\nSaul was initially succeeded by his youngest and only surviving son, Ishbaal (also written as Ishba'al and also called Ishbosheth). After Ishbaal was killed, David took control of his kingdom.\n\nAchievements\n\nThough the Bible states that during Saul's reign he demonstrated shortcomings like extreme jealousy of David, as the first king of Israel, Saul succeeded in bringing different tribes into a closer association and achieved several victories over Israel's enemies. In addition, the united monarchy that Saul established was subsequently ruled by the lauded leaders David and Solomon.\n\nSaul and David\n\nSamuel decreed that Saul no longer had God's favor and anointed David as the next king. There are different stories about Saul and David's early relationship. In one, Saul initially welcomed David to his court as a harpist; his musical talent could soothe Saul should he be tormented by an \"evil spirit.\" In another, David's military talents were the avenue by which he became known to Saul.\n\nTriumphs such as David's heralded defeat of Goliath awakened Saul's jealousy. This feeling continued despite David's marriage to Saul's daughter Michal, and his friendship with Saul's son Jonathan. After Saul decided to kill David, the younger man ended up seeking safe harbor with the Philistines.\n\nDeath\n\nSaul died circa 1000 BCE on Mount Gilboa. The Bible recounts that before an important battle with the Philistines, Saul visited a witch to ask about his fate. The witch conjured the spirit of the departed Samuel, who informed Saul that he and his sons would be defeated and die.\n\nAfter fighting the Philistines at Mount Gilboa, 1 Samuel relates that Saul chose to fall on his sword to avoid being taken by the enemy.\n\nQuestioning Saul's Existence\n\nInformation about Saul's life and reign comes from the Bible, whose text was not written down until years after Saul had allegedly lived and ruled. No other texts confirm his existence, and views on the accuracy of the Bible vary. For some scholars it contains historical accounts, others feel there are pieces of historical information to be uncovered, and in another view, the tales are more literary than factual.\n\nYet there is evidence confirming some aspects of Saul's life. Excavations at Tell el-Ful (biblical Gibeah) revealed a \"rude fortress\" that has been linked to Saul. In 2019, an archeological team claimed to have discovered the biblical city of Ziklag, which is where David supposedly went to evade an envious and murderous Saul. And the existence of Saul's successor David was supported by the discovery of a stone with the words \"House of David\" inscribed upon it, though this reading of the inscription is not definitive.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Saul\n\nBirth Year: 1050\n\nBirth Country: Israel\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: The Hebrew Bible relates that Saul ruled as the first king of Israel in the 11th century BCE.\n\nIndustries\n\nWar and Militaries\n\n\n\nPolitics and Government\n\n\n\nJudaism\n\n\n\nChristianity\n\nCultural Associations\n\nArabic/Middle Eastern\n\nDeath Year: 1000\n\nDeath City: Mount Gilboa\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/what-can-we-learn-from-the-relationship-between-david-and-saul.html", "page_content": "What Is the Story of David and Saul?\n\nWhile there are a few Psalms and other places in Scripture dealing with their relationship, the most prominent place to observe the relationship between these two men is 1 Samuel 15-31. The reader can see a definite shift in the narrative between 1 Samuel 15 and 16. Saul is rejected by the LORD in one chapter and the boy David is anointed by the Lord as the king to take his place. The readers of 1 Samuel are given clues to the rejection of Saul and the rise of David, but as the story played out in real-time it would have likely been far more jolting to David.\n\nOT scholar, Robert Bergen, has argued pretty definitively that the narrator of 1 Samuel portrays David as the most loyal and devoted of Saul\u2019s citizens. When Saul was tormented by an evil spirit, it was David who stepped in. When Saul\u2019s army was on the brink of humiliation it was the young David who rose to Goliath\u2019s challenge. He did everything that Saul asked of him. But in 1 Samuel 18 we read that Saul became jealous of the accolades given to David. Everything goes south in the relationship from this point forward.\n\nFrom David\u2019s perspective, there is no indication that he knew anything was going on until Jonathan (Saul\u2019s son and David\u2019s best friend) warned David of Saul\u2019s murderous intentions. At this point, David was also Saul\u2019s son-in-law. Saul had given his daughter, Michal, to David as an attempt to ensnare him. But to David, this would have been further evidence of his favor with the king. How confusing it must have been for David to realize that even his marriage was an attempt by Saul to keep power.\n\nJonathan was able to keep Saul\u2019s jealousy at bay for a season, but eventually, Saul was overcome and obsessed with removing this threat, David, from his kingdom. David had to flee. The rest of 1 Samuel is David running from Saul until it ends with Saul\u2019s death. It is during this time that many Psalms were written by David (Psalm 18, 57, 59, 63, 70, and 142). At one climactic point in the narrative, Saul is relieving himself in the very cave in which David was hiding. Saul has no idea that David is present. Saul\u2019s life was in David\u2019s hands, but David responded with integrity and preserved Saul but cut off a piece of his robe. Later when the two meet and Saul realizes that David could have killed him exclaims thusly:\n\n\u201cYou are more righteous than I,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the Lord delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today. I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father\u2019s family.\u201d (1 Samuel 24:17-21)\n\nThis is an apt summary of their relationship. David was the man with integrity (at least at this stage of his life) and Saul was the one who was rejected by the LORD. Saul was the one who held power but through his grasping of that power, he eventually forfeited it. David was the one with real power as exemplified in his self-control in that cave where he could have taken Saul\u2019s life. David was, in a sense, loyal to Saul even after Saul\u2019s death. David kept this vow and honored Saul\u2019s family line."}]}
