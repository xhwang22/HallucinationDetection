I\u2019m a Malay and in fact more Malay than you think you are.\n\nI\u2019m not insulted by Machang Bubuk state assemblyperson Lee Khai Loon\u2019s flash mob . Indeed, Najib deserved the title \u2018PM Kangkung\u2019.\n\nHang Tuah PJ: So Reezal cannot tolerate Lee\u2019s \u201cdespicable\u201d stunt last week. I do remember some protesters held a funeral outside Lim Guan Eng\u2019s house. Some even presented a cake which looked like someone\u2019s faeces . That was okay, is it?\n\nAnd Reezal is head of Tabung Haji? OMG (Oh my God), I am removing all my money from there.\n\nMushiro: Reezal, you have got every right to rally as provided by the law. No one is complaining about the 600 people who came to the rally. But the group should not be violent, seditious or instigate racial hatred.\n\nI am surprised that the police are closing both eyes on this rally which did not get a permit (unlike those organised by the opposition). This rally is to show arrogance, \u2018samseng\u2019 (gangster) attitude and to distract people from the rising costs.\n\nOh Ya?: In any democratic country all politicians both sides of the political divide are mocked everyday and have eggs and shoes thrown at them without any racist response in the magnitude of the Umno goons.\n\nAnd its leaders are defending their act. Of course, the PRDM (Royal Malaysian Police) condones it. Is this the political culture of a regime that aspires to developed country status?\n\nFerdtan: Reezal Merican, keep on demonstrating and playing on racial sentiments. It won\u2019t affect the popularity of the Pakatan Rakyat government in Penang. The Penangites are mostly urbanised; they are well-informed on the political matters in the country.\n\nAfter Pakatan surprisingly won the state in 2008, there were countless Umno-organised demonstrations against the DAP-led government using the usual strategy of race and religion. Many were violent. So did the strategy work in the following general election in 2013?\n\nNo, Pakatan government in fact won an additional seat, winning 30 out of the 40 seats available. The people of Penang are smart.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t PKR re-enact the same flash mob mocking PM for his comment on kangkung? This time involve only the Malays, after all they are also affected by the high cost of living.\n\nThen we shall see whether the Reezal-led Umno will demonstrate against them? If not, it is confirmed that this protest against Lee Khai Loon is racist just because he is a Chinese.\n\nHang Babeuf: No, it is that Reezal (\u201cGod chose us to rule\u201d \u2013 really?) who has brought and is bringing disgrace and, if he is given the chance, disaster upon this country. And a cynical government is quite happy to let him do so.\n\nBehind the \u201cnow-you-see-me, now-you don\u2019t\u201d absentee landlord PM, Perkasa and the violent street enforcers of the Ketuanan Melayu doctrine simply smile. They feel things are now going their way. Who will stop them? Who can?\n\nBasically: The difference between Umno\u2019s protest and Lee\u2019s is as day and night. Lee protested on behalf of the struggling rakyat, in a humourous and witty manner over a very serious matter.\n\nUmno in comparison is screaming threats and showing the fist to defend their own illegitimate actions and has the finesse of a bull in a china shop. It\u2019s the difference between a constitutional assembly and a bunch of rowdies threatening the use of force.\n\nGeronimo: Reezal, you are a real idiot. You said Najib\u2019s Christmas trip to Penang was paid by the federal government. Who do you think pay the federal government?\n\nFurthermore, you said Lee Khai Loon brought this matter upon himself. Wrong, it was Najib who brought it upon himself by not engaging his brain first before moving his mouth.\n\nIt just went to show how disconnected your leader is with the poor people of the country who had to put up with the high cost of living. You all are nothing but a pathetic lot.\n\nYUNoAnon: So Umno leaders are all for such rowdy behavior but won\u2019t accept responsibility for assaulting two individuals at the Sunday rally . Go on then. Say it wasn\u2019t done by your members.\n\nBut you were there taking part in the rally. So when you didn\u2019t bother to do anything about it, it meant you condoned it and allowed it to happen. Which then meant you agreed to such aggressive behaviour.\n\nSali Tambap: But you, Reezal Merican, is a samseng, a barbaric, uncultured, unpolished, uncivilised, unsophisticated and uncouth man. Whether or not Lee Khai Loon apologised, it does not give you the passport to riot and murder another human being.\n\nYour call for another May 13 is despicable and outright seditious. You should be hauled under the ISA or if not, for sedition. The likes of you should rot in jail. Malaysia has no place for people like you. Indeed, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\nSpinnot: \u201cReezal, who attended that rally as well, said he had no knowledge of individuals responsible for the (May 13) banner and that some people had misunderstood its message as a threat.\u201d\n\nOnly someone with a \u2018kangkung\u2019 brain would not interpret the banner as a threat.\n\nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
