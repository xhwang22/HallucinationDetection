{"Kia Joorabchian founded the Joorabchian Group in 2002.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/27/kia-joorabchians-growing-influence-arsenal-identity-crisis", "page_content": "It is not unusual to hear Kia Joorabchian offering his thoughts via TalkSport but, when he began discussing David Luiz\u2019s future 10 days ago, ears pricked up among many who deal regularly with Arsenal. One particular line from the agent served as a flashing light. The Premier League\u2019s contract deadline of 23 June was fast approaching and Joorabchian believed there was plenty of work to do. \u201cThere are several issues within the whole structure that will be resolved,\u201d he said, before returning to the theme of his high-profile client.\n\nJoorabchian\u2019s working relationship with the Arsenal hierarchy is no secret, and he was perfectly entitled to provide a commentary. But for some who have harboured reservations about his influence it was, as one puts it, the final straw. However it was intended, the statement felt overly familiar with the club\u2019s internal concerns. The events that followed have shed light on the identity crisis evolving within Arsenal, which has caused dismay among former and existing staff.\n\nThe worry is that Arsenal, once famously resourceful, have entrusted too much responsibility for recruitment to a narrow list of associates that includes Joorabchian, a super-agent with a storied past in helping broker big deals and a long-time friend of the technical director, Edu.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing to stop them working together, and there are many ways to address squad-building requirements. But eyebrows were raised on Tuesday when the 33-year-old David Luiz, one of the club\u2019s highest earners at a time when Covid-19 and a poor season have forced some difficult financial decisions, was enlisted for a further year.\n\nPerhaps more jarring was the fact C\u00e9dric Soares, the 28-year-old who had been prevented by injury from making his debut since joining on loan from Southampton, was tied down on a long-term deal that effectively makes him the deputy right-back.\n\nBoth players are represented by Joorabchian and his company, Sports Invest UK.\n\nArsenal centre-back David Luiz. Photograph: Reuters\n\nTransfers of that nature would, while entirely legitimate, have been anathema under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. He generally shied away from deals with bigger-name agents and had little time for heavy investments in older players. But Joorabchian\u2019s hand has been evident in a clutch of moves involving Arsenal in the past year, the first being a move that was completed on 8 August, a month after Edu, a former player, returned to Arsenal. The Football Association\u2019s list of intermediary transactions, released this week, shows Sports Invest UK represented Arsenal in Alex Iwobi\u2019s \u00a335m move to Everton.\n\nIwobi\u2019s and Everton\u2019s side of the deal was, according to the list, overseen separately by the agency that represents the player. It is not unusual for different parties to work on the different ends of a transfer, even more so when involving moves from abroad, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Some experienced industry figures simply point out that given Arsenal and Everton are familiar rivals and worked together 18 months previously when Theo Walcott made the same move it appears a convoluted way to have done business.\n\nDavid Luiz arrived from Chelsea on the same day and Soares followed in January. Willian, another Joorabchian client, has been linked with a summer arrival although the Observer understands that while there is strong interest on Arsenal\u2019s part no final decision has been made on his future.\n\nThe fear in certain quarters is that Arsenal\u2019s executive team are wed to a select set of voices and marginalising those with an alternative view, particularly when it comes to transfers and planning. Nobody doubted the club\u2019s approach needed modernising in the post-Wenger era and that is why there was surprise when Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment, moved on in February 2019.\n\nSince then, the suggestion is that Arsenal have surrendered a coherent approach to player-spotting and handed too much power to the contacts books of Edu and the head of football, Ra\u00fal Sanllehi. Some members of staff are believed to feel frozen out and there is particular angst that Arsenal, who also conducted a revamp of their academy staff in November, may be losing ground in any chase for the best young players. One former employee claims the club\u2019s approach no longer fitted their values and the high-performance culture fostered under Wenger has been allowed to ebb away.\n\nThere is a view that Arsenal\u2019s hierarchy are awkward customers. It has not gone unnoticed among certain club personnel over the past two seasons that certain agents and contacts do not return calls as frequently. One player representative says he sighs inwardly when an Arsenal number shows up on his phone; another is strongly critical of their communication skills.\n\nIt goes without saying that everyone in the picture has their own agenda and that every agent has clients\u2019 interests to look after. That is all part of the game but it becomes more problematic when, as some suggest has occurred, potential deals begin to falter.\n\nFor all the structural issues the biggest problem is, another source says, a \u201clack of relevant brains\u201d. Arsenal are well known, as per the words of their director Josh Kroenke, to be operating a \u201cChampions League wage bill on a Europa League budget\u201d, and given their league position that will not change unless Mikel Arteta is given the squad clearout he desires this summer. That means they ideally require value \u2013 and preferably resale value \u2013 in the market, operating more like Borussia Dortmund or RB Salzburg than Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cFinally Arsenal have people who really understand football and are footballing people in the back-room staff,\u201d Joorabchian said in a separate TalkSport interview last July, referencing Sanllehi and Edu. \u201cBut the question is whether or not the finances will be made available.\u201d\n\nIf not, then what? The bigger issue appears to be whether Sanllehi, who helped bring Neymar to Barcelona, and the former Brazil general manager Edu have the expertise to run Arsenal in a lean, streamlined fashion according to those parameters. Another figure familiar with their way of working does not believe so, suggesting Arsenal risk being a \u201cmid-table team within three to four years\u201d if nothing changes.\n\nThere remains enough promise to remove such doomsday scenarios. The acquisitions of Gabriel Martinelli and William Saliba a year ago showed that elements are still in place for Arsenal to find players with a genuine chance of becoming high-class performers. Match-winning contributions by Eddie Nketiah and Joe Willock at Southampton on Thursday were reminders the academy, can still turn up wonders. To realise all that potential, though, the sense is that Arsenal need to remember exactly how those things became true."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/1392016/2019/11/21/edu-kia-joorabchian-and-what-it-means-for-arsenal/", "page_content": "Since Kia Joorabchian\u2019s family fled Iran after the fall of the Shah, he has had various incarnations: aspiring scientist, oil trader, newspaper tycoon and notorious football magnate to name but a few. Through all the years, one thing has remained consistent in his identity: Joorabchian is an Arsenal fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome years ago, Joorabchian investigated the possibility of investing in the club of his heart. Ultimately, he made do with a \u00a3100,000-a-year corporate box. Until recently, his considerable influence in football did not extend to the Arsenal boardroom. He remained a spectator, just another supporter. When Joorabchian took his seat to watch Arsene Wenger\u2019s teams, it was strictly pleasure \u2014 no business.\n\nHowever, that is now changing. Wenger\u2019s departure has opened the door to a new era. There is another team close to Joorabchian\u2019s heart \u2014 Brazil\u2019s Corinthians \u2014 and it is through his association with the Sao Paulo outfit that he came to know their former player Edu Gaspar. When Arsenal wanted Edu to be their new technical director earlier this year, it was Joorabchian who brokered the deal.\n\nJoorabchian, who has spent so long on the periphery at Arsenal, finally has a man on the inside.\n\nThe year before Joorabchian made headlines in England by bringing Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to West Ham United, he had already sent shockwaves through South American football by shifting the Argentine pair to Corinthians.\n\nIt was 2004 when the Brazilian club struck a deal with MSI (Media Sports Investments), a London-based investment fund fronted by Joorabchian. He publicly promised to rival Real Madrid and Manchester United in building \u201ca team of Galacticos\u201d. MSI pledged to wipe the club\u2019s debts and invest a minimum of $35 million in exchange for 51 per cent of profits. A club that had been on the brink of economic crisis suddenly became a landing spot for some of South America\u2019s brightest talent.\n\nThe $22 million deal to sign Tevez from Argentina\u2019s Boca Juniors was reportedly four times the previous Brazilian transfer record, and MSI put up a significant percentage of the money. In return, they had control of 35 per cent of the player\u2019s registration rights \u2014 a strategy that was to become common practice for Joorabchian\u2019s fund. Mascherano is said to have arrived as part of a collaboration between MSI and Global Soccer Agencies (GSA) \u2014 a firm linked to Israeli \u2018super-agent\u2019 Pini Zahavi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was around this time that Joorabchian also began working with Jorge Mendes. It was the Portuguese agent who oversaw the transfer of Nuno Assis from Vitoria Guimares to Benfica in 2005. What was seemingly a straightforward deal between two Portuguese teams was in fact significantly more complex: the \u20ac600,000 transfer fee was paid in full by MSI. The player was then registered with Dinamo Moscow, before getting loaned to Benfica. MSI were effectively trading in \u2018player futures\u2019.\n\nThe Corinthians deal came a few years before either Stan Kroenke or Alisher Usmanov bought shares in Arsenal, and Joorabchian has since admitted MSI explored the possibility of a takeover at the club before deeming it \u201cfar, far too expensive\u201d. Corinthians came cheaper, and also afforded a chance to control the South American market \u2014 not only would the club become the destination of choice for local talent, but would also be the principle point of export when it came to moving those players to Europe.\n\nEdu\u2019s career with Corinthians and Brazil would later be built on his relationship with revered manager Tite, but back in 2005 Joorabchian was less than enamoured with the coach and wanted to hire his own man. According to Brazilian media, a furious Joorabchian took the coach to task after a 1-0 derby defeat against Sao Paolo, even criticising him for choosing a player other than Tevez as penalty taker. Hours later, Tite was gone, replaced by Argentine Daniel Passarella.\n\nMSI\u2019s impact on Corinthians was initially positive: in 2005, they won their first Brazilian championship in six years. However, things soon unravelled. The partnership between Corinthians and MSI was scheduled to run for 10 years but lasted just three.\n\nCracks began to show when questions were inevitably asked about where the money was coming from. Who were MSI, the mysterious consortium Joorabchian represented? The Sao Paulo organised crime squad and the state public prosecutor instigated an inquiry which concluded there was sufficient evidence to \u201cshow that the Corinthians-MSI partnership is being used to practise the laundering of money\u201d. Controversial Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and Georgian tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili were identified as probable investors. Patarkatsishvili, the owner of Dinamo Tbilisi, but was best known for his aggressive attempts to assume political power in Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoorabchian denied their involvement, but then-Corinthians president Alberto Dualib has since admitted to attending meetings with both men. He also named Berezovsky as an investor in Corinthians\u2019 planned stadium overhaul.\n\nMSI, Joorabchian and Dualib faced charges of money laundering, currency evasion, tax evasion and gang formation. In June 2007, the partnership was scrapped. Joorabchian was wanted for arrest, and MSI left its Brazilian offices empty and abandoned. Dualib was left to deal with the fury of the fans, who took to the streets in protest. Six months later, a debt-ridden Corinthians were relegated for the first time in their history.\n\nRemarkably, that was not the end of Joorabchian\u2019s association with Corinthians. It would be 2008 before his arrest warrant was suspended; 2014 before he was cleared of all charges. Through that period Joorabchian was less conspicuous in Brazil, but never fully out of sight.\n\nThe fall-out between Dualib and Joorabchian was significant. When Andres Sanchez rivalled Dualib for the club\u2019s presidency in 2007, Jooarabchian canvassed for the new man. \u201cHe [Joorabchian] never walked away\u201d, Dualib told Portal da Band. \u201cIn the very election that I lost, he worked for the opposition\u201d.\n\nOnce Sanchez took power, Joorabchian was back in favour. For their part, Corinthians stabilised and returned to the top flight at the end of 2008. Having done so, they made a couple of striking signings: goal-scoring legend Ronaldo, who had spent a year out of the game recovering from knee surgery, and former Arsenal and Valencia midfielder Edu Gaspar.\n\nFor Edu, this move represented a move back to the club where he had begun his professional career more than a decade before. Edu is revered in Sao Paulo \u2014 so much so that when he was robbed at gunpoint in his Brazilian home, the perpetrators paused briefly to ensure a terrified Edu signed an autograph.\n\n\u201cI was born in Corinthians,\u2019 said Edu. \u201cI started playing for Corinthians at five, I went to the first team, won important titles, was sold and then I came back and finished my career here \u2026 Corinthians is a club like no other in the world. Now, it is a rich club but it came from the poor people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was an emotional homecoming, but not an especially successful ones: a succession of injury problems limited him to just 15 Serie A appearances in a season and a half. Player and club agreed it would be best to cancel his contract and allow him to retire. Edu was only 32.\n\nAs one door closed though, another opened. A few months later, Corinthians announced Edu would succeed William Machado as sporting director.\n\nIt\u2019s here that his working relationship with Joorabchian began in earnest. In Edu\u2019s first year in charge, Corinthians were engaged in a lengthy transfer saga over none other than Joorabchian client Tevez. After Tevez allegedly refused to come on as a Manchester City substitute in a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in September 2011, Edu and Joorabchian held talks in London about a possible \u20ac20 million deal. Edu also travelled to meet Patrick Vieira, then-football development executive at City. In the end, after a significant fine and lengthy exile, Tevez chose to remain in England.\n\nNevertheless, Corinthians built an impressive team, featuring a number of known Joorabchian associates, such as future Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho. With Tite back at the helm, Corinthians won the 2011 Brazilian title.\n\nWhen they beat Boca Juniors the following June to win the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s equivalent to the Champions League, Joorabchian was present in the corporate seats. Later that year, they completed a historic treble by beating Chelsea 1-0 in the Club World Cup Final. As Edu stepped on to the pitch in Yokohama, Japan to join the trophy celebrations, Joorabchian is believed to again have been watching from the stands.\n\nAll the while, Joorabchian was becoming a pervasive and powerful figure across world football \u2014 including England. With Wenger\u2019s Arsenal still unwilling to do business, his London outpost was Chelsea.\n\nThe likes of Ramires, Oscar, Lucas Piazon and a certain David Luiz all wound up at Stamford Bridge, thanks to the work of Joorabchian and Brazilian business partner Giuliano Bertolucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoorabchian is keen to point out that, unlike Bertolucci, he is not a football agent. He styles himself as an intermediary rather than a player representative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a football agent and I don\u2019t practise as an agent\u201d, he told The Observer in 2008. \u201cI think the agency business is very different \u2026 We also have a business that advises players on their rights. We advise them on their image, on their financial stability, we advise them on every aspect, because a lot of agents are not professional to do that. A lot of agents work for us and basically they just do the player transfer. We provide the structure, and for that they work for us\u201d.\n\nJoorabchian found himself at the heart of London\u2019s burgeoning Brazilian football community. His wife Tatiana is Brazilian, and his relationships with his clientele became social as well as professional. However, when Chelsea faced Corinthians in that Club World Cup Final, Piazon was in little doubt as to who Joorabchian would be cheering on. \u201cHe is a Corinthians fanatic,\u201d he told Trivela. \u201cHis two teams are Corinthians and Arsenal. If we play against Arsenal, he doesn\u2019t support us.\u201d\n\nJoorabchian and Edu\u2019s relationship was not always straightforward. Not every player deal born of it was deemed a success. In 2013, Corinthians consented to sign Joorabchian client Alexandre Pato from AC Milan for \u20ac15 million.\n\nHis reported \u20ac45,000 a week wages made him one of the club\u2019s highest earners. However, the move became an unmitigated disaster.\n\nHis salary and attitude put him at odds with team-mates, and the nadir arrived when he missed the decisive penalty when a Brazilian cup quarter-final against Gremio went to a shootout. With the club\u2019s place in the competition at stake, Pato went for a tame Panenka which barely got off the ground. Brazil international goalkeeper Dida fell to his side to make the simplest of saves. The incident was somehow emblematic of Pato\u2019s perceived failings: a lackadaisical attitude and a preference for style over substance. Soon after, around a hundred Corinthians ultras stormed the training ground, reportedly brandishing crowbars and singing songs about breaking Pato\u2019s legs. It\u2019s a deal Corinthians fans have since dubbed the worst in their history.\n\nEdu himself admitted the deal had been a spectacular failure: \u201cWe were all happy when he arrived \u2013 even the media was cheerful, I remind you. But he didn\u2019t have the guts that our supporters demand of any player signed by Corinthians. It\u2019s not that he should have been mean on the pitch, but to have a little bit of knife between his teeth; to think, \u2018If I\u2019m not doing well technically today I\u2019ll do it in another way, I\u2019ll use my strength\u2019.\u201d\n\nCorinthians were ultimately so desperate to get rid of Pato that Edu agreed to pay half his salary for the duration of a two-year loan with neighbours and rivals Sao Paulo. When that expired at the end of 2015, it looked as if Pato might have to return to Corinthians. However, another loan club was hurriedly secured for the next six months.\n\nArsenal were linked in the press, but Wenger flatly denied the rumours. Where could Pato possibly go? Chelsea, of course. He joined Joorabchian\u2019s Brazilian contingent at Stamford Bridge, starting only once and making two total appearances, before moving on to Spain and then China. In March, he rejoined Sao Paulo.\n\nChina was a powerful new market for Joorabchian. Just two days before Pato moved to London, a \u00a325 million deal took Ramires from Chelsea to Jiangsu Suning.\n\nIn the same month, four players left freshly-crowned Brazilian champions Corinthians for Chinese football. Roberto de Andrade, Corinthians\u2019 president, lamented that \u201cthe Chinese clubs don\u2019t even know my name\u201d. One suspects the Chinese buyers may well have been more familiar with those of Edu and Joorabchian.\n\nIn June 2016, months after making Corinthians champions again, Tite left for Brazil\u2019s national team and took Edu with him. The former midfielder spent the best part of three years with Brazil until Arsenal\u2019s head of football Raul Sanllehi began negotiations to bring him back to the club he played for from 2001-05, including the Invincibles season.\n\nDuring this past summer\u2019s transfer window, Joorabchian took the unusual step of speaking out about the club he has supported since his childhood in London. Asked to comment on the Arsenal ownership situation, he said: \u201cI feel for those guys who have just come in. They have incredible, knowledgeable people there.\n\n\u201c(Unai) Emery is a fantastic coach who has worked at Sevilla and at Paris Saint-Germain, Raul (Sanllehi) has been at Barcelona, and Edu has been at Brazil. I think finally in the backroom staff, they have people who really understand football and are football people, the question is whether or not the finances will be made available.\u201d\n\nUltimately, money was made available to spend \u2014 and a chunk of it went on signing David Luiz, a Joorabchian client.\n\nThe deal to sign the Brazil defender came about in somewhat strange circumstances. In January, with his Chelsea contract just a few months from expiring, Luiz was frustrated at only being offered a one-year extension. However, once Chelsea were placed under a two-window transfer embargo by FIFA, the club relented, and in May he signed a new contract believed to run until 2021.\n\nBarely three months later, Luiz was so keen to leave for Arsenal that he reportedly refused to train.\n\nAround this time, Arsenal were being publicly linked with a bid for another Joorabchian client, Barcelona\u2019s Philippe Coutinho. Romain Molina, a journalist who has written a book about Emery, was moved to say: \u201cKia is behind the arrival of Edu at Arsenal, so the interests of the club will follow his own, as usual.\n\n\u201cTo allow Kia to bring back the sporting director brings many risks \u2014 ask QPR, Reading (both have signed several Joorabchian clients), Corinthians. It remains to be seen whether Edu remains \u2018independent\u2019 in his choices. The past shows that Kia, Pini (Zahavi) and family have the last word.\u201d\n\nArsenal have no such concerns and are happy that they and Edu maintain full control of such decisions.\n\nIn the end, Luiz joined Arsenal on a long-term contract. It was the third time he had changed clubs on a deadline day in his last four moves.\n\nJoorabchian is once more a familiar face at the Emirates \u2014 only this time, he\u2019s welcome in the directors\u2019 box as well as the corporate seats. Sanllehi has shown himself to be amenable to working with \u2018super-agents\u2019 \u2014 or the less catchy \u2018super-intermediaries\u2019, if Joorabchian prefers.\n\nThis is already opening up new markets for Arsenal. In the summer, Arsenal signed two Brazilians, Luiz and teenage forward Gabriel Martinelli. One imagines they won\u2019t be the last. With Edu at the helm and Joorabchian in the background, there\u2019s every possibility Arsenal could displace Chelsea as the destination of choice for South American footballers in London.\n\nPerhaps Joorabchian might also help Arsenal offload some of their unwanted players. Historically, they have been poor sellers, but his contacts in China and elsewhere could provide a lucrative exit route for those deemed surplus to requirements.\n\nJoorabchian maintains an interest in Corinthians \u2014 just a few weeks ago, he was linked with a deal to broker a partnership between Corinthians and Ferroviaria, a smaller club in Sao Paulo state. However, his focus may now be shifting to London.\n\nFor a long time, Wenger\u2019s Arsenal were uncomfortable embracing some of the realities of the modern market. However, this is a new era. Sanllehi has willingly struck this Faustian pact. Arsenal have opened the door to the man who helped bring Corinthians unprecedented success and disastrous failure.\n\nHiring Edu meant welcoming Joorabchian into the Arsenal fold. For better or worse, the club may never be quite the same again."}, {"url": "https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/11199411/who-is-kia-joorabchian-the-man-behind-philippe-coutinhos-barcelona-move", "page_content": "Philippe Coutinho's imminent move to Barcelona is the latest in a long list of deals to be overseen by one of the world's leading football advisors, Kia Joorabchian.\n\nThe London-based 46-year-old, born in Iran's capital Tehran, has been at the centre of some of the biggest deals in football history, returning to the limelight this month as Coutinho's advisor.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Watch Philippe Coutinho make his first public appearance in Barcelona colours ahead of Monday's medical and official presentation\n\nJoorabchian, an Arsenal supporter who at one point looked to invest in the Premier League club, has brokered numerous deals involving players from Brazil, where many of his high-profile clients and deals have come from.\n\nHere, we take a look at some of his biggest, headline-making and, at times, controversial transfer deals.\n\nJoorabchian's association with football began in Brazil in 2004 when he partnered with the legendary Corinthians and where his first major signing was made - many more have followed since then involving hundreds of millions in transfer fees.\n\nImage: Joorabchian's first major transfer involved Carlos Tevez joining Corinthians from Boca Juniors, who he is back with now\n\n2006 onwards: Carlos Tevez. West Ham, Man Utd, Man City (\u00a352m), Juventus, Boca Juniors, Shanghai Shenhua and back to Boca.\n\nA series of controversial moves which could never be summed up in just one paragraph and take up thousands of words in Wikipedia, but Tevez was certainly the player to put Joorabchian on the map. He helped save West Ham from relegation, much to Sheffield United's chagrin, won titles with United, City and Juventus before another big-money move China. He's now back with childhood club Boca and aiming for more success before a well-deserved retirement.\n\nImage: Robinho was a big-money signing for Manchester City on the day their takeover was completed\n\nSeptember 2008: Robinho. Real Madrid to Man City. Transfer fee \u00a332.5m\n\nHot competition for the Brazil striker helped raise his price, with Chelsea appearing to be in pole position before City swooped to complete a then club-record deal on deadline day - the same day the club was bought by their current Abu Dhabi owners. Nearly 10 years on, Robinho sits 10th on their transfer fee paid list. He eventually moved on to Milan and had a brief spell in China before returning home in 2016 with Atletico Mineiro.\n\nAugust 2010: Ramires. Benfica to Chelsea and on to Jiangsu Suning. Fee: \u00a325m\n\nThe midfielder was a constant in Chelsea's rise, winning Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League and Europa League titles after arriving in England as a relatively unheralded signing. He was another to follow the trail to China in 2016 and has continued his success, but could soon be back in Europe.\n\nImage: David Luiz has gone full circle back to Chelsea...but could be on his way out again\n\n2011 onwards: David Luiz. Benfica to Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain and back to Chelsea. Combined fee: \u00a391m.\n\nHe's a constant in transfer windows and could well be again this month, given his inability to force his way back into Chelsea's squad after injury. Chelsea brought him back to the Premier League for \u00a330m in September 2016 but could he be on his way to another lucrative deal - Arsenal have been linked but Arsene Wenger played that down.\n\nJuly 2013: Marquinhos. Roma to Paris-Saint Germain. Fee \u00a327m.\n\nAmong the most expensive defenders transferred when he left Serie A - not bad for a player who hadn't even turned 20 when he moved. He's still plying his trade for PSG now, although has been linked with a move to Real Madrid for what would have been another world record price for a defender had Virgil van Dijk's move to Liverpool not just been completed.\n\nImage: Willian was another high-profile Brazilian signing for the Stamford Bridge club\n\nAugust 2013: Willian. Anzhi Makhachkala to Chelsea. \u00a330m.\n\nHe'd cost his Russian side even more, but their problems meant a quick move for the Brazilian, who received a work permit even though he only had a couple of caps. Now, nearly five years on, he is an international regular with two Premier League titles on his CV.\n\nJanuary 2016: Alex Teixeira. Shakhtar Donetsk to Jiangsu Suning. Fee \u00a338m\n\nLiverpool were desperate to sign the Brazilian but a fee could never be agreed and it was the riches of China that beckoned for the talented now 28-year-old. He is now reported to be on the transfer list so could another big move be on the cards?\n\nImage: Joao Mario cost Inter big money but could be on his way out of Serie A in January\n\nAugust 2016: Joao Mario. Sporting Lisbon to Inter. Fee \u00a338.4m.\n\nHuge money for a player with so little experience, having played only 65 times for his Portuguese club. Could there be another big move in the works as well as he is constantly linked with a move to the Premier League, possibly with Man Utd?\n\nImage: Oscar secured a lucrative contract in China\n\nJanuary 2017: Oscar. Internacional to Chelsea (\u00a328.8m) to Shanghai SIPG. Fee \u00a360m.\n\nOne of the big movers to the Chinese Super League before that avenue became a tougher one to go down. He made Chelsea a massive profit and secured one of the biggest contracts in world football after having been on the fringes of Antonio Conte's team.\n\nJuly 2017: Tiemoue Bakayoko. Monaco to Chelsea. Fee \u00a340m.\n\nChelsea wanted more bite in midfield alongside N'Golo Kante and they had to spend big to get it, the second biggest fee the champions had paid - now third after the arrival of Alvaro Morata. He's settled in well to west London but might struggle to add to his Ligue 1 title last season with Manchester City in such flying form.\n\nImage: And now Philippe Coutinho becomes Joorabchian's biggest transfer deal - could there be a bigger one to come?\n\nJan 2018: Philippe Coutinho.
