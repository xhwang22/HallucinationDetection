{"Neilson retired from Smith in": [{"url": "https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/presidents", "page_content": "Kathleen McCartney\n\n2013\u2013Present\n\nSmith\u2019s 11th president, Kathleen McCartney, took office in 2013. McCartney, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), is an internationally recognized authority on child development and early education. The first in her family to go to college, she graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University with a bachelor of science in psychology and later earned a doctorate in psychology from Yale University. A signature accomplishment of her tenure at HGSE was the creation of a three-year doctorate in educational leadership developed in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government.\n\nSince assuming the presidency, McCartney has led a strategic planning effort that is resulting in important new academic and co-curricular programs that expand opportunities for women. She has forged partnerships with leading organizations, including the Harvard/MIT online education platform known as edX; the MassMutual Life Insurance Company, a supporter of data science initiatives; and the Posse Foundation. Under her leadership, Smith engaged noted architectural designer Maya Lin to re-envision its historic Neilson Library, in the context of its renowned Frederick Law Olmsted\u2013designed campus, and to create a modern intellectual learning common. The $110 million project opened its doors in 2021. Women for the World: The Campaign for Smith, which McCartney led to its culmination in 2016, raised $486 million, setting a record for the largest and most successful campaign ever undertaken by a women\u2019s college. Notably, the campaign raised close to $130 million for financial aid, including 103 new endowed scholarships. A central focus of McCartney\u2019s presidency has been increasing access for every student who wants to study at Smith. In October 2021, McCartney announced that the college will eliminate loans from its undergraduate financial aid packages, beginning in fall 2022, replacing them with college grants.\n\nCarol T. Christ\n\n2002\u201313\n\nA widely respected scholar of Victorian literature, Carol T. Christ took up her duties as Smith\u2019s 10th president in June 2002. In her first years at Smith, Christ launched an energetic program of outreach, innovation and long-range planning, including capital planning. She encouraged the development of coursework emphasizing fluency in American cultures and the diversity of experience of American ethnic groups and launched a review, conducted by members of the Smith faculty and outside scholars, to determine the distinctive intellectual traditions of the Smith curriculum and areas on which to build. Issued in 2007, The Smith Design for Learning: A Plan to Reimagine a Liberal Arts Education builds upon Smith\u2019s history of pedagogical innovation, identifying priority areas\u2014among them, international studies, environmental sustainability, and community engagement\u2014for significant investment over the coming decade.\n\nIn the area of capital planning, a number of major building projects came to fruition during Christ\u2019s tenure: the renovation and expansion of the Brown Fine Arts Center; a dramatic new campus center; a renovated Lyman Conservatory; the impressive Olin Fitness Center; new homes for the Poetry Center and the Mwangi Cultural Center; the renovation of Lilly Hall, home of the college\u2019s School for Social Work; and the construction of Conway House, an apartment building for Ada Comstock Scholars with children. Ford Hall, a state-of-the-art, sustainably designed classroom and laboratory facility named in recognition of its lead donor, the Ford Motor Company Fund, opened in fall 2009; it serves as home to the college\u2019s pioneering Picker Engineering Program as well as the departments of molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry and computer science. Under Christ\u2019s leadership, Smith made significant commitments to environmental sustainability in its curriculum and campus operations, including the construction of a co-generation facility for power and heat and the dedication of the MacLeish Field Station, a 200-acre woodland tract in Whately, Mass., for environmental education and research.\n\nRuth Simmons\n\n1995\u20132001\n\nIn December 1994 Ruth Simmons was chosen as Smith\u2019s ninth president. With a long and distinguished career in higher education behind her, Simmons was the first African-American woman to head any top-ranked American college or university. Simmons galvanized the campus through an ambitious campus-wide self-study process that resulted in a number of landmark initiatives, including Praxis, a program that allows every Smith student the opportunity to elect an internship funded by the college; an engineering program, the first at a women\u2019s college; programs in the humanities that include the establishment of a poetry center and a peer-reviewed journal devoted to publishing scholarly works by and about women of color; and curricular innovations that include intensive seminars for first-year students and programs to encourage students\u2019 speaking and writing skills.\n\nA number of building projects were launched during Simmons\u2019 administration; most significant was the Brown Fine Arts Center, a $35-million expansion and renovation of the Smith College Museum of Art, art department and art library. Ground was broken in 2002 for a campus center, and renovation and expansion of the Lyman Conservatory was completed in 2003.\n\nSimmons left Smith in June 2001, assuming the presidency of Brown University. John M. Connolly, Smith\u2019s first provost, served as acting president for one year, skillfully guiding the college through the trauma of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath.\n\nMary Maples Dunn\n\n1985\u201395\n\nThe college that President Conway left to her successor was in some ways very different from the college served by Presidents Seelye, Burton and Neilson. When Mary Maples Dunn came to Smith in 1985 after many years as a professor of history and then as dean of Bryn Mawr College, Smith\u2019s student body had diversified. During its early decades the student body had been overwhelmingly Protestant, but by the 1970s, Roman Catholic and Jewish college chaplains served alongside the Protestant chaplain, reflecting the students' religious and ethnic variety. All racial, ethnic and religious groups are now well represented on campus, evidence of Smith\u2019s continuing moral and intellectual commitment to diversity.\n\nIn her decade as president, Mary Maples Dunn led the college through exciting and challenging times. During her tenure, the college raised more than $300 million, constructed two major buildings and renovated many more, enhanced communication on and off campus, attracted record numbers of applicants (while holding the quality of those applicants steady) and doubled the value of its endowment. Computer technology transformed the way Smith conducted its business. And the curriculum became broader in scope, with five new majors and increased course offerings in non-Western and neglected American cultures.\n\nJill Ker Conway\n\n1975\u201385\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s another important movement\u2014the women\u2019s movement\u2014was gathering momentum. This was to have a profound effect on American society and to confirm the original purpose of Smith College. The college began its second century in 1975 by inaugurating its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway, who came to Smith from Australia by way of Harvard and the University of Toronto. She was a charismatic and energetic leader with a vision for women's education, and her administration was marked by three major accomplishments: a large-scale renovation and expansion of Neilson Library, evidence of Smith\u2019s undiminished concern for the heart of the liberal arts; the rapid growth of the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, through which women beyond the traditional college age could earn a Smith degree; and exceptionally successful fund-raising efforts. Also during President Conway\u2019s administration, the Career Development Office was expanded to better counsel Smith students and alumnae about career opportunities and graduate training for women. Recognizing the rapidly growing emphasis on fitness and athletics for women, Smith built the Ainsworth Gymnasium and broke ground for new indoor and outdoor track and tennis facilities. President Conway\u2019s contributions underscored her commitment to women\u2019s colleges and a liberal arts education in today's society. Since leaving Smith, Conway has written an acclaimed series of memoirs; her 2001 book, A Woman's Education, concerns her Smith years.\n\nThomas Corwin Mendenhall\n\n1959\u201375\n\nWhen Thomas Corwin Mendenhall came from Yale in 1959 to become Smith\u2019s sixth president, both the college and the country at large were enjoying peace and prosperity. During the 1960s, social and cultural changes stirred the college profoundly, and a series of powerful movements influenced the larger society and the academic world alike. In response to the needs of increasingly independent and ambitious students, the curriculum was thoroughly revised. College-wide requirements were set aside and independent study encouraged. The college made more varied educational experiences available to Smith undergraduates by extending cooperation with its neighbors\u2014Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts. And Smith joined other private colleges in the Northeast to develop the Twelve College Exchange Program. The college added buildings with the most modern facilities for the study of the natural sciences, performing arts and fine arts. The new Fine Arts Center included the Smith College Museum of Art, now one of the most distinguished college museums in the country.\n\nThe 1960s saw the civil rights movement, the students\u2019 rights movement and the anti-war movement take root and grow at many of the country\u2019s universities and colleges, including Smith. Thanks to these movements and to the wisdom, tact and humor of President Mendenhall, the college emerged from the 1960s with a more precise awareness of student needs and an active, practical sense of social responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, life in the college houses was changing. The old rules governing late evenings out and male visitors were relaxed, then abandoned. Not surprisingly, when Vassar began to accept men, and Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth to accept women as candidates for degrees, some members of the college community wondered whether Smith should also become coeducational. In 1971, a committee of trustees, faculty, administration, students and alumnae studied the question in detail. The committee concluded that admitting men as candidates for the Smith degree would detract from the founding purpose of the college, the best possible education for women.\n\nBenjamin Fletcher Wright\n\n1949\u201359\n\nBenjamin Fletcher Wright came from Harvard to become Smith\u2019s fifth president in 1949. The college had by then resumed its regular calendar and completed several much-needed building projects, including a new heating plant and a student recreation center named for retiring President Davis. The most memorable achievements of President Wright\u2019s administration were the strengthening of Smith's financial position and the defense of academic freedom during the 1950s.\n\nIn 1950, the $7 Million Fund Drive was triumphantly completed, enabling the college to improve facilities and increase faculty salaries. In 1955, the Helen Hills Hills Chapel was completed, giving Smith its own place of worship. The early 1950s were not, though, easy years for colleges; McCarthyism bred a widespread suspicion of any writing or teaching that might seem left of center. In defending his faculty members' right to political and intellectual independence, President Wright showed great courage and statesmanship. Complementing his achievements was the financial and moral support of Smith\u2019s Alumnae Association, by now the most devoted and active group of its kind in the country. Before President Wright\u2019s term ended, the college received a large gift for constructing a new faculty office and classroom building to be named for him.\n\nHerbert Davis\n\n1940\u201349\n\nPresident Neilson retired in 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, and for one year Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, an alumna trustee, served as acting president. Herbert Davis took office as Smith\u2019s fourth president in 1940 and reaffirmed the contributions that a liberal arts college could make to a troubled world. Already during World War I a group of Smith alumnae had gone to France to do relief work in the town of Gr\u00e9court; a replica of Gr\u00e9court\u2019s chateau gates is now emblematic of the college.\n\nSoon after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, the college agreed to provide facilities on its campus for the first Officers\u2019 Training Unit of the Women\u2019s Reserve, or WAVES. The college added a summer term from 1942 to 1945 so some students could graduate more quickly and go on to government, hospital or military service. Though physically isolated by travel restrictions, the college retained its cosmopolitan character as refugees came to lecture, teach and study. And foreign films were shown regularly in Sage Hall\u2014a practice that would give generations of students their sensitivity both to other cultures and to an important new art. President Davis' administration was marked by intensified academic life, reflecting his belief that serious study was a way of confronting the global threat to civilization.\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson\n\n1917\u201339\n\nWhen William Allan Neilson became president in 1917, Smith was already one of the largest women\u2019s colleges in the world. President Neilson shrewdly developed the advantages of large academic institutions while maintaining the benefits of a small one. Under his leadership, the size of the faculty continued to increase while the number of students remained at about 2,000. The curriculum was revised to provide a pattern still followed in many American colleges\u2014a broad foundation in various fields of knowledge, later complemented by the more intensive study of a major subject. The college expanded honors programs and initiated interdepartmental majors in science, landscape architecture and theatre. The School for Social Work, a coeducational graduate program, was founded. And more college houses were built, mainly in the Georgian complex called \u201cthe Quad,\u201d so that every student could live on campus.\n\nNot only did President Neilson help make Smith one of the leading colleges in the United States, whether for men or women, but he also developed it into an institution of international distinction and concerns. President Neilson, himself a Scotsman, married to a well-educated German woman, transformed the college from a high-minded but provincial community in the hinterland of Massachusetts into a cosmopolitan center constantly animated by ideas from abroad. Between the two world wars, he brought many important exiled or endangered foreign teachers, scholars, lecturers and artists to the college. Meanwhile, as long as peace lasted, Smith students went to study in France, Italy and Spain on the Junior Year Abroad Program instituted by the college in 1924.\n\nMarion LeRoy Burton\n\n1910\u201317\n\nSmith\u2019s second president, Marion LeRoy Burton, took office in 1910. President Burton, a graduate of Yale Divinity School, was a gifted public speaker with an especially acute business sense. He used these talents to help the college raise the amazing sum of $1,000,000\u2014a huge endowment campaign for any college at that time. With the college\u2019s increased endowment, President Burton was able to increase faculty salaries substantially and improve the faculty-to-student ratio. President Burton's fund drive also invigorated the alumnae, bringing them closer to the college than ever before and increasing their representation on the board of trustees.\n\nAlong with improving the financial state and business methods of the college, President Burton also contributed to a revision of the curriculum and initiated college honors programs to recognize outstanding students. He also helped to organize a cooperative admission system among Smith, Mount Holyoke, Wellesley and Vassar, the finest women\u2019s colleges of the day. President Burton\u2019s accomplishments are commemorated today by Burton Hall, the science building that his fund drive helped to finance.\n\nLaurenus Clark Seelye\n\n1873\u20131910\n\nSmith College opened in the fall of 1875 with 14 students and six faculty under the presidency of Laurenus Clark Seelye. Its small campus was planned to make the college part of what John M. Greene called \u201cthe real practical life\u201d of a New England town, rather than a sequestered academic preserve. College Hall, the Victorian Gothic administrative and classroom building, dominated the head of Northampton\u2019s Main Street. For study and worship, students used the town\u2019s well-endowed public library and various churches. Instead of a dormitory, students lived in a \u201ccottage,\u201d where life was more familial than institutional. Thus began the \"house\" system that, with some modifications, the college still employs today. The main lines of Smith\u2019s founding educational policy, laid down in President Seelye\u2019s inaugural address, remain valid today: then as now, the standards for admission were as high as those of the best colleges for men; then as now, a truly liberal education was fostered by a broad curriculum of the humanities, the fine arts and the natural and social sciences.\n\nDuring the 35 years of President Seelye\u2019s administration, the college prospered mightily. Its assets grew from Sophia Smith\u2019s original bequest of about $400,000 to more than $3,000,000; its faculty to 122; its student body to 1,635; its buildings to 35. These buildings included Alumnae Gymnasium, site of the first women\u2019s basketball game, and William Allan Neilson Library, one of the best-stocked undergraduate libraries in the country."}, {"url": "https://www.smith.edu/news/maya-lin-new-neilson-news-release", "page_content": "Now, as the redesigned library opens to members of the on-campus community, the new Neilson offers, McCartney says, \u201ca reenvisioning of a building that has been at the heart not just of our campus but also of the educational experiences of generations of students, staff and faculty.\n\n\u201cThis state-of-the-art library houses the new and the old: our archives and special collections, digital design studios, the Jill Ker Conway Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and so much more,\u201c McCartney said. \u201cIt is a place of learning, connection, discovery and beauty\u2014a place that invites us to explore the world in all its wonder.\u201d\n\nArchitectural designer Maya Lin\u2019s re-imagined Neilson Library is an innovative, contemporary structure that presents a compelling vision for the modern library while respecting the building\u2019s historic significance.\n\nWith an emphasis on natural light, sustainable environmental design principles, and flexible interior space that can be used for a variety of purposes, Lin\u2019s design re-imagines the library as a space for collaboration and reflection. It also reconnects the college\u2019s science quadrangle with the campus\u2019 historic center, restoring integrity to Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s 1893 campus plan.\n\nMaya Lin Studio developed the design in partnership with colleague William Bialosky and the firm of Shepley Bulfinch. Landscape architecture is by Lin with landscape designer Edwina von Gal (in collaboration with Ryan Associates).\n\nBegun in 2018, the five-story, 153,865 gross-square-foot project is Lin\u2019s first college library and one of the most significant capital projects in Smith College\u2019s history.\n\nIn an artist\u2019s statement, Lin says she envisioned the new Neilson as \u201ca dialogue between old and new.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy preserving the original, historic Neilson foundations and exterior, the new library retains the memory of the original structure. But completely rethinking and reconstructing the interior speaks to the needs of students today\u2014with more room for collaborating and socializing. And of course the book is still central to the space,\u201d Lin says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in Neilson, you\u2019ll know that you are in a house of books.\u201d\n\nThe new Neilson retains the original 1909 structure, including the venerable Neilson Browsing Room, but replaces the 1962 and 1982 additions with \u201cjewel box\u201d wings\u2014constructed of masonry, wood and glass\u2014that offer open, inviting, light-filled spaces designed to support research, teaching and learning in a variety of styles. Featuring gracious entryways on each side of the building, the new library draws people in from every direction.\n\nInside, books are abundant and visible. Visitors will also notice that all five floors are connected by an eye-catching central \u201coculus,\u201d an open core designed to capture and disseminate ethereal light throughout the space.\n\nTwo curved, \u201cjewel box\u201d wings (recently named for Smith presidents emeritae Ruth Simmons and Mary Maples Dunn) create comfortable space for reading (in the South wing) and socializing (in the North Wing). These striking, curved additions to the building\u2019s original 1909 core replace outmoded wings that divided the heart of Smith\u2019s campus, uniting Smith\u2019s historic quadrangle with its science quadrangle. \u201cThe two curved, organically shaped jewel boxes are a contrast to the original, orthogonal design, and speak to my aesthetic, which introduces a more hand drawn and organic shape,\u201d says Lin.\n\nThe primary purpose of Smith\u2019s library redesign was not to expand space for existing collections, which are among the strongest of any liberal arts college, but to think creatively and intentionally about what a forward-looking library should be, how it should function, and what scholarly and social goals it might serve.\n\nIn particular, Smith sought to develop a library that reflects and conveys the nature of a Smith education, which is global in scope and based on learning across disciplines.\n\nThe project cost for the new Neilson Library was $120 million, of which $42.8 million has been funded through philanthropy.\n\nReflecting the purpose of a contemporary library\n\nThe new Neilson places a premium on flexible space that blends traditional collections with new technologies and an intentional focus on collaborative learning.\n\nA \u201clearning hub\u201d for the campus\u2014offering classrooms, quiet study and reading rooms, as well as expanded space for collaboration, socializing and high-tech work\u2014the new Neilson features a Digital Media Hub with multimedia equipment and studio space for recording digital content; GIS and gaming labs; and a large, multifunctional Learning Commons where students can work with research librarians, instructional technologists and writing and quantitative learning specialists.\n\nThe Jill Ker Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, named for Smith\u2019s first woman president, is housed in a prominent place within the central core of the library, just to the left of the entrance from Seelye Lawn. Across from the Conway Center, the Neilson Browsing Room\u2014a longstanding and beloved home for readings, lectures and other events\u2014has been restored and updated.\n\nOn the top floor, the Skyline Reading Room provides large, open space for meetings, classes, events or individual study. A rooftop patio offers expansive views of the Holyoke Range.\n\nProvost and dean of the faculty Michael Thurston says, \u201cWhat\u2019s especially exciting to me is the way the shape and flow of spaces emphasize collaborative inquiry. It really emblematizes and enacts the ancient and vital identity of a library as the place where a community of scholars engages both the preserved thought of the past and the ongoing conversation that looks to renew and enrich our understanding.\u201d\n\nLeading in sustainability\n\nThe new Neilson is intentionally designed as one of the greenest, most energy-efficient libraries in the U.S., using 50 percent less energy than a typical library and contributing significantly to the college\u2019s goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. Maximizing the use of natural light through the central, light-catching \u201coculus\u201d and expansive windows (laced with an ultraviolet webbing pattern that prevents bird collisions), Smith\u2019s new Neilson Library unites the indoors and outdoors with an exterior courtyard and an outdoor amphitheater that can be used for performances and classroom instruction. Throughout, the structure emphasizes the use of locally sourced materials, including limestone.\n\nLin said, \u201cMy approach was to create a new, state-of-the-art, sustainable building that creates a dialogue with the historic Neilson and opens up and restores the Olmsted master plan, expanding the possibilities of the library while reducing the overall footprint of the building and restoring the heart of the campus.\u201d\n\nHistory of the project\n\nSmith\u2019s library redesign began in 2010, when the college engaged Shepley Bulfinch to partner on a master plan for all of the college\u2019s libraries. Soon after, the college worked with Shepley Bulfinch on several studies to assess what could feasibly be accomplished with current library space. In 2014, the trustees approved the concept of a redesign of Neilson and the hiring of an architect.\n\nMaya Lin and Shepley Bulfinch were hired in April 2015. They approached the Smith library redesign as a creative exploration and an active partnership with members of the Smith community. During the process, nearly 1,900 students, faculty, staff, alums and members of the Northampton community participated in more than 30 \u201cengagement sessions\u201d designed to help re-imagine Neilson for the 21st century.\n\nThe library\u2019s interior design reflects priorities identified during those sessions, including:\n\na strong desire for natural light\n\nflexible space that can easily be rearranged to suit a variety of teaching, learning and research purposes\n\na cafe where students can be \u201calone together,\u201d studying in solitude while surrounded by their peers\n\nstudy spaces, where students and faculty can work in solitude\n\na variety of spaces that support quiet reflection as well as task-oriented scholarship\n\nintegrated space for Smith\u2019s outstanding special collections\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest and best collections of materials related to women\u2019s history.\n\nNamed for Smith\u2019s third president, William Allan Neilson, Neilson Library serves as the sciences, social sciences and humanities library and includes the library administration offices. Neilson also is home to Smith\u2019s extraordinary Special Collections\u2014including the Smith College Archives, the Mortimer Rare Book Room, and the Sophia Smith Collection\u2014one of the world\u2019s largest and most important archives of women\u2019s history.\n\nAbout the Location\n\nBuilt in 1909 and expanded in 1962 and in 1982, Neilson Library holds pride of place on the Smith College campus, sitting between the science quad and the arts and humanities quad.\n\nWorking within Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s 1939 plan for the Smith campus, Lin\u2019s design for the new Neilson eliminates the architectural barrier created by the previous building, unifying the campus and opening the view\u2014and the paths for travel\u2014from the Smith College Museum of Art to the science quad, and from Green Street to Chapin Lawn.\n\nThe new Neilson highlights significant improvements to the surrounding landscape, recalling Olmsted\u2019s original campus plan, which Lin describes as \u201cnot formal, but very organic. Our goal,\u201d Lin says, \u201cwas to restore the heart of the Smith Campus\u2014creating a landscape that welcomes you to sit, read and gather outside as well as bringing back the flow around the building.\u201d\n\nThe revised landscaping effectively reveals and incorporates the 16-foot elevation change between Neilson\u2019s east and west sides, and will also preserve several heritage trees that surround the original 1909 structure.\n\nAbout Maya Lin\n\nKnown for her large-scale environmental installations, memorials and architectural works, Maya Lin is an American artist, architectural designer and environmentalist whose many mould-breaking projects defy explicit categories. Always trying to find a balance between opposing forces, she says, \u201cMy work originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nNature and the environment have long been central concerns for Lin, who attended Yale University, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 and a Master of Architecture degree in 1986. Lin was thrust into the spotlight when, as a senior at Yale, she submitted the winning design in a national competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to be built in Washington, D.C. She has gone on to a remarkable career in both art and architecture, while still being committed to memory works that focus on some of the critical historical issues of our time.\n\nLin\u2019s art explores how we experience and relate to landscape, setting up a systematic ordering of the land that is tied to history, memory, time and language. Her interest in landscape has led to works influenced by topographies and geographic phenomena.\n\nHer architectural projects are largely undertaken at the request of non-profit institutions and include the newly renovated Neilson Library (2021) at Smith College, the Museum for Chinese in America (2009) in New York City, the Riggio-Lynch Interfaith Chapel (2004), the Langston Hughes Library (1999) in Clinton, Tennessee, and the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research: Cambridge Campus (2015).\n\nHer designs create a close dialogue between the landscape and built environment, and she is committed to advocating sustainable design solutions in all her works.\n\nIn 2009, Maya Lin started work on her last memorial, \u201cWhat is Missing?\u201d, an ongoing, multi-sited multimedia installation that raises awareness about habitat loss and biodiversity and emphasizes how protecting and restoring habitats can help protect species and significantly reduce climate change emissions.\n\nLin, who operates Maya Lin Studio in New York, has received many honors, among them the National Medal of Arts (2009) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016), both conferred by President Barack Obama, and the Gish Prize (2014). The film \u201cMaya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision\u201d won the 1994 Oscar for Best Documentary.\n\nAbout Julia Chang Lin, Class of 1951\n\nThe new Neilson\u2019s sunken courtyard is named for Maya Lin\u2019s mother, Julia Chang Lin, who led an extraordinary life.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1928, she grew up in a small coastal town in South China, attended private schools, and in 1947 enrolled at St. John\u2019s University in Shanghai.\n\nIn May 1949, on the same day that the Communists marched into Shanghai, Lin received a telegram from Smith, notifying her that she\u2019d been accepted as a transfer student and awarding her a $1,000 scholarship. The family housekeeper, Liu Ma, sewed the telegram and two $10 bills into the collars of Lin\u2019s Chinese dress. As the Nationalist government bombed the coast, Lin was smuggled to the United States on a fishing boat with her best friend. Detained for weeks on an island held by the Nationalists, Lin arrived at Smith one month after the semester had started, in October 1949.\n\nAfter graduating from Smith and earning graduate degrees from the University of Washington, Julia Chang Lin taught for nearly 30 years in the English Department at Ohio University, where she also helped establish the university\u2019s Chinese language courses. The author of four books, she was influential in bringing generations of Chinese women poets to a western audience. In 1999, Lin was one of 29 \u201cremarkable women\u201d honored by Smith for \u201cachievements representing the accomplishments of generations of Smith alumnae.\u201d\n\nJulia Chang Lin died of cancer in New York in 2013, at age 85. At the time of her death, she was writing an autobiography. The sunken courtyard at the center of the new Neilson has been named for Julia Chang Lin.\n\nAbout Smith: Founded in 1871, Smith College opened in 1875 with 14 students. Today, it is one of the largest women\u2019s liberal arts colleges in the United States, educating women of promise for lives of distinction and purpose. Smith enrolls 2,600 students from nearly every state and more than 50 other countries to cultivate leaders able to address the complex, urgent problems of today. As a community of scholars, entrepreneurs, scientists, activists and humanitarians, Smith is changing the world.

My writing and discussions about libraries have been featured in The New York Times, NPR, and several podcasts. Some colleagues call me a \u201cfamous librarian\u201d (if that\u2019s really a thing). But I should confess that I was a horrendous library patron at Smith.\n\nFirst of all, I had no idea how books were organized and never bothered to ask. I only checked out three texts during my whole Smith career. Those three books (two on coming out to your parents as queer, one on poet William Blake) collected dust bunnies under my bed for months, accruing atrocious late fines. Did I laugh loudly with friends, and crunch granola bars in the stacks? Probably. I was \u201cthat\u201d student. So, when I toured Lin\u2019s library, I hoped to uncover memories of something I actually learned during all my hours of napping or hanging out in Neilson.\n\nWhen I first glanced at the renovated exterior, I loved the contrast between the traditional brick fa\u00e7ade and the addition of two glassy limestone spheres that Lin aptly calls her \u201cjewel boxes.\u201d I\u2019m an old-fashioned, book-loving librarian obsessed with digital research, so I admired Lin\u2019s artful confluence of old and new.\n\nThe first stop on the tour was the browsing room. The wood paneling and fireplace were polished to a sheen, but it was otherwise the same room I remembered from Ellen Dor\u00e9 Watson and Annie Boutelle\u2019s guest poet series. I took Watson\u2019s elective three times because we met different poets each semester. My class drank tea with Mary Oliver and heard about her writing process (early-morning beach walks in Provincetown with a notebook). At Bard Queens, I teach my own visiting author course informed by Watson\u2019s. I might have been a delinquent book borrower, but poetry gave me a home at Smith.\n\nWhen Smith students were surveyed about what they most wanted to see in the library, their answer was books. This might sound obvious, but in fact the library field often de-emphasizes reading these days. People are more interested in whether your library has a 3D printer in its makerspace than whether you have the latest novel by J. Courtney Sullivan \u201903. (Although they should care!) So I was grateful that Lin\u2019s design treated the book as sacred.\n\nWhen we proceeded into the airy, bright core of the library, my gaze swept upward to the oculus and three stories of glass-encased floors with multicolored books circling the mezzanine. Light is, simply, everywhere in the new Neilson. The old library was dark and cloistered, with orange-brown carpet. It made me sleepy. (I was often sleepy in those days.) So I would have appreciated the \u201cMaya nooks\u201d\u2014Lin\u2019s couches designed for lounging and slumber. And since I was often hungry as well, I would have appreciated the stylish caf\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI am an old-fashioned, book-loving librarian obsessed with digital research, so I admired Maya Lin\u2019s artful confluence of old and new.\u201d\n\nWhen I was assigned a research paper on William Blake, I approached a librarian at the imposing circulation desk. I\u2019m 5 feet, 9 inches, but I felt small. The librarian was perfectly nice, but the process felt as formal as approaching a judge\u2019s bench. When I struggled to find appropriate sources, I didn\u2019t consult her a second time. Instead, I left the library with only one text, on Blake\u2019s approach toward race. And I cited that one book quite generously in my paper, if you will.\n\nMy tough but affectionate professor, Patricia Skarda, commented on my paper: \u201cYou did a fantastic job \u2026 summarizing someone else\u2019s argument! Next time, try thinking for yourself.\u201d I\u2019ve carried Skarda\u2019s words close to me ever since. In fact, I learned more from that experience than if I\u2019d gotten an A.\n\nThe Single Service Point replaces the \u201cjudge\u2019s bench,\u201d with a cadre of friendly student workers you can sit down with, talking eye to eye. I believe this will impact student learning profoundly. Indeed, the trend in libraries is to eliminate the circ desk and make information seeking a collaborative, democratic process.\n\nAs I toured the new Neilson, I was flooded with memories of the Mortimer Rare Book Room, a chilly chamber sequestered on the third floor. I\u2019d go there to admire a framed napkin on which Sylvia Plath \u201955 had drafted a poem. When Operations Manager Nichole Calero AC \u201913 informed me that there was no longer a designated rare book room, I panicked. \u201cSo, where will I go to see Sylvia\u2019s napkin?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe exhibition space,\u201d Calero replied, explaining that exhibits on the second level will allow visitors to view celebrated items like Plath\u2019s memorabilia and Virginia Woolf\u2019s manuscripts. There is also a large archive room, numerous classrooms for archival study, and 6 miles of collections visible through glass. The library seamlessly blends historical holdings with modern resources.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest\u2014it might take some time to adjust to the idea that there\u2019s no rare book room. I liked making a pilgrimage to a secret vault. But I think Lin was smart to display treasures openly, to make everything so accessible. Her library is awe inspiring but not intimidating.\n\nWalt Whitman once wrote, \u201cI contradict myself! I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d Lin\u2019s renovation is also gorgeously contradictory, containing multitudes. Here you find solitude and community, technology and books, bodily comfort and intellectual rigor. As I left the library, reluctantly, I made a note to renew my Friends of the Smith College Libraries membership. The new Neilson makes me proud to be a Smithie and a librarian.\n\nJess deCourcy Hinds \u201900 writes on libraries, love, and life-building for The New York Times and other outlets.

As a member of the committee that eventually chose the artist, Mr. Alexander James, I recall vividly the contradictory advice offered us as to what the picture should embody. One group of admirers said, \u201cWe want an outstanding portrait of a great liberal. No classical representation would be appropriate for him.\u201d Another group argued, \u201cYou will cheat us with your modern work of art; we want a real likeness, even photographic in its details.\u201d The controversy raged for weeks, but the subject of it, when appealed to, only advised, \u201cThrift, in a matter of small importance.\u201d The first word terrifies me. In describing this great Scotchman I should properly use the restraint of speech characteristic of his race \u2014 he would be the first to cross out my adjectives \u2014 but I cannot practice thrift in my praise.\n\nHow can I describe one who had such diverse qualities? He was a scholar but also a man of action; he was full of courage and caution, severe yet sympathetic, imaginative and at the same time intensely practical; a great modern who loved the medieval world. It is a study in contrasts and here is the background.\n\nA graduate and Trustee of Smith College, MRS. DWIGHT WHITNEY MORROW, the wife of our late Ambassador to Mexico, for twentyeight years was associated with President William Allan Neilson in making Smith College a place of light and leading.\n\nHe was born in Scotland, at Doune, Perthshire, March 28, 1869, the son of David and Mary (Allan) Neilson, and the youngest of four children. He had an older brother, Robert, who was to help him later with his education, and two sisters, Elizabeth and Jean. They describe him as \u201can all-round intelligent little boy, gentle and earnest, very sensitive, with tears near the surface, who walked much with his father.\u201d From the earliest years his intellectual curiosity was keen and even at six he wanted to find the right answer to every question put to him by a teasing brother. After one failure he took a turn in the garden and then begged Robert, \u201cSayyon again, I\u2019ve an answer for ye noo.\u201d About the same time he was found one morning, forgetful of his breakfast, stretched out on the floor of his bedroom with a big concordance of the Bible before him. The parson had spoken in his sermon of the \u201cother Mary\u201d and the boy was trying to discover if Mary Magdalene and Mary, the sister of Lazarus, were the same person.\n\nThe Neilson household was a lively one, for his mother, Mary Neilson, had three sisters and four brothers, all married and living not too far away for much visiting back and forth. She was witty and gay in the family circle and the favorite aunt of forty nephews and nieces. David Neilson, his father, was the village schoolmaster, a man greatly beloved, to whom everyone went when in trouble. He was constantly overworked, and if he could not secure a pupil teacher he called on young William, only eleven, to take occasional classes for him even though the boy was obliged to stand on a chair to reach the blackboard.\n\nMr. Neilson counted his first real teaching experience as beginning at thirteen, after his father\u2019s death, when he became monitor in the village school, in charge of what would be in America the sixth grade. Besides some instruction in Latin and Greek given after hours, he received \u00a310 for the year\u2019s work. \u201cI earned it,\u201d he commented once, rather grimly, \u201cthough I taught badly at first.\u201d\n\nDuring his preparation for college, at Montrose Academy, he lived with his Grandmother Allan. She was over ninety, but of a lively spirit and very religious. She made her grandson read Spurgeon\u2019s sermons aloud to her regularly, though she often fell asleep while he droned over the pages. At such times young William would try to do a little reading on his own (he was never without a book in his pocket and read regularly on the three-mile walk to school every day), but the old lady always woke up and demanded more Spurgeon.\n\nHe won the Dux Medal, the highest honor of the Academy, and a County Scholarship that took him to the University of Edinburgh in 1886. In telling of his departure he used to describe humorously his small black bag \u201cfilled chiefly with homemade jam, the jars wrapped around with heavy underwear knitted by my mother and sisters.\u201d He had to practice every possible economy in Edinburgh and always declared that he ate so much oatmeal and liver in those years that he never wanted to taste them again. His attention was turned to the study of philosophy by an uncle, Peter Lyall, who had opened his library to the young man. Another kinsman, William Allan, who had come under the influence of William Morris, first interested Mr. Neilson in drawing and painting. With a classmate, Ernest Hobbs, he lived for some time in the heart of the slums of Edinburgh, at the University Settlement, where he taught wood carving and gave lectures to the men. Hobbs describes him as the genius of the place; a happy, high-spirited leader who easily persuaded other students to assist him. He was known to pour tea on the heads of his helpers when they grew too serious.\n\nIn 1891 he graduated from the University with honors in Philosophy, and as he had won a traveling fellowship in Education, he came to Canada and studied educational methods there and in the United States. It was on this ocean crossing that he won the ship\u2019s pool, and he used to explain with amusement that when he was asked to contribute to it, he had supposed he was giving to charity. With his strict upbringing he looked upon his windfall as unholy money and turned it over at once to the Seamen\u2019s Fund for Widows and Orphans. \u201cBut as a thrifty Scot,\u201d Mr. Neilson would add, \u201cof course I reserved for myself my original shilling.\u201d\n\nFor four years he was resident English Master in Upper Canada College, Toronto: \u201cFour of the most painful years of my life,\u201d he has said. The necessity for giving physical punishment to the boys caused him anguish of spirit. Stephen Leacock was a colleague of his and they grew friendly over their efforts at discipline. Mr. Neilson caned a multitude in his first year; after that he seldom had to strike an offender.\n\nThere followed two years at the Harvard Graduate School, where he took his Ph.D. with his dissertation on \u201cThe Origins and Sources of the Court of Love,\u201d a study in medieval allegory. He had been attracted to the University in 1893 by seeing, at the World\u2019s Fair in Chicago, a pamphlet on the courses given at Cambridge, and was especially interested in the work offered by Professor Francis Child in English Ballads and on Shakespeare by Professor Kittredge.\n\n2\n\nHis college teaching began with two years at Bryn Mawr as Associate Professor in English and then he was back and forth between Harvard and Columbia for seventeen years. The last eleven were spent at Harvard as Professor of English. His students included both men and women, for he lectured at Barnard and Radcliffe and during two summers lectured at the University of California. In 19141915 he was Exchange Professor at the University of Paris. This bare outline of his academic career shows that he had taught in four countries, four universities, and three colleges before he was lured to Smith. Perhaps I am making the cap and gown too prominent in the picture. There was an interlude in Germany that lightens the scene.\n\nIn 1904 he went over to take the examinations for Harvard, at Bonn, and spent the summer in Offenburg, Germany, in the family of Oskar Muser, a lawyer and a member of the Landtag of the Duchy of Baden. His daughter was to become Mr. Neilson\u2019s wife. It was upon the pleading of an American friend that the young student was received into the household. Mrs. Neilson in her delightful book, The House I Knew, has described her first sight of her future husband: \u201cHe stooped a little, and his pockets were bulging with books which turned out to be small dictionaries (they were to be his life companions!), and he said of himself, \u2018I feel like a donkey with a pack basket on each side.\u2019 \u201d During his stay, Herr Muser often helped out the young Scot\u2019s bad German with Latin, but it was Elisabeth Muser who gave him daily lessons and proved herself a charming though very exacting teacher. Many hours were spent reading Creiznach\u2019s Mediaeval Drama under the great copper beech at the back of the house. A bilingual courtship resulted and in June, 1906, after Mr. Neilson had had two years at Harvard, he returned to marry Elisabeth Muser and carried her off to Cambridge.\n\nAn old friend says of this period: \u201cI remember an early impression I had of him there, flashing along with a black cape and dark hat, glancing around with a piercing look and seeming to the callow student rather diabolic on the whole.\u201d He was a thrilling teacher and the men in his overcrowded classes were alternately awed by his \u201cferocious scholarship\u201d and fascinated by his humor that \u201cflashed like lightning over all his work.\u201d In the comments on his teaching I have been struck by the constant use of symbols of light, as if every word shone. His wit was \u201clambent,\u201d \u201cincandescent\u201d; he \u201cilluminated\u201d details of research; \u201chis dominant quality was luminosity.\u201d One of his students, afterwards a colleague, has described his method in his famous course on the Romantic Poets: \u201cHe trained us everlastingly in the principles and practices of criticism. All types of criticism were outlined for us and we read critical works. Once a week he would place a poem on the board and require us to analyze and criticize it. His comments went to the heart of the matter every time. They were brief and searching. One boy who wrote a somewhat lyrical appreciation of Keats and Shelley received as a criticism three words, \u2018Enthusiastic but unimportant.\u2019\u201d Another student has said, \u201cMr. Neilson made us aware of what delight there may be in a really detached approach to the consideration of an idea for its own sake. He had the power to reveal the fun (among other things) of the intellectual life.\u201d Everyone agreed that it was impossible to cram for his examinations, and Mr. Neilson himself boasted that he \u201cbeat the tutor\u201d every time. He knew all his students well and on one occasion went personally and pulled out of bed a boy who had overslept, so that he might get to his finals on time.\n\nAt the risk of being \u201cphotographic\u201d in my picture, I must put a row of books behind him: the famous Five Foot Shelf that he and President Eliot got out together and for which they were arraigned because of the name \u201cHarvard Classics\u201d; Essentials of Poetry, lectures delivered at the Lowell Institute in Boston; The Facts about Shakespeare (with Professor Thorndike); Burns, How to Know Him. As editor he produced The Chief Elizabethan Dramatists and (with Professor Webster) The Chief British Poets of the 14th and 15th Centuries; he was general joint editor of The Tudor Shakespeare, and was responsible for the new text of Shakespeare in The Cambridge Poets. This last was completely revised in 1942 with C. J. Hill.\n\nAs a scholar President Neilson held first rank. His learning covered a wide field: the Medieval, Elizabethan, and Modern periods in literature. He was an outstanding authority on Chaucer and Shakespeare, a brilliant successor to Professor Kittredge of Harvard. In evaluating his work his colleagues praise especially his new approaches to research. They cite his management of textual questions in his own edition of Shakespeare and the masterly argument of his introductory essay,\n\n3\n\nIT WAS Professor Sidney B. Fay of Harvard who suggested to the Smith Trustees, in 1917, that Mr. Neilson would make an excellent President of the college. After an interview with him, they gave him the call to come to us. He liked to tease me in later years by saying that he never really expected to become our head. He hesitated over the matter a long time. The fact that the two former Presidents of Smith had been clergymen made him, a layman, doubtful of his ability to undertake the position. However, he and Mrs. Neilson went to Northampton to look the ground over. That first visit was a disappointing one. It fell on a hot, misty day in August, when no hills were visible and the grass of the campus was dry and brown. The place seemed lifeless and uninteresting, and Mrs. Neilson felt that the President\u2019s house, facing on Elm Street, where a trolley line ran dangerously near the front door, was not suited to bringing up their three young children safely and happily.\n\nThey went back to Cambridge and found their home there looking unusually attractive with its lilac hedge and gay garden. They decided not to leave it. Mr. Neilson wrote the Smith committee that there were grave obstacles in the way of his accepting their invitation: he felt that the residence of the President would not do for his family; he could not undertake to raise money; and, the strongest objection of all, he could not promise \u201cto offer supplication aloud in Chapel.\u201d He was far from believing that the Board of Trustees would consider favorably his conditions of acceptance, but he had reckoned without their determination, especially that of the Chairman of the Committee to Choose a President, Mr. Thomas W. Lament. He persuaded the Board that all Mr. Neilson\u2019s objections to coming could be met and wrote him that the new President should have a new house; he would be under no obligation to ask for money; and he might interpret prayer as he wished. Mr. Neilson accepted the position and he came to Northampton on September 17, 1917.\n\nMr. Lamont has made many magnificent gifts to institutions of learning in this country, but he never contributed more to American education than when he induced William Allan Neilson to become the President of Smith.\n\nThe freshman class of that fall delight to tell of Mr. Neilson\u2019s first encounter with John, the cockney night watchman of the college, whom he met on the night of his arrival when strolling over the campus, smoking his after-dinner cigar: \u2014\n\nJOHN: \u201c\u2019Oo are ye now? No smoking allowed here,\n\nI tell ye.\u201d\n\nMR. NEILSON: \u201cI thought that I was the new President of the College.\u201d\n\nJOHN (pulling him under his lantern for inspection): \u201cCome on now, none of that, \u2018oo are ye and what are ye doin \u2018ere?\u201d\n\nMR. NEILSON: \u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I am the President of the College and I\u2019m glad to see you know your business, John.\u201d\n\nThere was a cry of outraged scholars at Mr. Neilson\u2019s decision to leave Harvard. His colleagues did not believe that he would prove a good administrator; they felt that a brilliant teacher was deserting a position of great influence exactly suited to his gifts for one of a businessman, a role in which his success was doubtful. Several factors entered into his decision and one of them was probably his knowledge that he had latent powers which could not be used at Harvard; he had ideals of education too that could not be developed from a professor\u2019s chair. After his mind was made up to leave Cambridge, he told one of his close friends there, \u201cWell, I like to function.\u201d Mrs. Wallace Notestein (Ada Comstock), the former Dean of Smith, has suggested another reason: \u201cPerhaps it was this, \u2014 that he cared more for education than for scholarship in a single field and that he saw in Smith an opportunity to concern himself with all the elements which enter into a student\u2019s college experience. He said himself that the ideal of education which he found and perpetuated at Smith implied care for the entire personality of the student.\u201d\n\n4\n\nTHE duties of a college president have never been accurately defined. We are told that he must above all things be a scholar to maintain standards of study; an able administrator to manage his physical plant; a judge of men to choose and hold a superior faculty; a good speaker to advertise his institution; a man who can convince his trustees of the wisdom of his policies, persuade parents that their children are being fairly treated, inspire the undergraduates, win the loyalty of his alumnae, and beg large sums for his college. Mr. Neilson fulfilled all these requirements but the last. He once described the President\u2019s job as a combination of the work of a hired man and a lightning rod for discontent.\n\nHe had a passionate faith in education which glowed throughout his life. To him it was part of the eternal struggle for freedom of the human soul and he battled for it on many fields. Every act of his administration, from framing the tiniest rule of student behavior to the expansion of graduate work, showed his zeal for liberty. He was the strongest believer in the higher education of women whom I have ever known. There were to be no compromises for sex; no fetters of utilitarianism. Without mercy he opposed specialization in the training of girls in a liberal college. Mothers who asked for housekeeping courses, or fathers who suggested typewriting classes, received scant sympathy. Again and again he stated that the aim of the liberal college should be to develop a student as a person, to awaken sensibilities and powers which would make her a more worth-while human being. He felt that women so trained were better able to serve home and society and that they had a richer and more significant life because of such training. Independent thinking was what he was after, and as his successor, President Davis, has said, \u201cHe opened the doors of the college to all the winds that blow.\u201d\n\nHe feared excessive docility on the part of the girls. \u201cSmith College has never stood for the handing out of prepared packages of belief to its students,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has stood for the finding of truth, for its communication for free and open discussion, and most of all, for the training of young women in methods of thought, methods of acquiring information that will enable them to find the truth for themselves.\u201d When the question of academic freedom arose at Smith he upheld his faculty under fire. \u201cOur tradition is in favor of complete freedom,\u201d he said, \u201cand our experience seems to show that such freedom produces loyalty to the college and consideration for its interests. With the writing and speaking of the faculty outside, the college has not concerned itself at all. . . . The history of attempts to limit academic freedom leaves no doubt as to the answer. The greatest universities have been the most tolerant.\u201d\n\nIt sounds easy now, but what a tempest of criticism fell upon us in those early years! Bitter protests came to me about immoral teachings and indecent freedom of discussion in classes. One alumna begged me to call the Board of Trustees together and have President Neilson dismissed at once. Her letter made me so angry that I could hardly answer it civilly. I replied that the Board could easily be called together, but that every member of it would give the President a vote of confidence. He was glad of our support but he had been the brave \u201clightning rod\u201d that met the storm.\n\nFor many years the President spoke daily at morning chapel, the service which he called the \u201cheart of the college,\u201d and his talks were famous for humor and eloquence. He did not come into his immense popularity immediately; the girls were afraid of his irony; but enthusiasm grew as they knew him and before long he was adored. His subjects varied from proper posture (\u201cYou will get lumbago if you sit slumped over as you are this morning\u201d) to every phase of the world situation. He emphasized constantly the responsibility of educated women to form their own opinions on questions of the day. Every campus problem was treated in relation to the world so that students saw their daily work in its larger meaning; they were led to view their own lives as a whole and to take long views as to the future.\n\nHis power over the student body became remarkable. He never preached or talked down to them, but with incalculable skill he could persuade them against their own wishes to a right course. They delighted in his wit even when it was turned against them, for he had the light touch of the artist in reproof and could make a scolding completely friendly. When he refused a request for more entertainment on the campus, they nicknamed him \u201cWilly-Nilly.\u201d As a missionary of humor to the young he was unsurpassed, and he was a diplomat at breaking bad news. One fall the opening of Smith was delayed two weeks because of a polio epidemic and in adjusting the calendar to this lost time a favorite holiday, when The girls made excursions into the hills, had to be sacrificed. On the morning of their return, as they assembled in College Hall, the President stated blandly, \u201cMountain Day was yesterday!\u201d The idea of celebrating a holiday in absentia struck the girls as so funny that the whole student body broke into laughter instead of groans of disappointment at this announcement.\n\nHe had a beautiful voice, resonant, with subtly varied cadences, and when he read the Bible at Chapel it became a living literature to his students, Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic. One of them has said, \u201cHe made the Lord\u2019s Prayer peculiarly our own.\u201d The salty sentences from the Proverbs were often on his tongue, and the Psalms sang as they came from his lips. On the anniversary of a great leader he would quote, \u201cLet us now praise famous men,\u201d and he always read, \u201cWhatsoever things are lovely,\u201d Philippians 4, at the Last Chapel before Commencement. I have heard him address that college assembly many times, in sorrow and rejoicing, and I have wondered always at his ability to make the greenest freshman feel that he was talking directly to her. The students were never a mass to him, rather the \u201ctwo thousand daughters\u201d he often called them, and he counseled them like a wise father. His influence lasted far beyond college years. As one graduate of his day has said, \u201cEvery student who heard him speak would go to him in her mind as an arbiter, a judge, a touchstone, even on things quite unrelated to college life.\u201d\n\nDespite administration duties, President Neilson taught for twelve years at Smith College. He carried an elective course in the History of English Literature which was overwhelmingly popular, and he conducted a seminar in Elizabethan Literature. It was a rigorous training, with penetrating questions and unexpected discussions, for he would never let anyone rest comfortably on a bed of quotations; he prodded for an original opinion, and authorities were often dismissed as \u201cstuffed owls.\u201d Here as in Harvard he shone, flashed, and illuminated. Gay and provocative, he made learning a happy experience. The seminar was held in his own home and he always wanted tea provided, but, fearing that time would be wasted, he insisted upon pouring it himself. His service was so swift that students left the house with both throats and minds tingling. The President entered fully into the lighter moments of the college. Irreproachable in dignity, he made no fetish of it, and a Harvard professor who complained that he himself could not maintain it in his classroom received the consoling reply, \u201cAfter all, dignity is a poor substitute for personality.\u201d My sketch needs bright colors for the merry giveand-take of pleasantries between Mr. Neilson and the students. It was something more than serenading him or hanging May baskets on his door \u2014 they tried to match their wits against his or to win his approval of a jest. No one enjoyed more than he a brilliant take-off of himself by an undergraduate at one of the informal campus entertainments; nor the Shakespeare dinner artfully arranged by a group of students to trap him, the great Shakespearean scholar, into a mistake; nor again the attempt of the girls two mornings running at Chapel to win his notice by appearing first all dressed in pink and again all dressed in blue. He made noopen comment on that last prank but in private he remarked that any burst of spontaneity from the students gave him fresh hope for the college. At his informal readings in the Library the girls sat at his feet literally and figuratively. He was willing to let himself go and to show his joy in poetry. To hear Burns in his rich Scotch was like being transported to another world. Extremely sensitive to rhythm, he has been known to dance to the music of a ballad, and the skirl of the bagpipes excited him always.\n\n5\n\nRUNNING back over his successful regime, one wonders why anyone could have doubted Mr. Neilson\u2019s powers of administration. He carried Smith through twenty most difficult years; a world war, the boom, the depression, and the New Deal; and this without a deficit and with growing honor for the institution. As a distinguished scholar his intellectual sway over faculty and students was natural; it was his executive ability that surprised his friends. The business of running a big college became his meat and drink.\n\nWhen he came to Northampton he faced a difficult dormitory situation. One third of the students were living in the town and an undemocratic system of invitation houses had developed which fostered snobbishness and was in direct opposition to our declared policy of keeping college charges low so that the undergraduate body might represent all economic classes. For sixteen years he labored to provide campus houses for everybody; and during his time ten dormitories were added to the college, a gymnasium, a music building, and an art gallery were built, and the Library was enlarged. As new buildings went up he followed with Scotch shrewdness every detail of construction. He knew how doors should be hung and kitchen drains run; he watched every grass plot on the campus. With a keen eye for natural beauty he saw that the college was neglecting it at her back door, and he opened up the grounds to a sight of Paradise Pond and the hills beyond, thereby gaining a view which seemed to double the extent of a meager campus. He called all his workmen by name, and their respect for his knowledge is shown in the tribute of the bricklayer who, though ill, refused to leave his job because, he said, \u201cOnly the President and me knows how to lay these bricks.\u201d By his wise planning and careful use of her limited endowment he saved Smith thousands of dollars. We hoped that Harvard was looking!\n\nBut this physical development of the college was secondary always to his chief concern, scholarship. Intellectually his standards were exacting and his criticism of anything below the best was sharp; but his warmth of heart turned away wrath. There was a positive grace in his relationship with people; his understanding of the other person\u2019s point of view was so sympathetic that a clash of opinions left no hard feeling. Administrative procedure always amused him and he avoided it as if it were a great white elephant in his path. Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s motto, \u201cNo wisdom without courage,\u201d might have been his own, for he went ahead fearlessly reorganizing departments and revising the curriculum. I should not give an idea of hasty changes. If the walls of Jericho fell before him, he had walked around them at least seven times first. Against opposition from the alumnae he gradually raised the requirements for both entrance and graduation. The Graduate School was expanded and the work in music and art was stimulated by his interest. Nothing pleased him more than an unexpected trip to New York \u201cto see a little Renoir we might buy.\u201d\n\nOn his Tenth Anniversary his Trustees established the William Allan Neilson Chair of Research to bring distinguished scholars from many fields to the college. In expressing his pleasure over the Chair, which the President always referred to afterwards as his \u201cpersonal immortality,\u201d he said, \u201cI do not believe an institution can teach effectively unless a large part of its faculty is interested in new truth and is participating in the search for it.\u201d\n\nHe was more than anything else a great, broadening force, with his mind intent upon new ways of educating people. It was his aim so far as possible \u201cto get away from hard and fast regulations, from mere statistics, to personality.\u201d With the idea of less rigidity in education he introduced the plan of Special Honors, by which students of outstanding ability were freed from classroom work during their last two years and were given special opportunities for independent study under a faculty adviser. This plan has been widely popular in recent years, but Smith was the first woman\u2019s college to put it into effect. Another experiment in freedom was the Junior Year Abroad which began with the Junior Year in France. The plan allowed properly qualified juniors to spend ten months in France, Italy, or Spain, living in families of the country, studying in foreign universities, and taking examinations from their professors. Small groups of students from different colleges, under the leadership of the University of Delaware, had been following this arrangement of study for several years, but Smith was the first woman\u2019s college to offer the Junior Year Abroad as part of the regular curriculum.\n\nA further illustration of his desire for liberty of action for the girls as part of their education is shown in the adoption of Student Government under his inspiration. He believed in the principle of growth through responsibility and that it was a move from an imposed discipline to a self-imposed one. \u201cYou are here to grow into women,\u201d he said. And when the girls abolished the time-honored ten o\u2019clock rule for lights out and voted to allow smoking, he refused to let them down, although he disagreed with their decisions. \u201cIf we believe in Student Government,\u201d he declared, \u201cwe must stand by its mistakes as well as its wisdom.\u201d He commented dryly that there was no especial honor in burning the electricity of the college; and as to smoking, he begged the students to smoke like gentlemen, and added his oft-quoted bon mot, \u201cIt is a dirty, expensive, and unhygienic habit \u2014 to which I am devoted.\u201d\n\nIn his dealings with serious infractions of the college regulations, he always leaned towards mercy. The Judicial Board, the students\u2019 self-government court, found him advising moderation in discipline. They would propose expelling a girl and he would suggest suspension as something less severe, but effective. The penalties demanded were sometimes novel. One student complained that she had not received a proper warning about her marks and a second chance was given her on condition that she hold a paid position in the outside world for a year as proof that she would work when she came back to college. She accepted the challenge, fulfilled the requirement, and returned to a triumphant career of A\u2019s and B\u2019s.\n\nIn the early 1920\u2019s there was one department at Smith which was very unpopular. Three prominent sophomores determined to have it reorganized. They pasted broadsides all over the campus describing the unfitness of certain members of the department and by implication demanding their dismissal. Feeling ran high; the whole undergraduate body appeared to be behind the reformers and a torchlight procession was planned in their honor. Then the President spoke in Chapel. He reminded the students that much freedom was given them because the administration trusted their intelligent use of it; he dwelt eloquently upon what loyalty to an institution meant and regretted that the authors of the broadside had not learned it; they had discredited their own Student Government and by a selfish individualism had exposed the college to unfortunate publicity. The trio of sophomores who had entered Chapel as crusaders walked out as culprits and found that all their fellow students had turned against them. The offenders feared suspension but they were only required to apologize to the department that they had criticized.\n\nOn another occasion the President called three mischief-makers to his office and showed them a piece of wood riddled with holes. \u201cThis has been destroyed by termites,\u201d he said, \u201ccreatures who work underground and who are undermining Smith College. I have nothing more to say to you.\u201d\n\nThe Trustees kept their original promise to him and he was never required to be a financial agent for the college. He inspired his Alumnae to raise money. I accompanied him on several trips during the campaign for the Four Million Dollar Endowment Fund and heard him first amuse and then thrill an audience over the cause of women\u2019s education. After any speech of his, the actual asking for money was not difficult for subordinates. We chuckled together over the remonstrance of one old gentleman who said, \u201cMr. Neilson, I don\u2019t believe in so much education for girls. If a girl is pretty she doesn\u2019t need a college education and if she isn\u2019t pretty, it isn\u2019t adequate,\u201d and then gave him a fat check! The Seven Women\u2019s Colleges, in their joint effort to arouse interest in the endowment of their institutions, leaned heavily upon Mr. Neilson for support. It was no passing of the hat that he encouraged; rather a campaign to evoke a different spirit towards the claim of women that they have an equal share with their brothers in the educational resources of the country.\n\n6\n\nTHROUGHOUT the administration the President\u2019s home played an important part in his success. Students, faculty, trustees, and friends from everywhere were entertained in that charming house which was always unconventional and easy, with gay badinage going on about the family table. The President was delightfully resourceful with his children. Once when they were quite young and a dinner party was in progress, a voice was heard in the hall. Our host went out and found a small daughter at the foot of the stairs. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, \u201cI haven\u2019t had enough asparagus.\u201d \u201cNo, Caroline,\u201d he answered with grave sympathy, \u201cno one has ever had enough asparagus.\u201d\n\nMrs. Neilson is the type of woman who creates a homelike atmosphere wherever she may be, with flowers put in the right place and chairs ready for any group. She shared every intellectual interest of her husband, and her wit sparkled with his. Her vivid personality was never overshadowed by the President\u2019s, and though her position demanded of her a certain pattern of life, the pattern never dominated her; rather she illumined it. At official functions the President could never be kept in the receiving line. Absorbed in conversation with some guest, he would entirely forget his social duties and his wife would have to send after him. He was an enchanting person and his arrival at any entertainment increased the gayety of the occasion. An extra candle was lighted as he entered. Unconsciously his spontaneity inspired others, who went away surprised at their own brilliance.\n\nBoth Neilson daughters studied at Smith; Margaret, the elder, after being an honor student there, graduated from Amherst Agricultural College; Caroline received her diploma summa cum laude, from her father\u2019s hand. The only son, Allan, a boy of much promise, died at seventeen, a grief so great that his parents could hardly ever speak his name again.\n\nNo one ever had to explain trouble to President Neilson. His sensitive spirit ran ahead to the hard place where you were standing and offered help at once. In any crisis his official family came to him: a domestic difficulty, a financial problem, an ethical question; and he never turned anyone away. However, his compassionate heart sometimes betrayed him, for, believing always the best about everyone, he refused to see any evil until it was actually forced upon him, and consequently he made mistakes in judgment about people.\n\nEven when the academic load was heaviest, the President carried manifold outside activities. For eight years he went one day each week to Springfield to work on Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary. He wrote countless reviews and delivered innumerable addresses. Good feeling increased between town and gown because of his unassuming work for every public interest in Northampton. He served the whole Connecticut Valley, notably as Chairman of Speakers of the Springfield Public Forums, and Chairman of the Connecticut Valley Branch of the Foreign Policy Association. He believed that education had a responsibility in ordinary living, and the ideals of citizenship which he had urged upon the girls he practiced before their eyes.\n\nI have sat with him on many boards and marveled that a man of his powers could show such plodding faithfulness in the drudgery of committee work. Slow-moving meetings must have irked him, for he was an expert presiding officer and could manage a long agenda with speed and skill. In bewildered discussions he saw through to the core of things and made the point at issue clear. Watching him work out a problem, I have often thought what a great ambassador he would have made, for he not only convinced you logically but charmed you into agreeing with him. There was the \u201csilvery common sense\u201d of Jane Austen about his decisions. At a faculty meeting where the question of printing the titles of the teachers in a more prominent manner than hitherto was argued ad nauseam, he finally commented quietly: \u201cTo change the catalogue as suggested will cost $500. We must retrench somewhere to meet this expense.\u201d A fresh economy was not attractive; the discussion stopped immediately.\n\nAs a liberal he stood in the forefront of the battle of human rights. Neither city nor college followed him fully. Some of his greatest admirers felt that his devotion to freedom kept him from discriminating in causes of the oppressed. One of the most dramatic incidents of his career was his defense of Sacco and Vanzetti during their last months of life in Massachusetts. President Neilson presided over a public meeting in Northampton called to consider their case, and when he presented the facts as he understood them, anger swept the audience. There were cries of \u201cMob him! Mob him!\u201d While he remained completely calm through the tumult, his friends trembled for his safety.\n\n7\n\nHE became a national figure, and he was recognized both at home and abroad. The governments of France and Spain decorated him and eleven institutions gave him honorary degrees. The LL.D. from his own University of Edinburgh, when he was referred to as \u201ca learned exponent of a gayer and lighter jurisprudence,\u201d especially pleased him. The gorgeous scarlet and blue robe of the University became him and brought out his marked resemblance to Chaucer. He had the noble head and the merry eyes of the poet.\n\nThe war had deeply affected him and he was active in every effort for peace. I can mention only a few of his ever widening humanitarian interests: he was Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace, and he exerted a powerful influence upon the thinking of the country on the problem of international co\u00f6peration; he was a director of the National Refugee Service; Co-chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born; he organized Food for Freedom to stimulate interest in relief overseas; with Dean Woodbridge of Columbia, John Finley, and others, he founded the American Scholar; from 1942 on he was an Overseer of Harvard (and rejoiced frankly when the Medical School was opened to women); for years he was a pillar of strength to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nBut a list of President Neilson\u2019s good works gives only a faint idea of the genius behind them. No one could work with him without rising to a higher conception of man; his spirit soared above differences of race or religion with such complete tolerance that he saw only common humanity. His greatness as a college president lay in the example of his own life, a superb blending of action and thought. He gave a pattern of the kind of education he had tried to provide for his students. All his experiences \u2014 early poverty, teaching unruly boys, the sight of misery in the slums, stern ideals of education, citizenship local and national \u2014 flowered in his work as President. He proved that learning is mellowed by living, and living enriched by scholarship. As a man he was one of the rarest human beings of our time; with his transcendent qualities of courage, integrity, and wisdom, he far surpassed the sum of his services and successes.\n\nIn June, 1939, he retired from the presidency of Smith College. His Trustees made valiant efforts to keep him at Northampton, but they could not dissuade him from this step. There was a great outpouring of devotion at his final Commencement; gifts and testimonials came thick and fast. I like to remember him planting the Scotch elm which the gardeners gave him, to the music of the bagpipes, and reviewing the Alumnae procession from the Library steps, when each person dropped a small cardboard heart at his feet till he was up to his ankles in red. At the close of the Commencement exercises, among other degrees, he conferred upon Mrs. Neilson an L.H.D. which the Trustees had urged: \u201cThe most delicate and embarrassing task they ever demanded of me,\u201d he said. In a few farewell words he spoke gently of the comradeship of the faculty, the loyalty of the Alumnae, the irresistible responsiveness of the undergraduates, ending, \u201cand so I take my leave.\u201d As the President and Mrs. Neilson walked down the aisle together, the whole assembly rose and the very air breathed affection for them.\n\nHis resignation did not mean retirement from active work. The New York Times made a true prophecy when it commented: \u201cAs a private citizen William Allan Neilson will have more leisure lucidly to teach and wittily to enliven this University of the United States.\u201d From a one-room schoolhouse in a small village he had become schoolmaster to an entire nation. He was so constantly called upon for counsel and help in a war-torn world that he had little time to enjoy his new home, a transformed farmhouse in Falls Village, Connecticut, where he and Mrs. Neilson went to live.\n\nThe Trustees of Smith commissioned him to write a History of the College, a hard task for a man who was far too modest to treat adequately his own regime; and he spent several winters in Northampton on research for the book. He was there working on his uncompleted draft when he was suddenly taken ill, and after a few days in the College Infirmary, he died, on February 13, 1946. He went as he would like to have gone, in a place dear to him, surrounded by friends, still in the fullness of his powers. One could not rightly mourn. But there are some people whose deaths are unbelievable because they have embodied so much life and his was like that. Thomas Wolfe has said that there are those who have \u201cthe quality of richness and joy in them and they communicate it to everything they touch. ... It is probably the richest resource of the spirit. It is better than all formal learning and it cannot be learned although it grows in power and richness with living.\u201d William Allan Neilson had this quality. He heightened one\u2019s sense of life and gave a fresh significance to all its possibilities. And now \u201cAll the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.smith.edu/news/2021-saq-fall-nancy-mason-bradbury-74-neilson-library", "page_content": "In her presentation to the Neilson architect selection committee, Maya Lin alluded only briefly to her gratitude to the college for taking in her late mother, Julia Ming Hui Chang Lin \u201951, after her escape from China in a fishing boat with her Smith acceptance letter sewn into her shirt. But it was enough to show that for Maya the project would be a labor of love. She was already popping with creative ideas, and she assessed the prerenovation building with the crisply decisive statement, \u201cWe can do better.\u201d\n\nAlumnae from classes before the late \u201970s may not realize how much the library had deteriorated since their own student days. What I remember from my graduation in 1974 is a comfortable, old-fashioned building with some handsome reading rooms, a place most students regarded fondly. In 1978\u201382 it suffered some unfortunate stop-gap new construction. Side-by-side additions and the sealing of all but the front door made Neilson a long, narrow cul-de-sac that bisected the campus. Inside, book stacks encroached on study space and cut off the light, systems were failing, leaks sprung, energy was wasted, technology became antiquated, and areas with chilly winter temperatures could only be warmed by creating torrid zones elsewhere.\n\nAs we all know, the new Neilson is bathed in natural light, a study in warm wood, stone, glass, nature-themed fabrics, live-edge furnishings, and lovely views of the campus and its surroundings. I\u2019m eager for the opening of the Special Collections wing, with its grand reading room for scholars. I look forward to working there with some rare 17th-century editions of Chaucer recently donated by Judith Raymo \u201953. Near its third-floor entrance, I love the serendipitous juxtaposition of an antique printing press and the Library of Congress books classed under Z, books on books, including the history of printing.\n\nUp-to-date technology will please others and is essential for today\u2019s students, but what means most to me is restored access to library collections in a setting worthy of their excellence and better suited to conserving them. Many will gravitate to the fourth-floor reading room, with its outdoor terrace and mountain views, or to the cushioned booths near the caf\u00e9, but I am likely to be found underground, amid the compact shelving where much of the on-site collection resides, in the daylit comfy seating around the sunken courtyard, with young trees on one side and many thousands of books on the other.\n\nNancy Mason Bradbury \u201974 retired in June after 34 years as a professor of English language and literature, a participant in the medieval studies program, and a founding member of the book studies concentration.\n\nThis story appears in the Fall 2021 issue of the Smith Alumnae Quarterly."}, {"url": "https://biographypedia.org/what-happened-to-j-neilson-accident-age-surgery-biography/", "page_content": "\u2022 Born in Pennsylvania, USA and is a bladesmith and reality television personality best known for being one of the judges of the History Channel show \"Forged in Fire\"\n\n\u2022 Holds the title of Master Smith from the American Bladesmith Society\n\n\u2022 Has an estimated net worth of over $1 million, achieved through his television work and success as a blade smith\n\n\u2022 Gained recognition for his use of traditional methods for knife making, and was awarded the title of Master Smith from the American Bladesmith Society\n\n\u2022 Actively involved on social media, with accounts on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook\n\nWho is J Neilson?\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nJames Neilson was born in Pennsylvania, USA \u2013 birthdate unknown \u2013 and is a bladesmith as well as a reality television personality, best known for being one of the judges of the History channel show entitled \u201cForged in Fire\u201d. He holds the title of Master Smith from the American Bladesmith Society, a title that is held by around 100 people.\n\nThe Riches of J Neilson\n\nHow rich is J Neilson? As of late-2019, sources inform us of a net worth that is over $1 million, accumulated through success in his various endeavors. He earns significant income through his work on television, while is also one of the top rated consultants and blade smiths in the country.\n\nAs he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nThere is very limited information when it comes to J Neilson\u2019s family and childhood. It is known that he grew up with a passion for crafting blades, and the steps he took early in his life would eventually lead him to his career. In 1995, he began training and honing his skills.\n\nHe created his own workshop located in the woods of Towanda, Pennsylvania though he did not intend on making it a career just yet. It wasn\u2019t until nine years later that he started forging and selling his wares professionally. He gained recognition for his use of traditional methods for knife making \u2013 his forging techniques, heat treating, and stock removal method, are those taken from more traditional smithing practices which has helped in crafting high quality blades. He slowly gained recognition, and became a member of the American Bladesmith Society.\n\nMastersmith\n\nThe American Bladesmith Society (ABS) is a nonprofit organization mainly composed of knifemakers, and promotes techniques on how to forge steel blades. The organization dates its history back to 1972, when they were founded by knifemaker William F. Moran, who was at the time Chairman of the Knifemakers\u2019 Guild. They started doing an annual show where he introduced Damascus steel blades, comprised of material taken from India and Sri Lanka. They are mainly characterized by their pattern which resembles flowing water. The organization was incorporated in 1976 before becoming non-profit around nine years later.\n\nMost of the knifemakers of ABS forge their own blades, and they\u2019ve created their own system of rating which include Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master Smith. They\u2019ve also partnered with several colleges for courses in bladesmithing and even launched their own museum. Due to his skill, Neilson was awarded the title of Master Smith, which he had to attain through rigorous tests. One of the tests required to become a Master Smith is forging a Damascus steel blade with a minimum of 300 layers. The blade must be tested to cut free hanging rope, chop through lumber, and still maintain an edge capable of shaving hair.\n\nAfter the knife is tested thoroughly for sharpness and durability, the applicant must then submit five knives to a panel of judges, who will look at all aspects of these knives.\n\nForged in Fire\n\nJ Neilson\u2019s fame started to gain mainstream attention when he became one of the judges of the television competition series entitled \u201cForged in Fire\u201d. The show airs on the History channel, and is produced by Outpost Entertainment. Each episodesees four bladesmiths competing in a three round elimination contest with each round having them forge different bladed weapons.\n\nThe winner of the episode will receive $10,000 and a championship title. The show is hosted by Willis while Neilson is a member of a three judge panel with Doug Marcaida and David Baker. The judges are either master smiths, history experts, weapon masters, or a combination of all three.\n\nThe show has been running for a total of seven seasons, and over the years they\u2019ve added differences with some of the episodes, including a \u201cchampions of champions\u201d match with previous winners returning to compete. There is also a \u201cJudges\u2019 Pick\u201d episode, when judges must pick a smith from past seasons to compete once more. The show has been highly successful, leading to a spin-off show called \u201cForged in Fire: Knife or Death\u201d.\n\nPersonal Life and Social Media\n\nFor his personal life, it is known that Neilson is married and has two children, though he has not shared a lot of details about his family. While he continues to forge, he places a lot of emphasis on spending time with his family. Due to his passion, his children have shown an interest towards forging as well, and with very few of them in the world, he is intent on training his children. His daughter forged her first blade at the age of nine \u2013 he often shares the creations of his children.\n\nSimilar to numerous smiths and reality television personalities, he is active online through accounts on social media. He has an Instagram account with over 25,000 followers, using the platform to promote his work and business. He often displays some of the commissioned work he does, while also promoting his work in \u201cForged in Fire\u201d. He also has a Twitter account with over 3,500 followers, though he has not been active on the account since 2018. Another account he has is on Facebook, on which he has over 17,000 fans. The account is not very active either, only posting every few months."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1939/05/28/archives/neilson-of-smith-smiths-president-retiring-soon-looks-back-and-far.html", "page_content": "Credit...

While these papers contain material dating from Neilson's years at Smith College (1917-1939), his official correspondence as president of the college is stored separately in the College Archives' holdings of records of the Office of the President.\n\n\n\nThe papers document Neilson's personal life with extensive family material. His letters to his brother and sisters are particularly valuable. Among other things these letters present Neilson's view of life at Bryn Mawr College under M. Carey Thomas, his strong opinions on world politics, his experiences tutoring Helen Keller at Radcliffe College, and his first impressions of Smith College. This series of letters is especially strong for the years between Neilson's arrival at Harvard University for graduate study in 1895 and his marriage in 1905. In addition to the Neilson family correspondence there is extensive correspondence between the Neilson and Muser families plus diaries and writings of Elisabeth Muser Neilson, her parents, and her sister. Much of the Muser family material is in German.\n\n\n\nOther personal material such as photographs, correspondence, class notes, and student essays document Neilson's youth and education. His love of his native Scotland and his study of its language and literature are clearly in evidence in his University of Edinburgh essays.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence and miscellaneous papers, 1917-1946, document such day-to-day concerns as finances, family health, the running of the household, and travel arrangements.\n\n\n\nNeilson's career as professor and scholar of English and Scottish literature is represented by class notes and correspondence with students and colleagues which date primarily from his years at Harvard and Radcliffe. Smith College material includes a few notes for courses Neilson taught in the English department but consists primarily of documentation of the events and celebrations of his presidency such as his appointment, inauguration, tenth and twentieth anniversaries, and retirement. Other material documents Neilson's affiliation with scholarly organizations such as the Modern Language Association, the Scottish Text Society, and the Shakespeare Association of America. There are also texts and notes for speeches on Shakespeare and Burns. Neilson's scholarly publications are represented by a number of articles, an unfinished manuscript for a book on allegory, and proofs for a 1942 edition of Shakespeare's plays and poems. Correspondence and news clippings document other writing and editorial projects in different stages of the work. Two such projects of particular interest are the 'five foot shelf' series of Harvard Classics, which Neilson edited with Charles W. Eliot, and the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, for which Neilson was editor-in-chief.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his work as professor, administrator, and scholar, Neilson was much in demand for committee work. As a respected educator and administrator, his advice and support was continually sought by educational institutions and organizations. Correspondence documents Neilson's work as a member of various committees for Harvard University, his suggestions on the planning of the campus and curriculum of Bennington College, and his advice and endorsements for the New School for Social Research and a variety of organizations promoting adult education such as the Affiliated Schools for Workers, the Eliot Foundation for Adult Education, and the Committee on University Extension in the Connecticut Valley.\n\n\n\nNeilson was also well-known for his vigorous support of liberal causes of the day. His political activities are reflected in his involvement with a large number of organizations most of which worked for civil liberties, peace, aid to refugees, or improved foreign relations. This work is documented by correspondence with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Foreign Policy Association, the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia, the National Refugee Service, various League of Nations organizations, and the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace.\n\n\n\nAll of Neilson's interests and concerns are in evidence in his speeches and writings. Texts contained in the papers are a rich source for the study of life at Smith College, and trends in education and politics during Neilson's term as president of Smith (1917-1939). News clippings document the quite considerable attention paid to his views.\n\n\n\nNeilson was a renowned speaker who seldom prepared a text, preferring to talk from cursory notes made shortly before the speech was to be delivered. Because of this process the texts contained in the papers are almost exclusively transcriptions. Some of them were edited for publication, others remain more or less as they were delivered. The papers also contain some of Neilson's handwritten notes for speeches.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence, citations, and news clippings document Neilson's many awards and honors and a group of biographical articles gives an overview of Neilson's life and work. The papers also contain notes, typescripts, and correspondence for Margaret Farrand Thorp's 1956 biography Nelson of Smith."}]}
