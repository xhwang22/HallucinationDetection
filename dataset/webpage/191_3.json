Collis started his Hollywood Invades Tempe (HIT) film series more than two years ago, and it quickly has become a must-see event among ASU School of Theatre and Film students.\n\nThe popular series attracts such Hollywood insiders as cinematographer Lawrence Sher, of \u201cGarden State,\" \"The Hangover\" and \"Due Date\" fame, and Bennett Miller, who directed \"Capote\" and the recent \"Moneyball.\" Download Full Image\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a great dinner party,\u2019\u2019 says Collis, who has coordinated video conference calls with Hollywood heavyweights such as Brunson Green, the producer of \u201cThe Help\u201d \u2013 and most recently, Tom Sherak, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\n\"I wanted our students to speak with professionals working at the very top level of movies and TV,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nThe evenings \u2013 complete with free popcorn, pizza and a movie screening, thanks to the student-run Programming and Activities Board and the ASU Film Association \u2013 are a kind of Actors Studio, with Collis serving as moderator. The conversations are tantalizingly candid, casual and informative. Frequently, the guests are talking from their living rooms swapping stories, answering questions and sharing insight and guidance.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nJoin Adam Collis and special guests Stephen Gyllenhaal, director and writer, and Kathleen Man Gyllenhaal, co-producer of \"Grassroots\", for Hollywood Invades Tempe, starting at 7 p.m., Wednesday, Nov. 30, in Coor Hall room 174. Come for pizza at 7 p.m., the film screening at 7:30 p.m., and a chat with the husband and wife team at 9:10 p.m. The interview will be broadcast live on ASUtv. Visit theatrefilm.asu.edu for more information.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nAnd like a good dinner party, the guests linger. Q&A sessions can last up to 90 minutes and rarely go less than an hour.\n\nCollis, who flies in from Los Angeles every Wednesday to teach film directing, has booked 18 guest speakers so far, including upcoming speakers Stephen Gyllenhaal, writer and director, and Kathleen Man Gyllenhaal, co-producer of \u201cGrassroots\u201d \u2013 a newly released film based on the true story of a Seattle activist who makes a run for a city council seat.\n\nAmong the folks Collis hopes to line up for future HIT events are Alexander Payne, director of \u201cDescendants,\u2019\u2019 \u201cSideways\u201d and \u201cElection\u201d; Larry Franco, producer of \u201cAnonymous,\u201d \u201cJurassic Park III\u201d and \u201cOctober Sky\u2019\u2019 and Jason Reitman, director of \u201cUp in the Air\u2019\u2019 and \u201cJuno.\u2019\u2019\n\nA native of Lexington, Ky., Collis went to Duke University to play soccer and wound up smitten by a film class and by Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo The Right Thing.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThat film inspired me to want to become a filmmaker,\u2019\u2019 Collis says.\n\nHe studied film at the University of Southern California and wound up directing \u201cMad Boy, I\u2019ll Blow Your Blues Away,\u2019\u2019 because he couldn\u2019t bear for \u201cthis gem of a story\u2019\u2019 to not be produced. The short film wound up winning several awards and put Collis in line for directing a feature film, \u201cSunset Strip,\u2019\u2019 about the Los Angeles rock \u2018n roll scene in the early 1970s.\n\nA regular on the film festival circuit, Collis began building a network of friends and colleagues who, like him, loved making movies.\n\nWhen he began teaching three years ago in the Herberger Institute\u2019s Theatre and Film School as a visiting professor, Collis saw the students' lack of exposure to real filmmakers \u2013 people he knew just a quick flight or call away.\n\n\u201cI asked friends of mine to Skype,\u2019\u2019 he says.
