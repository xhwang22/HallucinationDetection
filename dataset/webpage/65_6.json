After the formation of the National Women's Soccer League in late 2012, Deines played for the Seattle Reign during the league's first two seasons. She was traded to FC Kansas City in late 2014[3] but announced her retirement from professional soccer on March 31, 2015, before the 2015 season began.[4]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 1 933 393 1 665 2 180 3 175\n\nWomen's Soccer Fall Media Day\n\nKate Deines m4v\n\nKickin' it with Kate (Episode 3) - Victorious on the Road\n\nInterview: Laura Harvey 5/28\n\nHope Solo Signs Regan's Soccer Ball Transcription\n\nEarly life\n\nDeines was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 17, 1989, to Matt and Betsy Deines. As a freshman at Issaquah High School, Deines helped lead the soccer team to its first state championship final since 1988 and first title ever.[5] Deines led the team to four consecutive conference championships from 2004 to 2007 and four state title games, winning three of them.[6] Issaquah's lone runner-up finish was in 2005 when Deines was forced to miss the championship game to join the United States Youth Soccer Association Olympic Development Program in Boca Raton, Florida following the semifinal.[7] Issaquah went on undefeated the next two years with Deines in the lineup.\n\nDeines capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2007 state final, a 1\u20130 victory over Seattle Prep.[8]\n\nDeines finished with a total of 76 goals and was named to the all-state team four times and chosen as the state's Gatorade Player of the Year twice. During her senior year she was named to the Parade and NSCAA/adidas Girls High School All-America teams.[9]\n\nDeines has played soccer with the Seattle Sounders Women since joining the team in 2007 while still in high school.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nDeines was a four-year starter for the Washington Huskies, starting a school-record 86 games and scoring 21 goals.[10] She was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman First Team and was a four-time All-Pac-10 selection and a two-time NSCAA Scholar All-American.[11]\n\nAs a freshman at the University of Washington, Deines helped the Huskies return to the NCAA Tournament after a three-year absence.[12] She played a leading role as team captain during her junior year. She converted two key penalty kicks, including the game winner, during an epic penalty shoot-out in a shocking upset of the No. 2 overall seed University of Portland in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.[13] The Huskies would eventually go on to the Elite Eight where they were eliminated in an overtime loss at Boston College.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDrafted to the Atlanta Beat, 2012\n\nDeines was selected as a fourth round pick (23rd overall) by the Atlanta Beat in the 2012 WPS Draft of college seniors on January 13, 2012; however, the league suspended operations before play began.[14][15]\n\nFrom Seattle to Iceland, 2012\n\nAfter the WPS folded in 2012, Deines signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. She made 12 appearances for the club, scoring one goal.[16] Following the conclusion of the W-League season, Deines and her Sounders teammate and fellow University of Washington alum, Ver\u00f3nica P\u00e9rez, played for Stjarnan Women in Iceland's top division. The team won the Icelandic Women's Cup after a 1\u20130 win over Valur.[17] Of her time in Iceland, Deines said, \"Even though it was a spur of the moment decision to play overseas in Iceland, I believe my three month stint helped in my development as a player. Icelandic soccer was not nearly as technical or tactical as soccer in the United States but the extreme physicality of our practices and games challenged me to play with a whole new level of aggression.

The longtime Pacific Northwest inhabitant was traded to FC Kansas City in the offseason and she is exactly the type of player who is likely to have a great opportunity to take on a more prominent role this season and next as clubs deal with player absences due to the World Cup and Olympics. But Deines, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications and media studies as well as a master\u2019s in continued education from the University of Washington, couldn\u2019t continue to turn down business opportunities in favor of the low-paying league. In the increasingly expensive Seattle housing market, Deines\u2019 income level meant she lived in a five-bedroom house with three teammates and a pair of players from Major League Soccer\u2019s Seattle Sounders. \u201cIt definitely feels like an extension of college life, and it is way less glamorous than college,\u201d Deines said.\n\nAs for the on-the-field, some lopsided scores popped up on opening weekend.\n\nSeattle Reign 5-1 Western New York Flash\n\nEven when Megan Rapinoe wasn\u2019t scoring, her Welsh hair-twin Jess Fishlock was making sure a shock of blonde hair was putting a ball in the goal. Rapinoe recorded a hat trick as Seattle busted open the match with four second-half goals. Fishlock and Beverly Yanez also scored, while Jordan Angeli netted for the Flash.\n\nWashington Spirit 0-2 Houston Dash\n\nNew faces shone in Friday\u2019s league opener, as Carli Lloyd and Kealia Ohai scored on each side of halftime and Stephanie Roche subbed on to make her NWSL debut for Randy Waldrum\u2019s Dash. Ashlyn Harris made five saves in the loss.\n\nBoston Breakers 1-4 Portland Thorns\n\nAllie Long goals in the 71st and 72nd minutes salted away this one for the visitors, while Meleana Shim added a goal and two assists.

After suffering from a badly torn quadricep in high school, her coach recommended cross-training with yoga, which the former Husky and Seattle Sounders star credits for helping her play to her potential during her college years and into her current position as a midfielder in the Icelandic Pro League. Athletes for Yoga chatted with Kate about focus, recovery, and the importance of athletes taking time out of their schedules for a little happy baby and some gummy bears!\n\nHow did you first get introduced to yoga?\n\nI started doing yoga in high school due to some nagging injuries that just wouldn\u2019t go away. I tore my quad pretty badly and couldn\u2019t seem to get healthy. One of my trainers recommended I try yoga and I\u2019ve been practicing every since. I really stepped up my yoga game when I joined the women\u2019s soccer team at the University of Washington and was introduced to Athletes for Yoga. Erin (Owner and Head Coach) had an amazing ability to transform the way I thought about recovery and I credit my regular sessions with her during college for keeping me injury-free and helping me take my game to the next level.\n\nWith a career like yours, it must be hard to find time to fit yoga into your schedule. Why is it important for you to prioritize this form of training?\n\nI think for athletes who are constantly on the go and trying to balance so many different pressures in our daily lives, being able to take an hour of your day to relax and refocus through yoga is huge. Since I started, I\u2019ve noticed improvements in my flexibility, performance, and overall well-being. I feel a lot more relaxed and I feel like yoga really takes the edge off all the pressure I feel as a competitive athlete \u2014 especially when I was in college and juggling school and practice and friends and family. It just always takes me to a happy place, and it helped get me back on the soccer field at 100 percent after my injury. I\u2019m definitely grateful that I have yoga in my life and it will remain part of my life\n\nDo you notice the difference when you skip a few yoga sessions?\n\nThe minute I have not been good about practicing on a regular basis, I\u2019ve gotten a tweak here or there so I always try to practice as often as I can, especially now that I\u2019ve gone pro \u2014 staying on top of my game and keeping my body right is super important.\n\nWhat's your favorite pose?\n\nIt's hard to pick just one but it would probably be happy baby. As a soccer player, my hip flexors and groin are always tight so for me, I always feel like I get the most out of that kind of stretch. I also love savasana but then again, who doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s just the most gratifying feeling when you make it to the final pose and feel the weight of the day just lift off your shoulders. There are few things better than that.\n\nOther than yoga, how do you relax and blow off steam?\n\nEven though my career revolves around being active, I still love being as active as possible in my downtime. My family and friends and I are always finding ways to boost our energy outdoors, from hiking to walking, we are always moving!\n\nFavorite post-workout snack?\n\nChocolate milk is my go-to for the protein and of course, gotta have the gummy bears!\n\nWhen I play soccer I feel\u2026\n\nEmpowered!\n\nKate is currently playing for Stjarnan FC in the Icelandic Pro League along with fellow former Husky teammate Veronica Perez.
