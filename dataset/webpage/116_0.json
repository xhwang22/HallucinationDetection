{"Charles Lee was born on October 28, 1975.": [{"url": "https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/charles-lee", "page_content": "At the outbreak of the American Revolution, Charles Lee resigned his post in the British Royal Army to join the colonists in their patriotic cause. To Lee\u2019s chagrin, George Washington surpassed the British born officer as Congress\u2019s choice for Commander of the Continental Army. Although Lee was widely recognized for his adroit military capabilities, after only a few years into the war, his reputation would be tarnished entirely.\n\nCharles Lee was born on January 26, 1731 in Cheshire, England. As a boy, he was enrolled in military school and later served in the French and Indian War as a Lieutenant. While in America, Lee married a Mohawk woman and was subsequently adopted into the Mohawk tribe. Due to Lee\u2019s erratic temperament, the Native Americans referred to him as \u201cBoiling Water.\u201d\n\nIn 1773, Lee returned to the colonies to establish a more permanent residence in Virginia. When hostilities between Britain and the American colonies erupted in 1775, all hope for reconciliation was extinguished and the two sides plunged into war. As second in command of the Continental Army, Lee was appointed head of the Southern Department. His resentment for Washington as Commander-in-Chief, however, would continue to surface throughout the war.\n\nThe Major General garnered substantial praise and admiration for his defense of Charleston in 1776. Though the victory was largely accomplished by the judgement of others, Lee was credited with the win and dubbed a hero. In the following months, Lee joined Washington in New York where the \u201chero of Charleston\u201d began badmouthing his superior in written correspondences. Longing for Washington\u2019s job and exploiting the colonists\u2019 recent defeats in New York, Lee penned a Congressman, \u201cHad I the powers, I could do you much good.\u201d The Major\u2019s efforts to undermine General Washington were disrupted when in December of 1776 he was captured by the British. As second in command, Lee was a notable prize for the enemy and his release would only come in 1778 after a British loss at Saratoga.\n\nIn May of 1778, Lee had returned to the Continental Army in time for the Battle of Monmouth. The decisive battle took place on June 28 as the Patriots pursued the British into New Jersey. Lee was ordered to lead the troops into battle and what followed proved disastrous for the general. As the British began to flank Lee\u2019s men, the commander prematurely issued a retreat. Witnessing this, Washington confronted Lee on the battlefield and the two commanders exchanged heated words. Charged with disobeying orders and insubordination, Lee was relieved of his command and court-martialed. Congress decided to remove Lee for one year during which the ex-general proceeded to speak out against Washington.\n\nIndeed, Lee\u2019s sharp tongue created new enemies determined to defend Washington\u2019s honor. In 1778, John Laurens challenged Lee to a duel and shot him in the side, wounding but not killing the officer. In 1780, Lee formally resigned from the Continental Army and retired to Philadelphia. It was there that Lee died in 1782."}, {"url": "https://mybirthday.ninja/?m=October&d=28&y=1975&go=Go", "page_content": "Your Birthday Gift: Click the free ninja poster above to save the high quality version.

At certain points he is believed to have sought to supplant George Washington and take command of the Continental Army. Lee and Washington came into direct confrontation during the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. Lee's conduct during the battle and the subsequent exchange with Washington eventually led to his permanent dismissal from the Continental Army.\n\nCharles Lee was born in Cheshire, England the son of British Army General John Lee and Isabella Buxbury. Educated in Switzerland, Lee became fluent in several languages. He joined the British army in 1744. After serving in a number of European armies, including those of Russia, Poland, and Portugal, he took up permanent residence in America and joined the Continental Army in 1775. Lee was commissioned second major general in the force, following only George Washington in seniority.\n\nLee was widely respected in the colonies for his military reputation, and his military advice and direction were sought after in a number of locations in the first years of the conflict. He served on the siege lines outside of Boston and aided in the development of the defenses of Newport, Rhode Island. Afterwards he began the defenses of New York, and was reassigned to the southern department where his most significant contribution came in the defense of Charleston, S.C. against a British assault in 1776.\n\nThese actions led to Lee achieving a fairly high reputation. Lee was captured by the British in 1776 following the fall of New York City. Exchanged in a prisoner swap in 1778, Lee returned to the Continental Army and was a staunch critic of the reforms of the Baron von Steuben. There is some speculation that Lee abandoned the American cause while a prisoner in New York, as he wrote several notes to William Howe on the best manner to defeat the Americans. This was unknown to the American camp at the time of his return and Lee was reinstated at his previous rank.\n\nLee returned to the field and led the advanced guard at the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. Lee's attack was disorganized and the ensuing confusion resulted in the retreat of the American advance guard. When confronted by Washington on his reason for the withdrawal, the two men exchanged words. Lee was brought up on charges of insubordination and removed from command in the army for one year. In the aftermath, he became embroiled in several affairs of honor and often criticized the Continental Congress for enforcing the sentence on him. These actions led to his permanent dismissal from the Continental Army in January of 1780. He died in Philadelphia in 1782.\n\nJames McIntyre\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nMoraine Valley Community College\n\nBibliography:\n\nAlden, John R. General Charles Lee: Traitor or Patriot?.

A British Army veteran, he offered his services to the Continental Congress and was given a commission. Lee's prickly demeanor and substantial ego brought him into frequent conflict with General George Washington. He was relieved of his command during the Battle of Monmouth Court House and was later dismissed from the Continental Army by Congress.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn February 6, 1732, in Cheshire, England, Lee was the son of Major General John Lee and his wife Isabella Bunbury. Sent to school in Switzerland at an early age, he was taught a variety of languages and received a basic military education. Returning to Britain at age 14, Lee attended the King Edward VI School in Bury St. Edmonds before his father purchased him an ensign's commission in the British Army.\n\nServing in his father's regiment, the 55th Foot (later 44th Foot), Lee spent time in Ireland before purchasing a lieutenant's commission in 1751. With the beginning of the French and Indian War, the regiment was ordered to North America. Arriving in 1755, Lee took part Major General Edward Braddock's disastrous campaign which ended at the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9.\n\nFrench and Indian War\n\nOrdered to the Mohawk Valley in New York, Lee became friendly with the local Mohawks and was adopted by the tribe. Given the name Ounewaterika or \"Boiling Water,\" he was permitted to marry the daughter of one of the chiefs. In 1756, Lee purchased a promotion to captain and a year later took part in the failed expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg.\n\nReturning to New York, Lee's regiment became part of Major General James Abercrombie's advance against Fort Carillon in 1758. That July, he was badly wounded during the bloody repulse at the Battle of Carillon. Recovering, Lee took part in Brigadier General John Prideaux's successful 1759 campaign to capture Fort Niagara before joining the British advance on Montreal the following year.\n\nInterwar Years\n\nWith the conquest of Canada complete, Lee was transferred to the 103rd Foot and promoted to major. In this role, he served in Portugal and played a key part in Colonel John Burgoyne's triumph at the Battle of Vila Velha on October 5, 1762. The fighting saw Lee's men recapture the town and win a lopsided victory that inflicted around 250 killed and captured on the Spanish while only sustaining only 11 casualties.\n\nWith the end of the war in 1763, Lee's regiment was disbanded and he was placed on half-pay. Seeking employment, he traveled to Poland two years later and became an aide-de-camp to King Stanislaus (II) Poniatowski. Made a major general in the Polish service, he later returned to Britain in 1767. Still unable to obtain a position in the British Army, Lee resumed his post in Poland in 1769 and took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1778\u20131764). While abroad, he lost two fingers in a duel.\n\nTo America\n\nInvalided back to Britain in 1770, Lee continued to petition for a post in the British service. Though promoted to lieutenant colonel, no permanent position was available. Frustrated, Lee decided to return to North America and settled in western Virginia in 1773. There he purchased a large estate near lands owned by his friend Horatio Gates.\n\nQuickly impressing key individuals in the colony, such as Richard Henry Lee, he became sympathetic to the Patriot cause. As hostilities with Britain looked increasingly likely, Lee advised that an army should be formed. With the Battles of Lexington and Concord and subsequent beginning of the American Revolution in April 1775, Lee immediately offered his services to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.\n\nJoining the American Revolution\n\nBased on his prior military exploits, Lee fully expected to be made the commander-in-chief of the new Continental Army. Though Congress was pleased to have an officer with Lee's experience join the cause, it was put off by his slovenly appearance, desire to be paid, and frequent use of obscene language. The post instead was given to another Virginian, General George Washington. Lee was commissioned as the Army's second-most senior major general behind Artemis Ward. Despite being listed third in the Army's hierarchy, Lee was effectively second, as the aging Ward had little ambition beyond overseeing the ongoing Siege of Boston.\n\nCharleston\n\nImmediately resentful of Washington, Lee traveled north to Boston with his commander in July 1775. Taking part in the siege, his gruff personal behavior was tolerated by other officers due to his prior military accomplishments. With the arrival of the new year, Lee was ordered to Connecticut to raise forces for the defense of New York City. Shortly thereafter, Congress appointed him to command the Northern, and later Canadian, Department. Though selected for these posts, Lee never served in them because on March 1, Congress directed him to take over the Southern Department at Charleston, South Carolina. Reaching the city on June 2, Lee was quickly faced with the arrival of a British invasion force led by Major General Henry Clinton and Commodore Peter Parker.\n\nAs the British prepared to land, Lee worked to fortify the city and support Colonel William Moultrie's garrison at Fort Sullivan. Doubtful that Moultrie could hold, Lee recommended that he fall back to the city. This was refused and the fort's garrison turned back the British at the Battle of Sullivan's Island on June 28. In September, Lee received orders to rejoin Washington's army at New York. As a nod to Lee's return, Washington changed the name of Fort Constitution, on the bluffs overlooking the Hudson River, to Fort Lee. Reaching New York, Lee arrived in time for the Battle of White Plains.\n\nIssues with Washington\n\nIn the wake of the American defeat, Washington entrusted Lee with a large portion of the Army and tasked him with first holding Castle Hill and then Peekskill. With the collapse of the American position around New York after the losses of Fort Washington and Fort Lee, Washington began retreating across New Jersey. As the retreat began, he ordered Lee to join him with his troops. As the autumn had progressed, Lee's relationship with his superior had continued to degrade and he began sending intensely critical letters regarding Washington's performance to Congress. Though one of these was accidentally read by Washington, the American commander, more disappointed than angered, did not take action.\n\nCapture\n\nMoving at a slow pace, Lee brought his men south into New Jersey. On December 12, his column encamped south of Morristown. Rather than remain with his men, Lee and his staff took quarters at White's Tavern several miles from the American camp. The next morning, Lee's guard was surprised by a British patrol led by Lieutenant Colonel William Harcourt and including Banastre Tarleton. After a brief exchange, Lee and his men were captured.\n\nThough Washington attempted to exchange several Hessian officers taken at Trenton for Lee, the British refused. Held as a deserter due to his previous British service, Lee wrote and submitted a plan for defeating the Americans to General Sir William Howe. An act of treason, the plan was not made public until 1857. With the American victory at Saratoga, Lee's treatment improved and he was finally exchanged for Major General Richard Prescott on May 8, 1778.\n\nBattle of Monmouth\n\nStill popular with Congress and parts of the Army, Lee rejoined Washington at Valley Forge on May 20, 1778. The following month, British forces under Clinton began evacuating Philadelphia and moving north to New York. Assessing the situation, Washington desired to pursue and attack the British. Lee strenuously objected to this plan as he felt the new alliance with France precluded the need to fight unless victory was certain. Overruling Lee, Washington and the army crossed to New Jersey and closed with the British. On June 28, Washington ordered Lee to take a force of 5,000 men forward to attack the enemy's rearguard.\n\nAt around 8 a.m., Lee's column met the British rearguard under Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis just north of Monmouth Court House. Rather than commence a coordinated attack, Lee committed his troops piecemeal and rapidly lost control of the situation. After a few hours of fighting, the British moved to flank Lee's line. Seeing this, Lee ordered a general retreat after offering little resistance. Falling back, he and his men encountered Washington, who was advancing with the rest of the Army.\n\nAppalled by the situation, Washington sought out Lee and demanded to know what had happened. After receiving no satisfactory answer, he rebuked Lee in one of the few instances where he swore publicly. Replying with inappropriate language, Lee was immediately relieved of his command. Riding forward, Washington was able to rescue American fortunes during the remainder of the Battle of Monmouth Court House.\n\nLater Career and Life\n\nMoving to the rear, Lee promptly wrote two highly insubordinate letters to Washington and demanded a court-martial to clear his name. Obliging, Washington had a court-martial convened at New Brunswick, New Jersey on July 1. Proceeding under the guidance of Major General Lord Stirling, the hearings concluded on August 9. Three days later, the board returned and found Lee guilty of disobeying orders in the face of the enemy, misbehavior, and disrespecting the commander-in-chief. In the wake of the verdict, Washington forwarded it to Congress for action.\n\nOn December 5, Congress voted to sanction Lee by relieving him from command for one year. Forced from the field, Lee began working to overturn the verdict and openly attacked Washington. These actions cost him what little popularity he had remaining. In response to his assault on Washington, Lee was challenged to several duels. In December 1778, Colonel John Laurens, one of Washington's aides, wounded him in the side during a duel. This injury prevented Lee from following through on a challenge from Major General Anthony Wayne.\n\nReturning to Virginia in 1779, he learned that Congress intended to dismiss him from the service. In response, he wrote a scathing letter that resulted in his formal dismissal from the Continental Army on January 10, 1780.\n\nDeath\n\nLee moved to Philadelphia in the same month as his dismissal, January 1780. He resided in the city until taking ill and dying on October 2, 1782. Though unpopular, his funeral was attended by much of Congress and several foreign dignitaries. Lee was buried at Christ Episcopal Church and Churchyard in Philadelphia."}, {"url": "https://takemeback.to/28-October-1975", "page_content": "Old Newspapers from October 28, 1975\n\nBrowse US newspapers from October 28, 1975\n\nDiscover UK newspaper headlines from October 28, 1975\n\nOld Magazines from October 28, 1975\n\nBrowse your vintage magazines from October 28, 1975\n\nLooking for other vintage memories?\n\nLook at our old newspapers and magazines page\n\nSee also\n\nWhat happened on October 28 in history?

The South Vietnamese and US troops held off the offensive but it was such fierce fighting that the U.S. public began to turn against the war.\n\nIn 1978, Charles was 26 years old when on July 25th, Louise Brown, the first \"test-tube baby\", was born at Oldham Hospital in London. Louise was conceived through IVF (in vitro fertilization), a controversial and experimental procedure at the time.\n\nIn 1982, by the time he was 30 years old, on June 30th, time ran out on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).

His capture by British troops a year later and his retreat during the Battle of Monmouth, which led to a court-martial and removal from the army, prompted historians to question both his military ability and his allegiance to his adopted country.\n\nOne of the most puzzling and ambiguous characters in American military history, Charles Lee served as third in command in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Captured only a year into the war while staying at a New Jersey tavern and imprisoned for 18 months, he later compromised an attack by General George Washington's army by retreating during the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. Haunted by growing disapproval due to his outspoken criticism of Washington, Lee was court-martialed and subsequently suspended from the army.\n\nNo Fixed Allegiance\n\nOf Irish heritage, Lee was born in Dernhall, Cheshire, England, on January 25, 1731. His father, a former colonel in the British Army, encouraged his son's interest in the military and enrolled Lee in a Swiss military school in 1744. An ensign from the age of 14, Lee was sent to the American colonies during the French and Indian War and in 1755 served in British General Edward Braddock's 44th Regiment. This regiment contained several officers who would go on to shape history, among them George Washington, Horatio Gates, and Thomas Gage. Unlike his colleagues, Lee flouted convention with his unkempt appearance and his coarse demeanor, although he was known to quote from Latin scholars when the occasion suited him. Known for his bouts of drunkenness and vulgar language, Lee was rarely seen without his train of dogs. He said dogs, unlike men, were faithful. In 1756, while in northern New York, he was adopted into a Mohawk tribe, entered what he considered a non-binding union with the daughter of Seneca tribal leader White Thunder, and was given the name Ounewaterika, or \"Boiling Water,\" referring to his quickness to anger.\n\nHis life with the Mohawks was brief. In July 1758 Lee was back under British command and serving in the 44th Regiment under General Abercromby during the unsuccessful British attack on Fort Ticonderoga. Wounded during battle, he was sent to Long Island to recover. He disagreed with his surgeon on proper treatment of his wounds and whipped the doctor, who later tried to kill him. Lee's brash, impetuous nature frequently got him into trouble.\n\nIn 1759, Lee and the 44th Regiment fought French forces at Fort Niagara. He served under General Amherst during the siege and capture of Montreal on September 8, 1760. Spending the winter in England, he was promoted to the rank of major in the 103rd Regiment. On August 10, 1761, he became a major in the 103rd Regiment of the British Army. The following spring, he was a lieutenant colonel when he accompanied an expeditionary force to Portugal under Major General John Burgoyne.\n\nWith Great Britain once again at peace, Lee saw no future as an officer on half-pay in the British Army. Lee traveled to Warsaw in March 1765 and gained the confidence of Poland's King Stanislaus. However, a trip to Turkey caused him to rethink this career move. After becoming snowbound in the Balkans and then surviving a deadly earthquake in Constantinople in May 1776, Lee returned to the relative safety of England. He spent the next two years penning sarcastic essays critical of the British crown and lived off his gambling winnings. When civil war broke out in Poland he returned to aid King Stanislaus and was commissioned a general in the Polish army. During a campaign in Turkey in late 1769 Lee became ill and was sent to the Mediterranean to recover. During 1771 he alternated between England and France, but he was discontented with the political situation in both nations.\n\nJoined American Cause\n\nExcited by the growing spirit of the Enlightenment, Lee desired to fight on behalf of liberty, and he enlisted in the cause of the American patriots after returning to the American colonies in 1773. Making a home in current-day West Virginia, he attacked efforts at reconciliation between colonists and the British crown in the pamphlet Strictures on a Pamphlet, entitled \"A Friendly address to All Reasonable Americans.\" His enthusiastic support of the colonial cause gained him the admiration of Richard Henry Lee, Patrick Henry, and Samuel and John Adams. His military experience made him a valuable asset to the newly formed Continental Army. In December 1774, Lee traveled to Mount Vernon and Washington's side. After war broke out in 1775, he renounced his commission in the British Army. Artemas Ward was named first major general and Lee became second major general in Washington's Continental Army, a commission Lee accepted on June 17, 1775.\n\nA month later, Lee accompanied Washington to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and fought during the siege of Boston under General Ward. The following March, the Continental Congress ordered Lee south to fight British troops in Virginia and North Carolina as head of the army's Southern department. On June 4, 1776, Lee arrived in Charleston and assumed command of the South Carolina troops, making his headquarters in nearby Williamsburg. Unenthusiastic about the post, he anticipated a retreat. Colonel William Moultrie had other ideas, and repulsed the British naval force from his position at Fort Sullivan on Sullivan's Island. While Lee and Moultrie both received commendations for their actions, Moultrie was considered primarily responsible for the victory.\n\nCaptured by the British\n\nIn September 1776, after the British withdrawal from the southern colonies, Lee was ordered to return to the main army, now stationed in New York and New Jersey. He expressed reluctance to rejoin Washington after learning that threatening maneuvers by British General Howe had forced a colonial retreat. He believed he would be more effective and gain more notoriety as head of a \"rogue\" unit that engaged the British using guerilla tactics. However, Lee eventually followed orders and headed into New Jersey. On December 12, 1776, he took quarter at White's Tavern in Basking Ridge, two miles from where his 4,000-member detachment encamped, and the following day sent a terse letter to General Horatio Gates, referring to Washington by noting that \"a certain great man is most damnably deficient. He has thrown me into a situation where I have my choice of difficulties.\"\n\nCamped less than four miles away, British troops led by Lieutenant General Cornwallis discovered Lee's whereabouts. Soon after writing his letter to Gates, Lee was captured by Colonel Harcourt. General Lee was \"hurried off in triumph,\" Continental Army Captain James Wilkinson later recalled in his memoirs, \"bareheaded, in his slippers and blanket coat, his collar open, and his shirt very much soiled from several days' use.\"\n\nLee was taken to New York and imprisoned. An order to return him to England for trial as a deserter was rescinded by British General Howe, who knew of Lee's resignation. Washington attempted to secure Lee's release through a prisoner exchange, but he had no captives of similar rank with which to bargain, and Lee remained in British custody for almost 18 months. During this time Lee appears to have wavered in his allegiance to his adopted country. In 1858 a document titled \"Mr. Lee's Plan, 29th March 1777\" was discovered; it advised Howe on a way to defeat the Continental Army. While some historians have argued that Lee's plan was an attempt to mislead the British commander, in the light of his later activities his loyalty remains in question.\n\nAfter Burgoyne's defeat at the Battle of Saratoga, Lee was exchanged for recently captured Major General Richard Prescott and released in April 1778. After a quick trip to Congress to complain about his lack of promotion during his capture, Lee traveled to Valley Forge and by late May had rejoined his command.\n\nThe Battle of Monmouth\n\nThroughout his involvement in the Revolutionary War, Lee earned a reputation as a loose cannon, a recalcitrant officer resentful of taking orders from Washington, whom he believed to be of lesser ability. His actions in June 1778 during the Monmouth campaign cemented this reputation and led to the end of his military career.\n\nWashington was determined to attack the British during their retreat from Philadelphia to New York, and he overtook General Henry Clinton and his 11,000 British regulars near New Freehold, New Jersey, near Monmouth Court House. The Battle of Monmouth provided Washington with the chance for a much-needed victory. While generals Nathanael Greene, Wayne, and the Marquis de Lafayette urged a full assault, Lee argued against such an approach. Put in command of the main flank supporting the advance force led by General Wayne, he was suddenly confronted by more soldiers than he had anticipated. Informed by a scout of an area to his rear that would be easily defended, Lee began to retreat, forcing Wayne to fall back. Washington quickly reformed the regiments of Greene, Stirling, and Wayne into a second formation that successfully stalled the British until dark, while General von Steuben assumed command of Lee's forces.\n\nWashington's words to Lee on the battlefield were not recorded, but they were severe enough that Lee immediately demanded an apology. Two days later he sent the commander-in-chief a critical letter that angered Washington. Further correspondence between the two men resulted in Lee's request for a court of inquiry so that he could prove his case. On July 4 Lee's court martial began, with General Stirling presiding, and on August 12 he was found guilty of disrespect to his commanding officer, disobedience, and leading a disorderly and unauthorized retreat. His punishment, one year's suspension, was eventually sanctioned by Congress on January 10, 1780, although colonial leaders expressed regret at the loss of a commanding officer during wartime. As Eric Ethier reported in American History, when Lee heard the decision of Congress to approve his suspension, he pointed to one of his dogs and said, \"Oh, that I was that animal, that I might not call man my brother.\"\n\nLee sent repeated letters to congressmen, members of the military, and the press attacking the character of Washington and complaining of mistreatment by the Continental Congress. After reading Lee's defamatory \"Vindication,\" published in the Pennsylvania Packet on December 3, 1778, Colonel John Laurens challenged Lee to a duel over his slanderous remarks about Washington's character. In the duel, Lee was wounded and could not fight a second duel requested by General Wayne.\n\nIn July 1779 Lee returned to his home in Virginia, remaining there for two years before moving to Philadelphia. He died of pneumonia in a tavern on October 2, 1782. Up to the time of his death he continued to express animosity toward Washington as a \"puffed up charlatan.\" In Lee's last will and testament he asked that he not be buried in a churchyard. \"I have kept so much bad company when living,\" he wrote, \"that I do not choose to continue it when dead.\" Despite these wishes, Lee was buried at the cemetery at Christ Church, Philadelphia. Though he had been unpopular only months before, his funeral was attended by Washington, members of the Continental Congress and the assembly of Pennsylvania, the minister of France, and other officers of distinction.\n\nBooks\n\nCommager, Henry Steele, and Richard B.

Minor tweaks that can give their team even a little edge.\n\nBut four games into a series, there are not a lot of secrets left. Everyone knows what is coming. It is often more about execution and effort over adjustments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of both,\u201d the Heat\u2019s Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely some things we can adjust on, and then it\u2019s also about a little bit more effort and just doing more. You always need more, always can do more\u2026 we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the floor, but you know, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe Heat need to figure it out before Game 4 on Friday night, because they can\u2019t afford to go down 3-1 to the Nuggets in this series. Game 4 is as close as it gets to must-win for Jimmy Butler and the Heat.\n\nHere are two things worth watching in Game 4, plus some betting advice from Vaughn Dalzell of NBC Sports Edge.\n\n1) Miami has to slow the Jokic/Murray two-man game. Somehow.\n\nDenver\u2019s defense has been impressive in these Finals, holding Miami to a 111.1 offensive rating through three games (for comparison, that is 7.2 below their offensive rating against Boston).\n\nPart of the reason is that Nikola Joki\u0107 can be a better rim protector and defensive player than people give him credit for. Another key is Malone has been able to lean hard into more defensive-based lineups because the two-man game of Jamal Murray and Joki\u0107 has been all the offense the Nuggets need.\n\nThe Murray/Jokic pick-and-roll has been a masterclass in this series \u2014 the Nuggets have a 126 offensive rating this series when running that play. In Game 3, the Denver stars ran 32 pick-and-rolls, and those plays were the foundation of each of them getting a 30-point triple-double (the first teammates to have a 30+ point triple-double in any NBA game).\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are the first pair of teammates with triple-doubles in Finals history! Jokic: 32 PTS, 21 REB, 10 AST\n\nMurray: 34 PTS, 10 REB, 10 AST DEN/MIA Game 4: Friday, 8:30pm/et on ABC pic.twitter.com/0hLcPvv0zN \u2014 NBA (@NBA) June 8, 2023\n\n\u201cI mean, the Murray/Jokic two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop,\u201d Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cBut we got great defensive players, got some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy [Butler] and Bam [Adebayo], so we\u2019re gonna figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies we can throw at Murray as well.\u201d\n\nMiami may need to sell out to stop Joki\u0107 and Murray and force any other Nugget to beat them. The Heat did blitz the pick-and-roll more in the fourth quarter of Game 3, but that led to Christian Braun cuts to the basket and Denver buckets. Miami may have to live with some of that, they have to keep Murray in particular in check (it feels like Joki\u0107 will get his no matter what).\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, you just can\u2019t do it all the time,\u201d Spoelstra said of defending the Nuggets duo. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolutes when you get to this level. It\u2019s the highest level of competition. You\u2019re getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they\u2019re trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThe first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn\u2019t need to go to any other part of their playbook.\u201d\n\nMiami needs to see the rest of that playbook.\n\n2) Miami has to make shots, rebound, set defense\n\nThe best way for Miami to limit the Jokic/Murray action and the Denver offense in general is to slow the game down. Make them go against a set defense every time down. That didn\u2019t happen enough in Game 3 \u2014 Denver was free-flowing on offense when Miami needs the game played in the mud.\n\nFor the Heat to change that dynamic two key things need to happen.\n\nFirst, Miami has to make shots. It\u2019s simplistic but it\u2019s true. Denver isn\u2019t going to run if they are taking the ball out of the net.\n\nThat starts with 3-pointers, because as has been noted everywhere the Heat are 6-1 when they shoot 45% or better from 3 this postseason (including Game 2 against the Nuggets), and unreasonably hot shooting has sustained their run to the Finals. The Heat starters were 5-of-19 (26.3%) from beyond the arc in Game 3, which is simply not good enough \u2014 Max Strus, Gabe Vincent and the rest of the role players must step up and knock down shots. However, the bigger concern in Game 3 was the Heat shooting 38.2% within eight feet of the basket. The Nuggets\u2019 size is clearly bothering the Heat. Jimmy Butler needs to get downhill and then make the shots, Bam Adebayo has to get the floater to fall, and the Heat need to attack and get to the free throw line.\n\nSecond, the Heat can\u2019t let the Nuggets win the rebounding battle by 25. Denver\u2019s size advantage has played out in this series in many ways (including how they contested 3s in Game 3), but it is most clearly on the glass. Miami is getting one shot and they\u2019re done, but the Nuggets grabbed the offensive rebound on 36.1% of their missed shots in Game 3, and if you give them that many second chances you will pay.\n\nIt will take gang rebounding and effort, but the Heat must be stronger on the glass.\n\n3) Vaughn Dalzell\u2019s betting recommendations\n\nOver/Under: The total continues to drop from game-by-game starting at 219.5 then going from 216.5 to 214.5 and now 210.5 for Game 4. Denver and Miami have struggled with consistency when it comes to scoring, Miami a little more than Denver. The Nuggets are shooting 51% to Miami\u2019s 41% from the field and averaging 10 more free-throw attempts per game. The pace and tempo of this series has barely changed through three games and if it wasn\u2019t for Miami\u2019s 38-point fourth quarter in Game 2, the Under would be 3-0 in this NBA Finals. I will keep riding the Under.\n\nPlayer Props: In this series there have been four players worth betting overs; Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. On the other hand, there have been some very good fade prospects for unders such as Kevin Love, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who are all shooting 31% or worse from the field. When betting player props in the NBA Finals, keep it simple stupid (KISS).\n\n(Check out more from Dalzell and the team at NBC Sports Edge.)"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3171605/2022/03/09/nba-40-under-40-milwaukee-bucks-assistant-coach-charles-lee-is-ready-to-run-his-own-team/", "page_content": "This past offseason, Charles Lee emerged as one of the most interesting head-coaching candidates for the various openings around the league. He was tied to a handful of jobs, including as a strong candidate in New Orleans and as a finalist in Washington. It was the latest sign that Lee is ready to take the next step in his career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee, 37, is in his eighth season in the NBA and all eight have been spent on the bench alongside Mike Budenholzer, first in Atlanta and now in Milwaukee where Budenholzer is the Bucks head coach, and the franchise is the reigning NBA champion. A former Patriot League Player of the Year at Bucknell, Lee played in Europe after college, before moving into coaching.\n\nIt seems as if Lee will get his chance to run his own team at some point, if last year\u2019s hiring cycle was an indication. He took some time recently to speak with The Athletic for its 40 under 40 series. He discussed what he\u2019s learned from Budenholzer, his approach as a coach, what he\u2019s taken from working with Giannis Antetokounmpo and what he took from coming so close last offseason.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked with Mike in two stops now. How much have you pulled from him? What is your approach as a coach dealing with NBA players?\n\nI would say I\u2019ve drawn a lot from Coach Bud. I\u2019ve been blessed to have worked for a guy who was Coach of the Year. Who\u2019s won championships, even outside of Milwaukee, but as an assistant, obviously, in San Antonio. And then the other assistant coaches that he\u2019s had on staff, I\u2019ve gotten to draw and pull from Taylor Jenkins, who\u2019s crushing it in Memphis. And Darvin Ham and Neven Spahija and Kenny Atkinson. It\u2019s been a special group to kind of draw a lot of different thoughts and ideas from, but I would say what I\u2019ve learned over the years, there are so many variables that go on in a day-to-day process, and throughout a season, and the thing that I keep falling back on is just like controlling what you can control. The schedule\u2019s tough and injuries happen and all this stuff, but can we just be focused and obsessed with just controlling what we can control, which is our preparation on a daily basis, our effort levels, and then our mental makeup?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m a big \u2018power of positivity\u2019 guy. Yeah, there\u2019s some adversity, there\u2019s some, quote-unquote, failures or losses, but how are we going to respond to that and how do we just develop this thicker skin to be able to deal with these adverse situations? Then controlling what you can control kind of flows into my coaching philosophy. Daily improvement \u2014 how can we make sure that we\u2019re just making everyday matter? Whether it\u2019s on the court, we\u2019re going to improve, with our skill set, whether it\u2019s in the weight room getting stronger, whether it\u2019s the diet part of our nutrition, just to help our body to be able to recover. Have you just be obsessed again, like daily improvement and not getting bored with the day-to-day improvements. The second part, again, competitiveness. I think that if you can compete at a high level physically, but also the mental side of it as well, you\u2019re going to put yourself in a good position to win a lot of games. And then the third part of my philosophy is just togetherness. How can we come together as a team? How can I as the head coach, or even as an assistant coach, build relationships where I\u2019m earning their trust? Where they will let me coach them, they will allow me to help impart some wisdom to them as basketball players? And also just admit, because I want to see the best for them. And I think that once players feel that there\u2019s a connection and a real genuine relationship, it makes them want to play a little bit harder for you.\n\nWhat have you learned from working with Giannis and coaching Giannis when it comes to coaching star players and getting them to trust you?\n\nBeing honest. Not beating around the bush. Understanding the game and doing your homework and watching the film and going back and forth, but then just finding opportunities to hit him on things that are just honest. Like, not always, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re the best. You know, you\u2019re doing this great,\u2019 No, he wants to be coached. All the players from Giannis down to our 15th guys \u2014 Lindell Wigginton and Jevon Carter or Jordan Nwora, whoever it is, they just want you to be honest with them and upfront. I think that when you outline clear expectations for players, they respect that more than anything else.\n\nSo what was last year like, winning the title? What, what was that like for you personally?\n\nMy talking about kind of controlling what you could control, there\u2019s so much hard work that goes into a season and every year we all have this goal, obviously, of trying to compete or win a championship, and we\u2019ve fallen short in previous years, and we\u2019ve had some great seasons. Staying patient but continuing to trust your hard work, that it\u2019s gonna pay off. And then last year, we finally hit the pinnacle, which is kind of what you\u2019ve been working for. It felt really good because we\u2019ve been kind of to the top of the mountain or really close to the top the mountain of getting to the finals. Last year, we finally get there, and it just felt great to see it and all the hard work that we had put in, all the daily improvement, all the adversity that we had kind of gone through and come together, we had grown.\n\nAfter that, it seemed like you were interviewing with several teams for a head coaching job. It looked like, at least according to reports, that you were close in New Orleans. What did you take away from the interview process and what do you have your eyes on now when it comes to being a head coach one day?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefinitely learned how to accept rejection. In all seriousness, number one, it was just an honor to be in these conversations. To be so young but to know that my hard work is paying off, I\u2019m just kind of staying focused on just being the best assistant coach that I can possibly be at a place and not worry too much about this self-promotion or doing anything extra. Just really working hard and diving into whatever responsibilities the team needs. Then I would say, on top of it, just accepting feedback and understanding. \u2018What am I going to have to do to grow so that one day I can be in the seat of being a head coach for one of these organizations?\u2019 There are only 30 of them and it was kind of tough to keep hearing no. But after self-reflection, you take the feedback, and now it\u2019s just my responsibility to keep trying to grow in those areas that they think that I can show some improvement in.\n\n(Photo of Charles Lee: Jim Poorten / NBAE via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://playersbio.com/david-lee/", "page_content": "David Lee is an American-born former professional basketball player who played for around twelve seasons in the NBA.

He is the son of Gary (Father) and Susan Lee (Mother).\n\nLee started his education at a local school nearby his house in St. Louis, where he was an academically gifted kid. Born in a wealthy family, he did not feel short of anything while growing up.\n\nHis grandfather, Desmond Lee, was a retired World War II veteran who had established a big company named Lee-Rowan Company which had a net worth of millions. So, his family had a good influence in the city he resided.\n\nDespite his busy schedule, Desmond spent considerable time with his grandkid. He used to tell him war stories and other stuff such as business, hard work, and dedication.\n\nAs he was born with the silver spoon, people in St. Missouri believed that David would take over his family\u2019s business. However, he had a passion of his own.\n\nHis father, Gary, was an assistant coach at the Chaminade College Prep School besides being a businessman. Moreover, his grandfather was an athlete during his college years at Washington University.\n\nSo, maybe because of their influence, he grew fond of basketball and soon became proficient. His coach at the school often doubted that he would not pursue such a career seeing his family background.\n\nBut, Lee did not want to live off his privilege and carried on with his studies and sports to shape his life. After graduating from the Chaminade prep in 2001, he enrolled in the University of Florida for higher education.\n\nDavid Lee | Basketball Career\n\nHigh School Career\n\nDavid Lee played high school basketball for the Chaminade Preparatory High School in Missouri. He had already gained considerable experience by playing basketball at the John Burroughs School and the St. Louis Eagles AAU team.\n\nHis high school coach Kelvin Lee initially doubted his skills, but David proved to be a good power forward since his freshman season. His tall frame helped him dominate his opponents and score high points.\n\nHowever, Lee\u2019s performance on the rear end of the court was far superior to his teammates during his school years. Moreover, he was ambidextrous, which often came in handy while making quick passes.\n\nFor his performance in senior season, David got an opportunity to play in the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game and was named to the first-team Parade All-American in 2001. Similarly, he won the Slam Dunk competition that same year.\n\nClick here to read about the American-born retired professional basketball player John Lucas II who now coaches the Houston Rockets athletes!\n\nCollege Career\n\nDavid began receiving scholarship offers from different universities such as Florida, Duke, Kentucky, Illinois, etc., when he was in senior year of his high school.

However, his performance kept getting better one season after another, and just like Donovan said, he was the leading rebounder in his senior season.\n\nLee averaged 13.6 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in his last college season. He led the Gators to the 2005 SEC Basketball Tournament, their first-ever SEC championship win.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nThe New York Knicks selected Lee as the 2005 NBA draft\u2019s first-round 30th pick. The Knicks were at their low times during the years they chose Lee, and every player on the team had great challenges ahead.\n\nAt first, the Knicks relied on Channing Frye above Lee, but they later had to give Lee more chances as Frye retreated to rest due to injury.\n\nContrary to the expectation, Lee performed poorly in all sides of the game except rebounding. He finished his first-ever NBA season with an average of 5.1 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.\n\nHowever, his performance in the next four seasons with the Knicks set him up for a fantastic career in the NBA. Even though he missed many games in the second season, his games did not degrade even a bit.\n\nHe averaged 20.2 points and 11.7 rebounds per game and secured a place in the NBA All-Star Game in the 2009-10 season. After that season, the Knicks traded him to the Golden State Warriors, with whom he signed a new contract on July 9, 2010.\n\nHowever, he consistently missed many matches due to frequent injuries.

After the New York Knicks picked him in the 2005 draft, they paid him around $860k for his rookie season.\n\nLee continued playing for the Knicks in the next few seasons with improved gameplay, due to which they increased his salary up to $7 million by the end of his time with them. He collected around $11 million playing for the Knicks until 2010.\n\nSecondly, he played for the Golden State Warriors from the 2010-11 season to 2015, from which he made most of his earnings playing in the NBA.

He was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996. He became the fourth player to amass 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists over his 16-year NBA career.\n\nCharles Barkley, in full Charles Wade Barkley, bynames Sir Charles and the Round Mound of Rebound, (born February 20, 1963, Leeds, Alabama, U.S.), American professional basketball player and television personality whose larger-than-life character made him one of the most popular figures in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. Over the course of his 16-year NBA career, he became the fourth player to amass 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists.\n\nBarkley was a nondescript high school basketball player until a 6-inch (15-cm) growth spurt helped him become one of the better players in Alabama during his senior year and earn a scholarship to Auburn University. He was an all-conference selection in each of his three seasons at Auburn, and in 1984 he was chosen by the Philadelphia 76ers with the fifth overall pick of the NBA draft. Listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 metres) tall but by most accounts about 2 inches (5 cm) shorter, Barkley was very undersized for a forward, but his great leaping ability and his skill at establishing position around the basket using his considerable strength quickly made him one of the elite rebounders in the game. He made the first of 11 consecutive All-Star Game appearances in 1987, but the 76ers\u2019 success as a team was limited. With the exception of a run to the Eastern Conference finals during his rookie season (on a team led by future Hall of Famers Julius Erving and Moses Malone), Barkley and the 76ers never advanced farther than the second round of the play-offs during his eight seasons in Philadelphia. His inability to get the 76ers a championship led some to question whether he should be considered a truly elite player. Coupling this with Barkley\u2019s outspokenness, which made him unpopular with the team\u2019s front office, the team decided to trade him to the Phoenix Suns in 1992.\n\nBritannica Quiz NBA Postseason 2021 Quiz\n\nAfter helping the Suns post the NBA\u2019s best record in his first season with the team, Barkley won the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player award. In the following postseason he led the Suns to the NBA finals, a six-game loss to the Chicago Bulls. That season was the highlight of Barkley\u2019s tenure in Phoenix, and in 1996 he was traded to the Houston Rockets. He again had an immediate positive impact on a franchise, as the Rockets reached the conference finals in the 1996\u201397 season. However, Barkley failed to win his long-sought championship in Houston, and he retired in 2000.\n\nBarkley was a member of two U.S. men\u2019s basketball teams that won Olympic gold medals (1992, 1996). He was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nBarkley\u2019s postretirement fame arguably surpassed that of his playing days. Always a popular pitchman, he continued to appear in commercials for a wide variety of products after he last stepped off a court. But he was best-known as a commentator on an award-winning NBA studio show on the Turner Network Television cable channel and as a frequent talk show guest. Beginning with his years as a player, Barkley was never shy about expressing his opinions\u2014often with a large dose of humour\u2014which helped him create a persona that transcended the basketball world."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/athletes/michael-jordan", "page_content": "1963\u2013present\n\nWho Is Michael Jordan?\n\nMichael Jordan is a former professional basketball player, American Olympic athlete, businessperson, and actor.

Getty Images\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Jordan began his professional basketball career when he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984. He was the third overall pick, behind Hakeem Olajuwon, who was selected first by the Houston Rockets, and Sam Bowie, taken by the Portland Trail Blazers; the draft also featured legendary players John Stockton and Charles Barkley.\n\nJordan soon proved himself on the court. He helped the Bulls make the playoffs and scored an average of 28.2 points per game that season. For his efforts, Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and was selected for the All-Star Game.\n\nAlthough his second season was marred by injury, he broke new ground on the court during the 1986-87 season. He became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score more than 3,000 points in a single season. By the late 1980s, the Chicago Bulls were quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Jordan was an instrumental part of the team\u2019s success.\n\nThe Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1990 and won their first NBA championship the following year by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers. Jordan was well known by then for his superior athleticism on the court and for his leadership abilities.\n\nIn 1992, the Chicago Bulls beat the Portland Trail Blazers to win their second NBA championship. The team took their third championship the following year, dominating in the basketball world.\n\nFollowing the 1993 death of his father and a short stint in minor league baseball, Jordan returned to the basketball court and the Bulls in March 1995. He came back even stronger the following year, averaging 30.4 points per game to lead the Bulls to a then-record 72 regular-season wins before they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics for the NBA championship.\n\nChicago nearly matched the previous year\u2019s record with 69 wins in 1996-97, a season that ended with a Game 6 win over the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. The two teams faced each other again for the championship in 1998, with Jordan sinking the winning shot in Game 6 to claim his sixth and final title. In addition to those six rings, Jordan won each of his five league MVP awards with Chicago.\n\nAfter his second retirement from basketball in 1999, Jordan joined the Washington Wizards in 2000 as a part owner and as president of basketball operations. In the fall of 2001, Jordan relinquished these roles to return to the court once more. He played for the Wizards for his final two NBA seasons.\n\nJordan\u2019s Jersey Numbers\n\nJordan is most famous for donning No. 23 during the majority of his career. He once said the number was a reference to brother Larry, as it was roughly half of his elder sibling\u2019s high school number 45.\n\nJordan did wear 45 upon his 1995 return to the NBA because 23 was the number his late father knew him by, and he wanted a new beginning. That lasted only a couple months before Jordan switched back to 23 during the 1995 playoffs.\n\nJordan famously wore No. 12 for one game on February 14, 1990, because his jersey had been stolen. The Bulls didn\u2019t have a backup and tried to locate a 23 jersey in the stands that would fit Jordan but couldn\u2019t. The temporary change didn\u2019t affect his performance, as Jordan scored 49 points in a loss to the Orlando Magic.\n\nOlympics\n\nDuring the summer of 1984, Jordan made his first appearance at the Olympic Games as a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team. The team of college amateurs won the gold at the games that year, which were held in Los Angeles.\n\nJordan later helped the American team bring home the gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games, held in Barcelona, Spain.

He first stepped away on October 6, 1993, at age 30 to pursue a career in baseball following the death of his father. In July of that year, James was murdered when two teenagers shot him in his car in an apparent robbery as he was driving from Charlotte to Wilmington, North Carolina.

Getty Images\n\nIn a move that shocked many, after the end of the 1992-93 basketball season, Jordan announced his retirement from basketball to pursue baseball. For one year in 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, as an outfielder.\n\nThis decision came shortly following the murder of Jordan\u2019s father, who always wanted him to play baseball. He had last played baseball as a high school senior in 1981.\n\n\u201cYou tell me I can\u2019t do something, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nDuring his short career in baseball, which many fans considered a whim, Jordan had a rather dismal .202 batting average. However, many of the people who worked with him at the time an extremely dedicated player with potential.\n\n\u201cHe had it all: ability, aptitude, work ethic. He was always so respectful of what we were doing and considerate of his teammates. Granted, he had a lot to learn,\u201d former Barons manager . \u201cI do think with another 1,000 at-bats, he would\u2019ve made it. But there\u2019s something else that people miss about that season. Baseball wasn\u2019t the only thing he picked up. I truly believe that he rediscovered himself, his joy for competition. We made him want to play basketball again.\u201d\n\nAfter his season with the Barons, Jordan went to the Arizona Fall League to play for the Scottsdale Scorpions. After hitting .252 and naming himself the team\u2019s \u201cworst player,\u201d he returned to the NBA in March 1995 with a two-word press release: \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s Business Ventures\n\nOutside of his career in basketball, Jordan has been involved in a number of profitable business and commercial ventures, including a longtime partnership with Nike. Jordan signed his first deal with Nike in 1984. The company launched its signature Air Jordan basketball sneakers in 1985. In its initial contract, Nike gave Jordan a generous 25 percent in royalties.\n\nThe Air Jordan quickly proved very popular, and it continues to be a best-seller for the apparel maker more than 30 years later. The collaboration mints money for Nike and Jordan, with Nike reporting nearly $2.9 billion in revenue for the Air Jordan line in 2018.\n\nThe story of Jordan\u2019s partnership with Nike is the subject of the 2023 biographical drama Air, which stars Ben Affleck as Nike founder Phil Knight and Matt Damon as marketing executive Sonny Vaccaro.\n\nOver the years, Jordan has signed a number of other endorsement deals with brands like Hanes, Upper Deck, Gatorade, Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, Chevrolet, and Wheaties.

Designed to reflect Jordan\u2019s tastes and style, this typical steakhouse seated 150 and 60 at the bar, occupying 7,000 square feet in Grand Central Terminal, before closing in late 2018.\n\nAs of April 2023, there are four Michael Jordan\u2019s Steak House locations: in Chicago; in Oak Brook, Illinois; at the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut; and at the Ilani Casino in Ridgefield, Washington.\n\nPart Owner of the Charlotte Hornets\n\nIn 2006, Jordan bought a share of the Charlotte Hornets (formerly known as the Bobcats) and joined the team\u2019s executive ranks as its managing member of basketball operations. In 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets and serves as the team\u2019s chairman.\n\nImproving the team\u2019s less-than-stellar record seemed to be Jordan\u2019s priority. In November 2012, he told ESPN: \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate getting out of this business. My competitive nature is I want to succeed. It\u2019s always been said that when I can\u2019t find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it.\u201d While the Hornets\u2019 on-court record wasn\u2019t hugely successful\u2014they failed to make the playoffs six straight seasons from 2016 through 2022\u2014the organization has grown from a $175 million valuation in 2006 to $1.7 billion as of October 2022.\n\nIn March 2023, that Jordan was in talks to sell his majority stake in the franchise to a group led by two NBA minority owners.

The name is a reference to Jordan\u2019s basketball number and Hamlin\u2019s No. 11 race car.\n\nJordan is a longtime NASCAR fan and grew up watching legends of the sport like Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, and Dale Earnhardt. Hamlin is a Jordan brand athlete and fan of the Charlotte Hornets, so the two were friends before the NASCAR partnership.\n\nThe team debuted in the 2001 Daytona 500 with Bubba Wallace driving the No. 23 car. Wallace picked up the team\u2019s first NASCAR Cup victory later that season on October 4 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.\n\nThe team expanded to two cars for the 2022 season, with former champion Kurt Busch driving the No. 45 car.

Jordan Foundation, Keep Memory Alive, and Opportunity Village.\n\nThe four-day tournament and celebration attracted celebrity participants, including Wayne Gretzky, Michael Phelps, Chevy Chase, Samuel L. Jackson, and Mark Wahlberg.\n\nIn 2023, Jordan made a $10 million donation to the Make-A-Wish Foundation\u2014the largest by an individual in its history\u2014in honor of his 60th birthday.\n\nWives and Children\n\nIn 1989, Jordan married Juanita Vanoy.

Tiger Woods, Spike Lee, and Patrick Ewing, among other celebrities, reportedly attended the wedding ceremony. The couple welcomed twin daughters, Victoria and Ysabel, in February 2014.\n\nJordan and Juanita\u2019s two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, both played basketball in college and had dreams of making it to the NBA.\n\nJeffrey joined the basketball team at the University of Illinois in 2007. Both Jordan and his ex-wife, Juanita, supported their son and tried to help him deal with playing in the shadow of an NBA legend. \u201cThe thing that we have tried to tell Jeff is that you set your own expectations. By no means in this world can you ever live up to someone else\u2019s expectations of who you are,\u201d Jordan said during an appearance on the Today show.\n\nJeffrey played for the University of Illinois for three seasons, from 2007 to 2010. He then played for the University of South Florida for one season, from 2011 to 2012, before retiring from basketball. He later entered a management training program at Nike.\n\nJordan\u2019s younger son, Marcus, played basketball for the UCF Knights, for three seasons from 2009 to 2012.

Along with featuring archival footage of Jordan and interviews with teammates and opponents, The Last Dance explored the tension between the Bulls front office and its peerless superstar over his final triumphant year with the team.\n\nJordan has also appeared on the cover of the popular NBA 2K video game franchise four times, including as recently as 2022.\n\nA photograph of Jordan in tears during his 2009 induction into the Hall of Fame turned into a popular internet meme called \u201cCrying Jordan,\u201d in which Jordan\u2019s teary face is superimposed on pictures of other people suffering mishaps.\n\nQuotes\n\nYou have to expect things of yourself before you can do them.\n\nBy no means in this world can you ever live up someone else\u2019s expectations of who you are.\n\nMy competitive nature is I want to succeed. It\u2019s always been said that when I can\u2019t find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it.\n\nI\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of my career. I just feel that I don\u2019t have anything else to prove.\n\nI can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can\u2019t accept not trying.\n\nLimits, like fear, is often an illusion.\n\n[A]t the end of the day, the team\u2019s got to go out and play. I think the players win the championship, and the organization has something to do with it, don\u2019t get me wrong. But don\u2019t try to put the organization above the players.\n\nThe game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place I\u2019ve always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It\u2019s been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It\u2019s a relationship that has evolved over time, given me the greatest respect and love for the game.\n\nI try to be a role model for Black kids, white kids, yellow kids, green kids.\n\nEnjoy every minute of life. Never second-guess life.\n\nI always thought I would be a professional athlete. I always loved sports. I knew one thing I didn\u2019t want was a job. Me and working were never best friends. I enjoyed playing.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness. If you see something that doesn't look right, contact us!"}]}
