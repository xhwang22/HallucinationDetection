With over 17 000 pieces of concept art created to be replicated and brought to life for Prime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power fantasy drama series.\n\nNews24 sat down with the iconic book illustrator John Howe to discuss his work. He served as a chief conceptual designer for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and returned to work on The Hobbit films.\n\nAs the concept artist for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the illustrator says that Prime Video's latest visual venture into Middle-earth brings viewers \"another glimpse of an absolutely vast world\".\n\nWith The Rings of Power, set thousands of years before the events depicted in The Lord of the Rings, you and we as viewers get to go back to a re-envisioned Middle-earth where most of the civilisations are actually in their prime. The statues are whole; cities are gleaming and inhabited. How was it to work backwards to create concept designs to fill out what came before the remnants of what's left?\n\nThat's one of the most exciting parts of this excursion into the Second Age. We're no longer in the end of the Third Age where magic is leaving the world, and the Elves are leaving and everything.\n\nIt's like being at the end of autumn by the time we reach The Lord of the Rings, and for The Rings of Power, we're in spring and summer. As you just said, I think there's a vibrancy to this world that will go through some incredible events that are just on the horizon. That atmosphere that sentiment is what I hope The Rings of Power manages to capture.\n\nHow big and broad could you go? Were there limitations beforehand of what you could dream up, or what were the parameters you got from the producers, or did they tell you, \"John, go for it\"?\n\nThe best directors are the kind who say, \"don't worry about practicalities. Practicalities will come later on\".\n\nI think it's important to have a certain amount of freedom, especially at the beginning. It's really important to somehow create imagery which encompasses not only the scope but also the atmosphere of any universe. Whether that atmosphere is slightly melancholic or vibrant \u2013 whatever is in the air \u2013 is what you need to capture, and there are no limits when you start. The beginning of pre-production is a wonderful time because you can just dream up anything.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Prime Video\n\nN\u00famenor on an island as a kingdom of men is a setting we've never seen before. In The Rings of Power, it is majestic, but it's destined to be destroyed like Atlantis. What inspired that fabled setting and its design?\n\nIt's been a wonderful privilege to spend some time near the ocean in Middle-earth because, obviously, The Hobbit takes us nowhere near the sea, The Lord of the Rings only briefly, and here we're dealing with an island-nation, a maritime nation which is sending ships to the mainland. It's exciting and quite a different dynamic. The first season was filmed in New Zealand, and New Zealand has some of the most wonderful coastlines in the world. For me, it was a personal privilege to experience another glimpse of that and take that into the work.\n\nThey're both beautiful to me in their own right \u2013 the post-apocalyptic worlds where you see shards of what's left and try to imagine what used to be there in its splendour. Which one do you enjoy dreaming up and creating the most?\n\nOh, I'm a true romantic at heart, I'm afraid. I enjoy the whole notion of ruins, things that have disappeared, and civilisations that have passed. But I'm also very appreciative of every form of architecture, every form of decorative art, and every form of culture the world has to offer.\n\nOne of the things which I've tried to help bring in is this diversity of approach, this diversity of materials and textures and techniques. All of that hopefully contribute to a believable universe because we're really somewhere else. We're nowhere on Earth, and it's important that it in some form has credibility that we can relate to.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Prime Video\n\nHaving worked on all the other films, you didn't come in cold, and everything that came before informs what comes after. How did working on the films help you to envision the look of this next chapter of the story?\n\nIt's always a complex situation to deal with a point in time in a universe and then to go back in time in the same universe.\n\nI'm not a great believer in retro-design \u2013 in taking what was done and then trying to imagine what it was before. I prefer very much to go back to the original material, to go back to the sources that were the inspiration for the first excursion into this world, and then try to reimagine from those sources what it might have been like many thousands of years earlier. If my intuition is in any way correct, then, in theory, it will match. I really don't like taking what's been done before and working back. I'm not really a fan of that. I think it's better to, in a way, I shouldn't say \"abandon\", but to leave that where it is and try and imagine, reimagine, the same universe in an earlier time without \"owing\" anything to what was done before.\n\nThere are obviously, clearly, references and do need to be respected. That's obviously very important, but I think it would be an unwelcome restraint.\n\nDo you have a favourite \u2013 what do you enjoy more between drawing fantasy settings, cultural objects or creatures?\n\nI like them all! I really enjoy them all because they're all such different propositions. I love doing weapons and armour very much. I love drawing creatures. I like it all; I really do.\n\nI enjoy trying to create the visual details of a credible, non-existent culture from another time and another world. It's very exciting. What makes it work? What makes it fail? Those are things that are hard to define, but I've always found that if I can find half a dozen design elements for any culture I'm approaching and trying to imagine, then you can build a world from that.\n\nIt's very much that process I've been following since I've been designing for film. I like to do it; I shouldn't say \"slowly\" because everything needs to be done at a certain speed and a certain pace in the movies. But it is done with a lot of thought. It's almost like you could imagine being on a pilgrimage to a city where you can see it from far away. So you draw what you see. Then as you walk a bit closer, you draw what you see now, and you keep walking a bit closer. Each time you gain more detail and knowledge of where you're going. Then, when you're actually inside, you just look around, and you can draw it all!\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Prime Video\n\nWhat do you think will surprise viewers when they enter this visual world of Rings of Power for those who read the book and those who haven't?\n\nI don't know if I can even answer that! I hope that people will take this for what it is \u2013 it's another glimpse, I shouldn't say \"a modest glimpse\", but another glimpse of an absolutely vast world. After having worked on two trilogies \u2013 they barely scratched the surface of Middle-earth. There's still a huge amount to explore. This, to me, is an opportunity to open a window on a period of Middle-earth we haven't seen yet.\n\nSeason 1 of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is available to stream on Prime Video, with a new episode released every Friday.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://quillandpad.com/2020/09/10/how-to-train-a-dragon-jaquet-droz-collaborates-with-john-howe-lord-of-the-rings-and-the-hobbit-illustrator-and-conceptual-artist/", "page_content": "Quill & Pad\u2019s Joshua Munchow would say that watchmaking and sci-fi/fantasy easily appeal to the same kind of person. But Joshua is not the only member of the Quill & Pad team to find joy in two such seemingly disparate subjects: I too am a nerd at heart.\n\nWhich is why the announcement of Jaquet Droz collaborating with John Howe both pleased me and made me realize that the two fit together far better than I imagined. Starting with Jaquet Droz\u2019s past in making androids \u2013 perhaps the science fiction items par excellence of their day \u2013 this brand is about as creative as it gets in our traditionally minded world of horology.\n\nWho is John Howe?\n\nJohn Howe, the Canadian-born book illustrator and conceptual artist, is best known as one of two chief conceptual designers for the Lord of the Rings film trilogy by Peter Jackson and The Hobbit trilogy. He has also illustrated other items based on the timeless story by J.R.R. Tolkien and other well-known genre classics like Game of Thrones and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.\n\nA conceptual artist is responsible for the style and look of a film. His or her sketches aid producers, programmers, and 3D artists in understanding how sets should look and the vibe should feel. The conceptual artist\u2019s sketches are vital to the cohesive development of a feature-length film.\n\nBorn in Vancouver, 63-year-old Howe has lived in Neuch\u00e2tel for 30 years. He moved to Europe after graduating from high school, beginning with a university experience in Strasbourg.\n\nHowe is currently busy working on the upcoming Lord of the Rings television series for Amazon Studios \u2013 according to reports, set to become the most expensive TV series ever \u2013 which began shooting in New Zealand in February 2020. It is expected to stream in 2021.\n\nHowe keeps a rather low profile, so this collaboration with the imaginative La Chaux-de-Fonds-based brand is one that I find eminently exciting.\n\nThe Jaquet Droz dials, as we\u2019ve shown before, do lend themselves very well to artistic endeavors outside \u201cusual\u201d watchmaking. This turn toward the fantasy world could be an immensely exciting collaboration, and not just for nerds like me.\n\nJaquet Droz collaboration with John Howe\n\nHowe\u2019s collaboration with Jaquet Droz marks the first time that he has been approached by a fine watch brand. From reports, Howe worked alongside the brand\u2019s own artisans in the creation of an as-yet not-disclosed timepiece or timepieces.\n\nIt will be exciting to discover what magical, mysterious ideas pop up on the dial of the next Petite Heure Minute or Ateliers d\u2019Art models, which constitute my guesses as to the canvas of the future Howe masterpiece(s). I just hope we don\u2019t have to wait too terribly long to see them!\n\n\u201cThe craftsmen and designers at Jaquet Droz strive to bring together precision, poetry, and light in their meticulous work when it comes to materials and movements, something I particularly appreciate,\u201d Howe said. \u201cThe technical constraints further stimulated reflection and creativity. Collaborating with Jaquet Droz, renowned for its great creativity, proved to be challenging \u2013 but most of all, a real pleasure.\u201d\n\nFor more on John Howe, please visit www.john-howe.com.\n\nYou may also enjoy:\n\nJaquet Droz Petite Heure Minute Tiger: So Lifelike You Expect It To Leap From The Dial\n\nJaquet Droz Loving Butterfly Automaton: Millions Of Years In The Making\n\nJaquet Droz Magic Lotus Automaton: Zen Serenity On The Wrist\n\nAll About Automata: Mechanical Magic (With Action Videos)\n\nJaquet Droz\u2019s Charming Bird Deconstruction By The Naked Watchmaker (Plus Video)"}, {"url": "https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/John_Howe", "page_content": "\"I shan't call it the end, till we've cleared up the mess.\" \u2014 Sam\n\nThis article or section needs to be cleaned up to conform to a higher standard of article quality.\n\nJohn Howe Biographical information Born 21 August, 1957 Location Switzerland Website John-Howe.com\n\nJohn Howe is a Canadian illustrator most known for illustrating many works of J.R.R. Tolkien as well as working on both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series. Most recently he has worked as a concept artist for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power television series. [1]\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, Canada.[2] He graduated from the \u00c9cole des Arts D\u00e8coratifs of Strasbourg[2] in 1981, having obtained a Diploma in Illustration.[3] He now lives in Neuchatel with his wife Fataneh and his son Dana.[2]\n\nHowe first read The Lord of the Rings in high school, borrowing them from his school library. He started with The Two Towers, because \"everyone who started the first volume never got any further\" and The Fellowship of the Ring was rarely available to borrow.[4] He was inspired by artwork from The Brothers Hildebrandt to start creating illustration of Tolkien's works.[4]\n\nHowe's version of Boromir is based on his own face.[5]\n\nInvolvement in Peter Jackson's Middle-earth film series [ edit | edit source ]\n\nJohn Howe and Alan Lee worked as the chief conceptual designers on The Lord of the Rings trilogy.[6] Howe is also credited as a carpenter in the first two films.[6] [7] He has a cameo as one of the nine Kings of Men in the Prologue of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Howe and Lee returned to work as conceptual designers for The Hobbit film series. They both make an uncredited appearance as a men-musicians of Laketown in The Desolation of Smaug.[8]\n\nArtwork theft [ edit | edit source ]\n\nIn the night of 18 May 1997, 11 of Howe's originals were stolen from the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que of Sedan in Belgium. The thief's father contacted the M\u00e9diath\u00e8que a couple weeks later promising to try to retrieve the stolen works from his son. 8 originals were finally returned, one (Minas Tirith) was damaged beyond repair. \u00c9owyn and the Nazg\u00fbl, Gandalf the Grey, and The Uruk-hai were never recovered.[9]\n\nPublished Artwork [ edit | edit source ]\n\nHowe is one of HarperCollins' most used artists, and his cover art is frequently featured on translations as well.\n\nMultiple editions [ edit | edit source ]\n\nCalendars and books [ edit | edit source ]\n\n\"Illustrating Tolkien means treading warily, dipping one's brush in shadow and rinsing them in light.

He took on a variety of projects, but an invitation to join other artists in contributing to the 1987 and 1988 J R R Tolkien calendars changed his life. Admiring his approach to Tolkien, publishers then assigned Howe to illustrate books by Tolkien, as well as four additional Tolkien calendars (in 1991, 1995, 1997, and 2001). In 1997, when Peter Jackson began working on his three-part film version of The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955 3vols), Howe was hired to serve as the films' conceptual designer, also working as a carpenter on the films; he is now performing similar duties for Jackson's upcoming film trilogy based on The Hobbit (1937; rev 1951; rev 1966). His Tolkien artwork is not unlike that of his most famous predecessor, the Brothers Hildebrandt, though he is noted for his obsessive attention to detail in rendering medieval weaponry, contributing to the generally darker and more mature ambience of his paintings.\n\nOutside of his Tolkien-related work, Howe has done other book covers, almost exclusively for works of Fantasy, including books by Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, and David A Gemmell. However, he did paint impressive covers for two paperback volumes of Robert Silverberg's collected stories, Pluto in the Morning Light (coll 1992) and The Secret Sharer (coll 1993), interestingly juxtaposing imagery from sf and fantasy and suggesting that he might have enjoyed equal success had he specialized in sf.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earthFor other people with the same name, see John Howe.\n\nJohn Howe (born August 21, 1957) is a Canadian book illustrator and conceptual designer, best-known for his artwork of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. One year after graduating from high school, he studied in a college in Strasbourg, France, then at the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs in the same town.\n\nHowe and Tolkien artist Alan Lee served as chief conceptual designers for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. Howe illustrated the Lord of the Rings board game created by Reiner Knizia, and re-illustrated the maps of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion in 1996\u20132003. His work includes images of mythological material such as the Old English epic poem Beowulf (including Knizia's board game Beowulf: The Legend). Howe illustrated many books in the fantasy genre, such as those by Robin Hobb. He also contributed to the film adaptation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia. In 2005 a limited edition of George R. R. Martin's novel A Clash of Kings was released by Meisha Merlin, with numerous illustrations by Howe.\n\nHowe has illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game.\n\nFor The Hobbit films, original director Guillermo del Toro and replacement director Peter Jackson consulted with both Howe and fellow conceptual artist Alan Lee to ensure continuity of design.\n\nHowe is a member of the living history group the Company of Saynt George, and has expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments.\n\nHowe also served as a conceptual designer for Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which premiered on Prime Video on September 2, 2022.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Howe was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother's help. Around primary school age he found his mother's ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe's school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art cl*es full, and left him in cl*es like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology cl* though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for cl*mates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got \"a real spark\" from the Hildebrandt calendars, which showed him that the books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.\n\nWith Alexis Metzinger during filming John Howe in Strasbourg\n\nA year after his high school graduation, Howe moved to Strasbourg, France to attend college. The following year, he enrolled into the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:\n\nThe first year was spent not understanding much, the second at odds with what I did manage to understand, and the third eager to get out, although in retrospect I certainly owe whatever clarity of thought I possess to the patience of the professor of Illustration.\n\nThroughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was \"simultaneously ancient and novel.\" He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his \"The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-d\u00fbr\", a piece inspired by Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe's earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of \"his\" in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.\n\nProjects in which Howe worked include The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien's Books and Merchandise, Beowulf, Robin Hobb's books, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Cards for Magic: The Gathering, The Hobbit, Pan's Labyrinth. Howe has also written and illustrated children's books.\n\nSelected works\n\nThe Fisherman & His Wife , transl. from Brothers Grimm (Mankato, Minnesota: Creative Education, 1983).

It\u2019s a corker.\n\nHowe is, of course, a long-time Tolkien illustrator and is currently working with Alan Lee as Conceptual Designer for The Hobbit movie trilogy.\n\nMeet the man who remade Middle\u2011earth\n\nby Ethan Gilsdorf\n\nYou may not know John Howe, but you have probably visited his worlds.\n\nHowe is among the best-known illustrators of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s works. Since the 1990s, Howe has helped visualize Middle-earth by creating art for various bound editions of The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and other works. He also provided artwork for more obscure Tolkienania, such as calendars, posters, postcards, jacket art for the covers of audio editions and games and trading cards. Not only that, he\u2019s the man behind the pen for a variety of other fantasy art projects: Beowulf board games, Anne McCaffery book jackets, Magic: The Gathering cards, children\u2019s books, and folk tales such as Rip Van Winkle and Jack and the Beanstalk. Howe has also illustrated books on dragons, knights and \u201chow to\u201d instructional manuals for how to draw your own fantasy art.\n\nBut Howe\u2019s stature as a fantasy artist catapulted to new heights when Peter Jackson tapped him and Alan Lee, another prominent Tolkien illustrator, to serve as conceptual designers for his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jackson has said that even before he hired Howe, the illustrations that Howe drew of Gandalf (see banner image above), Bag End, the Balrog and the Nazg\u00fbl\u2019s flying beasts helped guide his vision for Middle-earth.\n\nToday, given the millions who have seen Jackson\u2019s films, Howe can be credited with irrevocably shaping how we see Tolkien\u2019s world on the screen, and in our imaginations. Someone had to design every dwarf axe, evil tower, hobbit mug, and orc prosthetic, and Howe had his hand in nearly every decision about Middle-earth\u2019s \u201clook and feel.\u201d\n\nPlus, thanks to the seemingly infinite production documentaries found in the Rings trilogy\u2019s Extended Edition DVDs, Howe has become somewhat of a celebrity\u2014at least among the ranks of those who care about the behind-the-scene scribblers, sword-forgers and model makers who work for the special effects house Weta Workshop and Jackson\u2019s fantasy empire down in Wellington, New Zealand. (Howe actually works for 3 Foot 7 Ltd., the New Zealand production company created by Warner Bros.) With his colleagues, Howe has brought new levels of fastidiousness to movie production design.\n\n\u201cJohn is highly productive,\u201d said Alan Lee about his office mate and artistic collaborator, \u201cproducing brilliant drawings in the brief periods when his turbo-charged metabolism allows him to sit still.\u201d\n\nThe tag-team of Howe and Lee moved back to Wellington when Jackson decided to adapt The Hobbit trilogy. The first installment, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, came out Christmas of 2012; film two, The Desolation of Smaug, hit theaters a year after that. When the \u201cExtended Edition\u201d of An Unexpected Journey was released last year, fans got an extra taste of Howe\u2019s magic touch. Expect the same sneak peeks into Howe\u2019s process when the extra dance mix version of film two comes likely comes out in October or November. Of course, there\u2019s also the final installment of the trilogy, now with the new title The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which arrives just over half a year from now, in December.\n\n[Read More]"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/ZJj8WYkbBRhQWgWgSZtk0C/fantasy-to-reality-the-designer-who-brought-tolkiens-middle-earth-to-the-screen", "page_content": "Most of the creature design was by Weta Workshop\u2019s team of six designers, closely supervised by Richard Taylor and Peter Jackson. I contributed a few drawings of Treebeard and Gollum and other denizens of Middle-earth but the more crucial part of the process was the production of large numbers of Plasticine models, culminating in a highly detailed figure \u2013 for Gollum \u2013 and a full-scale puppet version of Treebeard\u2019s head and shoulders, or the forks and branches that make up that part of his anatomy.\n\nI have no doubt that it won\u2019t be long before the actor behind a digital character is awarded an Oscar\n\nThese were both at Hobbit scale, or the size they would appear to us if we were hobbits, so that the actors playing Merry and Pippin \u2013 Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd \u2013 could be filmed sitting among the branches and conversing with the Ent who has just rescued them.\n\nAs soon as an approved design model is made, work begins on creating the digital version. The model is scanned, which gives an accurate, though not very high resolution CG model. This forms the basis for the very simplified versions used for pre-visualizing all the animated sequences, essentially animated story-boarding, and these will go through many iterations before becoming a definitive guide, both to the shooting crew and to the animators.\n\nThe animators will use either motion capture of a performer covered with tracking markers, or key-frame animation, or a combination of the two. In the case of Andy Serkis\u2019 ground-breaking portrayal of Gollum, the whole process went through an evolution from simple rotoscoping (replacing a filmed image of the performer with a matching animated one) to trying to capture every detail of the actor's performance and facial expressions.\n\nThere has been some controversy over how much of the finished scenes is the work of the animators and how much the work of the performer, but having witnessed the incredible work of both I have no doubt that it won\u2019t be long before the actor behind a digital character is awarded an Oscar.\n\nThe Creatures department at Weta Digital was responsible for turning the design of the characters into something that could move convincingly, with digital bones, fat and muscles.\n\nTreebeard had to be able to move without breaking into pieces, which raises the question of how flexible his bark should be. To avoid him looking too rubbery, the bark was separated into plates secured onto a more flexible subcutaneous layer, and moss, ivy and ferns added for cosmetic effect.\n\nThousands of hours are spent creating and nuancing all the elements in one figure and much of this process was far too technical for me to even begin to understand. At various points along the way, all the code is sent to 'The Render Wall' to be processed into something that can be viewed as a work in progress. It isn\u2019t unusual for this to happen well over a hundred times before the shot is finalized. The whole process was overseen by Jim Rygiel and Joe Letteri.\n\nMy role during this part of the production was to produce artwork, mainly in Photoshop, as a guide for the compositors who are creating the finished shots. It is a quick way for Peter to be able to communicate what he would like to see. He will hand over the shots as he edits the film, and give a brief description of what he is looking for \u2013 many of the shots are of actors against a green screen \u2013 and artwork will be sent for his approval a couple a days later.\n\nThe fact that I had played a part in conceiving and designing the sets and miniatures enabled a degree of continuity and realism which helped to ground the film in a believable world. On a film set in a historical period, the design process would start with the accumulation of large amounts of reference material, but when the film is set in an imaginary world that material needs to be generated by conceptual designers."}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHowe", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHowe\n\nGo To\n\nJohn Howe (born August 21, 1957) is a Canadian book illustrator and conceptual designer.\n\nIn his youth, he was influenced by the works Frank Frazetta and Brothers Hildebrandt, which helped him discover his own style of artwork.
