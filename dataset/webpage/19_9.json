However, it does not capture all details of a performance; elements such as the communication by body language, gestures, and facial expression will be missing from the recording. Furthermore, the experience of performing for a recording can be significantly different from a live performance. The suspense of performing in front of an audience is missing, and no interaction with the audience is possible. There is also the recording process itself that may impact the performance: the musicians can perform a piece of music, listen to the recorded result, and discuss and possibly adapt their performance. The pianist Glenn Gould describes the advantages of this process [44.6]:\n\nBy taking advantage of the post-taping afterthought, however, one can very often transcend the limitations that performance imposes upon the imagination.\n\nThe production team may also influence the performance by pointing out technical necessities and by making suggestions on how to better convey musical thoughts over the medium.\n\nSince the introduction of multitrack recording machines, each instrument or instrument group can be recorded separately on its own track. After the first analogue multitrack machines were released in the 1950s (e. g., Ampex 8-track), the number of tracks increased over the decades; digital multitrack tape machines were released in the late 1970s and early 1980s with a number of tracks between 24 and 32, followed by the cassette-based recorders Alesis ADAT and Tascam DA-88 in the 1990s. Both the ADAT and the DA-88 allowed one to sync several machines up to an overall limit of 128 simultaneous tracks. Modern digital audio workstations (GlossaryTermDAW s) have no restriction with respect to the maximum number of tracks. In the context of classical music, multitrack recordings are primarily used to allow for postprocessing of the recording by adjusting the level and equalization of individual tracks. In the case of popular music, however, multitrack recording not only offered enhanced postproduction options but it transformed the way music is recorded: instead of recording all musicians of a band simultaneously, the sound engineers could record individual instruments at different times and possibly different places. This process is not applicable to all styles of music, but its implications for the performance are noteworthy; not only have the musicians lost the communication with the audience, but they are not even able to communicate with each other during the recording session. Musicians who have never met can perform together by sending the recording to a different studio and record the next musician at a different time and a different place.\n\nIt has also been argued that the process of recording and the public availability of recordings can influence long-term performance strategies and trends. For example, Mark Katz points out that the increased use of vibrato at the begin of the twentieth century coincides with the increasing availability of the gramophone. He makes a compelling argument that this change in performance style was motivated and triggered by the growing popularity of the gramophone [44.7]. Katz lists three reasons for the violinists to increase their vibrato usage for a recording:\n\n1. It allowed the violin to be more perceptible on early recordings with limited dynamic range and poor transfer characteristics. 2. It helped to obscure imperfect intonation which is more likely to be noticeable on a recording than in a live setting. 3. It might enhance the artist's presence in order to compensate for the missing visual cues in a concert situation.\n\nThe so-called crooning is another example of the inter-relation of technology and performance styles. Crooning was a popular singing style in the 1930s to the 1950s that created a personal atmosphere by singing at a low volume. The vocals could only carry over the accompanying band or orchestra by means of amplification of the microphone signal. Singers such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra used this technique to create intimacy between audience and singer.\n\n1.1 Recording Perfection\n\nTechnological innovations and improvements increased the sonic quality of recording and reproduction equipment continuously throughout the 20th century. The most notable quality improvements were probably a) the transition from an acoustic to an electric way of recording by means of the condenser (also: capacitor) microphone (1920s: [44.8]), b) the possibility to make high-quality recordings on tape (1940s), and c) the introduction of digital means for recording, processing, editing, storing, and distributing music (1970s\u20131990s).\n\nThese general improvements in audio quality are an unsurprising and foreseeable technological evolution. However, it was less foreseeable how technological possibilities would influence the musical content itself. It has been observed that the level of perfection of recorded music performances has been continuously increasing over the last century [44.9]. The main reason is probably that a recording, unlike a live performance, can be listened to repeatedly and is preserved for a long time. Even a minor imperfection or performance nuance, barely noteworthy in a live setting, can become an annoying artifact. The technical flawlessness of a studio recording may, in some ways, compensate for the missing live concert experience.\n\nEditing (or splicing) a recording is an aspect of the postproduction process that originated in the 1940s and 1950s. While in early recording sessions the artist had to perform the whole piece for the recording process and repeat this until satisfaction was obtained, technological development opened up new ways of dealing with nonoptimal recordings. After the introduction of the first tape machines it was soon discovered that the tape could be split and joined together. This allowed for merging two or more recordings of the same piece of music; a section with a small mistake could easily be replaced with another recording of this section from the same recording session. The advent of digital processing allowed an unprecedented level of editing; Weinzierl and Franke presented evidence that the amount of edit points increased by a factor of two to three with the introduction of digital editing stations such as the Sony DAE-1100 and digital audio workstations (DAWs) [44.10]. It is a valid assumption that modern productions make even more extensive use of the possibilities of splicing and joining of two or more recordings at virtually any position; hundreds of edit points can be expected in such a modern production. Note that the editing process not only involves removing errors and mistakes from the recording \u2013 the editor essentially has the power to select and merge takes according to his own artistic taste. This choice does not necessarily reflect the musical intentions of the artists, although it is common for the artists to give final approval of an edited recording.\n\nThe modern postproduction process offers more options to change a recording. Traditionally, these modifications were restricted to changing the sound quality by using equalization or adding artificial reverberation and (passively or actively) modifying the dynamic variation or the level relationships between instruments. Newer digital tools, however, allow more drastic changes of the music content. For instance, technologies such as time-stretching (changing the tempo without changing the pitch) and pitch-shifting (changing the pitch without changing the tempo) allow detailed modifications of the (micro-)tempo and the pitch in order to correct or modify intonation and timing. The final, published recording thus evolves more and more from the plain reproduction of one recording studio performance to a new performance with a level of technical perfection hard to match in a live context.\n\n1.2 Recording Authenticity\n\nThroughout the last century the music industry put significant effort into marketing records as a realistic medium which is indistinguishable from the live concert experience [44.11]. However, listeners realized early on that playing recorded music does in fact not result in the same experience as a live concert. In the early days of recording, one important factor was clearly the quality of the recording and reproduction systems. To give an example, the dynamic range of the recording devices was limited which meant that instrumentalists had to minimize the dynamic range of their performance or continuously change the distance from the recording device to adjust for the correct level. The quality-related restrictions such as insufficient dynamic range, added noise, and added distortion disappeared with improved recording technology and better storage media. However, while research in virtual acoustics led to recording and reproduction methods that enabled a listening experience that was practically indistinguishable from a live setting [44.12], the standard consumer reproduction technologies (e. g., stereo, 5.1) are unable to reproduce this concert experience.\n\nSince the consumer's normal listening environment is fundamentally different from a live concert setting, it is doubtful that even an accurate physical reproduction of the sound field would be perceived by the listener as realistic. Therefore, the sound engineer's goal is usually not to create a realistic reproduction, but a recording that is perceived as realistic and thus implies realism. This has been referred to as the concept of artificial realism [44.13].\n\nIt has also been argued that, because of limitations in the listening environment, the recording is not even supposed to be as realistic as possible. To give an example, the dynamic range of symphonic recordings is usually reduced to allow a comfortable listening experience \u2013 to reproduce the whole dynamic range of an orchestra would result in the listener constantly adjusting the playback level. The musically informed adjustment of the level of single instruments and instrument groups by the sound engineer may compensate for the missing visual component and probably allows for a better, more transparent listening experience.\n\nSimilar to the discussion of realism in classical music, there has been a debate about authenticity in popular music as well [44.14]. The controversy is about the use of new technologies to produce or postprocess recordings and the utilization of new effects and sounds versus a plain recording made with as few technological gadgets as possible. Alex Ross comments on this discussion [44.15]:\n\nYet frills-free, low-fi recording has no special claim on musical truth; indeed, it easily becomes another phonograph effect, the effect of no effect.\n\n1.3 Changes in the Recording Studio Sector\n\nThe changes in the recording studio sector are well aligned with technological innovation. Leyshon summarizes the different stages of historical development [44.16]: during the 1930s and 1940s, studios were built by the major labels with custom-designed and unique equipment. The introduction of the tape machine in the 1940s made the recording process less expensive and triggered the establishment of new, privately owned recording studios in the 1950s. Digital audio technology disrupted the recording studio market twice: first, with the introduction of digital studio hardware for recording and processing offering a sonic quality and functionality at the same or a higher level than comparable analogue hardware at a fraction of the price. Second, with software applications offering to replace most of the studio hardware (except microphones and speakers) at affordable prices. Essentially, computer software is able to replace the tape machine, patch bay, mixing console, sound generators and synthesizers, and external audio effects. Although analogue studio equipment continues to be used for its special sound characteristics, virtually every modern music production will use software; for some genres, music may be produced exclusively by using software.\n\nThere is a general trend for high-quality audio technology, previously only available to specialists at high prices to become more easily available and affordable to nonprofessionals and hobbyists. The price drop is not only observable between hardware and software, but also in the software market itself. To give one example, the sales price of Apple's DAW Logic Pro dropped from $999 to $499 and then to today's price of $199 between 2004 and 2011. Similar price developments can be observed for professional-grade audio plugins. This democratizes the recording market by decoupling audio quality from the budget invested into the studio equipment.\n\nFor the music (software) industry, however, this presents a problem due to decreasing revenue. As a result, new distribution models are being evaluated. Current trends, possibly influenced by the rise of the mobile app market, include consumer versions of software targeted at professionals at low prices and profit generation through sales of additional content such as audio loops. Software-as-a-Service solutions are not yet popular in the consumer market, but are starting to gain traction in the business-to-business market with companies such as EchoNest (now part of Spotify), Gracenote, and sonicAPI.com."}, {"url": "https://blabbermouth.net/news/whitesnakes-reb-beach-has-no-problems-with-certain-artists-using-pre-recorded-tracks-during-live-performances", "page_content": "WHITESNAKE and WINGER guitarist Reb Beach says that he has \"no problems\" with certain rock and pop artists relying on pre-recorded tracks during their live performances.\n\nIn recent years, more and more bands have been given a pass for using backing tracks, drum triggers and other assorted technology that makes concerts more synthetic but also more consistent.\n\nAsked by Antihero Magazine if he feels that a reliance on backing tracks is enhancement or cheating, Beach said: \"All of us are getting old. A little help is okay with me. As long as it sounds great out there, that's what you want and to see the performers. I have no problems with some enhancements up there. David [Coverdale, WHITESNAKE singer] does; David refuses to use any of that stuff. And WINGER's been talking about it: 'Boy, wouldn't it be fun to get some background vocal running in Pro Tools behind the drum kit?' Or have Rod [Morgenstein, WINGER drummer] get some samples of background vocals, you know, 'cause back in the '80s, we did these huge productions of vocals. And also, it's not like THE ROLLING STONES, where 'I can't get no\u2026', [where] it's just talk-singing. But with us, with WINGER and WHITESNAKE, that stuff is high to sing when you're 60 years old, so you've gotta do things like lower the key, change the key and things. David said he'll never use any kind of recordings.\"\n\nOne musician who has been open about his band's used of taped vocals during live performances is M\u00d6TLEY CR\u00dcE bassist Nikki Sixx, who recently said: \"We've used technology since '87.\" He added the group employed \"sequencers, sub tones, background vox tracks, plus background singers and us. [M\u00d6TLEY CR\u00dcE also taped] stuff we can't tour with, like cello parts in ballads, etc.... We love it and don't hide it. It's a great tool to fill out the sound.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview, M\u00d6TLEY CR\u00dcE guitarist Mick Mars admitted that he wasn't comfortable with the fact that his band used pre-recorded backing vocals in its live shows, claiming that he preferred to watch groups whose performances are delivered entirely live.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" he said. \"I think a band like ours\u2026 I have to say '60s bands were my favorite \u2014 '60s and '70s bands \u2014 because they were real, like, three-piece bands or four-piece bands, and they just got up there and kicked it up. Made a mistake? So what? Sounded a little bit empty here or there? So what? It's the bigness and the rawness and the people that developed and wrote the songs and made them and presented them. To me, that's what I really like. I mean, I could put on a M\u00d6TLEY CD and play with it all day long. I don't wanna do that.\"\n\nKISS lead singer Paul Stanley, who has been struggling to hit the high notes in many of the band's classic songs for a number of years, has been accused of singing to a backing tape on KISS's recently launched \"End Of The Road\" tour.\n\nBack in 2015, KISS bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons slammed bands who used backing tapes for not being honest enough to include that fact on their concert tickets.\n\n\"I have a problem when you charge $100 to see a live show and the artist uses backing tracks,\" Simmons said. \"It's like the ingredients in food. If the first ingredient on the label is sugar, that's at least honest. It should be on every ticket \u2014 you're paying $100, 30 to 50 percent of the show is [on] backing tracks and they'll sing sometimes, sometimes they'll lip sync. At least be honest. It's not about backing tracks, it's about dishonesty.\n\n\"There's nobody with a synthesizer on our stage, there's no samples on the drums, there's nothing,\" Gene continued. \"There's very few bands who do that now \u2014 AC/DC, METALLICA, us. I can't even say that about U2 or THE [ROLLING] STONES. There's very few bands who don't use (backing) tracks.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/arts/music/classical-music-orchestra-improvisation.html", "page_content": "The improvising composer-performers Henry Threadgill and Anthony Davis have been among the winners of the Pulitzer Prize for music in the last five years.

Paul studied at Berklee College of Music, is a columnist for such magazines as Modern Drummer and Sick Drummer Magazine and he has most recently drummed for the hit musical Rock of Ages.\n\nOfficial statement from Trivium: (taken from Trivium\u2019s website in 2015)\n\nWe are writing this to let you all know that Trivium has amicably parted ways with Mat Madiro as our drummer.\n\nMat stepped up for us at a dire moment where it was either leave a tour, or carry on. With Mat, we will forever be eternally grateful of everything he helped us out with. Mat\u2019s time filling in for us was much appreciated.\n\nCreatively though, we felt at this time we needed to make a change. And every change, every difficult decision and every evolution that Trivium has either decided, or been forced to make has been for the necessary for us to continue on as a functioning band. The things that go on behind the scenes that directly involve the Trivium members aren\u2019t always apparent from an outside fan\u2019s perspective.\n\nWith that said our new drummer is Paul Wandtke from Chicago,IL. With Paul, we took our careful time deciding exactly what had to happen and how.\n\nWe spent our time checking out, trying out and feeling out many drummers this time around. After much deliberation, Paolo said to Matt one day \u201cyou should hit up John Petrucci and see if he has an ideas.\u201d We figured our friend John may have some ideas from the Berklee-world.\n\nJohn brought Mike Mangini into the conversation and within minutes of describing our conundrum to Mike, he had a name: Paul Wandkte. Paul studied under Mike at Berklee, and obviously made an impression on a man we consider to be one of the greatest drummers on the planet.\n\nPaul made his debut with us in thunderous fashion this past weekend by playing to 40,000 fans at Knotfest Mexico. And he nailed it. We hope to work with Paul for a long time and we hope the Trivium fans around the world welcome him with open arms.\n\nSays Paul, \u201cI was blown away when Trivium had contacted me. I have been looking for a place to call home all my life, a home of brothers with similar tastes in music, musicianship and goals. I\u2019d like to thank Dream Theater\u2019s Mike Mangini for getting us in contact. I couldn\u2019t be happier, this is literally life changing.

Whether a band leader is on stage or not, Paul makes sure to deliver a groove so inviting that the whole ensemble and audience is having a blast.\n\nPaul is slowly becoming the who\u2019s who in the industry having been to over 45 countries as a work for hire drummer and by receiving endorsements by some of the world\u2019s top brands and manufacturing companies. On top of drumming, he\u2019s recently launched an original music project called Dead Original. Check out Dead Original at www.deadoriginalmusic.com\n\nPaul was born and raised in Chicago , IL and began his drumming career at the age of eleven by performing around Chicago with numerous rock, punk and metal groups. Most notable while residing in Chicago is that early in 06\u2032 Paul collaborated/rehearsed with members of the band including frontman EDSEL DOPE and lead guitarist Virus in hopes of a new side project but the concept of the new group exhausted. Paul has performed/recorded in all types of musical settings including jazz, latin, blues, progressive rock, electronica, fusion, dance, punk, ska, musical theatre, but is best known as a rock/metal drummer.\n\nMagazine Lessons:\n\nPaul is a freelance lesson contributor for drum magazines such as Sick Drummer Magazine and Modern Drummer Magazine. He just wrapped up a six-lesson series with SD magazine covering topics about the importance of reading drum notation and he just submitted a 1,500 word article to Modern Drummer tentatively titled \u201cDrum soloing in the live rock/metal context\u201d which will be published very shortly. Paul also is an avid drum instructor both when he\u2019s not on the road and via Skype.\n\nCruise Ships:\n\nIn the past, between school and other events Paul would often be found on the waters playing for cruise ships. For instance, Paul was the showband drummer for Carnival Cruise line\u2019s \u201cCarnival Conquest Orchestra\u201d. The Orchestra performed a total of six nights a week in the Toulouse Lautrec theatre. The shows included three Production Shows, two Big Band Sets and one excellent Motown set. The Toulouse Lautrec theatre holds over 1100 people, and the Conquest Orchestra performed two sets every night and that\u2019s a total of 2200 people that would watch the group and Paul perform.\n\nSchools:\n\nPrior to his studies at Berklee, Paul has studied percussion at the Joliet Junior College (an accredited school of NASM)and received his Associate in Arts from JJC. During percussion ensemble performances, Paul would often times be featured as a soloist artist on various percussion instruments including the xylophone, marimba, and timpani. Paul understands that both drum set and percussion can go hand in hand, that\u2019s why he has studied both art forms.\n\nDuring his tenure at Berklee Paul studied privately with Rod Morgenstein (Dixie Dreggs, Winger). Check out Rod\u2019s personal thoughts of Paul\u2019s playing at www.paulwandtke.com. Other teachers that Paul studied with are Mike Mangini, Skip Hadden, Bob Tamagni, Larry Finn, David Weigert, and Tony Thunder Smith.\n\nFor Hire (if time allows):\n\nTo find out what Paul can do for your project, then check out www.paulwandtke.com/studio-work.

While being able to reestablish the same sound an artist may have worked hard to establish on past releases is promising, it\u2019s understandable that at the same time, a lack of progression or an interruption in the natural pattern of advancement can be frustrating\u2013for both the artist and the listener. American Me\u2019s III finds itself in the midst of this quandary. While it picks up right where the band\u2019s previous efforts left off, packed with crushing heaviness and contagiously catchy beatdown, there is little tangibly new aspects to the dynamic American Me have already established and used nearly to death.At it\u2019s core, III is an anvil-like juggernaut of metallic hardcore and beatdown. Fueled by political distrust and misanthropy, American Me have created a steam-roller of a release which, once it gets started, cannot be stopped. At the heart of the album, the drums maintain a heavy, deep pounding laden with furiously fast fills and drop-of-a-dime dives into skull-collapsing breakdowns. The heavy, low end provided by the drums is dog-piled upon by both guitars and bass work, which rarely rises from the subterranean depths at which they operate. All three of these elements combine to create a viciously heavy and in-your-face beatdown feel, with just enough technicality behind the drums and just enough occasional groove in the guitars to provide a metallic feel. While the instrumentation is a solid, driving factor, American Me\u2019s real power comes from the visceral vocals and their volatile lyrics.American Me use their vocals and lyrics to paint misanthropic, sociopathic and politically fueled images across their violent, devastating instrumentation. \u201cSubmissioner,\u201d III\u2019s second single featuring The Acacia Strain and Shut In\u2019s Vincent Bennett is a thriving display of such an endeavor. While the lyrics are not fundamentally poetic, they are a well-organized and straightforward carrier for the hate and strife American Me aim to deliver. \u201cSon of a Machine Gun pt. III\u201d and \u201cNarcota Night Life\u201d are two more short, intense bursts of vocally-driven anger and anguish which nicely summarize III\u2019s purpose as a whole: a short, furious, to-the-point skull-crusher of an album which punishes the listener before they can even realize what it is that hit them.\n\nWhile III has a simple goal, and achieves it readily, it isn\u2019t without it\u2019s shortcomings\u2013the most notable of which being just that. It\u2019s an incredibly brief album. While it\u2019s short length prevents the onset of the ever-popular plague of monotony, the incredible number of supporting vocalists and immense variation of track lengths already serves as an apt deterrent to boredom. Clocking in at a little over twenty two minutes, there is just no other way around it: American Me\u2019s III, while a whirlwind of a release, still leaves the listener wanting. III\u2019s other pitfall comes in the form of stagnancy, and really only applies to fans of Heat and Siberian Nightmare Machine. American Me have a tried and true formula of quick, hard-hitting beatdown-influenced hardcore: and while they certainly haven\u2019t backslid with it, they aren\u2019t taking much in the way of new ground, either. For all the time it took for their latest album to come to realization, there isn\u2019t an enormous defining factor to separate it from their past releases. III is more of the same, even if \u201cthe same\u201d is just what the listener might be looking for.\n\nSo while it isn\u2019t a step or a leap for hardcore-kind, American Me\u2019s III is a punctual, break-neck maelstrom of anger and chaos that\u2019s sure to cure beatdown boredom. Loaded with visceral vocals, vicious lyrics, and intense, pummeling instrumentation, American Me provide a distinctly\u2026well, American take on the metal-infused hardcore that might not be food for the mind, but is definitely fuel for the mosh.\n\nFor Fans Of: Shinto Katana, It Prevails, Shai Hulud, The Acacia Strain\n\nBy: Connor Welsh/Eccentricism\n\nshow more\u2026\n\nAmerican Me \u2013 Heat (Review) \u2013 Sputnik\n\nReview Summary: Its so easy to differentiate between acts in such a flooded scene. All it takes is for everyone to stop bullshitting and make room for those who matter.\n\nAmerican Me showcase a refreshing listen in a crowded scene of intense hardcore. Although Rise Records has let loose a dozen new releases in the last few months of the same demeanor (Recon, For The Fallen Dreams, ADBOK), American Me sneaks in with a punishing 19 minutes of raw carnage.\n\nThe tough-guy hardcore on this debut is evidently in the vein of its predecessors. However, avoiding the chug-oriented masses in recent months, the group delivers a fresh approach to aggressive beat-downs. \u201cAttribute Of The Strong\u201d welcomes the listener to the field of American Me with a balanced groove and a solid assault on the ears. The rough production automatically triggers interest avoiding the polished production of current Zeuss-produced-quality-deathcore. Although quality production should never be shunned, nu-metal quality in hardcore (recent releases such as \u201cThe Respect Issue\u201d and White Chapel\u2019s \u201cThis Is Exile\u201d come to mind) is often distracting since the majority of the album revolves around pro-tools and leaves the weight of creativity for the computer. \u201cHeat\u201d proves American Me to be in full attendance and no overdubbed gang shouts and explosive analog bass are going to shadow the bands debut.\n\nThe musicianship of the quintet is as tight as any other band that spends 10+ months of the year on tour. Full of surprise squealers and guitars bending over backwards alternating from left to right, going back and forth by Phil and Brian Blade, the duo is able to showcase chemistry that hasn\u2019t been felt or heard since Converge\u2019s Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton premiered their home video footage on \u201cThe Long Road Home.\u201d A connection such as this develops only through time, shared experience, and an understanding focus of one common goal: CREATE PASSIONATE HARDCORE.\n\nThe lyrical content on \u201cHeat\u201d should also be made note of. With emo-psychology seeping into the seams of acts such as Misery Signals, Sky Eats Airplane, and yes, even Bury Your Dead, American Me is able to distance itself from the pack and derive its influence from a variety of topics. \u201cSaid Nothing Began Firing\u201d is a perfect example that\u2019s based on an ancient office shooting ala-Wild, Wild, West style. Tony Tataje\u2019s capability to churn out bellow after bellow shocks even the most advanced listener.\n\nComing in at just above 20 minutes there\u2019s hardly enough time to conceptualize the effort. With each song clocking at or below two minutes its great to see the tracks roll one by one into a snowball masterpiece. From the contagious strolls through tough-guy city and into the depths of DUI HXC, American Me have a terrific tendency to leave a mark.\n\nshow more\u2026\n\nAmerican Me, It Prevails tour (Europe) \u2013 Lambgoat\n\nAmerican Me, It Prevails, and Give em Blood are touring Europe this summer.\n\nDates Include:\n\n07/27 Martin, SVK @ Wlesefest\n\n07/30 Stuttgart, GER @ Juha West\n\n07/31 Mechelen, BEL @ Kamikaze\n\n08/01 London, UK @ Barfly\n\n08/02 Kent, UK @ Hevy Fest\n\n08/03 York, UK @ Ous Fest\n\n08/08 Bologna, ITA @ Freakout Club\n\n08/10 Gleisdorf, AUT @ Kulturkeller\n\n08/13 Poznan, POL @ Pod Minoga\n\n08/14 Berlin, GER @ Miks\n\n08/15 Kaiserslauter, GER @ Kramladen\n\n08/16 Essen, GER @ Opium\n\n08/18 Arhus, DNK @ Backstage\n\n08/19 Oslo, NOR @ The Revolver\n\n08/20 Stockholm, SWE @ Debaser\n\n08/21 G\u00f6teborg, SWE @ Sticky Fingers\n\n08/22 Hamburg, GER @ Logo\n\n08/23 Wolfsburg, GER @ Juha Ost\n\n08/24 Dessau, GER @ Destruction Derby\n\nshow more\u2026\n\nAllInMerch, MetalSucks & Metal Injection Proudly Present THE ACACIA STRAIN\u2019s No Way Out Tour \u2013 Metal Injection\n\nWe are so excited to be teaming up with our homies at MetalSucks and the fine folks at AllInMerch.com to present to you quite the killer tour package\u2026The No Way Out tour featuring The Acacia Strain and on select dates Within The Ruins, Xibalba, Fit For An Autopsy and American Me.

Featuring members of prominent Portland area bands like American Me, Arsonists Get All The Girls, Those Who Lie Beneath, Across the Sun, and Sacrificer, the collective performed a benefit show which raised a whopping $2,000 for The Ghost Inside. Earlier this year, they did another show, this time in honor of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, which managed to raise $2,300 for The American Foundation For Suicide Prevention. Whether or not you appreciate the bands for which these musicians are best known, you can\u2019t deny that this has been an excellent use of their status in the music community.\n\nAs of today, the Rose City Collective is no longer limiting its fundraising efforts to benefit shows: they\u2019ve recorded a seven-track tribute to Chris Cornell, featuring covers of such Soundgarden classics as \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d and \u201cOutshined,\u201d and will donate 100% of the proceeds, once again, to The American Foundation For Suicide Prevention. I say again: not a single penny is going into the pockets of these musicians. In a statement, the group says \u201cwe felt it was our civic duty to make this record.\u201d There\u2019s absolutely nothing in it for them, other than the satisfaction of helping those who need help.\n\nIncidentally, the album is really good. Personally, I\u2019m especially fond of the \u201cPretty Noose\u201d cover, which utilizes female vocals and speedy double-kick drums to inject some new life into an old gem.\n\nI strongly encourage you to buy the album, which is just five bucks.

The band was formed in 2006 and signed with Rise Records in late 2007 releasing three full length albums to date. The music is often described as \u201cbrutal hardcore\u201d and is known for its fast pace and heavy sound.\n\nThe band\u2019s first studio album, Heat, was released in 2008. The album received praise from reviewers for exhibiting a unique, heavier style of hardcore punk, combining hardcore punk and heavy metal with a slight hip hop edge.
