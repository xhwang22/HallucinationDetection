Lee Strobel\n\nLee Strobel wasn't always a Christian writer, in fact, Lee Strobel wasn't always a Christian. He was an atheist who set out as a journalist to make a piece about how the Christian faith was ridiculous but found compelling evidence that led him to the Lord himself. Lee is now one of the leading men in the Christian writing community and a very motivational personality for others to be inspired by. His most notable books are \"The Case For Christ\", and \"The Case For Faith.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are all terrific choices for authors when looking for a good read.

Forster, in full Edward Morgan Forster, (born January 1, 1879, London, England\u2014died June 7, 1970, Coventry, Warwickshire), British novelist, essayist, and social and literary critic. His fame rests largely on his novels Howards End (1910) and A Passage to India (1924) and on a large body of criticism.\n\nForster\u2019s father, an architect, died when the son was a baby, and he was brought up by his mother and paternal aunts. The difference between the two families, his father\u2019s being strongly evangelical with a high sense of moral responsibility, his mother\u2019s more feckless and generous-minded, gave him an enduring insight into the nature of domestic tensions, while his education as a dayboy (day student) at Tonbridge School, Kent, was responsible for many of his later criticisms of the English public school (private) system. At King\u2019s College, Cambridge, he enjoyed a sense of liberation. For the first time he was free to follow his own intellectual inclinations; and he gained a sense of the uniqueness of the individual, of the healthiness of moderate skepticism, and of the importance of Mediterranean civilization as a counterbalance to the more straitlaced attitudes of northern European countries.\n\nBritannica Quiz Matching Names to Novels\n\nOn leaving Cambridge, Forster decided to devote his life to writing. His first novels and short stories were redolent of an age that was shaking off the shackles of Victorianism. While adopting certain themes (the importance of women in their own right, for example) from earlier English novelists such as George Meredith, he broke with the elaborations and intricacies favoured in the late 19th century and wrote in a freer, more colloquial style. From the first his novels included a strong strain of social comment, based on acute observation of middle-class life. There was also a deeper concern, however, a belief, associated with Forster\u2019s interest in Mediterranean \u201cpaganism,\u201d that, if men and women were to achieve a satisfactory life, they needed to keep contact with the earth and to cultivate their imaginations. In an early novel, The Longest Journey (1907), he suggested that cultivation of either in isolation is not enough, reliance on the earth alone leading to a genial brutishness and exaggerated development of imagination undermining the individual\u2019s sense of reality.\n\nThe same theme runs through Howards End, a more ambitious novel that brought Forster his first major success. The novel is conceived in terms of an alliance between the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, who embody the liberal imagination at its best, and Ruth Wilcox, the owner of the house Howards End, which has remained close to the earth for generations; spiritually they recognize a kinship against the values of Henry Wilcox and his children, who conceive life mainly in terms of commerce. In a symbolic ending, Margaret Schlegel marries Henry Wilcox and brings him back, a broken man, to Howards End, reestablishing there a link (however heavily threatened by the forces of progress around it) between the imagination and the earth.\n\nThe resolution is a precarious one, and World War I was to undermine it still further. Forster spent three wartime years in Alexandria, doing civilian war work, and visited India twice, in 1912\u201313 and 1921. When he returned to former themes in his postwar novel A Passage to India, they presented themselves in a negative form: against the vaster scale of India, in which the earth itself seems alien, a resolution between it and the imagination could appear as almost impossible to achieve. Only Adela Quested, the young girl who is most open to experience, can glimpse their possible concord, and then only momentarily, in the courtroom during the trial at which she is the central witness. Much of the novel is devoted to less spectacular values: those of seriousness and truthfulness (represented here by the administrator Fielding) and of an outgoing and benevolent sensibility (embodied in the English visitor Mrs. Moore). Neither Fielding nor Mrs. Moore is totally successful; neither totally fails. The novel ends in an uneasy equilibrium. Immediate reconciliation between Indians and British is ruled out, but the further possibilities inherent in Adela\u2019s experience, along with the surrounding uncertainties, are echoed in the ritual birth of the God of Love amid scenes of confusion at a Hindu festival.\n\nThe values of truthfulness and kindness dominate Forster\u2019s later thinking. A reconciliation of humanity to the earth and its own imagination may be the ultimate ideal, but Forster sees it receding in a civilization devoting itself more and more to technological progress. The values of common sense, goodwill, and regard for the individual, on the other hand, can still be cultivated, and these underlie Forster\u2019s later pleas for more liberal attitudes. During World War II he acquired a position of particular respect as a man who had never been seduced by totalitarianisms of any kind and whose belief in personal relationships and the simple decencies seemed to embody some of the common values behind the fight against Nazism and Fascism. In 1946 his old college gave him an honorary fellowship, which enabled him to make his home in Cambridge and to keep in communication with both old and young until his death.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The novels sustain the cult of the heart\u2019s affections that was central to that tradition, but they also share with the first Romantics a concern for the status of man in nature and for his imaginative life, a concern that remains important to an age that has turned against other aspects of Romanticism.\n\nIn addition to essays, short stories, and novels, Forster wrote a biography of his great-aunt, Marianne Thornton (1956); a documentary account of his Indian experiences, The Hill of Devi (1953); and Alexandria: A History and a Guide (1922; new ed., 1961). Maurice, a novel with a homosexual theme, was published posthumously in 1971 but written many years earlier."}, {"url": "https://adjkjc.github.io/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prolific_writers.html", "page_content": "Some writers have had prolific careers with hundreds of their works being published. While some best-selling authors have written a small number of books that have sold millions of copies, others have had lengthy careers and maintained a high level of output year after year. Dame Agatha Christie, the most-published novelist in history, is estimated to have sold 4 billion books, having written 69 novels and 19 plays.[1] Her works were published between 1920 and 1976, equating to around three publications every two years. Dame Barbara Cartland has also sold millions of copies of her books but wrote many more than Christie. She spent 80 years as a novelist with 722 books published, averaging one book released every 40 days of her career.[2] While Cartland wrote a significant number of full-length novels, other authors have been published many more times but have specialised in short stories. Spanish author Cor\u00edn Tellado wrote over 4,000 novellas, selling 400 million copies of her books.[3]\n\nNot all authors work alone. Groups of writers, sometimes led by one central figure, have published under shared pseudonyms. The Stratemeyer Syndicate, started by Edward Stratemeyer in 1905, created numerous book series including 190 volumes of The Hardy Boys and 175 volumes of Nancy Drew. More than 1,300 books were published by the group, and although Edward L. Stratemeyer wrote several hundred, he also employed ghostwriters to keep up with the demand. These writers were given storylines and strict guidelines to follow to ensure a level of consistency within each series. Amongst the writing team was Howard R. Garis, who contributed several hundred books to the collection, one of the most active authors. Sales were estimated at over two hundred million copies before the syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster in 1984.[4]\n\nMost authors carefully craft their work, writing and rewriting several times before publication. Some authors simply use pen and paper, while others such as Isaac Asimov spent hours at a stretch working at a typewriter.[5] Philip M. Parker, by one measure the world's most prolific author, has an entirely different approach. Parker has over 200,000 titles listed on Amazon.com, having developed an algorithm to gather publicly available data and compile it into book form.[6][7] The computer-generated nature of the books is not detailed on the sales page and the books are printed only when ordered.[6][8]\n\nProlific writers [ edit ]\n\nNotes\n\nAuthors with more than 100 books are considered for inclusion.\n\n^a Asimov celebrated his birthday on 2 January but his true date of birth is unclear.\n\nOther notable writers [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://irisreading.com/10-of-the-most-prolific-authors-of-all-time/", "page_content": "21 of the Most Prolific Authors of All Time\n\nIf you had to choose between quality versus quantity, which would you choose? What if we told you that you could have both!\n\nAt least, that is the case for those in the literature world. Over the years, authors of all genres put their creative minds to the test by seeing how many books they could write. Before computers, these prolific authors managed to publish as many as over 500 novels, novellas, short stories, and indeed any piece of writing!\n\nKeep reading to see what authors have written the most books in history.\n\n1. Stephen King\n\n\u201cI had a period where I thought I might not be good enough to publish.\u201d \u2013 Stephen King\n\nIt is no surprise to see Stephen King as one of the most published authors. He once said that he writes 2,000 words a day, which accounts for how quickly you see his books on shelves (and on the big screen). Records say that King has published 60 full-length works and over 200 short stories.\n\nKing also has essays, screenplays, and comics. You have to wonder how one author could write something as horrific as Carrie and then create a heart-warming story like The Green Mile. King is definitely a writer of all trades.\n\n2. Isaac Asimov\n\n\u201cScience fiction writers foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not.\u201d Isaac Asimov\n\nScience-fiction enthusiasts all know who Isaac Asimov is. A legend of the genre, Asimov wrote or edited more than 500 books and hundreds of short stories. He wrote a few series of publications, including the Foundation Series, Galactic Empire, and Robot Series.\n\nMost of Asimov\u2019s books explain the history of science in great detail. These books came with reference guides to explain the terminology in his books. Books about books, who knew!\n\n3. Kathleen Mary Lindsay\n\n\u201cThe logic behind the magic is that we create what we are imagining.\u201d \u2013 Mary Faulkner, Complete Idiot\u2019s Guide to Women\u2019s Spirituality\n\nKathleen Mary Lindsay held the world record for most published books for many years. Lindsay wrote under 11 pseudonyms: Mary Faulkner, Margaret Cameron, Mary Richmond, Molly Waring, Betty Manvers, Elizabeth Fenton, Nigel Mackenzie, and Hugh Desmond. The Guinness Book of World Records reports that Faulkner has a total of 904 books.\n\n4. Jozef Ignacy Kraszewski\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a writer nor an artist. Although I write a lot and I love all the beauty \u2013 I am a man of my age, a child of my nation.\u201d \u2013 Jozef Ignacy Kraszewski\n\nJozef Ignacy Kraszewski, also known as Kleofas Fakund Pasternak, published his first book in 1830. That book was one of many in Kraszewski\u2019s collection. The author, activist, and historian published 600 books in his lifetime. He is most well-known for his work on historical Poland. There are 29 novels in the series in 79 parts.\n\n5. Ursula Bloom\n\n\u201cAnn was thirty-five. What was worse, she looked thirty-five.\u201d \u2013 Ursula Bloom, Wonder Cruise\n\nUrsula Bloom was a British romance novelist who wrote over 500 books. She, like many others on this list, wrote under pseudonyms. Bloom said Charles Dickens influenced her to become an author. She was an avid reader as a kid and read all of his works before she was ten. In the 1920s and 30s, it wasn\u2019t common to have a female journalist, but Bloom fought back and wrote for various newspapers and magazines.\n\n6. Charles Hamilton\n\n\u201cYarooh!\u201d \u2013 Frank Richards, Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School\n\nThe Billy Bunter series is the humorous children\u2019s fiction novel written by Charles Hamilton\u2019s pseudonym, Frank Richards. The stories were initially published in a boy\u2019s weekly story paper. Before his passing at the age of 85, he wrote about 100 million words making him one of the most prolific authors in history.\n\nHis stories were easy for kids to read, and all had a moral message; don\u2019t smoke or gamble, be honest, and respect other races. The BBC eventually made a TV show based on the series which Hamilton wrote the scripts for.\n\n7. Barbara Cartland\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep going till my face falls off.\u201d \u2013 Barbara Cartland\n\nWell, Barbara, it turns out you kept writing even after that! Barbara Cartland was one of the most published authors and continued publishing after her death in 2000. Cartland holds the Guinness Book of World records for the most written novels in one year. She wrote roughly 23 novels each year and had a total of 723 published pieces. After she passed, they found manuscripts of a book and released it as the Barbara Cartland Pink Collection.\n\n8. Ryoki Inoue\n\n\u201cAbandon inertia.\u201d \u2013 Ryoki Inoue\n\nBrazilian author Ryoki Inoue holds the Guinness World Record for being the most prolific author, with 1,075 books published under many pseudonyms.\n\nInoue would write all day and all night until he finished a book. He wrote Sequesreo Fast Food in one night. According to Ryoki.com, \u201cIn his opinion, the secret of the creative process is in 98% of sweat, 1% of talent, and 1% of luck. Moreover, discipline and application are the motive that make him to be sit in front of his computer and don\u2019t leave until the end of his new job.\u201d\n\nIf you ever need the motivation to finish a book or project, think about Inoue\u2019s philosophy.\n\n9. R.L. Stine\n\nR.L Stine was once asked in a Goodreads forum, \u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how much do you enjoy traumatizing young children?\u201d\n\nR.L. Stine cooly replied, \u201cI enjoy getting children to read. Traumatizing them is just a bonus.\u201d\n\nThe infamous author of the Goosebumps series and Fear Street series, Stine has 157 books posted on his website. At one point, it was said that Stine wrote one book every two weeks. Stine is still at it and has a writing program for aspiring young authors. Visit his website for more information.\n\n10. Cor\u00edn Tellado\n\n\u201cSome months, the censors rejected four novels. I told things clearly. Censorship taught me to imply things.\u201d \u2013 Cor\u00edn Tellado\n\nRomance author Cor\u00edn Tellado from Spain held the world record for having sold the most books written in Spanish. Tellado published over 5,000 titles selling more than 400 million books.\n\nTellado stood out amongst all other romance novelists because she didn\u2019t fall into the trap of happy endings with all of her books. In the 70s, her novels raised a few eyebrows as they tackled tough subjects amid the women\u2019s rights movement.\n\n11. Jane Austin\n\n\u201cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.\u201d\n\nJane Austen is one of the most well-known English writers ever. She is regarded by many as being second only to Shakespeare in her crafty use of language. What makes her story even more incredible is that she was at a disadvantage against all the other authors, because she was born a woman. Yet, she overcame adversity and cultural shackles to become the most iconic novelist that the English ever produced.\n\n12. Enid Mary Blyton\n\n\u201cThe best way to treat obstacles is to use them as stepping-stones.\u201d\n\nEnid Mary Blyton is credited with writing over 800 different books for children. One report claims that she has a higher number of cumulative book sales than even J.K. Rowling herself. Although this might have changed even as you are reading this sentence, because Rowling has continued writing.\n\nUnfortunately, Blyton died in 1986, at the age of 71, but her stories remain forever popular with children, going so far as being translated into over 90 languages.\n\n13. Jacob Neusner\n\n\u201cDo not let people put you down. Believe in yourself and stand for yourself and trust yourself.\u201d\n\nJacob Neusner has some of the most neglected works that made rounds across the world. His books were centered on practicing Judaism during the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras. He has over 950 books to his name, which he was involved in either directly writing them or editing the drafts. Most of his books are around 400 pages, which displays the sheer magnitude of research that must have gone into writing them.\n\nWriting completely non-fiction takes up a lot more time because of the research required. Thus, the amount of time Jacob spent writing his books was most likely far longer than that of any of his fiction writing peers.\n\n14. John Creasey\n\n\u201cNever buy an editor or publisher a lunch or a drink until he has bought an article, story or book from you. This rule is absolute and may be broken only at your peril.\u201d\n\nJohn Creasey is one of the most interesting mysteries revolving around great writers. Legend has it that he was rejected 768 times before he got his first approval from a publishing firm for his book. He then went on to write more than 600 books. However, he did so using 28 different pseudonyms. Hence, there\u2019s some conflict over the exact number that can be credited to him. He\u2019s majorly focused on Westerns but was an avid romance writer and produced several novels using the pseudonym \u201cMargaret Cooke.\u201d\n\n15. Georges Joseph Christian Simenon\n\n\u201cWriting is not a profession but a vocation of unhappiness. I don\u2019t think an artist can ever be happy.\u201d\n\nGeorges Joseph Christian Simenon is a writer of over 200 novels written using his name and has more than 300 books written under at least 12 different pseudonyms. Simenon\u2019s niche was detective novels, and his unique talent was in the psychological aspects of the novels themselves. His best-known work is Inspector Maigret. His writing had more intuition than deductive reasoning in solving crimes, something which greatly resonated with the audience.\n\n16. Alexandre Dumas\n\n\u201cAll human wisdom is contained in these two words \u2013 Wait and Hope\u201d\n\nAlexandre Dumas wrote 277 books. Dumas had reportedly told Napoleon the Third that he had written over 1,200 volumes. What sets him apart is that he is more openly known to be associated with various collaborators. This makes it very challenging to give an actual number containing the exact number of works Dumas was involved with.\n\nHowever, in the old days, authors often took multi-volume novels to be individual books in themselves, instead of the continuity of one book. Therefore, Dumas\u2019 The Three Musketeers, although technically one book now, had been counted as separate volumes back in his day.\n\n17. Charles Dickens\n\n\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\u201d\n\nCharles Dickens was undoubtedly an extraordinary writer. His major acclaim to fame was his works as an incredible novelist. He produced many classics during his day, for instance, Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield, Bleak House, Great Expectations, and many more. Unarguably, all of the novels that he wrote can be very easily considered to be English classics.\n\n18. Jules Verne\n\n\u201cAnything one man can imagine, other men can make real.\u201d\n\nA French poet, a novelist, and a playwright; Verne rightfully earns his place on this list. His novels add a futuristic adventurous overtone to them, which is greatly appreciated by his audience. Being called the \u201cfather of science fiction,\u201d Verne has played an insurmountable role in the development of the infrastructure for science fiction writing.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts about his novels is their ability to predict the technology of the future. Several things described in Verne\u2019s novels have now become a reality, long after his sad demise.\n\n19. Lewis Caroll\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know where you are going any road can take you there.\u201d\n\nAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland is an English classic that is widely popular throughout the world; it has been adapted into many plays and even several blockbuster films. Lewis Carroll, was the genius behind this wonderful story.\n\nIn his day, he was far more than just a novelist; an English academic, Caroll was both a mathematician, and an Anglican deacon on the side.\n\nAs if Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland wasn\u2019t enough, Caroll went on to write the hit sequel Through the Looking-Glass. The most notable aspects of his work were his genius wordplay, apparently nonsensical logic, and the fantastical imagination. He quite literally invented the entire genre of literary nonsense.\n\n20. Emily Dickinson\n\n\u201cThat it will never come again is what makes life sweet.\u201d\n\nEmily Dickinson never received the fame she deserved during her lifetime. However, now she is recognized by notable poets and literarians throughout the world as one of the most influential representatives of the American culture.\n\nHer voice, which reverberated through her poetry, has been a source of inspiration for many other authors, most notably, the Brontes. In 1994, she was enlisted among the 26 pivotal writers of the Western civilization by literary critic Harold Bloom. Tragically, it was only after her death that her sister found the literary equivalent of Atlantis in the form of some two thousand poems Emily had composed.\n\n21. Rabindranath Tagore\n\n\u201cClouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.\u201d\n\nWas the first ever non-European lyricist who won the Nobel Prize in literature. A Bengali polymath, Tagore was a writer, composer, poet, social reformer, playwright, philosopher, and even a painter.\n\nHe is largely credited for outrightly reshaping Bengali literature. Through music and art, Tagore brought Contextual Modernism to India during the late 19th century.\n\nHe wrote novels, short stories, poems, drama, essays, and songs, all in Bengali. He later translated them into English himself.\n\nTo make an idea of how prolific his artistic life was, know that he wrote approximately 2,232 songs and over 50 volumes of poetry, not to mention the plethora of drama plays.\n\nWrapping up\u2026\n\nWOW!

At the end of the war, G\u00f6ring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported G\u00f6ring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because G\u00f6ring weighed more than 300 pounds (140 kg). . Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that G\u00f6ring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom G\u00f6ring - as the commander of the Luftwaffe - had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a.45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn\"t reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled G\u00f6ring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" G\u00f6ring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he\"d been picked up. I wouldn\"t say it changed my view of the war, but it showed me that there are.. Well, I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" G\u00f6ring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities. By October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to brigadier general, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Foster graduated in 1937 with a degree in English from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

Foster received the Silver Star for his wartime service in southern France in 1944. lieutenant was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States\" decisive role in the liberation of our country during World World War World War II\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana.

Mayhew makes an interesting reference to a \u201cgreat hulking negro\u201d who dressed and spoke like a woman. He was called Miss Brown. Today that man would be considered transgendered. In 1889, Miss Brown, was considered crazy.\n\nWe would not know of Miss Brown or the man who slapped his daughter in the street just to show her who was the boss, or the negro who walked 36 miles for dollar, if we didn\u2019t read Mayhew. In order to read Mayhew, we have to first know who he was.\n\nThe point is, so much of Bahamian history has been locked away in the divisive past, behind doors, we would rather not open.\n\n\u201cEvery generation confronts the task of choosing its past. Inheritances are chosen as much as they are passed on. The past depends less on \u201cwhat happened then\u201d than on the desires and discontents of the present. Strivings and failures shape the stories we tell. What we recall has as much to do with the terrible things we hope to avoid as with the good life for which we yearn\u201d\n\n\u2014Saidiya Hartman, Lose Your Mother: A Journey among the Atlantic Slave Route\n\nCONFRONTING AN UNCOMFORTABLE PAST\n\nThe further back one goes in Bahamian history, the more divisive it becomes. All of it, from the sea to the sky, somehow came down to race and class. Settlement, slavery, survival and social separation marks this. It is partly for this very reason why, under British colonial rule, and for decades after, the stories of Europe and elsewhere became the focus of every history, geography, English literature and religion class in Bahamian schools.\n\nMoving forward, our historical ignorance presents a real problem to the goal of understanding the ethnology of ourselves in this small island nation. Bahamians have missed out on learning about generations of people, who affected and changed the course of Bahamian history, and equally, those who became great contributors to world history.\n\nOne such Bahamian born contributor to American classical literature, of the late 1880s, was Edgar Mayhew Bacon. Bacon\u2019s maternal family were Lockharts. He was born in Ragged Island, in 1855. Edgar Mayhew Bacon was a third generation Bahamian. Both his mother and maternal grandfather were born in the Bahamas between Ragged Island and Nassau.\n\nFAMILY ANCESTRY OF EDGAR MAYHEW BACON\n\nEdgar Mayhew Bacon was family to the Lockhart\u2019s from Ragged Island. The Lockharts were settled Loyalists or possibly just plantation owners who came by way of Scotland. From slave owners the Lockharts probably moved into the salt business.\n\n(The Hartford Courant, 14 August 1826)\n\nJames McKay Lockhart born possibly in Aberdeen Scotland. DIED in 1798 in Nassau or Ragged Island.\n\nJohn Monroe Lockhart who was born in 1798 in Nassau or Ragged Island and died on 21 October 1832 on Ragged Island, was in all likelihood the SON of James McKay Lockhart originally of Aberdeen Scotland.\n\nJane \u201cJennie\u201d Mary Lockhart was born in Nassau, New Providence on 15 November 1826 was the DAUGHTER of John Monroe Lockhart who lived on Ragged Island. Jane died in Tarrytown, Westchester, NY 12 October 1916.\n\nJane Lockhart married American John Reuben Bacon in the Bahamas on 7 April 1851. John Reuben Bacon was born in Albany New York and died in Tarrytown, Westchester, NY\n\nTheir son, one of eight children, Edgar Mayhew Bacon was born 05 June 1855 in Nassau.\n\nJohn Bacon took his wife Jane and their first three children, (Harriet born 1852), (John born 1853), and (Edgar Mayhew born 1855), all born in the Bahamas, to America sometime in 1858.\n\nEdgar Mayhew Bacon went on to become a celebrated writer, contributing to the historical literature of America.\n\nEdgar Mayhew Bacon died in 1935.\n\nExcerpt from Notes from a Sub-Tropic Study\n\n(The Leicester Chronicle, Saturday 14 December 1889)\n\nFULL STORY BELOW\n\nNOTES OF A SUBTROPIC STUDY\n\nBy Edgar Mayhew Bacon 1889\n\nSo you have been enjoying the Bermudas this winter? \u201c\n\n\u201cNot the Bermudas the Bahamas.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes the Bahamas. By the way, the people \u201cthere speak Spanish, do they not? \u201c\n\n\u201cNo. It is an English colony.\u201d\n\nIf I had been properly paid for each time that I took part in the foregoing dialogue, after my return from a six months participation in Bahama life, I should now be in a position to purchase the entire group from Great Britain.\n\nCertainly the reader of these notes needs not to be reminded that those isles of perpetual summer are strewn in a strange, irregular fashion between a point somewhat southeast of Florida and the island of Hayti ; that they lie in a setting of golden sand-bars and silver reefs that make navigation among them a matter of skill and sometimes of peril, and that the southernmost member of the colony is about twenty degrees south of the city of New York.\n\nIt is to the out-islands, with their primitive fashions still fresh upon them, and something of border romance clinging to them, that I ask you to accompany me; not tooften-described Nassau. With the exception of one or two more favored ones, they are out of the usual course of navigation so completely that many of the people have seldom or never seen a steamer, rarely get a newspaper, and dream for years of accomplishing a pilgrimage to the Bahama \u201cMecca\u201d Nassau.\n\nOn first visiting Watlings Island (or San Salvador) in a steamer, we approached the land at the same point as did Columbus. The excitement that our arrival caused was very marked. The fleet of small boats that swarmed out to meet us; the crowds of eager people almost the whole population that congregated at the edge of the white, clear water ; even the palm-fringed land sloping down to a scattered settlement of thatched dwellings that bordered the brilliant beach, all reminded one forcibly of an old picture of the landing of the Genoese navigator. It is doubtful if that worthy created any more excitement than did we. To the question when the last steamer stopped there, the magistrate, a pleasant old gentleman, responded: \u201cSteamer? Lord bless you, boy, we haven t had a steamer here before for two years.\u201d\n\nYet half a dozen regular steamship lines pass near Watlings light monthly, or even oftener; and, with anything in the way of production to form a basis for export, it would be easy to open regular and frequent communication with the outside world. As it is, the people are waiting and hoping that somebody or something will somehow at some time move their way. There is a general apathy and supineness that is incomprehensible to the average American.\n\nThis is a geographical condition which is either an advantage or a disadvantage as one inclines to view it. If it is good to keep old manners and customs hermetically sealed, so that the nineteenth century, can hold near its heart a bit of the eighteenth, just as a modern girl may wear on her bosom an old miniature, then it is an advantage to be always on the inner line of one of the ocean eddies. It is simply a question whether superstition will balance romance and picturesqueness of thought; whether naivete will outweigh ignorance; or the old-fashioned virtues of hospitality, politeness, moderation in speech, and simplicity in manners are to be desired when coupled with such old-fashioned vices as shiftlessness and lax morals. There is still a suspicious flavor of earlier piratical occupancy in the zest with which a Bahaman hails a wreck or engages in a smuggling operation.\n\nNEGROES AND WHITES\n\nIt is many years since the institution of slavery was abolished there, but still the colored inhabitants, who are greatly in the majority, are subservient to their white neighbors; the misfortune being that the latter are not always wise. The mingling of the two races has not been generally attended with the best results, for between them has sprung up an intermediate class which presents some of the worst characteristics of both. The white people are often amusingly proud of their English kinship, holding that nothing good can come from any other than the Albion spring. Opposed to these are very few who are American in their leanings, and as absurdly confident that all goodness and worth, enterprise and might, centre in the \u201d States.\u201d\n\nThe isolated Caucasian is much the same here as elsewhere, except that his constant intercourse with a people always ready to do him reverence has made him indolent and vain. If it were not for a few wide-awake men who, with their families, are scattered like leaven through the provincial lump, there would be little hope for the future of the white inhabitant. His days are days of ants will present names not upon the idleness, his aspirations are hardly worth pay-roll. After a while you discover that the name, while his life and his children\u2019s lives are vitiated and demoralized by constant contact and companionship with the irresponsible negro.\n\nIn the negro there seems to be a larger promise. He is the true Bahaman. When he gets where he can look the white man level in the eyes and forget his race-stigma he will grow. He belongs to the climate and to the soil. Even where he is now his vices do not seem repulsive, his immoralities are hardly shocking (except when shared by his dominant brother), and his kind dis position, sunny temper, and hap-hazard methods of working and living render him generally attractive and always interesting. Perhaps his most prominent failing is his want of proper pride. He is eager to agree with your opinions even to the extent of frequently contradicting himself. A lack of strong personality is strikingly shown by his readiness to change his name. If you have occasion to pay off a gang of men, half the claim that George Ambrister is converted into Henry Cartwright, and so on through the list. A man s nominal identity does not seem to be a matter of the least importance to him. Besides this, there is a general readiness to accept charity, even when remunerative work may be staring the mendicant in the face.\n\nThe better educated negro may not ask for a shilling, but he will not hesitate to let you know how you may serve or benefit him. There was a white-haired old fellow, with a skin so fair that in another climate no one would suspect his lineage\n\nto be of the house of Ham, who began his attacks upon my sympathies before I had fairly got the northern chill out of my blood, and continued his interested attack long after I was brown as a native and as well known as the oldest inhabitant. He brought shells which he was willing to part with for twenty times their value in silver ; he hinted, yes, more than hinted, that he had a warm admiration for certain articles of personal apparel which I possessed. He even sank so low as to laugh convulsively at the derision which I heaped upon him. In the end he succeeded in securing a shilling, and straightway \u201cbegan to lie awake nights to contrive a plan by which to get another.\u201d\n\nARE THE COLORED NATIVES IMMORAL OR ONLY UNMORAL?\n\nA very pertinent question was recently asked by a thoughtful man, anent the\n\nmoral status of the colored natives: \u201d Are they immoral or only unmoral?\u201d\n\nThis is a question which seems to answer itself. They are only unmoral.\n\nMany fine points and nice distinctions in ethics, which usually engage the attention of civilized people, they never trouble themselves to consider. There is no logic in their morality. One may love his neighbor, and then extend the affection to his neigbor\u2019s family. If a man appropriates somebody else\u2019s wife, for example, he does it in a manner so kind and gentle that the offence is robbed of half its unpleasantness.\n\nThere is another common trait, whether mental or moral it is hard to determine, which may best be described by an illustrative story. An old man whose daughter, lately grown to womanhood, was among the best -dressed and best-behaved damsels of her native town met her one day upon the street, and, stepping up to her, without a word struck her two or three sharp blows. When interrogated as to his motive for such an act, he replied : \u201c Dat my own chile. She ain do nuttin , on y she get too fine. /mus* hit her jus to show tority\u201d The deed was a typical one.\n\nThere are many absurd, irrational things done by this race \u201cjust to show authority.\u201d\n\nThe Haunted Jail, Inagua .\n\nLarceny is rare in the islands. The inhabitants are seldom thieves, and the jails are usually empty. There is rather a good story, by the way, which is told of the Inagua jail, which, common report claims, is haunted. The ground upon which the building stands used to be subject to voudoos or obeah, or witch craft in some other African form, so that no one liked to stray there after sunset. After the prison was erected it stood for some time empty, till at last the authorities secured a culprit in the person of a sailor who had committed some criminal offence. We may imagine that the rejoicing of the state\u2019s officers at thus proving their right to have a jail must have been great when the culprit was safely incarcerated; but such feelings, if they indulged them, did not last long. Shortly after midnight there was a terrible outcry heard in the building, and those who at length summoned courage to investigate found the sailor almost dead with terror. The old spell was evidently still operative; he had seen the ghosts. At his urgent entreaty the officers, being sensible men and persuaded of the justice of his reasoning, set the unfortunate man at liberty.\n\nIn their dealings with each other the people are so sharp that business transactions are frequently followed by an envoy in a police court. In fact, the Magistrate s Office is a favorite resort for the black folks of both sexes, their charges often being of the most trivial character, and seldom permanently interrupting the good feeling which usually exists between the litigants.\n\nOne magistrate complained to me that he hated to fine the delinquents who were brought daily before him, because they generally ended by borrowing of him the money with which to pay their fines.\n\nRudimentary education is general\n\nEvery settlement except the very smallest has its public school, where the stranger in passing will be amused to hear the shrill chant of young voices repeating the alphabet or the multiplication-table. There is something very strangely discordant in the sound, as though it issued from an organ composed of defective treble pipes. Enter the school-room and you will find that, whatever deficiency there may be in other studies, there is a general proficiency in mental arithmetic. Almost every Bahaman reads; the percentage of those who are unable to do so being very small. Along a graded color-line the student follows with interest the growth of intellectual grasp, through the various shades of chocolate and yellow humanity, from the perusal of the Nassau Guardian or the Turks Island Gazette to the study of some late ethical discussion in an American magazine or review. But it will be apparent, even to the most optimistic observer, that reading is not the chief occupation of the islanders leisure. Even were inclination and habit more exacting, the poverty of the average native would stand in the way of his possessing many books or periodicals. Of public libraries I know at least one fairly good one, composed mostly of standard English works; but the method, or rather want of method, with which it is catalogued and conducted largely de feats its usefulness.\n\nMENTAL HEAL TH AND A TRANSGENDER NEGRO , WHO CALLED HIMSELF MISS BROWN CLASSIFIED AS CRAZY\n\nOccasionally an example of erratic mental activity is presented, as in the case of a colored man who is periodically hunted by a swarming legion of imaginary \u201cvoudoos,\u201d who make his house untenable. At such times his neighborhood is neither pleasant nor safe, but between these attacks the poor victim shows a marked degree of intelligence, conducting his business with considerable skill, and often inventing little contrivances to lessen his labor.\n\nA more amusing case of mania is that of a great hulking negro who, years ago,\n\nadopted the dress, habits, and mincing manners of a woman; and he has for so\n\nlong a time been known as Miss Brown the name he chose for himself that people are apt to forget that his pretensions are spurious.\n\nViolent insanity is rare. Yet I shall never forget, as one of the saddest and most striking spectacles that I ever witnessed, the removal of a maniac girl from her home to that only place of confinement, the jail. It was along a sandy path shadowed by tropical foliage, bordered by a broken wall over which the passion-flowers ran riot, that the cortege of natives came. In advance fled a herd of frightened children, going a few steps in dismay, and then, as curiosity got the better of fear, stopping to gaze back at the terrifying object. There she walked, between two strong black women, others behind impelling her for\n\nward ; a girl as beautiful and shapely as some bronze bacchante, with wild eyes, clothes torn and dishevelled, and arms flung out in supplication. It was a sad, strange, pitiful sight.\n\nTo the question where they were taking her, one of the women answered :\n\n\u201c Jes to de jail yonner. We is totin her dere cause she done gone mad, an dey ain no yuther place to put her at.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long has she been mad?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long she is been so? Oh, I dunno, sir. She ain ben righ dis long time. Dey lock her in de jail now and den efshe ain dead, dey sen her to Nassau nex mail.\u201d\n\nThis treatment of the insane matches very well the usual course pursued in cases of sickness. The poor patient is over-visited from the first. He is sung\n\nto, talked to, and prayed over, till, being medicined after the most approved Indian methods, he finally dies in sheer self-defence. A black man was recently\n\nemployed to take care of a sick neighbor, and one morning soon after reported on his charge as follows:\n\n\u201d He wuss ebery day. He pear like he ain goiri get well. I done jam de word o Gawd into him all de time sense I been dere.\u201d\n\nHe was admonished that he was not employed to \u201cjam\u201d the word of God into his suffering brother, but to jam nourishment into his system. The sick man failed to recover.\n\nSUPERSTITUTION SEEN AS REMNANTS OF OLD CONGO RELIGION\n\nIt seems hardly necessary to record of members of the African family that they are superstitious. The vagaries of belief are preserved fragments of archaic Congo religion. The old bottle or charmed bag hung up in a field is still often sufficiently potent to scare away the more ignorant, and no watch or ward would protect treasure from molestation half as well as a good ghost story. No one cares to pass a graveyard after nightfall. I have known a boat\u2019s crew disturbed because a bag of sand ballast thrown overboard looked like a sheet or a shroud beneath the surface of the deep, and the smell of watermelon which once greeted us out at sea was immediately attributed to spirits.\n\nDIAECT AND POLITICS\n\nOf dialect there is every shade, between the consonantless grumble of the old African and the modified English of his descendant in the fourth or fifth generation. There is a splendid field for the enthusiastic student of lingual peculiarities. A babel of tongues is loosed whenever a political question is started. For, be it known, all Bahamans are, to a certain extent, politicians; that is, to the extent of being more or less intelligently interested in the action of their representatives in the Colonial House, and in the attitude of the Governor. The reason is not far to seek. Every question which comes up touches the whole colony, if it has any importance at all. There is no vast territory with various business interests to be considered. The laws passed at Nassau must interest Watlings, or Rum Cay, or Inagua, or Fortune Island almost equally, since all are engaged in about the same pursuits and living under the same conditions. The government is both representative and paternal. The members of the Colonial Legislature are elected by popular vote and serve without salary. Many of them are colored men.\n\nThese representatives are not always resident on the islands for which they sit. Thus the member for Inagua lives in Nassau, and the member for the western district of Nassau is also resident magistrate at Inagua. The laws passed by the legislature are locally administered by magistrates, assisted by justices of the peace, or by visiting or circuit judges, of whom there are two in the colony. The Governor is appointed by the Crown, andexercises a fatherly supervision over the affairs of his subjects, after the usual fashion of benign colonial governors. Occasionally he makes tours of inspection among the out -islands, gladdening the hearts of his people, inquiring into their wants, noting the conditions of advantage and disadvantage under which they labor, and receiving their account of grievances, of which there is usually a full budget.\n\nGOVERNOR, SIR AMBROSE SHEA AND THE FULLY REGALED AFRICAN SOCIETIES COME TO HEAR HIS SPEECH\n\nHaving the good fortune to be present at one of the islands when His Excellency\n\nSir Ambrose Shea paid a visit, I was interested to observe the good feeling that\n\nwas reciprocally shown. After a morning spent with some of the more prominent inhabitants of the little town,\n\nSir Ambrose signified his intention of addressing the people in some public place. The library was selected as being the largest and most pleasant room in the village, and messengers were sent to inform the colored people of the event, and to gather in an audience ; but for a time it seemed as though they would be unsuccessful, as only half a dozen men and women had arrived at the hour appointed.\n\nWhile we waited, an old man embraced the opportunity to present a\n\nlonesome little petition of his own. It was all about some cattle that insisted upon straying into his field and eating up his corn and plantains. The Governor sat in an arm-chair by one of the cool windows, a look of puzzlement on his kindly face ; turning first to one and then to another of those who were around him, asking : \u201d What does he say?\u201d or, \u201cCan you understand him now ? \u201d as the ancient African proceeded to unburden his vexed soul.\n\n\u201d Um, um Yo Ex luncy. I is obligated to um a present to yo kineness de queshon, yo Exluncy, how we is goin keed cattle f um dewowin our fiel . I wex wid dis queshon dis long time. Da s a queshon, yo Ex luncy, da go way back f o de time dey buil de salt- pon , I ole man, mo oler danyuther in-habtan . I ben heah mo longer, yo Ex luncy, an I knows how de queshon riginally ben grow. De hole maatarigh heah; how I is goin he p ese f w en dey ain no way kee d cattle out. Now, yo Ex luncy, I um ain da larned, but I gatter say disher: \u201cHow ?\u201d\n\nThe address was interrupted. A sound a remarkable sound of drum and fife, with a suggestion to the uninitiated that perhaps the sackbut and the psaltery were adding their obsolete strains to the minstrelsy. Out of the windows we saw a procession filing down the sandy street black men with black coats, over which were worn red and white sashes; a few banners, a scarlet-coated band of musicians, and several score women in white, pink, and blue dresses.\n\nThe societies were coming in a body to hear the Governor s address. In a few moments afterward the library room was filled with a respectful, attentive crowd, to whom his Excellency spoke upon the subject he had come to interest them in,\n\nthe production of the \u201d pita \u201d plant, or hemp-fibre, in the colony.\n\nAfter the conclusion of his speech, in which many advantages and concessions\n\nwere promised to those who would take land and go to work on it, Sandy Ambrister, the President of the Union Society, rose to respond. He was comically enveloped in his scarf, and the sleeves of his black coat somewhat interfered with the free play of his fingers, but his tongue was loosed. He told his fellow-citizens how good the Governor was to them:\n\n\u201d E talkee lak a fader to um. E say go wuk. Das righ .Wukke like a me. I done tole um so ; tak e cutlass, bus in head fus . Take shut off. De Gov ner good maan ; talkeelak a fader.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion of President Sandy\u2019s address, though good from a Bahaman standpoint, might not commend itself to the better cultured underwriter. It was this : \u201d An now, my bred rin, pray de Lawd he sen us a good wrack, so st we kin get a few shillin to buy de Ian .\u201d\n\nSandy was by no means as well educated as most of his hearers, but he had\n\nthe great advantage of knowing experimentally how to \u201d bus in head fus.\u201d\n\nWhen I last saw him he had taken his own advice and, cutlass in hand, his old arm was clearing land to some advantage.\n\nAfter the meeting in the library, as we descended the steps, the band struck up a lugubrious tune, whereat the Governor uncovered his head and stood with a respectful air of attention. As it finished I asked in a whisper, \u201d What was that?\u201d and he smilingly replied, \u201d I think it was God save the Queen. \u201c\n\nThe effort I have alluded to i.e., to introduce hemp cultivation in the colony is already an assured success, and it is safe to say that in the \u201d pita \u201d aloe lies the future wealth of the Bahama Islands. It needs only a glance at the present condition of Yucatan and other Mexican States, and a comparison of their present great prosperity with their poverty before \u201d sisal \u201d became the staple cultivation, to convince one that with a plant which grows larger, takes less time to mature, and yields more and better fibre than that of Yucatan, the prospect for these islands is very brilliant. Heretofore, ere the value of the Bahama hemp-plant was known to the inhabitants, salt, sponges, turtle-shells, fruit, and cocoa-nuts formed the exports. But sea-salt had other enemies besides the heavy duty which America imposed upon its import, pineapple lands played out in time, and the cocoa-nuts were far from being always a success. There is still something done with each of these products, and probably always will be ; but their importance in the eyes of the people is a thing of the past. Those whose inexperience leads them to burn their fingers with salt are yearly growing fewer.\n\nI omitted to mention wrecking among the Bahama industries, yet it has its place, which is far from being an unimportant one. Men, women, and children will abandon any pursuit to throng to the scene of a wreck. An entire congregation will swarm out of church at such a summons, the men divesting themselves of superfluous clothing as they run, pitching garments over walls or into the bushes for the women to pick up. They are as active and prompt in their work, and as skilful, as the members of the New York Fire Department are in theirs. Nor does the labor require less nerve and skill, To take a boat out through a beating surf, in water which is not by any means free from sharks, and successfully save the cargo, rigging, and even the furniture, of a wrecked vessel, to say nothing of the human lives, is not work for a coward or an unskilled boatman. The pay for salvage is high, so that a \u201cfat\u201d wreck is a thing to be prayed for and long remembered.\n\nNumberless stories are told of the facility with which the insular conscience reconciles itself to the idea of assisting to wreck a vessel. Kather a knotty case was that of one of the older pilots, who was suspected and tried several years ago for complicity in a crime of this nature. At the trial two points are said to have been proven by witnesses : First, that the pilot was in the cabin of the vessel one afternoon for some time, and that when he came out he was heard to say, piously, \u201d Well, cap\u2019n, if it mus be so, de Lawds will be done ; \u201d and, second, that the next morning the vessel was hard and fast ashore.\n\nNEGRO LABOURERS AND THE MAN WHO WALKED THIRTY-SIX MILES FOR A DOLLAR\n\nThe laborers appear to work with more intelligence and energy when on or in the sea. Salt water seems to be vivifying in its effect. Perhaps it is the unending, unyielding demand for activity in action and thought which the ocean always makes upon those who wrestle with it, that accounts for this difference in character. But it certainly is the case that the colored laborer of the Bahamas does not seem fonder of continued exertion when in his field or engaged in shore work than does his race-brother elsewhere. Yet he is not lazy either, for often he proves a capacity for spurts of exertion that are remarkable when one takes the climate into consideration. Calling a negro one day, I gave him a note to be delivered to a gentleman who was at a point eighteen miles distant, the path between being a mere trail through sand-waste, water-pools, and brush. He was to bring an answer back by sunset. Starting cheerfully, though the day was a hot one, he actually made the thirty- six miles within fifteen minutes of the time appointed, and showed not the slightest trace of fatigue. Asking him what the service was to cost, he rather bashfully asked if I thought fo shillin \u201d (a dollar) would be too much. I do not mention this walk as an uncommon feat. I have known it excelled by women.\n\nThe daily routine of labor for a working man is very unlike that of his northern prototype. \u201cEarly to rise,\u201d whether it results in health, wealth, and wisdom or not, is the rule. Coffee is the first thing on the daily programme, and then work till about ten o clock, when breakfast is in order. By four o clock the day\u2019s task is performed, and the laborer goes home to his dinner and rest.\n\nINFAMOUS TRUCK SYSTEM \u2013 NEGROES NOT PAID IN MONEY BUT FORCED INTO DEBT AT EMPLOYER SHOP\n\nHis pay is not always in money. An employer will often have a store where his employees are paid in provisions or merchandise, in most cases rarely seeing money from one month to the next. It will be readily seen that this \u201ctruck system,\u201d as it is called, is liable to great abuse. It becomes often a species of slavery, the consumer being allowed sufficient credit to effectually enchain him; and generally paying his master two profits for everything he uses. The bare necessaries of a savage life are produced on the islands ; all else is imported, so that when the importers have got the people tied hand and foot, as is the case on one or two of the islands, the poor wretches must either submit to the tyranny, having no money, or credit elsewhere, or they must go naked and subsist on what they can raise on the soil or get out of the sea.\n\nThe individual islands, it must be confessed, differ greatly in this respect. Upon one of the most important of the smaller ones a certain man, who has carried the trucking system to its limit, glories in the title of \u201cKing.\u201d\n\nThere is only one road leading to and from the homes of these islanders. It is the great, blue highway of the sea. Toward it hope looks, night and morning, and its chances are the special providences that brighten the provincial life. Remember that all things for food or other use, except the very simplest ; all ideas, all news, all knowledge, all things that interest, amuse, instruct, must come by vessel, and then you will understand how the sight of a sail or a steamer s smoke is greeted with eager interest. A stranger presents all the chances of a lottery till he has fairly cast anchor and his business is fully known. The sailors, who come not only from neighboring ports, but from the utter most parts of the earth, bring with them a flavor of many lands. To-day it may be a yacht, fitted with all the luxury demanded by modern taste; to-morrow a smuggler on his way to some Haytian or Cuban port, and the next day a whaler turning homeward after a year or two of work. There may be a month of loneliness, when a sail on the horizon is a godsend to minds weary with the reiteration of small local affairs; then all at once the harbor or roadstead will be full of craft a strangely assorted fleet ; and the mariner from Maine, or the fisherman from Nova Scotia, hails his neighbor from Norway or Austria, England or Spain, and together they proceed to enliven the settlement where chance has drawn them. The boy who has gone away to seek his fortunes and to see the world, comes back some day on one of these unheralded vessels, and is full of wonderful tales of the cities he has seen and the adventures he has taken part in. Cold, snow, and ice are among the marvellous things he tells about, always finding an interested audience.\n\nNothing more primitive can be imagined than the mode of travelling from island to island. The wonder, to one who has tried the provincial way, is not that so few people leave home, but that anyone can be induced to do so except in case of dire necessity. Even a man is reduced to sore straits, and to a woman the discomforts and inconveniences are simply horrible. Even upon the mail-boat (until very lately) there was no accommodation for more than eight passengers, and these were of the crudest type. A stuffy cabin with eight berths, four upper and four lower ones, that were more like potato-bins than anything else, often had to serve for double that number of people. Besides these were perhaps a score of \u201d second class \u201d passengers, who were crowded in the hold or on the deck anywhere, in fact, that they could find room to spread themselves. Bedding, store-chest, every thing that one needed or was likely to require for a long voyage, had to be provided by the passenger. Yet, why do I write in the past tense? The experiment of using some better means of conveyance is only now being tried, and does not extend to nor is it intended to include all the islands of the group. If the discomfort of travel by the mail- boat is great, what must be said of the chance craft, the sponge-fishers, turtlers, traders, and even dirty Haytian sloops, in which the majority must go if they would ever widen their horizon? Among the lower people I have even known two women make a voyage of forty-eight hours in a little deckless sloop, in company with three men, and the feat was not uncommon enough to excite remark.\n\nThe better class of people charter little schooners to take them where they want to go, if the expense is not greater than they can stand; for this is apt to be a costly undertaking. If one chances to be becalmed, as often happens, or is forced by stress of weather to take refuge in some harbor or bight, the voyage is indefinitely prolonged. Ten days is not an uncommonly long time to consume in travelling from one end of the group to the other.\n\nYet the life of the Bahaman, especially the lower-class native, is a life full of romance. A primitive existence, a superstitious, imaginative mind, and the great ocean with all its might and mystery encircling him, compensate for much of life s discomfort. From generation to generation the old tales of marooners and buccaneers are handed down.\n\nABORIGINAL TREASURE AND ARTEFACTS FOUND IN BAHAMAS CAVES\n\nEnough treasure has been found at various points to form a basis for marvellous tales, and also for some hair-brained expeditions. Caves have produced images carved by forgotten hands, and bones (presumably) of aboriginal origin. A well in one place, and a circle of stones somewhere else, are witched.\n\nEvery island has its traditions, and every tradition is more or less believed. Wrecks, smuggling, feats of prowess in storm, and of endurance in stress, all become the components of a not unattractive border life, and would doubtless, in any other age than ours, crystallize into an interesting chapter of folklore. The time of all others to hear a provincial raconteur is on a moonlight night, when a number of men congregate about the fishing-boats, or upon some spar that lies at the end of a rocky point whence an approaching sail may be first sighted. The narrator becomes interested, gesticulates freely, even acts the more exciting parts of his story, while the little audience good-humored-ly applaud with laughter that is seldom boisterous or prolonged, and occasionally add such remarks as: \u201cDat ain t so coarse,\u201d \u201cDa s righ ,\u201d or \u201cHi! e tellin urn now, for true.\u201d\n\nNEGRO HOME LIFE\n\nIn his home-life the negro is, strangely enough, usually contented and kind. I say strangely, because the tie that binds these black bodies to each other is not\n\nof the strongest. It is formed and broken frequently without legal or churchly aid or intervention. But the children, I am convinced, would compare favorably in their manners and appearance with young people of similar grade in any part of the world.\n\nMany of the inhabitants are banded together in societies, whose object is to care for the sick and dying, and provide for the families of disabled or deceased members. Upon high days and holidays these societies love to parade with all the pomp and circumstance of wide scarfs, flaunting banners, and gorgeous bands. A band may be composed of one or two wind instruments (difficult to identify), a drum, triangle, concertina, and tambourine, and afford more solid satisfaction to its patrons than the performance would seem to warrant.\n\nThe societies divide with the churches the duty of satisfying the organizing instinct. Three denominations, Episcopal, Baptist, and Methodist, share a somewhat imperfect sway over the consciences and lives of the people. The race-love for show leads many of the stranger within their gates. Their costumes are wildly grotesque, home-made affairs, that enhance the drollery of the dances, grimaces, and antics of the performers.\n\nREFERENCE TO JOHNNY CANOE AT CHRISTMAS AND FUNERAL TRADITIONS\n\nBefore and behind these masquers, who are generically known as \u201cJohnny Canoe,\u201d come troops of children, half afraid and wholly delighted with the performance. Fire-crackers play an important part in the Christmas observance, just as on the Fourth of July with us. Indeed, \u201d any noise, good or bad,\u201d is acceptable.\n\nAs in all small communities, weddings and their festal opposite, funerals, make large demands upon popular interest. A wedding affords opportunities that the more sombre funeral does colored people into the fold of the Established Church, where they are satisfied with ritualistic observance, while others find in the freer chapels of Methodist and Baptist persuasion that peculiar bliss that emotional natures enjoy when exchanging the experiences of a common faith.\n\nA chapel is a sort of safety-valve for the pent\u2013up emotions of men who elsewhere appear singularly quiet and repressed.\n\nHowever, on one day in the year at least, an exception is made to the general rule of orderliness and decorum. After the church services Christmas Day, the towns are given over to the merrymakers, who go in companies through the streets, masked and hideously apparelled. They play every conceivable prank upon their brethren and incessantly demand money from their more exalted townsmen or from the not; yet I think that the general enjoyment of the latter is more keen. To meet solemnly at some neighbor\u2019s house in the unaccustomed garb of holy days; to talk in whispers of the departed brother or sister, with sundry digressions on every known topic under the tropic sun ; to wait through the hour during which the people are assembling and the mournful preliminaries arranged, while the hush grows more profound, afford a melancholy satisfaction. The mocking-bird that sings lustily from his perch in yonder cotton-tree, or the wood-dove that calls from the tamarind in the next yard, are the only living creatures that do not seem to feel the presence of the mysterious visitor. The guests at length take their places in the procession that forms at the gate and walks to the quiet graveyard, preceded by the bearers and the dead.\n\nIt is a rite to satisfy the negro\u2019s easily moved soul. How slow and eminently decorous is that assemblage. The afternoon sun makes long shadows for each mourner, for five o clock is the usual time for funerals. The white sand of the streets, walled by the white calcareous rock fences, crowned with palm and cork, anaconda bush and jessamine, glitters beneath the hundred dusky feet that impress it. Yonder, after you have passed those few houses, innocent of windows, and roofed with thatch-palm, you are suddenly face to face with a high wall, behind which a few trees look over in a melancholy fashion. The gates are open, and the funeral procession follows that way after the bearers, who have already entered. A few mounds, fewer still having head-stones, lie in the shade of the cedars, or are sprinkled with the white falling oleander blossoms.\n\nAnd here, after a life scarcely less unobtrusive and quiet, we leave the islander to continue his repose."}, {"url": "https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/prolific-writer", "page_content": "collocation in English\n\nmeanings of prolific and writer\n\nThese words are often used together.

After receiving a Classics degree from Oxford and spending a brief spell in Paris, Arnold spent most of his life working as a schools inspector. He was elected to the Oxford Professorship of Poetry in 1857. Arnold was an author of both poetry and criticism. His verse includes: The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems (1847), Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems (1852), and New Poems (1867), as well as the classical verse tragedy Merope (1858). Together with Tennyson and Browning, Arnold has been held by critics as one of the representative poets of his age because of his poetry\u2019s difficult negotiations of the legacy of Romanticism and its clear expression of the Victorian zeitgeist, evident, for instance, in the analysis of religious doubt contained in one of his most famous poems, \u201cDover Beach.\u201d His prolific prose canon includes cornerstones of 19th-century intellectual and critical history such as On Translating Homer (1861), Essays in Criticism (1865) and Culture and Anarchy (1869). The influence of Arnold\u2019s literary, social, and religious criticism has been immense. His work appears so representative of the Victorian age because of its constant effort to understand and scrutinize modernity. Like many other Victorian authors, however, Arnold suffered a period of neglect and hostility in the early 20th century; but his works are now once again recognized as classics and attract a great deal of critical attention both from literary scholars and cultural historians.\n\nback to top"}]}
