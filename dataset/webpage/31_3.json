In 2014, Peter mounted an underdog campaign to unseat a popular six-term incumbent Republican in the primary election, closing a 25-point margin and eventually securing a 14-point victory. In November 2014, he would go on to become the first resident of the Village of Lombard in 140 years to be elected to the General Assembly.\n\nIn November 2018, Breen lost a tight reelection in the midst of the national \u201cBlue Wave,\u201d with House Speaker Michael Madigan spending over $2 Million against Breen, outspending Breen\u2019s underdog campaign roughly 3 to 1. Breen concluded his two terms with 32 bills passed into law, more than any other second term legislator. His bills saved small businesses and nonprofits millions, protected seniors from having their estates raided by scammers, and shined a bright spotlight on the activities and spending of Illinois\u2019 many thousands of units of government. He enjoyed consistently high marks for his support of small businesses, manufacturing and technology jobs, lower taxes and balanced budgets, a healthier environment, craft brewers and organic farmers, transparency and openness, and free speech and personal freedoms.\n\nAn attorney by training, Peter left a lucrative private law practice in Chicago in 2004 to enter full-time public service. One year later, Peter founded a local not-for-profit, mobilizing hundreds of volunteers who have since served thousands of pregnant women in need and their children in DuPage and Will counties. He spearheaded the Chicagoland Project Gabriel campaign, which distributed tens of thousands of \u201cPregnant? Need Help?\u201d bumper stickers throughout local churches to reach out to women in difficult and untimely pregnancies. In 2008, Peter joined the Thomas More Society, a national not-for-profit law firm that focuses on the defense of First Amendment rights. As Vice President and Senior Counsel for the Society, Peter represents churches, organizations, and individuals in state and federal courts across the country, and he regularly advises state and federal elected officials on the effects of proposed legislation. Peter is sought out by local and national television, radio, and print media as an expert legal analyst.\n\nPeter served as an elected Trustee on the Lombard Village Board from 2011-2014, stepping in as Lombard\u2019s Acting Village President in 2012-13. One of his first initiatives as a trustee was authoring and securing passage of the strongest municipal transparency policy in the state of Illinois, earning Lombard a rare 100% transparency rating from the Illinois Policy Institute. When he took over as Acting Village President, Peter initiated a line-by-line review of the Village\u2019s proposed 2013 annual budget, identifying and cutting over half a million dollars in spending without the loss of Village services. He then ensured that those savings were returned to Lombard taxpayers by permanently eliminating the Village\u2019s annual vehicle sticker and fee. The next year, Peter led a successful fight to freeze property taxes in the Lilac Village, which was the first property tax relief residents experienced in 20 years.\n\nDuring his time as Trustee, Peter served as Chairperson of the Lombard Economic & Community Development Committee. Under Peter\u2019s leadership, the Committee took on numerous initiatives to help downtown Lombard and to improve the business climate generally in the village. He sponsored and worked to pass the Lombard \u201coutdoor dining\u201d program, rolling back unnecessary regulations to allow new outdoor dining options in the downtown area. He also started downtown Lombard\u2019s \u201cOutdoor Game Watches,\u201d bringing in hundreds of new patrons to shop at local businesses. In order to encourage lower prices for taxi service and to allow Lombard-based livery businesses to grow, Peter rewrote the Lombard Taxi Ordinance to wipe away outdated regulations and to allow a wider variety of vehicles to service residents\u2019 transport needs.\n\nIn 2009, Peter founded \u201cBanRedCams,\u201d a grassroots initiative that sought to ban unfair and punitive red light cameras in Lombard and surrounding communities. Lombard removed its cameras shortly thereafter. As a Village Trustee, Peter successfully worked to prevent garnishment of residents\u2019 state tax refunds to pay red light camera ticket fees.\n\nIn 2019, Peter began the Fair Maps Initiative to remove the redistricting power from Michael Madigan. This initiative would give voters the opportunity to pass a referendum in the 2020 November elections to amend the Illinois Constitution. If passed, redistricting would be put into the hands of a bipartisan commission, ending gerrymandering in Illinois. The goal is to give more residents in Illinois a voice when choosing representatives.\n\nPeter earned his Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, completing the program in just 3 years. Peter earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame, which he attended on scholarship. He is a member of the Father Boecker Council of the Knights of Columbus and is an Eagle Scout. Peter and his wife Margie have been married for 14 years, and they are the proud parents of two sons, Matthew Elijah, whom they adopted in August 2016, and James Francis, whom they adopted in September 2018.\n\nsource: VoteBreen.com"}, {"url": "https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/49722/did-i-get-or-take-my-degree-from-or-in-the-university-of-somewhere", "page_content": "Firstly, a master's degree is not proper and therefore does not require capitalization, but personally I've seen several highly professional institutions spell it both ways.\n\nSeeing as how all three of those sentences are grammatically sound, it's more a question of etiquette or regional custom.

Breen and Renee Romberger Breen in memory of their son, Peter. The purpose of this award is to recognize undergraduate students enrolled in the Eberly College of Science at The Pennsylvania State University who are majoring in or planning to major in Chemistry and who have demonstrated excellence in academics and research focused in chemistry.\n\nThe inaugural recipient of the award was Ailiena Maggiolo, a rising senior working in the laboratory of Amie Boal, an Assistant Professor in Chemistry/BMB. Ailiena has worked in the Boal group for the past two years on several different projects involving x-ray structure determination of biological catalysts that use transition metal ions as part of their catalytic cycle. Her efforts to date have helped us understand more about enzymatic halogenation reactions, a chemically challenging transformation of interest for its potential to make certain synthetic chemistry applications more environmentally-friendly. She has also worked on a DNA biosynthesis enzyme that is an important antibiotic drug target, helping to discover novel chemistry associated with versions of the catalyst found exclusively in certain types of bacteria that cause infections in humans and animals. Ailiena\u2019s work has already appeared in prominent scientific journals with more to come prior to completion of her B.S. degree in Spring 2017. In her nomination letter, Professor Boal stated, \u201cAiliena\u2019s persistence in setting up a research opportunity in my lab is notable \u2013 when I took too long to respond to an initial inquiry via email, she waited outside my office. I\u2019m very grateful that she went to such lengths. Ailiena has proved to be a remarkably ambitious and productive trainee and she has helped initiate several new research directions in my lab.\u201d Ailiena intends to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry after graduation.\n\nThe award was given for the first time at the chemistry graduation reception on May 7th, in honor and memory of Peter Craig Breen, who was a chemistry major at Penn State from 2010 through 2014. Peter was a gifted student who excelled in high school and was selected as a National Merit finalist. Peter chose during his senior year to attend Penn State. He saw many opportunities to continue to learn and grow at the university and was following a family legacy of Penn Staters, which includes both of his parents, Renee and Kevin, as well as an uncle, aunts, and his brother, Scott.\n\nPeter enrolled at Penn State in 2010 as a Braddock Scholar and a Schreyer\u2019s Scholar in The Eberly College of Science with a major in chemistry. He immediately pursued a computational chemistry research position involving the study of RNA in Phil Bevilacqua\u2019s lab. Working in the Bevilacqua lab quickly became an important and enjoyable part of his studies, while the lab and the group became an extended campus home and family for Peter.\n\nNot only was he heavily involved in research during his studies, but Peter was also dedicated to assisting his fellow students and peers. He found fulfillment in helping others, and sought out opportunities to do so throughout his undergraduate career. Peter worked under the direction of Joe Keiser as both a tutor in the chemistry resource room and a teaching assistant in chemistry courses. Other interests of Peter\u2019s included travel and pursuing exposure to chemistry beyond the academic setting, fulfilled during his time as an intern in industry at the University in Freiburg, Germany for a summer.\n\nPeter had planned to continue pursuing his passion for research in bioinformatics, and was accepted into three Ph.D. programs before his passing in 2014. Penn State conferred a B.S. degree in Chemistry with honors posthumously to his family in May 2014.\n\nPeter\u2019s friends and family felt that it would be fitting to establish a research award in his name so that his passion for scientific discovery would continue on after him. The award is intended to honor undergraduate students who are dedicated to excellence in research and who are driven by a spirit similar to Peter\u2019s."}, {"url": "https://reilly.nd.edu/undergraduate/dual-degree/", "page_content": "Dual Degree\n\nIn a world increasingly challenged by new developments in technology and science, it is particularly important that those most intimately engaged in the creation and implementation of technology have skills that go beyond technical competence and the opportunity to reflect deeply on the world their technical work will transform. The Reilly Dual Degree Program in Arts and Letters/Engineering is designed to make this possible.\n\nEstablished in the 1960s, the program enables engineering students to combine professional training in a field of engineering with richer expertise in humanistic, artistic, and social scientific disciplines than would be possible within the confines of a four-year engineering degree program alone.\n\nTo achieve its goals, the AL/ENG Program requires five full academic years of study. However, those who complete the program receive, in turn, two degrees, a bachelor of science degree from the College of Engineering and a bachelor of arts degree from the College of Arts and Letters.\n\n\u201cAn engineer with a strong liberal arts background is a valuable asset in today\u2019s business world. You\u2019re going to stand out because you will have the ability to use both sides of your brain.\u201d \u2014Craig Simon, chief operating officer of Titan Industries, Inc. and 1989 dual degree alumnus (mechanical engineering and history).\n\nEnrollment in the Program\n\nTo take full advantage of the program, students are encouraged to join the AL/ENG Program during their sophomore year, but applications to the program will be accepted up until Spring break of their junior year if the students are able to meet all the program requirements.\n\n\n\nTo enroll in the program, students should contact Patrick Gamez (219 O'Shaughnessy Hall), write a short statement of interest, and fill out a registration form. Professor Gamez is holding office hours on Mondays from 2:30-4 or by appointment.\n\nStudents then meet with their Assistant Dean in the College of Arts and Letters, and with Assistant Dean Michael Ryan in the College of Engineering, who will assist them in determining their schedules. After enrollment in the program, regular consultation with the deans, as well as the student's faculty advisers in their Engineering and Arts and Letters majors, is strongly advised.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nStudents accepted into the Reilly Dual Degree Program in Arts and Letters/Engineering are Reilly Scholars and, through the generosity of the Reilly Endowment, gain access to five years of need-based eligibility for financial aid. This is administered through the Notre Dame Office of Financial Aid and includes \u201cpreferential packaging\u201d \u2014 a heightened effort to provide students with grant rather than loan assistance \u2014 during the final years.\n\nIn 1985, an alumnus of the AL/ENG Program, Mr. John D. Reilly (BA 1963, BS Engineering 1964) established a scholarship in honor of his father to support students enrolled in the Reilly AL/EG Dual Degree Program.\n\nThe relatively high costs of a Notre Dame education can make the commitment to five, rather than four, years of academic study a difficult one. Students at Notre Dame enrolled in accredited five-year programs (e.g., architecture and AL/ENG) have the same entitlement to undergraduate financial aid from the University during their fifth year as they did during their first four years.\n\nThe Reilly Scholarship Program is in a position to further help by offering qualifying AL/ENG students scholarship dollars in place of non-scholarship financial aid (such as additional loans and/or campus employment). Priority for this \"preferential packaging\" continues to be on Reilly Scholars preparing to enter their fifth and final year in the AL/ENG Program; if funds permit, preferential packaging may be awarded to fourth-year students as well. In recent years, as many as 22 AL/ENG students annually have received Reilly Scholarship support.\n\nStudents who wish to be eligible for financial aid in the fifth year must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS PROFILE applications in April of their fourth year (as they may have done during their earlier years at Notre Dame).\n\nNotre Dame's Office of Financial Aid administers the financial aid application and award processes for all five years, and students should contact Financial Aid for more information, or to discuss their particular circumstances. We recommended that all fourth-year AL/ENG students submit the financial aid applications even if they have not previously qualified for University financial aid."}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-notre-dame-1840", "page_content": "University of Notre Dame is a private institution that was founded in 1842.

Baum Memorial Elder Law Lecture\n\nIn remembrance of the life of Mrs. Ann F. Baum, a gift through her estate has endowed the Ann F. Baum Memorial Elder Law Lecture. This lecture series seeks to promote the relevant and timely discussion of broad range of issues relating to the intersection of public policy, the law, and the elderly.\n\nMrs. Baum was born November 11, 1922, into a poor Irish Catholic family. A life-long resident of the Chicago area, Mrs. Baum grew up with seven siblings. She and her husband, the late Alvin H. Baum, operated an investment firm in Chicago. Mr. Baum passed away in 1982, and Mrs. Baum passed away in 2005.\n\nMrs. Baum and her late husband were compassionate individuals who supported a broad array of charities as well as providing direct support to needy individuals. Targets of their giving included the disadvantaged, the young, the elderly, religious organizations, educational organizations, and civic organizations. Their legacy of giving and sharing is continued through the Alvin H. Baum Family Fund of which Alvin and Ann were both benefactors.\n\nThe Ann F. Baum Memorial Elder Law Lecture constitutes a fitting memorial to a woman who was deeply concerned with the rights and issues pertaining to elderly people in our society.\n\nDavid C. Baum Memorial Lecture on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights\n\nThe family and friends of David C. Baum endowed the David C. Baum Memorial Lecture on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights not only in his memory, but at his request.\n\nDeep concern for the dignity and rights of all people was central to Professor Baum\u2019s character and activities. After receiving his undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, Professor Baum served as law clerk for Justice Walter V. Schaefer of the Illinois Supreme Court, 1959-60. He then practiced law with the Chicago firm of Ross, McGowan, Hardies and O\u2019Keefe until he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois College of Law in 1963.\n\nProfessor Baum was an inspiration to his student and colleagues, not only because of the excellence of his teaching, scholarship, and public service, but because of his remarkable human qualities. Conscientious and judicious, blending passion for justice with dispassionate objectivity, he inspired the highest level of discourse and endeavor in all who had the privilege of knowing and working with him.\n\nIt is hoped that the David C. Baum Memorial Lecture on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights will constitute a fitting memorial to a man whose unrelenting intellectual vigor and moral commitment made his presence in the world of law invaluable.\n\nVacketta-DLA Piper Lecture on the Role of Government and the Law\n\nThis series was made possible through the generosity of Carl Vacketta, \u201965, and DLA Piper, which has more than 4,200 lawyers in offices in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States; and represents more clients in a broader range of geographies and practice disciplines than any other law firm in the world.\n\nThe Vacketta-DLA Piper Lecture Series is a component of The Marbury Institute, named for William L. Marbury, Jr. (1901-1988), who was instrumental in the development of the firm and devoted his career to public and community service. The Institute serves as DLA Piper\u2019s initiative to promote the highest ideals of the legal profession.\n\nPaul M. Van Arsdell, Jr. Memorial Lecture on Litigation and the Legal Profession\n\nIn commemoration of the life and accomplishments of Paul M. Van Arsdell, Jr., the law firm of Latham and Watkins, the Van Arsdell family, and his many friends, colleagues, and clients endowed the Paul M. Van Arsdell, Jr. Memorial Lecture on Litigation and the Legal Profession. This lecture series promotes thoughtful discussion on litigation and dispute resolution systems and the highest ethical ideals of the legal profession.\n\nMr. Van Arsdell received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1969 and master\u2019s degree in 1971 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After serving as an officer in the United States Army from 1971 until 1973, he returned to the University of Illinois where he received his law degree in 1977, earning a Rickert Award for Legal Writing and serving as managing editor of the University of Illinois Law Forum.\n\nFollowing his graduation from law school, Mr. Van Arsdell clerked for Judge John Godbold of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Montgomery, Alabama. He began his practice in 1978 as an associate for the Chicago-based law firm of Hedlund, Hunter and Lynch, moving to their Los Angeles office in 1980. In 1982 the firm merged with Latham and Watkins; Mr. Van Arsdell became a partner in 1985.\n\nMr. Van Arsdell was an outstanding young litigator involved in consumer law and was a role model for younger attorneys. He was regarded by his colleagues as a very hard-working attorney and regularly shared his experiences and expertise with others. He became the youngest head of the firm\u2019s finance committee, a demonstration of the firm\u2019s deep respect for him and his work.\n\nDean\u2019s Lecture Series\n\nDean\u2019s Public Engagement Lecture\n\nThe Dean\u2019s Public Engagement Lecture Series aims to increase interaction between the legal academy, the legal and business professions, and the public.\n\nHosted by Dean Vikram David Amar, the Series brings distinguished judges, lawyers, and businesspersons to the College of Law to talk on cutting-edge issues affecting law, justice, business, and government."}, {"url": "https://law.illinois.edu/", "page_content": "you could follow your passion to pay it forward?\n\nyou didn\u2019t have to spend your law career paying for it?\n\nyou had 11,000 alumni ready to meet you?\n\nyou chose a law school that is intensely focused on bar exam success?\n\nyour capstone semester was spent in the heart of Chicago?"}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/BreenPeter", "page_content": "Peter I.

The Law Review provides practitioners, judges, professors, and law students with cogent analyses of important topics in the law.\n\nThe College of Law\u2019s history of student publication dates back to 1917, when a group of high-ranking students began to publish the Illinois Law Bulletin. The publication appeared as the Illinois Law Quarterly from 1922 until 1924. Students of the College joined with editors from the Northwestern and University of Chicago law schools from 1924 to 1932 to publish the Illinois Law Review. Between 1932 and 1948, students of the College published a \u201ccurrent law section\u201d in the Illinois Bar Journal. In 1949, the University of Illinois Law Forum was established as a quarterly under the guidance of then-Professor John E. Cribbet. During the next three decades, the Law Forum became one of the twenty most widely circulated law reviews in the country. In 1980, in an effort to more accurately reflect the contents of the journal, the members voted to change its name from Law Forum to Law Review.\n\nThe editorial policy and control of the Law Review has evolved as well. From 1949 to 1968, a faculty editor and faculty committee published the lead section, while the Board of Student Editors prepared the student section. In 1968-69, the Board assumed control of the entire publication. In 2001, the Board of Editors increased the number of issues per Volume from four to five.\n\nLectures & Symposia\n\nSince 1973-74, the College of Law has hosted the David C. Baum Memorial Lecture Series on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights. The Law Review, in turn, invites the Baum Lecturers to publish their work in the journal.\n\nAbout the David C. Baum Memorial Lecture Series on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights\n\nDavid C. Baum, 1934-1973\n\nThe family and friends of David C. Baum endowed the David C. Baum Memorial Lecture Series on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights not only in his memory, but at his request.\n\nDeep concern for the dignity and rights of all people was central to Professor Baum\u2019s character and activities. After receiving his undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, Professor Baum served as law clerk for Justice Walter V. Schaefer of the Illinois Supreme Court, 1959-60.

Conscientious and judicious, blending passion for justice with dispassionate objectivity, he inspired the highest level of discourse and endeavor in all who had the privilege of knowing and working with him.\n\nIt is hoped that the David C.

Organized by Professor Tom Ginsburg and Professor Thomas Ulen, this conference explored issues such as treaty design, the role of customary international law, and the role of international law in national level governance. The Law Review looks forward to publishing many of the articles and comments presented at the conference in the first issue of its 2008 Volume.\n\nVolume 2007 Symposium \u2013 Consumer Bankruptcy and Credit in the Wake of the 2005 Act\n\nOn April 20, 2005, President George W. Bush signed into law the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). BAPCPA not only brought the most sweeping changes to the United States bankruptcy laws since the enactment of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, but also marked a radical reorientation in the fundamental nature and premises of consumer bankruptcy in this country.\n\nIn April 2006, one year after the enactment of this controversial reform, over a dozen of the leading bankruptcy scholars in North America explored the significance and impact of the new law on consumer bankruptcy and credit at a conference organized by Professor Charles Tabb and Professor Ralph Brubaker. The symposium participants\u2019 papers were published in the January 2007 issue of the Law Review.\n\nMembership\n\nBecoming a Member of the University of Illinois Law Review\n\nThere are two ways to become a member of the University of Illinois Law Review. Generally, a student may be invited to become a member based on a writing competition held before the beginning of the fall semester or by writing a note that is selected for publication in the Law Review.\n\nWriting Competition\n\nBefore the beginning of each fall semester, the Editor-in-Chief invites the top-ranking applicants to become members of the Law Review. The Board will invite a minimum of 30 participants for membership. If there are 3 first-year sections, the top 5 ranking applicants (based on class rank) from each first-year section, if they have also made a good faith effort in the writing competition, will receive invitations. If there are 4 first-year sections, the top 4 ranking applicants (based on class rank) from each first-year section, if they have also made a good faith effort in the writing competition, will receive invitations. \u201cGood faith effort\u201d is defined as a paper that falls within the top 75% of the papers submitted. The remaining needs of the membership will be filled by selecting applicants with the highest scores on the writing competition who have at least two remaining semesters and are in good academic standing. Transfer Students are eligible and encouraged to participate in the writing competition.\n\n\u201cNote on\u201d Admission Procedure\n\nIn addition to the writing competition admission procedure, any student who has previously participated in the writing competition or who, upon application to the Editor-in-Chief, can show good cause for failure to participate, and who is in good academic standing may be invited to become a member by participating in the \u201cNote On\u201d option.\n\nAll College of Law students in good standing will have equal opportunity to have their submissions evaluated without prejudice under the blind-grading scheme established by the Board to review note submissions and shall be allowed to submit a note for evaluation at any time the Board accepts submissions from Law Review Members. All submissions must comply with the student note submission guidelines set forth below.\n\nShould the Board decide to publish a note written by an eligible student who is not already a member of the Law Review, the announcement of the student\u2019s selection for publication shall be accompanied by an invitation for the student to join the Law Review as a member beginning at the start of the subsequent academic semester.\n\nWithout affecting any student\u2019s right to submit a note for the Board\u2019s consideration, no first-year student at the College of Law shall be eligible to receive an invitation for membership under this Note On procedure.\n\nAny member invited under the \u201cnote on\u201d provision will, upon becoming a member, assume all privileges and obligations of membership.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nThis year\u2019s deadline for student note submissions is 5:00 PM on March 15, 2013. All submissions should be turned in to the Law Review office (Room 245).\n\nAny nonmembers who are planning to submit notes and any returning members who are planning to resubmit their notes must contact Jennifer Duffy before 5:00 PM on March 13, 2013 to receive a note entry number. Students failing to contact Jennifer by this time WILL NOT be allowed to submit a note for consideration.\n\nEach submission must consist of six stapled copies including entry number on each page of each copy and NO NAME OR OTHER IDENTIFYING MARK. In order to preserve the anonymity of each submission, all formatting must meet the following specifics:\n\nLength: Notes are usually around 40 double-spaced pages of publishable quality text and an appropriate number of triple-spaced pages of endnotes. These are merely guidelines. Margins: All margins on all pages should be 1-1/2 inches. Copies: Six copies of each note must be submitted by the deadline. Type: All notes must be typewritten. No exceptions. Text and endnotes should be in 12-point Times New Roman font. Pagination: Please number your pages.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all publication decisions are contingent upon the production of an acceptable post-publication decision draft. The Board reserves the right to make stylistic and other necessary changes to this post-acceptance draft. Some of the factors that the Board will consider in making publication decisions include: (1) depth of research, (2) complexity or importance of the issues discussed, (3) organization of the paper, (4) depth of analysis, (5) creativity of analysis, (6) resolution of the issues, (7) clarity and style of writing, and (8) proper citation form.\n\nNote: A nonmember who writes a note that is selected for publication in the Law Review may be eligible to become a member of the Law Review under the \u201cNote-On\u201d Admissions Procedure."}]}
