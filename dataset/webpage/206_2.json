At four years old his father built him a kart and soon after enrolled him in the local kart club Kerpen Horrom. Michael\u2019s problem was that in Germany the regulations stated the minimum permissible age to obtain a kart license was 14. To get around this he obtained a Luxembourg license (obtainable from the age of 12). However in 1983 he obtained his German license and the year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship. From 1985 Schumacher drove for Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert and once again took the title.\n\nIn 1989 Michael signed with Willi Weber, whose team WTS he would drive for during 1989 and 1990 in the Formula 3 Championship. Weber paid the costs for both seasons (approximately 1 million DM). In the 1989 season Karl Wendlinger was champion, with Michael finishing 3rd behind Heinz-Harald Frentzen.\n\nDuring 1990 and 1991 Schumacher moved into sports car racing, instead of the more usual step up to Formula 3000. Many managers believed this would block his progression to Formula 1, but Weber believed that exposure to professional press conferences and dealing with the cars of 700bhp would be beneficial.\n\nFormula 1\n\nThe Belgian Grand Prix of 1991 at Spa was Michael\u2019s debut in the world\u2019s top racing series. His lucky break came as a result of Bertrand Gachot being imprisoned for spraying CS gas into a London taxi driver\u2019s face. Qualifying 7th, he unfortunately retired on the first lap from this race with clutch failure of his Jordan-Ford. Although Eddie Jordan wished to sign Michael to the team, Schumacher was advised by Weber to act cautiously, as Jordan was to use factory Yamaha power the following year. They suspected this engine might prove to be second class and they were proved correct.\n\n\n\nSubsequent to this Michael moved to the Benetton team, replacing Roberto Moreno. He competed in five more grand prix that season with Nelson Piquet as team mate. In 1992 Schumacher was partnered with Martin Brundle and his first victory was 1 year after his debut at Spa. During 1993 Ricardo Patrese partnered Michael, that being Patrese\u2019s last year in F1. Michael\u2019s second win came at the 1993 Portuguese GP.\n\nIn the 1994 season with an under powered Ford Zetec V8 he took his first Driver\u2019s Championship, after the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola. It came after a season of several run-ins with the FIA and he was disqualified from the British and Belgian Grands Prix. Michael was also put under a two race ban during the Italian and Portuguese GP that year. The race bans were a result of not adhering to a black flag (driver disqualified) at Silverstone that year. Instead of coming in, he continued on to win the race \u2013 the team had hoped that a later appeal would overturn the disqualification and hence keep the victory he obtained. The disqualification was a result of Michael overtaking Damon Hill on the parade lap, a seemingly psychological manoeuvre. In a controversial last round at the Australian GP Michael entered leading Damon Hill by one point. On the 36th lap Schumacher made an unbecoming mistake and banged the wall, damaging his rear suspension. He made it back on the track and as Damon Hill came to pass him on the next corner, Michael turned in on the Williams car. Hill\u2019s front suspension was badly damaged and both cars were out of the race. Hence Michael gained the crown.\n\nThe 1995 season was just as successful. Schumacher now had Renault power, to match the Williams and he dominated the season. It was marred however by several collisions between himself and Hill. In a particularly stupid overtaking manoeuvre Hill took them both out of the British GP near the start of the race. Having taken 9 GP wins, Michael finished the season to take his second Championship.\n\nThe 1996 season saw Michael move to Ferrari with a reported salary of $30 million He stated the need for a new challenge as his reasoning, it being to return Ferrari to the pinnacle of motorsport. Eddie Irvine moved from Jordan to become his team mate in the same year. The Ferrari F310 car had poor handling and it was a testament to Michael\u2019s ability that he managed to gain three wins. One of his wins, at the Spanish GP of that year was a wet race and is regarded as one of the best drives ever. His method of attaining time from the car resulted in somewhat flamboyant and uncharacteristic driving, with oversteering et al. With a lack of competitors Hill finally managed to take the world championship.\n\nWith Damon Hill being dumped from Williams in 1997, Michael\u2019s main rival became former CART champion Jacques Villeneuve. The Ferrari was more reliable and a somewhat less than spectacular early season for Villeneuve allowed Michael to provide a challenge. He took 5 GP wins and at the last race of the season Michael was ahead in the championship by just one point. Mid way through leading the race in Jerez, Schumacher\u2019s lap times began to drop off and concern was raised about the condition of his car. As Villeneuve came to pass on a corner, Michael turned in on him. His wheel banged the Canadian\u2019s sidepod but the Williams seemed undamaged. Michael wound up in a gravel trap and was out of the race, with Villeneuve finishing third to take the title. In a decision by the FIA Schumacher was disqualified from the whole of the season as punishment for his manoeuvre in that race.\n\nIn 1998 the McLaren\u2019s dominating the season convincingly and Michael was the only driver to come near them to provide a challenge. With the Ferrari improving significantly throughput the season and being particularly faster in the second half, Michael gained 6 wins and 5 other podiums. With the later outlawed mini sidepod wings the Ferrari\u2019s took an historic 1-2 at the Italian GP at Imola that year.\n\nMichael\u2019s accident at the British GP in 1999 ended his chances of taking the title in that year. Prior to that it looked very probable that he would take it. Looking back on the season and the relative performances of McLaren and Ferrari it seems likely he would have done so. The fact that Irvine was so close to Hakkinen in the championship at the end, surely indicates that Schumacher would have had it wrapped up long before, had he been able to compete. However he returned to drive the second two races of the season and astounded the paddock with his speed, leaving the pack behind. Excuses from drivers such as Coulthard and Irvine included that he\u2019d had a nice rest at home and they were tired out after a full season of races.\n\nMichael regained the F1 Driver\u2019s title in 2000 and then won it every year up to and including 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the streak ended with the Ferrari cars\u2019 pace outdone by Renault, whose driver Fernando Alonso took the title in both years. Michael retired as a driver at the end fo the 2006 season, as the most successful F1 driver ever. He then took up a position as consultant to Ferrari.\n\nAfter Ferrari driver was injured, there was specualtion that Michael would return to F1 racing as a stand in for the 2009 season. However, a neck injury from motorcycle racing prevented that. Nevertheless, Michael did return to Formula 1 in the 2010 season on a three year contract with the Mercedes team. He then raced for three seasons, including 2011 and 2012 before once again retiring.\n\nRacing Results\n\nKarting\n\nYear Position Championship 1984 1st German Junior Kart Championship 1985 1st\n\n2nd German Junior Kart Championship\n\nJunior World Kart Championship 1986 3rd\n\n2nd\n\n3rd German Senior Kart Championship\n\nEuropean Kart Championship (North Zone)\n\nEuropean Kart Championship Final 1987 1st\n\n2nd\n\n1st German Senior Kart Championship\n\nEuropean Kart Championship (North Zone)\n\nEuropean Kart Championship Final\n\nSingle Seater\n\nYear Position Championship 1988 1st\n\n2nd\n\n6th German Formula K\u00f6nig Championship\n\nEuropean Formula Ford 1600 Championship\n\nGerman Formula Ford 1600 Championship 1989 2nd (*) German Formula 3 Championship 1990 1st\n\nDQ German Formula 3 Championship\n\nEuropean Formula 3 Cup 1991 2nd All-Japan Formula 3000 Championship\n\nSports Car\n\nYear Position Championship 1990 DNF\n\n5th (=) German Touring Car Championship\n\nSports-Prototype World Championship 1991 DNF\n\n9th (=) German Touring Car Championship\n\nSports-Prototype World Championship\n\nFormula 1\n\nDetailed race and season results can be found at www.f1db.de."}, {"url": "https://www.automobilsport.com/speedcar-series-herbert-johnny-win-bahrain-race-thomas-biagi-gianni-morbidelli-qatar---55015.html", "page_content": "24.01.2009 / MaP\n\nJean Alesi won the first Speedcar Series race of the weekend at the Bahrain International Circuit.

Karting is a young sport; six decades ago it didn\u2019t exist. Karting as we know it began in 1956 in Glendale, California, when Art Ingels, a fabricator at Kurtis Kraft (the era\u2019s dominant builder of Indianapolis 500 race cars) cobbled together a small, tube-frame machine powered by a 2-cycle lawn-mower engine.\n\nAfter showing off his contraption in a local parking lot, his friends went home and built their own machines. Soon, Ingels and his buddies were holding impromptu races in the Rose Bowl parking lot. By 1958, the first kart racing track was built in Azusa, California. The sport of kart racing was on its way.\n\nThe term \u201cGo-Kart\u201d was coined by Duffy Livingston, a muffler-shop owner in Los Angeles, who went on to manufacture and sell karts under the Go-Kart name \u2014 the first kart manufacturer. While Ingels may have built the first kart, Livingston is credited with launching its popularity.\n\nKart engines, from the late 1950s through today are mostly two-cycle, which deliver serious power in a small package. In 1959, McCulloch \u2014 of chainsaw fame \u2014 was the first company to produce dedicated kart engines. Clinton, Power Products and West Bend were rival engines.\n\n\n\nBy the 1960s karting \u2014 thanks to US servicemen \u2014 had spread to Europe, which saw the introduction of motorcycle engines (sans gearbox) before dedicated manufacturers, mostly from Italy, started to offer engines \u2014 Komet, Parilla, and Saetta.\n\nAs demonstrated by Ingels\u2019 original kart, early karts were breathtakingly simple. The rudimentary Ingels kart, for example, used a hand activated mechanical brake, and the motor was direct drive, meaning no clutch. Tires were made of hard industrial rubber. There was no suspension, just lightning-quick direct steering.\n\nKart design evolved during the late 1950s and early 1960s, but not much. Live (solid) rear axles and left-pedal-operated hydraulic disk brakes became the norm. Centrifugal clutches removed the need for push starts. More engines developed more power, many running on methanol. Tires became wider and grippier.\n\nKarting became instantly popular, thanks to publicity delivered by Hot Rod magazine and a host of new kart publications. Chassis manufacturers sprung up like mushrooms after a warm rain. Sears and Montgomery Ward even sold karts by mail order. Meanwhile, kart tracks appeared on any undeveloped square of asphalt. Just add hay bales and stir.\n\nPopular culture came along for the ride. Karts appeared in movies, like \u201cBikini Beach,\u201d starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Other celebs caught behind the wheel of a kart include Steve McQueen, James Garner, Roy Orbison (pictured above), director Alfred Hitchcock, and The Beatles. Eventually, the \u201cfad\u201d of karting waned leaving the sport to develop into a serious form of motorsport.\n\nIn the U.S., kart racing was first was managed by the Go Kart Club of America, and later by the International Kart Federation and World Karting Association. Internationally, karting fell under the domain of the CIK/FIA world governing body, which still oversees competition around the world, including the World Karting Championships. In the U.S., the IKF, WKA, and SKUSA (SuperKarts USA) call the shots.\n\nWhile the karts are small, the skill set required to build, tune, and drive one of them is large. Race craft, passing technique, and car control can all be developed in karts, thanks to quick steering, direct feedback, and hours and hours of affordable \u201cseat time.\u201d The list of professional drivers who earned their chops in karts proves the point. Formula One champions Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost, Fernando Alonso, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, to name but a few, all started in karts.\n\nBut it all began 61 years ago on a side street in Glendale, where an Indy car artisan whipped up a small 4-wheel diversion. The world of motorsports hasn\u2019t been the same since."}]}
