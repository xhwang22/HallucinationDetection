He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D. Sewall, a member of the firm.

He is best known for his book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell (1758). Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on Easter Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening' in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell and talk with angels, demons and other spirits and the Last Judgment had already occurred the year before, in 1757. For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works\u2014and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a \"Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ\" in True Christian Religion, which he published himself.

With his elder brother, Edward, he formed the firm of E. & A. Sewall and commenced work in the family yard on the Kennebec. The Holyhead, of some 1100 tons, launched in 1855, was the first of his eighty vessels. Upon Edward's death he took a son and a nephew as partners, and the firm in 1879 became A. Sewall & Company. Though English vessels, utilizing iron, steel, and steam, were driving the wooden American sailing vessels out of competition, the Sewalls specialized in the latter type, doing much to keep it alive in the period of decline. They generally retained ownership of the ships they built and at one time owned a fleet of more than twenty-five. Their shipwrights and captains were usually natives of the Kennebec valley. During the Civil War he refused to have his ships take advantage of British registry, and his Vigilant was captured on her maiden voyage by the Confederate raider, Sumter. In the decade following the war, the Sewalls turned out a number of celebrated ships, including the Undaunted, Eric the Red, El Capitan, Occidental, Oriental, Continental, Harvester, Reaper, Thrasher, and Granger. Then came a depression without even the usual \"ship a year, \" but in the early nineties they built their \"Big Four, \" the Rappahannock, Shenandoah, Susquehanna, and Roanoke, averaging more than 3000 tons. The next step was iron. Sewall was interested in Gen. Thomas W. Hyde's Bath Iron Works, organized in 1889, which built the Machias, Castine, and Katahdin for the new navy. After visiting England to study the latest methods he began to build steel sailing vessels, and in 1894 the steel Dirigo was launched. His last ship, launched a month after his death, was the William P. Frye, sunk January 28, 1915, the first American vessel sunk by the Germans in the World War. He was at various times president of the Eastern Railroad and of the Central Railroad, and a director of the Boston and Maine Railroad. From 1871 until his death he was president of the Bath National Bank. He was the most prominent of the Maine Democrats, those constant supporters of forlorn hopes in that Republican stronghold, but the only elective offices he ever received were as councilman and alderman in Bath. He was a delegate to the national conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888; in the next two campaigns he served on the executive committee of the Democratic national committee, and in 1896 he was nominated for vice-president on the fifth ballot and took an active part in the campaign.

He is best known for his book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell (1758). Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on Easter Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening' in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell and talk with angels, demons and other spirits and the Last Judgment had already occurred the year before, in 1757. For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works\u2014and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a \"Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ\" in True Christian Religion, which he published himself. Some followers of The Heavenly Doctrine believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully divinely inspired.\n\nNew!!: Arthur Sewall and Emanuel Swedenborg \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nGarret Augustus Hobart (June 3, 1844 \u2013 November 21, 1899) was the 24th Vice President of the United States, serving from 1897 until his death in 1899.\n\nNew!!: Arthur Sewall and Garret Hobart \u00b7 See more \u00bb\n\nHarold Marsh Sewall (January 3, 1860 \u2013 October 28, 1924) was an American politician and diplomat.\n\nNew!!: Arthur Sewall and Harold M.

He was a lineal descendant of Henry Sewall, mayor of Coventry, England, one of whose grandsons was married to Jane Dummer, and emigrated to Newbury, MA, in 1634. Samuel Sewall, who settled at York, ME, in 1708, had two sons: David, first U.S. judge for the district of Maine, appointed by Washington, and Dummer Sewall, a distinguished soldier and the great grandfather of Arthur Sewall. The latter obtained a lieutenancy under Amherst in the Canada campaign, and in 1775 joined the revolutionary army as a lieutenant colonel. After the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts, he was elected a senator from the state; he was also a memebr of the state convention which ratified the Constitution of the United States. The father of Arthur Sewall was one of the earliest and most prominent shipbuilder of Bath. He built his first ship, the Diana, a vessel of 199 tons burden, in 1823, and in 1841 launched the ship Rappahannock, which though of little over 1,000 tons burden, was at that time the largest ship afloat. He also held large interest in railroad and other important corporations. As his sons completed their education they joined their father in business, and Arthur on leaving shchool was sent in the interests of the firm to Prince Edward Island to buy timber for the shipyard at Bath. Returning, he entered the employs of his father's firm in 1853, and in 1854 formed, with his elder brother, the firm of E. & A. Sewall, which took over the business of the old firm of William D. Sewall and Clark & Sewall. On the death of the elder brother, in 1879, the name of the firm was changed to Arthur Sewall & Co., being made up of the senior partner, with his nephew, Samuel S. Sewall, and his second son, William D. Sewall. Since January, 1855, when the brothers launched their first ship, the Holyhead, a vessel of over 1,100 tons, one ship a year, on an average, has been built in the sewall shipyard. The largest and the best built wooden ships in the world are the product of this yad. With the giant Roanoke this era of ship-building was closed, and the firm turned its attention to building steel vessels, the ship Dirigo, launched in 1894, being the first of its class followed in quick succession by others of the largest size. Mr. Sewall had supreme faith in the ultimate maritime supremacy of the United States, and lost no opportunity, by public and private effort, to forward this end. He was prominent in other fields of commercial and industrial enterprise; was a director in the Maine Central railroad, and its president for nine years, 1884-93; was also president of the Eastern railroad, and the Boston and Maine, and director in the Mexican Central and other roads. He was president of the Bath National Bank, holding the office for 29 years, to the time of his death. He was the leader of the Democratic party in Maine, but held only minor political offices; was a delegate to the national Democratic convention at Baltimore in 1872; to that at Cincinnati in 1880, and delegate-at-large to that which nominated Cleveland in 1884. In 1888 he attended the convention at St. Louis, where he was elected a member of the Democratic national committee, and was a member of its executive committee for the campaign of that year. At the Chicago convention of 1892 he was elected to the same office. In 1896 he was nominated for the vice-presidency on the ticket with William J. Bryan. He was also a delegate to the national convention of 1900, and there elected again a member of the national committee. He was married in 1859, to Emma Duncan, daughter of Charles Crooker, a ship-builder and merchant, of Bath, ME, and, like her husband, a descendant of Samuel Sewall, of York. They had three sons, two of whom are living: Harold, consul-general at Samoa under Cleveland and Harrison; attached to the Berlin commission for the settlement of the Samoan affairs, and minister to Hawaii, under McKinley, to the time of its annexation, and William D.

With his elder brother, Edward, he formed the firm of E. & A. Sewall and commenced work in the family yard on the Kennebec. The Holyhead, of some 1100 tons, launched in 1855, was the first of his eighty vessels. Upon Edward's death he took a son and a nephew as partners, and the firm in 1879 became A. Sewall & Company. Though English vessels, utilizing iron, steel, and steam, were driving the wooden American sailing vessels out of competition, the Sewalls specialized in the latter type, doing much to keep it alive in the period of decline. They generally retained ownership of the ships they built and at one time owned a fleet of more than twenty-five. Their shipwrights and captains were usually natives of the Kennebec valley. During the Civil War he refused to have his ships take advantage of British registry, and his Vigilant was captured on her maiden voyage by the Confederate raider, Sumter. In the decade following the war, the Sewalls turned out a number of celebrated ships, including the Undaunted, Eric the Red, El Capitan, Occidental, Oriental, Continental, Harvester, Reaper, Thrasher, and Granger. Then came a depression without even the usual \"ship a year, \" but in the early nineties they built their \"Big Four, \" the Rappahannock, Shenandoah, Susquehanna, and Roanoke, averaging more than 3000 tons. The next step was iron. Sewall was interested in Gen. Thomas W. Hyde's Bath Iron Works, organized in 1889, which built the Machias, Castine, and Katahdin for the new navy. After visiting England to study the latest methods he began to build steel sailing vessels, and in 1894 the steel Dirigo was launched. His last ship, launched a month after his death, was the William P. Frye, sunk January 28, 1915, the first American vessel sunk by the Germans in the World War. He was at various times president of the Eastern Railroad and of the Central Railroad, and a director of the Boston and Maine Railroad. From 1871 until his death he was president of the Bath National Bank. He was the most prominent of the Maine Democrats, those constant supporters of forlorn hopes in that Republican stronghold, but the only elective offices he ever received were as councilman and alderman in Bath. He was a delegate to the national conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888; in the next two campaigns he served on the executive committee of the Democratic national committee, and in 1896 he was nominated for vice-president on the fifth ballot and took an active part in the campaign.

He is best known for his book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell (1758). Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on Easter Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening' in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell and talk with angels, demons and other spirits and the Last Judgment had already occurred the year before, in 1757. For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works\u2014and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a \"Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ\" in True Christian Religion, which he published himself.
