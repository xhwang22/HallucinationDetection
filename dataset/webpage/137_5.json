Protons and neutrons are the building blocks of atomic nuclei. Exotic forms of nuclear matter were present in the early universe and continue to exist today in neutron stars. Nuclear fusion processes at the core of our Sun are the source of the vast energy flow that sustains life on Earth. Nuclear fusion in stars and nuclear processes at the end of stellar life have formed the rich spectrum of elements we observe in nature.\n\nNuclear physics is the study of the structure of nuclei\u2014their formation, stability, and decay. It aims to understand the fundamental nuclear forces in nature, their symmetries, and the resulting complex interactions between protons and neutrons in nuclei and among quarks inside hadrons, including the proton.\n\nExperimental nuclear physics drives innovation in scientific instrumentation and has a far-reaching impact on research in other fields of science and engineering. From medicine\u2014x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging, radiation therapies for cancer treatment\u2014to materials science\u2014x-ray lithography and neutron scattering\u2014to propulsion and energy production\u2014nuclear physicists have changed our world. Today's research in nuclear physics is not only unraveling fundamental questions about matter and energy but also enabling a host of new technologies in materials science, biology, chemistry, medicine, and national security.\n\nTheoretical nuclear physics draws from a wide variety of fields such as statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, statistics, particle physics, astrophysics, and gravity to understand fundamental properties of the universe on the smallest scales. Theorists use these tools to study the interior of neutron stars, simulate tiny versions of the Big Bang created in the laboratory, study fluid dynamic properties in relativistic systems, and calculate the microscopic interactions of quarks and gluons.\n\nWe have both experimental and theoretical groups covering a broad range of nuclear physics and related fields. We have joint speakers, seminars, journal clubs and other more informal interactions which provide unique learning opportunities for everyone in these groups.\n\nWhat are we doing in Experimental Nuclear Physics at Illinois?\n\nThe Nuclear Physics Laboratory (NPL) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign carries out research in two broad areas. We are making precision measurements of neutron decay and searching for the neutron electric dipole moment and the axion. We also study both hot and cold QCD in relativistic heavy-ion experiments and in spin-dependent nucleon structure measurements .\n\nWe have significant state-of-the-art infrastructure to design and build scientific instrumentation in our laboratory. We focus on the development of instruments for novel experimental approaches to solving open questions in nuclear physics. Past and current examples include the large volume superconducting spectrometer magnet for the G0 experiment at Jefferson Laboratory, the cryogenic 4He target for the neutron EDM experiment at Oakridge National Laboratory, the W-trigger and the MPC, a forward EMC for the PHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a large planar drift chamber for the COMPASS experiment at CERN, 6000 detector towers for the electromagnetic calorimeter for sPHENIX at Brookhaven National Lab and novel ultra-radiation-hard forward detectors for Pb-Pb and p-Pb physics in ATLAS at CERN.\n\nWe participate in several large-scale experiments at accelerator and reactor facilities in the United States and abroad. A careful balance between experiments in different stages\u2014R&D, construction, data taking, data analysis\u2014results in a broad spectrum of research opportunities. Our large group\u2014nearly 50 graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduate student researchers\u2014focuses on discovery in fundamental nuclear physics, modern data analysis techniques, and advanced instrumentation.\n\nExperiments, status, and major goals\n\nARIADNE (Axion Resonant InterAction DetectioN Experiment) is an NMR-type experiment which searches for induced magnetization in a small sample of cryogenic, polarized helium-3 atoms as a dense, non-magnetic source mass is modulated in close proximity. This would be a signal of an exotic, spin-dependent interaction which could be mediated by the axion, a hypothesized, light, weakly-interacting particle that has emerged as a leading candidate for dark matter.\n\nATLAS Study of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in the collisions of large nuclei using the modification of jets from their vacuum fragmentation configurations as they propagate through the QGP. The Illinois group also is contributing to the two stage upgrade of the ATLAS Zero-Degree Calorimeter for the high luminosity LHC runs 3 (2022-2025) and 4 (2029-2032) and leads the development of a novel Reaction Plane Detector using AI reconstruction algorithms.\n\nBL3 The Beam Lifetime (BL) experiment at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) measures the neutron lifetime using a different technique by observing neutron decay in flight. The neutron lifetime is determined by comparing the rate of beta-decay protons captured in a Penning trap to the rate of beam neutrons passing through the trap. The neutron lifetime measured using the beam method differs from that measured using the bottle method (UCNtau) by ~10 seconds. The continued disagreement hints at new physics, including neutron oscillations and low-energy physics in the dark sectors.\n\nCOMPASS (COmmon Muon Proton Apparatus for Structure and Spectroscopy) is a fixed-target experiment at CERN. It has been using the muon or hadron beams of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to scatter off a target of unpolarized or spin-polarized protons or deuterons, and unpolarized heavier nuclear targets. The SPS is also used to inject beams into the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\nneutron EDM The possible existence of a non-zero electric dipole moment of the neutron is of great fundamental interest and directly impacts our understanding of the nature of electro-weak and strong interactions. The experimental search for this moment has the potential to reveal new sources of T and CP violation. Such new sources would help us to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe and challenge proposed extensions to the Standard Model.\n\nProject 8 The energy of the beta emitted from tritium atoms near its endpoint energy, through simple kinematics, reveals the absolute mass of the electron neutrinos. The Project 8 experiment aims to measure the mass of neutrinos using a novel technique of Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) to reach an unparalleled sensitivity of 40 meV. This mass sensitivity covers the range of inverted neutrino mass hierarchy and reaches into the prediction for the normal hierarchy. To achieve this goal, we need to trap atomic tritiums. A magneto-gravitational trap using a Halbach array of permanent magnets, similar to the UCN trapping in the UCN\u03c4 experiment, could be readily applied to trap cold tritium atoms.\n\nSeaQuest The Fermilab E-906/SeaQuest experiment is part of a series of fixed target Drell-Yan experiments designed to measure the antiquark structure of the nucleon and the modifications to that structure when the nucleon is embedded in a nucleus. Its principal goal is to extend the landmark measurement of the sea flavor asymmetry d(x)i u(x) in the proton made by its predecessor, E866, to the high-x regime.\n\nsPHENIX The main physics motivation for the sPHENIX detector is the study of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in the collisions of large nuclei using the modification of jets from their vacuum fragmentation configurations as the propagate through the QGP. Together with the ATLAS program, the detectors at RHIC (sPHENIX) and the LHC (ATLAS) will allow us to constrain the temperature dependence of the properties of the QGP. The sPHENIX experiment also allows for the measurement of proton transverse-spin and transverse-momentum dependent effects.\n\nUCNtau The UCNtau experiment measures the neutron lifetime using magnetically trapped ultracold neutrons (UCN) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In the UCNtau apparatus, UCN are magnetically levitated by an array of permanent magnets and confined by earth gravitational fields. The large volume of UCNtau, its asymmetrical construction, and the use of active neutron counting in-situ make it possible to reach a precise lifetime determination on the level of 1e-4, which is needed to test the unitarity of the CKM matrix and probe physics beyond the standard model.\n\nTheory, collaborations, and major goals"}, {"url": "https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/kwiat", "page_content": "Paul G Kwiat\n\nPrimary Research Area Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics John Bardeen Chair in Electrical Engineering and Physics (217) 333-9116 kwiat@illinois.edu 337B Loomis Laboratory\n\nFor More Information\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D., Physics, University of California, Berkeley, 1993\n\nBiography\n\nProfessor Paul G. Kwiat received his Ph.D from the University of California, Berkeley (1993), where his dissertation was on nonclassical effects from spontaneous parametric downconversion. After two years as a Lise Meitner Fellow with the quantum optics group of Prof. Anton Zeilinger (at the Univ. of Innsbruck, Austria), he went to Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) as an Oppenheimer Fellow; in 1998 he became a technical staff member in the Neutron Science and Technology group of Physics Division. He has given invited talks at numerous national and international conferences and has authored more than 100 articles on various topics in quantum optics and quantum information, including several review articles. He is a Fellow of the Optical Society of America and the American Physical Society and an Expert Panel member for both the Quantum Computation and Quantum Cryptography Roadmaps.\n\nIn 1998, Professor Kwiat was awarded the LANL Fellows Prize for his work on optical studies of quantum information. He has done pioneering research on the phenomena of quantum interrogation, quantum erasure, and optical implementations of quantum information protocols. He is a primary inventor of the world's first two sources of polarization-entangled photons from down-conversion, which have been used for quantum cryptography, dense-coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement distillation, and most recently, optical quantum gates. In January 2001, he joined the Physics faculty as the second Bardeen Chair.\n\nIn 2018, Professor Kwiat was instrumental in the formation of the Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center (IQUIST) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is currently serving as the center's inaugural Director. IQUIST seeks to accelerate quantum information science (QIS) research on the Urbana campus through collaborations across physics, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, math, and other engineering disciplines; and to build new educational programs to better equip a future QIS-smart workforce.\n\nTeaching Statement\n\nMy intent is to motivate students to care about these topics (e.g., electricity and magnetism, and thermal physics), by showing the ubiquitous application to our everyday lives, in addition to cutting edge technologies.\n\nResearch Statement\n\nQuantum Optics and Quantum Information \u2014 In our quantum optics lab, we use photons to investigate a range of topics from foundations of quantum mechanics (such as tests of nonlocality, the quantum Zeno effect, and so forth) to quantum cryptography (enabling for the first time provable unconditional security), communication (including \"teleportation\"), and computation (investigating simple quantum logic, algorithms, and decoherence-defeating measures). We have developed methods to produce pairs of photons that share the most mysterious of all quantum properties -- entanglement. The goal now is to improve these systems, to explore uncharted waters of novel quantum mechanical states, and to learn to use them to advantage in all areas of information processing.\n\nPhotonic Quantum Information Systems \u2014 Our goal is to develop the following optical quantum technologies for quantum information processing (including computation, cryptography, and metrology), and apply them to critical problems in these areas: Entangled-photon sources and characterization, quantum state transducer, photon storage and quantum memory, periodic single photon source, and photon number-resolving solid-state photomultipliers (SSPMs). These are central resources for many quantum communication applications.\n\nHyper-entanglement for Advanced Quantum Communication \u2014 Hyper-entanglement \u2014 the property that quantum systems, photons in our case, may be simultaneously entangled in multiple degrees of freedom \u2014 promises to enhance the capabilities of current quantum communication protocols, and to enable new ones. We will extend our experience in the creation, manipulation and characterization of hyper-entanglement in the photon pairs produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and employ them for several relevant advanced quantum communication applications: quantum super-dense coding, production and application of bound entanglement, optimized teleportation beyond single qubits, and entanglement-enhanced quantum fingerprinting. Our research in these areas will substantially increase understanding of the benefits \u2014 and limitations \u2014 of using hyper-entanglement for quantum information processing, extending the capabilities of current communication protocols, and enabling new ones.\n\nOptical Quantum Computing \u2014 Quantum computing uses the unique quantum properties of small systems to enable exponential computational speedups for certain classes of problems. Simple gates have been realized in several systems; the cleanest of these have been using photons as the quantum bits (\"qubits\"). Now we are investigating the feasibility of transitioning these small scall results to a much larger system, eventually capable of performing universal computations. We are exploring two approaches in detail. The first uses the newly devised \"cluster\" state paradigm, thereby reducing resoures requirements by several orders of magnitude. The second approach, relying on weak nonlinear effects, reduces the resource requirements even further.\n\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\n\nI routinely have talented undergraduates working in my group.

Formally it was in physics, but in reality, it was in biophysics. The last experiment for his thesis, for example, was measuring the torsional rigidity of DNA by looking at a fluorophore intercalated in DNA, twisting around. A paper based on this experiment was published in Science (Selvin, 1992, Science) and later confirmed in a single molecule experiment (Bryant, Nature, 2003).\n\nProfessor Selvin did two sets of experiments during his postdoctoral training. One was developing a new type of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on lanthanides, called luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET). He later used this technique to discover how a potassium ion channel, in part responsible for nerve conduction, responds to voltage (Cha, 1999, Nature; Posson, 2005, Nature). The second involved single molecule fluorescence\u2014the first measurement of FRET between a single donor and single acceptor (Ha, 1996, PNAS).\n\nAfter joining the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois in 1997, his interest has turned to molecular motors \u2014 proteins whose job is moving cargoes around the cell. For example, chromosomes are bound to molecular motors (kinesin and dynein) and under their power, are moved into the two halves of a cell during cell division. Selvin\u2019s task was to determine how the motors moved. They were known to be dimeric, with two \u201cfeet,\u201d held together by a head that consumed ATP (the universal food of the cell) and a stalk that bound to the cargo. It was also known that for each ATP burned up, these proteins moved between 8 and 37 nm, depending on the individual motor.\n\nBut did they move in a walking-type motion (also called \u201chand-over-hand\u201d), or did they move as an inchworm does? A walking-type motion would move the back foot twice the center-of-mass distance, with the front foot not translating at all; an inchworm-type motion would move all parts equally\u2014equal to the center of mass. The problem was that this distance for the walking motion was only 74 nm for the biggest motor, and 16 nm for the smallest motor\u2014or 37 nm and 8 nm for an inchworm motion\u2014about 30 times smaller than the diffraction limit of light, arguably the smallest distance that can be resolved with visible light.\n\nThe trick to get around this problem was to realize that a single molecule\u2019s position can be located arbitrarily well. It\u2019s much like a mountain peak, which can be located to within a few yards, even though the mountain itself may be a a mile wide. Similarly, a single molecule\u2019s center can be determined to be its width (~250 nm), divided by the square root of the numbers of photons collected (see left diagram). Selvin and his group managed to collect 10,000 photons in 0.5 s, meaning that the fluorophore\u2019s center could be determined to \u00b11.25 nm (250/\u221a104). With some clever chemistry, the single fluorophore could last several minutes, meaning that Selvin could watch the fluorescently-labeled molecular motor take several steps (Yildiz, 2003, Science). He called the technique FIONA\u2014Fluorescence Imaging with One-Nanometer Accuracy.\n\nThe first measurement was performed in vitro to control the amount of ATP that the motor \u201cate,\u201d thereby slowing it down so each individual step could be seen. With FIONA, Selvin found that from the biggest motor, Myosin V, (Yildiz, 2003, Science) to the smallest motor, kinesin, (Yildiz, 2004, Science), to one in between (Myosin VI), (Yildiz, 2004, J.Biol.Chem.), the motors all moved in a hand-over-hand, or walking, fashion. This discovery won the award as one of the ten most significant advances in science for 2003, as judged by Science magazine. It also won for Selvin\u2019s student, Ahmet Yildiz, Science\u2019s grand prize (a world-wide competition) for the most noteworthy Ph.D thesis.\n\nSelvin then looked in vivo, i.e., inside a cell (Kural, 2005, Science). Here the time resolution had to be improved to 1 msec\u2014a 500-fold increase\u2014because the ATP was now not under his control, and was at a fairly high concentration. The motion of individual kinesins, and individual dyneins, could be measured, and surprisingly, they could move cargo around more than 10 times faster than what had been measured in vitro!\n\nSelvin is now combing FIONA with optical traps (holding particles with light) in vivo, to see how many motors are causing such large velocities. Selvin\u2019s future plans call for measurements in situ, for example, in Planaria and in C. Elegans, to test how these motors act in \u201creal life.\u201d\n\nSelected Articles in Journals\n\nTeaching Honors List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by their Students, Fall 1999, Fall 2001, Spring 2002, Spring 2003, Spring 2007, Spring 2015, Spring 2016, Spring 2021\n\nNational Science Foundation CAREER Award for Outstanding Research/Teaching (2000) Research Honors Grass Imaging Fellowship, Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, Mass., Summer 2014.\n\nNikon Fellowship, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts (2010)\n\nThe International Raymond and Beverly Sackler Prize in Biophysics, Tel Aviv University (2006)\n\nUniversity Scholar, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2006-2007)\n\nFaculty Member of the Precision Proteomics Research Theme, Institute for Genomic Biology (2005-present)\n\nFellow, American Physical Society (2004-present)\n\nPhysics Sony Faculty Scholar (2004-2007)\n\nElected to General council of Biophysical Society (2004)\n\nBiophysical Society Michael and Kate Barany Award for Young Investigators (2004)\n\nBeckman Fellow, Center for Advanced Studies, Urbana (Spring 2000)\n\nCottrell Scholar, Research Corporation (2000)\n\nXerox Award for Outstanding Research (2000)\n\nResearch Innovation Award, Research Corp.

Among large U.S. firms offering health benefits in 2019, 84% also offered a workplace wellness program to reduce health care costs and improve employee health.\n\nBut a randomized controlled trial showed that, after 24 months, a comprehensive workplace wellness program had no significant effects on measured physical health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure, cholesterol or blood glucose; rates of medical diagnoses; or the use of health care services; according to a new paper co-written by U. of I. scholars David Molitor, Laura Payne and Julian Reif.\n\nThe paper, which was published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, comes out of the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, which examined a workplace wellness program offered to employees from the Urbana campus of the University of Illinois.\n\n\u201cMany employers use workplace wellness programs in an attempt to improve employee health and reduce medical costs, but randomized evaluations of their efficacy are rare,\u201d said Molitor, a professor of finance at the Gies College of Business and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cOur randomized evaluation found no significant effect of the program on employee health measures or medical use.\u201d\n\nThe comprehensive workplace wellness program, dubbed iThrive, was designed to represent a typical corporate wellness program offered by employers. It included three annual components: an on-site biometric screening and survey; an online health risk assessment; and a choice of wellness activities.\n\nIn the study, individual employees were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was eligible to participate in a two-year comprehensive workplace wellness program, or a control group that was ineligible. The researchers evaluated the effects of the program on health beliefs, self-reported health behaviors, clinician-collected biometrics, and claims-based medical diagnoses and medical use.\n\nIn a randomized controlled trial of more than 4,800 U. of I. employees, the researchers found that those invited to join the wellness program showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes compared with the control group.\n\nMeasures taken at 12- and 24-month intervals included 16 clinician-collected biometric outcomes; administrative claims related to medical diagnoses such as diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and medical use such as office visits, inpatient visits, and emergency room visits; and 14 self-reported health-behavior and health-belief outcomes.\n\nThe program included paid time off for annual on-site health screenings, health risk assessments and ongoing wellness activities \u2013 for example, physical activity programs encouraging campus walks over lunch breaks, smoking-cessation programs and chronic disease self-management programs.\n\nThe program affected two self-reported health outcomes: It increased the proportion of employees reporting that they have a primary care physician and improved employee beliefs about their own health, the authors report.\n\n\u201cA significantly higher proportion of employees in the treatment group reported having a primary care physician after 24 months,\u201d Molitor said. \u201cThe workplace wellness program also significantly improved a set of employee health beliefs on average. But we found no significant effect of the program on employee health measures or medical use, demonstrating a mismatch between employee perceptions of workplace wellness programs and an actual improvement in health. These findings shed light on employees\u2019 perceptions of workplace wellness programs, which may influence long-run effects on health.\u201d\n\nThe study adds to a growing body of evidence from randomized evaluations showing that workplace wellness programs affect some self-reported outcomes but are unlikely to significantly improve employee health or reduce medical use in the short term, said Reif, a professor of finance at the Gies College of Business and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\u201cMany prior studies found that workplace wellness programs improved health and reduced medical use, but those results were likely due to differences in who participates. Our study complements recent randomized studies and demonstrates the value of using randomized evaluations to determine causal impact,\u201d Reif said.\n\nPayne is a professor of recreation, sport and tourism in the College of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nMolitor, Reif and Payne\u2019s co-authors are David Chan, of Stanford University and the National Bureau of Economic Research; and Damon Jones, of the University of Chicago and NBER.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health; the National Science Foundation; the U.S. Health Care Delivery Initiative of J-PAL North America, a regional office of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab; Evidence for Action, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; and the W.E.

During these two years he began developing methods to characterize states of matter using quantum entanglement, most notably, disordered fermionic systems and topological insulator/ordered systems. Additionally he began working on the theory of the topological visco-elastic response in topological insulators.\n\n\n\nProfessor Hughes joined the faculty at the University of Illinois in the Fall of 2011.\n\nResearch Statement\n\nMy research interests are focused in three main areas:\n\n1. Topological insulators/Superconductors\n\n2. Using quantum information/entanglement techniques to characterize quantum condensed matter systems.\n\n3. Mesoscopic transport in low-dimensional materials or heterostructures\n\nOther interests include topological order, quantum Hall effect, spin-orbit coupled electronic systems, connections between high-energy physics, gravity, and condensed matter.\n\nSome of my recent work has been on connections between torsion, gravity, and viscosity in topological insulators, characterizing disordered topological insulators using the entanglement spectrum, and transport calculations in graphene/superconductor junctions.\n\nInterested students should contact me via email and be willing to work on a broad range of topics. Before contacting me please look at some of my selected publications below, or on the arxiv to get an idea of which subjects are of the most interest to you.\n\nI have several opportunities for research projects/reading courses for undergraduates who are highly-motivated and can program or proficiently use either Matlab, Mathematica, or C/C++/FORTRAN.\n\nPost-Doctoral Research Opportunities\n\nI do not have any (funded) post-doctoral research opportunities at this time.\n\nGraduate Research Opportunities\n\nI have graduate student positions open for one, or possibly two students.\n\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities\n\nProfessor Hughes has several opportunities for research projects/reading courses for undergraduates who are highly-motivated and can program or proficiently use either Matlab, Mathematica, or C/C++. Students must have had at least PHY485 or PHY 486.\n\nSelected Articles in Journals\n\nTeaching Honors Donald Biggar Willett Faculty Scholar (April 2020, May 2022) Research Honors ONR Young Investigator Award (May 2015)\n\nUniversity of Illinois Center for Advanced Study Fellowship (November 2014)\n\nNSF CAREER Award (February 2014)\n\nDean's Award for Excellence in Research for an Assistant Professor (February 2014)\n\nAlfred P.
