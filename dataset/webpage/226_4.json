{"Virginia Bottomley worked as a management consultant before entering politics.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/10/virginia-bottomley-interview", "page_content": "At a time when most people would be contemplating spending more time with the grandchildren, there are some who still relish being in the office every day to deal with problems.\n\nVirginia Bottomley \u2013 Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, to give her full title, is in the latter category. She's not an ardent reader \u2014 a collection of boring business books on her office shelves testifies to that. And rather than enjoying one of her three homes \u2014 Westminster, Surrey and the Isle of Wight \u2014 the former Tory cabinet minister turned City headhunter finds fulfilment in spotting the right people for the right jobs, and especially in helping more women obtain high-powered business positions.\n\nAt Odgers Berndtson, Britain's largest headhunting firm with \u00a350m of turnover and 400 staff, Bottomley placed former City minister Paul Myners on the Marks & Spencer board, put Paul Deighton in charge of delivering London Olympics, made Barbara Stocking director of Oxfam and Richard Lambert leader of the CBI.\n\n\"Temperamentally, I am more suited for headhunting \u2014 politics is about policy, but the issue is not who's going to make it happen,\" she says in her unpretentious office overlooking Hanover Square behind Oxford Street.\n\nA photo of John Major's 1992 cabinet hangs on the wall, showing her standing next to Michael Portillo. She was health secretary for three years before taking over at national heritage for the remainder of that turbulent administration, and the ups and downs of public life taught her that the best leaders are those who get back on their feet after being wounded. And so it seems that the unpredictable nature of Westminster politics has left her with an attraction to the more complex business problems and an aversion to starry appointments.\n\n\"We don't do prima donna school of headhunting \u2013 we solve an insolvable equation,\" she says of her team, which employs 31 people. \"Some people go on the easy ride, but I like people who've been through the storm \u2013 it's the people who can stand straight.\"\n\nOdgers delivered City veteran Simon Walker to the role of chief executive of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association when buyout firms faced a public backlash for inflating their companies with debt, without generating enough jobs or growth. Bottomley says she knows how it feels to be in the firing line from her cabinet days, when there was the possibility that she could be sacked, or resign, almost every month.\n\nBut her favourite battle is about women \u2014 with men. Ten years ago, when she started at Odgers, chairmen of large companies told her that they \"just couldn't have a woman\" on their boards, and couldn't understand why women wanted to have a two- or three-year career break to have children. Men used the golf course for fun, but also for networking, leaving women out of the running for potential jobs.\n\nNow, after years of explaining, networking and hand-shaking, \"even men\" can understand career breaks, she says. Almost a quarter of board positions filled by Odgers' hunts are allocated to women, and no shortlist is all-male any more. One client recently offered a bonus of \u00a330,000 if Odgers could find a woman to occupy a boardroom seat.\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nFor a start, the middle-class, middle-aged men who dominate business and politics have understood that their own children could be jeopardised by their own policies, Bottomley says. \"They know that their hugely intelligent daughters are at a disadvantage,\" she says, also speaking as someone whose daughter is a City trader.\n\nBottomley has also pressed hard to persuade directors that boards should include legal, communications and marketing experts, a move that may open the door to more women, as they more often fill high positions in those areas than in finance or sales. Retail, food, and financial service companies are also realising who most of their customers are, and the need to represent them at the top of the company, she says.\n\nBut Britain's boards are still far from representative of the population as a whole. Only 10% of directors in the country's top 100 companies are women, and 25 of the top firms have no women board members at all. \"It's still work in progress \u2013 individuals are inclined to look in the mirror, and appoint in their image, rather than look through the window and recognise the diversity of the work environment,\" Bottomley says. \"A board should be an orchestra that can play a harmonious tune, not just a group of violins.\"\n\nCompanies need to search in a wider pool of candidates. To lead by example, Bottomley boasts that she employs former bankers, journalists and even an admiral because \"if he can unite a ship, he can run a team\".\n\nStill, access to board positions is tough, since most openings are not even advertised. Instead, word of mouth and the ties of friendship are the main way into these highly paid and influential positions. Board members of large FTSE 100 companies can be paid as much as \u00a3100,000 a year to attend a few meetings and read over the company's documents. Occupying one board seat can usually lead into another one, as companies seek experience from other firms.\n\nWomen also need to stop \"selling themselves short,\" Bottomley says, adding that men are better at highlighting their strengths. As an example, Bottomley remembers when Margaret Thatcher offered her a job in environment, and she replied that she didn't know anything about the subject. \"You'll have to read up,\" the former primer minister answered.\n\nWomen's access to top positions may be improving \u2013 especially for those like Bottomley, the third generation of female graduates of the London School of Economics. She has a privileged background \u2013 family members include cousins Peter Jay, the economist and broadcaster, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott and brother Christopher Garnett, until recently chief executive of GNER. Bottomley, who counts the chancellorship of Hull university among her various roles, put her three children through Cambridge.\n\nWary of politicians\n\nHowever, Bottomley says that she is aware Britain is still a country divided by differences so wide that people at its extremes barely know each other. When asked how the Eton-educated David Cameron is going to change that, she argues that the prime minister has made \"a great effort\" to make his party \"look more like Britain today\".\n\nPeople should always have a chance \u2013 to fight, to stand up, to change, she says. She's all for mid-life career changes, proud of her move from politics into headhunting after reaching the age of 50. But she's wary of former politicians \u2014 perhaps a certain former prime minister \u2014 going into business, especially those \"moving into the celebrity world\". Rather than finding gate-openers, Odgers is \"here to advise on who's got the real technical skills\".\n\nAbove all that, lack of ego, integrity, desire to bring change and good references will weigh more in the final reckoning, she says \u2013 adding that she isn't fooled by self-boosting propaganda. \"I don't necessarily believe anything people say to me,\" she says.\n\nOne shouldn't. No nepotism in headhunting? Asked who she would hire to lead the Labour party now that Gordon Brown has departed, Bottomley immediately picks historian and newly elected MP Tristram Hunt \u2013 a nephew."}, {"url": "https://www.odgersberndtson.com/en-gb/people/virginia-bottomley", "page_content": "Virginia Bottomley\n\nChair, Board Practice\n\nLondon\n\nRt Hon Baroness Virginia Bottomley DL chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board Practice.

Photos by David Bebber for the New Statesman\n\nBeing on the road with a former roads minister makes you see the UK differently. \u201cThat\u2019s the Rochester Way Relief Road,\u201d says Peter Bottomley, pointing from the window of his baby blue MG hybrid to the A2 dual carriageway roaring beneath Eltham station, as if it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world. There is a moment of awed silence.\n\n\u201cI got the campaign going for that. Because this had been a marginal seat, people had always feared that building a road through it might lose you 500 votes \u2013 you might lose the seat, you might lose the government, you might then leave Nato, world peace, all the rest\u2026\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Bottomley won this south-east London constituency \u2013 then called Woolwich West \u2013 off Labour in a 1975 by-election by 2,382 votes. It was the first by-election fought by the Tories under Margaret Thatcher (Bottomley believes if it hadn\u2019t been for his victory, there \u201cwould\u2019ve been a heavy movement to topple her\u201d).\n\nHe has served as an MP ever since, winning his current coastal West Sussex seat of Worthing West in 1997, and is the longest-serving member of the House of Commons. Now 77, he inherited parliament\u2019s most avuncular title, Father of the House, after the December 2019 general election. \u201cThere\u2019s no pay, no merit and no responsibility\u201d to the role, he smiles, his blue eyes twinkling.\n\nRelated\n\nDressed smartly in a pink shirt, blue and pink patterned tie, grey suit trousers and with his white hair neatly brushed back, Bottomley drives us around significant spots of his old constituency of Eltham. When we stop off to walk, he uses a walking stick adorned with a green flag bearing the yellow House of Commons portcullis.\n\nNewsletters from the New Statesman View all newsletters The best of our politics, international affairs, culture and business coverage, straight to your inbox Sign up here Select and enter your email address Morning Call A quick and essential guide to domestic politics from the New Statesman's Westminster team.

THANK YOU Close\n\nHis eyes moisten at the spot where Stephen Lawrence was killed, marked by a stone plaque and covered in flowers. He remembers driving the murdered teenager\u2019s father, Neville, around London, talking about what he\u2019d taught his children. He points out the street where he first visited the grieving family. \u201cIt\u2019s a road which is seared into my life,\u201d he says.\n\nCommitted to the lives of his constituents, he sees his work as an MP \u201ctrying to do the right things in the right way\u201d. He likens it to throwing starfish washed up by the tide back into the sea. \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands, you can\u2019t save them all, but I can save a small number.\u201d\n\nFrom child benefit and discrimination in Whitehall to the minimum wage and pension justice, to his latest fight against leaseholders shouldering post-Grenfell fire safety costs, Bottomley\u2019s career is defined by successive campaigns against a constellation of injustices. \u201cYou ought to get to the stage where neither your chromosomes nor the colour of your skin should matter more than the colour of your eyes or the colour of your hair, and when will that be true?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s better, but it\u2019s [still] not right.\u201d\n\nWhen congratulating him on his Fatherhood of the House two years ago, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs he would always go to him when seeking \u201call-party consensus\u201d and a \u201cConservative character\u201d to his causes.\n\nBottomley never wanted to be a minister \u2013 though he served stints as a junior minister for employment, transport and Northern Ireland under Thatcher between 1984 and 1990. Party politics only interests him \u201cin the same way playing squash or tennis interests me\u201d, he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pay, no merit and no responsibility to being Father of the House\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically liberal. Liberals are wasted in the Liberal party. Virginia, my wife, says you should join the Tory party to make them socially aware, and you should join the Labour party to make them economically responsible.\u201d\n\nBut the Tories very nearly missed out on him altogether. In 1972, a 28-year-old Bottomley headed to Smith Square in Westminster, where the offices of major parties and unions were based. He knocked on the door of Labour HQ and said \u201cI\u2019m thinking of joining the Labour Party\u201d. They gave him a membership form, which asked if he accepted the party\u2019s constitution. He bought a copy for thruppence, and was put off by the idea of party conference setting policy.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I knew about the party conference is that the ordinary members are the smallest group, the trade unionists the biggest, except for the journalists who are even larger.\u201d\n\nInstead, within an hour he had joined the Transport & General Workers\u2019 Union and the Tory party. (\u201cWhen they said \u2018we don\u2019t have a constitution\u2019, I couldn\u2019t rule them out, so I joined.\u201d)\n\nIt sounds like an unusual combination, but Bottomley worked as a lorry driver after completing his Cambridge economics degree. During our drive, he points out the Well Hall Pleasaunce gardens in Greenwich, where he used to deliver ice cream.\n\n\u201cIf you go back a decade or more, most companies had their own drivers, vans, recruitment, training,\u201d he says of the latest shortage of HGV drivers. \u201cSince the growth of logistics firms, that\u2019s changed operations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s cabotage [rules that restrict the number of trips European drivers can take in the UK], coronavirus interrupting things and the drop in the value of the pound since Brexit came along, coupled with when you\u2019re earning money in this country, you\u2019re sending less back home to your own countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically liberal. Liberals are wasted in the Liberal party\u201d\n\nAs a former transport under-secretary for Thatcher, he is used to building things. He believes the Tories\u2019 latest priority to \u201clevel up\u201d should mean connecting \u201cthe old industrialised parts of Britain, London of course being the biggest industrial part of Britain\u2026 If there\u2019s difficulty getting from Stoke to the centre of Europe, and there are traffic jams in the south, the answer is to [make it so people can] get there more easily.\u201d\n\nYet it shouldn\u2019t just be about infrastructure: \u201cThere\u2019s health, there\u2019s wealth, there\u2019s opportunity and being a place where if you have get-up-and-go you can get up and stay.\u201d\n\nBottomley believes the whips see him as \u201cindependent, singular\u201d, but he has \u201cnever said an adverse word privately or publicly about any prime minister, even Labour ones\u201d. He even has a positive word to say about Keir Starmer, under whom he believes Labour could \u201covercome the idea that they\u2019re not in favour of order and law\u201d.\n\nHe and his wife, the Tory peer and former health secretary Virginia Bottomley, \u201chave worked with poor and troubled people with an intensity that most people have not\u201d.\n\nWhile he predicts the current cost-of-living crisis will last \u201cno more than six months\u201d \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s bad but it\u2019s not disastrous\u201d \u2013 he does not believe the \u00a320 uplift to Universal Credit should be removed overnight.\n\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better to have tapered it off in two goes, down from \u00a320 to \u00a310, and then from \u00a310\u201d, he says, adding the new fund for vulnerable households over winter should have been announced earlier than \u201ca week before the change\u201d.\n\nAs the sea rises over the horizon and we approach Worthing, Bottomley points out the number of fields and green spaces on his satnav subject to planning applications.\n\n\u201cEvery bit of greenfield between the built-up area of Worthing and Littlehampton appears to be under attack by developers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely against the government\u2019s intention but they don\u2019t wake up\u2026 It\u2019s an uphill struggle to get them to pay attention\u201d to the threat to greenfield sites in constituencies like his.\n\nIt\u2019s a hot topic in southern Tory circles, and the government has already started relaxing planning rules \u2013 most notably allowing an extra two storeys to be built upon existing blocks, which Bottomley calls a \u201cstraight gift to landlords\u201d.\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t right. The government made a number of incredible mistakes [on planning]\u2026 When the [housing] minister [Chris Pincher] wound up the debate [about change allowing the two extra storeys], he didn\u2019t mention the leaseholders once \u2013 that\u2019s crackers. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery bit of greenfield between the built-up area of Worthing and Littlehampton appears to be under attack by developers\u201d\n\nBottomley believes \u201csome\u201d of these problems may be addressed with Michael Gove as Housing Secretary, but warns building new housing \u201cneeds a bit of imagination\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome ministers will say \u2018as long as the design\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok\u2019, but they should be commenting on whether it should be there in the first place\u2026 Start trying to judge by the rules you published, rather than doing situational selectivity.\u201d\n\nWe stop off for a copy of the Worthing Herald and a packet of T-bone steak-flavoured Roysters crisps at a local newsagent, and then settle in Bottomley\u2019s cosy ground-floor flat.\n\nPhotos of the coast line the walls, alongside a mirror framed in shells, and a model of a sailboat on the window sill. Virginia\u2019s presence is indicated by a vibrantly coloured oil portrait, a red cushion reading \u201cHer Ladyship\u201d in golden thread, and I sip tea from a mug championing \u201cVotes for Women\u201d. Bottomley lays out punnets of mini cucumbers, chopped raw mushrooms, tomatoes and grapes on the kitchen table for us to munch on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still an MP because I\u2019m still alive and people vote for me,\u201d he shrugs, when I ask what keeps him in the Commons.\n\nThe only time he considered stepping down was in 1982. Virginia had given up most of her paid work to run as a candidate on the Isle of Wight, and they had \u201ctwo and half dependent children\u201d to look after. \u201cMPs\u2019 pay was low, and I wasn\u2019t going to go either broke or crooked to keep going,\u201d he recalls.\n\nToday, he believes MPs should have higher salaries. \u201cI take the view that being an MP is the greatest honour you could have, but a general practitioner in politics ought to be paid roughly the same as a general practitioner in medicine,\u201d he says. (The average GP salary in England is \u00a3100,700.)\n\n\u201cBeing an MP is the greatest honour you could have, but a general practitioner in politics ought to be paid roughly the same as a general practitioner in medicine\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors are paid far too little nowadays. But if they would get roughly \u00a3100,000 a year, the equivalent for an MP to get the same standard of living would be \u00a3110-\u00a3115,000 a year \u2013 it\u2019s never the right time, but if your MP isn\u2019t worth the money, it\u2019s better to change the MP than to change the money.\u201d\n\nWhile Bottomley no longer suffers the financial strains, he believes the situation is \u201cdesperately difficult\u201d for his newer colleagues. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they manage. It\u2019s really grim.\u201d\n\nAs he drives me to Worthing station, the Father of the House speaks with all the enthusiasm of a first-time candidate, listing his hotchpotch set of priorities for the parliamentary term ahead: from reducing the abortion rate by four-fifths with \u201cno change of law, just improving people\u2019s understanding\u201d, to rescuing leaseholders from the cladding crisis: \u201cThe government must find the places that need fixing, fix it, fund it, then get the money back, full stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Boris Johnson can make people happy, fine. If he and his advisers could occasionally ask the person who\u2019s driving your car now for a view, he\u2019d probably give them some good advice,\u201d Bottomley smiles, eyes fixed on the road.\n\n\u201cThe only people who know how to run the country are either driving your car or cutting your hair \u2013 I\u2019m not cutting your hair, but I\u2019m driving your car.\u201d\n\n[See also: Can Keir Starmer break Labour\u2019s losing streak?]"}, {"url": "https://www.islandlifemagazine.co.uk/virginia-my-passion-for-island/", "page_content": "In her 10 years as a Cabinet Minister Virginia Bottomley was one of the most powerful women in British politics. But even she will admit she didn\u2019t quite carry the clout of the woman who virtually ordered her to become a Member of Parliament \u2013 none other than former Prime Minister, \u2018Iron Lady\u2019 Margaret Thatcher.\n\nDuring her decade at the cutting edge of Government, and in all during her 21 years as a serving MP, Virginia never lost sight of the education of life and good values that were instilled into her as a young girl growing up, for the most part, here on the Island.\n\nDespite being born in Scotland, simply because her father was working there at the time, she, along with numerous family members, calls the Island her home. She is here as often as she can be, despite now being an active member of the House of Lords as Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, as well as working as a head-hunter for a high-profile company in London. She chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board & CEO Practice, which conducts searches for Chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors for plcs and private companies.\n\nDuring a break away from life in the fast lane that she still enjoys, Virginia took time out to give \u2018Island Life\u2019 readers an insight into her interesting and rewarding career as an MP, and her love of the Island.\n\nShe revealed: \u201cMy great grandfather Sir Edward Poulton came to St Helens Cottage in about 1890, and in 1915 he gave St Helens Common to the National Trust. My other grandfather Dr. William Garnett bought a house in Seagrove Bay around 1900.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents met playing hockey in Priory Bay, and we still play hockey there, so the family have been doing that for more than 100 years. All my family were quite academic and very involved in public policies. Dr William Garnett was involved in introducing education to London as one of the original signatories of the London School of Economics where I studied, so I am very proud of him.\u201d\n\nHer family bought half of Priory Bay in 1926, and the family home was built the following year. Since then the whole family has been down here constantly, with often as many as 100 relations gathering in the summer.\n\nVirginia points out: \u201cWe all share a passion for the Island. As a young girl I remember we had these appalling traditions, so every Easter Monday we would walk from Horestone Point to Whitecliff Bay \u2013 again a walk that was started by my great grandfather in 1890. The other tradition is swimming to St Helens Fort. My great uncles who were killed in the First World War did it, and I swam to the Fort when I was 10 years old.\n\n\u201cAnother childhood memory was when we loaded up the dinghies and drove to Freshwater and then rowed around and had a picnic in Scratchells Bay. Another time we had a running race from Freshwater to home. We really went for it, and couldn\u2019t move for a week afterwards. It was a competitive environment.\n\n\u201cWhen we were young Priory Bay was quite distant from Ryde because people didn\u2019t have cars and we went everywhere by boat. I think we learned a great resilience. Sometimes the tide and wind are against you and you make no progress. On other occasions you have the tide and wind with you, and even though you don\u2019t make much effort you travel like a rocket. I think that is the most wonderful lesson for life \u2013 sometimes you work so hard and it doesn\u2019t happen, but other times you just sail through it.\u201d\n\nVirginia recalls one of the most influential people in her life was her \u2018very special\u2019 aunt Peggy Jay. She said: \u201cShe was in politics and had a massive influence on me, and I say my husband Peter only married me because he thought I would turn out like Peggy Jay. She was a member of the Greater London Council, and was forceful. She was a great reformer and campaigner. She was brought up on the Island, and was a wonderful mentor.\u201d\n\nDespite being married to a Tory MP, Virginia had never given much thought to joining him in the Commons. Then one day her whole life changed when she received a call from 10 Downing Street, on the orders of PM Margaret Thatcher, saying more female MPs were required, and she was on the \u2018wanted list\u2019.\n\nShe continued: \u201cI decided Peggy Jay should have been an MP, but she wasn\u2019t so I would be. I wanted Peter to be the MP for the Isle of Wight long ago, and then in 1982 it came up for the following year\u2019s General Election. I worked so hard and actually got 34,900 votes \u2013 only five people in the country got more votes than I did, but one of those was Liberal Stephen Ross, the sitting MP, who beat me.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. The campaign was \u2018Turn Wight Blue\u2019 and Mrs. Thatcher even came over to visit. The day after I had lost she rang me to say \u2018what bad luck\u2019 and I burst into tears. But it made me realise much more about the Island; the huge delights, but also some of the difficulties and dilemmas.\n\n\u201cI learned how hugely entrepreneurial and creative the Island is with lots of small businesses and so many dedicated people. We all hope it can become an Island of real enterprise and creativity in small businesses. With modern technology, distance working and IT, my senses are that it is going to become ever more possible to realise this vision. The Island really has everything going for it.\n\n\u201cWhatever I have done, I have always felt part of my energy was put into developing and promoting the Island in any way I could. The Island needs all the help it can get to make people realise what a wonderful and exciting place it is.\u201d\n\nVirginia became MP for South West Surrey in 1984. There were 365 applicants to be the Tory candidate, but she was chosen and subsequently won the seat. She said: \u201cAt the time there were just 23 women MPs in a House of Commons of more than 600, so we were like an endangered species. Now the ratio is about one in four. I loved the constituency life and being involved in every aspect.\u201d\n\nInitially she served under Margaret Thatcher and then John Major, and received her first ministerial position in 1988 as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of the Environment. She was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health in 1989, and was appointed a member of the Privy Council upon joining Major\u2019s Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in 1992, serving until 1995.\n\nShe then served as Secretary of State for National Heritage until 1997. After the 1997 General Election, she returned to the back benches, saying: \u201cI had been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and returning to the back benches enabled me to re-connect with my family. After 10 years I felt I had done my time and needed my life back.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her 10 years as a Minister, Virginia recalls: \u201cMrs. Thatcher called me one day to see her on a Monday, which was unusual. I said I was busy and could it be later in the week. But I was summoned and she offered me a job as a Minister. I was so surprised. She wanted me to go to Environment, but I had only ever spoken about Defence, Agriculture or transport, and knew nothing about it.\n\n\u201cShe replied very smartly that I would have to read up on it! It was very interesting getting people to use unleaded petrol, and recycle. But I loved being Secretary of State for Health because it was so demanding and intense. It was a job where I had a real role with serious responsibilities. I had to take difficult decisions, so I had to be courageous and tenacious to survive.\u201cWhen I first became a Minister I had a very bright young man in Central Office. He was 23 and used to coach and brief me when I went on television\u2019s \u2018Question Time\u2019. He was a very clever, positive person, and his name was David Cameron!\u201d\n\nThat is one of the main reasons why Virginia is very supportive of the present team, even though she believes coalition must be \u2018incredibly frustrating, compromising and complex\u2019.\n\nAfter quitting the Cabinet Virginia continued to work closely with Tory leaders William Hague, Ian Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. It was Howard who put her in the House of Lords in 2005. She said: \u201cI was absolutely delighted, and it was unexpected. Some of the debates in the Lords are phenomenal, and it will be a great loss if it goes. But I accept it is hard to justify.\u201d\n\nVirginia added: \u201cI am someone who is constantly restless, so I am never really satisfied. I have been married coming up 45 years to the same person, and that is something that gives great strength. But if you can find a role in life that in your way plays to your strengths and minimises your many failings then you are privileged.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.odgersberndtson.com/en-se/people/virginia-bottomley", "page_content": "Virginia Bottomley\n\nChair, Board Practice\n\nLondon\n\nRt Hon Baroness Virginia Bottomley DL chairs the Odgers Berndtson Board Practice.

William Tuohy is London bureau chief for The Times. They interviewed Virginia Bottomley in the health secretary's office\n\nShe has brought more than a touch of glamour to the British Cabinet--so much so that Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley is depicted on the irreverent Spitting Image TV show as Prime Minister John Major\u2019s girlfriend. But she is hardly the dumb-blonde caricature of the series. Rather, Bottomley, 44, holds one of the toughest jobs in the Cabinet--con stantly under fire from the opposition, which accuses the government of trying to undermine Britain\u2019s famed National Health Service.\n\nAnd as health secretary, boss of one of the big \u201cspending\u201d departments in government, she is frequently locked in battle with Treasury officials who are in the business of trimming her $62 billion-a-year NHS budget. However, she has had plenty of training for her arduous job.\n\nBorn in Scotland as Virginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Garnett, she grew up in a middle-class, socially aware family. \u201cFor me, there wasn\u2019t really a decision about whether or not to do something in the public arena,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was almost taken for granted that I would.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe studied sociology at Essex University and took a master\u2019s degree at the London School of Economics. At 19, she married Peter Bottomley, who became a member of Parliament and transportation minister. A mother of three, she was a researcher in child psychiatry, and was appointed a magistrate at age 27. She won election as a Conservative MP in 1984. In government, she served in various sub-Cabinet posts: in the Departments of Education, Overseas Development, the Foreign Office and Environment, before moving to Health, from which she was appointed to the Cabinet as secretary last April.\n\nBottomley denies that the Major government is trying to privatize the NHS, insisting that she herself has never received private medical care, and points out that her daughter is a doctor with the NHS.\n\nShe supports women\u2019s rights and equality, and is responsible for the governmental department that is the country\u2019s largest employer of women--some 750,000--mostly nurses.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t blot her copybook, her political future is bright indeed. As opposition Labor MP Frank Field, with whom she worked on joint committees, says of her \u201cEnglish rose\u201d attraction and clear speaking voice: \u201cShe knows that she is incredibly good-looking--and this government is short of talking heads on the box that don\u2019t make voters beg for the return of steam (early) radio.\u201d\n\nQuestion: There is growing criticism that, over the years, the medical research Establishment has wavered on issues that concern women more than men. For example, many critics both inside and outside the medical Establishment insist that breast cancer research has been neglected in relation to its incidence among women. Does that resonate in Britain?\n\nAnswer: I think there is little resonance of that here. Indeed, in this country we have taken forward a number of health programs directly related to women\u2019s health. We were one of the first countries in the world to have a national call and recall program for breast cancer and cervical cancer screening. And the new steps we have taken in our general practitioner contract--our family doctors contract--give them additional rewards for reaching almost universal coverage in the cancer-screening program. So one of the strengths of the National Health Service is its universality, its accessibility to all and, through the family doctor service, we are particularly determined to reach the groups who would otherwise be reluctant to come forward for health care, and, within that target audience, the needs of women--both in terms of cancer-screening and maternity services--are a clear priority.\n\nLast year I launched a document, \u201cYour Health--a Guide to Services to Women,\u201d available free to anyone who applied for it. It was extremely popular. Women are interested in health. They want to know what is available--they want to know for themselves and they want to know for their families.\n\nQ: The allocation of resources here has been a running argument. As people live longer, health care costs are higher. How does your government, or any government, cope with these costs vs. treatment? Do you foresee solutions as to how to deal with this in a time of dwindling revenues?\n\nA: Around the world it is clear that every country is facing the same challenges: aging population, rising expectations and the incredible ability of new medical techniques to combat diseases and disabilities that in the past would have been inconceivable. Our health service is one of the most efficient in the world. We spend a smaller share of our GNP, although a rising one, than many other countries, and it has great strength in that it is universally available, accessible to all and free at the point of delivery.\n\nThose are fundamental principles which I shall hold to. The reforms we have introduced have been about trying to ensure that we use those resources more effectively, that we integrate what I call the cultures of caring and costing. But, because we\u2019ve had a free health service, we\u2019ve very often been divorced from any knowledge or understanding of price or cost at all. In the minds of professionals and patients, it felt like a free service.\n\nOur reforms have been to try to secure better management control over resources so that we can maximize the ability of the service to deliver patient care. At the same time we have been introducing a health strategy so we actually get health authorities to begin to identify and assess the health need of the local population and spell out how they are going to meet that health need. Of course, that means making difficult choices between investment in intensive care, investment in the latest equipment and providing ever-improved services for mental illness or learning disabilities, for example.\n\nSome new techniques result in greater cost effectiveness--a rapid expansion in day surgery, for example. Whereas in the past patients would have gone into hospital for days or weeks, some use of pharmaceutical products can then reduce the need for hospital admission. So it is not necessarily the case that all medical advances lead to escalating costs. But as policy-makers we are in a much stronger position in this country, on the basis of our health reforms, to try to take the process forward, maximizing our ability to use those resources that we fight hard for, to get the best possible health benefit for the population.\n\nQ: Often you use the phrase \u201chealth reforms.\u201d What specifically do you mean by health reforms in the general sense?\n\nA: We have tried to reduce some of the bureaucracy and the monolithic nature of our National Health Service--so that hospitals can become free-standing organizations answerable to the (health) secretary--still part of the National Health Service but with a more effective management structure. Above all, we have separated out the role of commissioning health care, to the role of providing health care through the hospitals, both part of the National Health Service, but a clearer recognition of the functions and a greater transparency of the cost elements.\n\nQ: You do have an elaborate health service, and you also have very good private practices. Is there any fear--either from a government point of view or from an average patient--that somehow the government service may be second-rate compared with private health care?\n\nA: We have a modest private sector compared with almost any other country\u2019s, and ... my position is one of respect for the private sector; but my program is almost entirely concerned with ensuring that our National Health Service is and remains the envy of the world.\n\nPerhaps the most effective way of responding to your question is to make a personal statement, which is that I, my family, use the National Health Service. . . . I think it provides the best health care for me and my family. And what I am committed to is safeguarding that National Health Service, free, available to all, for the people of this country.\n\nQ: You don\u2019t want to privatize it?\n\nA: Not remotely on the agenda. I want to use the skills though, if there are management skills in the private sector--about the use of resources, about information technology, about management, about communication--that we can apply in the public sector.\n\nIf you are characterizing our health service in the past, I would say that our clinicians were outstanding, their techniques were in the forefront. We have to make sure that our management skills are as good in a public service as our clinical skills. And this is, of course, the whole focus of the Prime Minister\u2019s Citizens Charter program. Citizens Charter is about making sure that public services are accountable, that they give value for money, that they put the user in the forefront of concern. Our patients Charter has been the pioneer of the Citizens Charter movement, spelling out what are the rights and standards that patients can expect from the National Health Service, and we have been seeing real results in terms of falling waiting times, improved quality of service.\n\nQ: Do you think the British experience with the National Health Service bears lessons that the United States could learn?\n\nA: The strengths of the National Health Service are its universality, its availability to all. It seems that any health service ... needs to think about how to reach those groups who are often most at risk in terms of health need. So when it comes to HIV and AIDS, there are many anxieties about people coming forward, but having to pay for their treatment is not one of them. And those who are sick already have one handicap; we want to be sure that there is no further disincentive for them seeking treatment. The advantages of a system that encourages prevention is that you want to achieve the access. So that the strength is the universality.\n\nAn additional strength is our family doctor service, so that virtually every individual person in the country is signed on with a general practitioner--a generalist--who is the gatekeeper, the filter, a source of communication for the individual who is referred on to a hospital. Any other country taking forward a proposal has to examine those proposals in the context of its own traditions.\n\nQ: Specifically, how does Britain keep down the cost of health care?\n\nA: The issue will always be, for health secretaries, how to hold the ring between investing and encouraging those areas which don\u2019t necessarily hit the headlines. In addition, some of the more glamorous, experimental treatments, which cost huge resources, but result in relatively modest improvements in the quality of life, have to be balanced against areas where there is less public and political interest, but relatively modest sums can achieve substantial improvements. . . ."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/inside-parliament-conservatives-lose-patience-as-mrs-bottomley-loses-hospitals-1614362.html", "page_content": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inbox Get our free View from Westminster email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Sir Edward Heath murmured darkly about the \"political implications\" of Mrs Bottomley's decisions for Conservatives representing London seats. On Tuesday, Mr Brooke criticised the Secretary of State's lack of \"moral courage\" after she confirmed the closure of Bart's and the transfer of most of Guy's patients to St Thomas's in a Commons written reply rather than making a statement.\n\nRaising the issue yesterday, he told the House: \"If a hospital has been around for 900 years, for it to receive its death warrant through a written answer doesn't seem to me to be wholly worthy of the traditions of our party.\" Barts was founded in 1123.\n\nLater, having obliged Mrs Bottomley to make a statement by tabling a private notice question, Mr Brooke was comparatively restrained. \"Bart's is a national and international asset and in the post-industrial society such assets are of the highest importance in communicating British medical excellence to the world,\" he said.\n\nA former minister, Sir Rhodes Boyson, compared the closures to the abolition of grammar schools he fought against. \"We are now, on this side of the House, destroying the same traditions in the hospitals, which to my mind is a form of vandalism.\"\n\nThe normally loyal Roger Sims, MP for Chislehurst and vice-chairman of the Tory backbench health committee, praised Mrs Bottomley's \"courage\" in grasping the nettle of reorganisation but pleaded with her to show \"rather more sensitivity\". \"Consultation implies listening to what people have to say and taking account of their views,\" he said.\n\nWith closure of the accident and emergency unit at Edgware hospital raising as much passion as Bart's, Sir John Gorst, MP for Hendon North, asked if Mrs Bottomley accepted \"that democratic politics is about delivering to people what the majority want, and not about telling the majority of people what they should have?\n\n\"Does she not accept now that she is doing the wrong thing in the wrong way at the wrong time and in the wrong place?\"\n\nBut the most wounding criticism came from Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East: \"Mrs Bottomley has not succeeded as a senior member of the Cabinet because she has not - having listened to the half-baked account of some bureaucrat in her department or elsewhere, reached her own essential, human, social, clinical, medical and indeed political judgements on these matters.\"\n\nMr Dykes said the proposal to close the Edgware A&E unit was \"outrageous\" and Mrs Bottomley should think again.\n\nMrs Bottomley was supported by out-of-London Tories who have long complained that the capital's hospitals get too big a share of resources and by her husband, Peter Bottomley, MP for Eltham.\n\nSimon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Guy's, said more than 1 million people had signed a petition in support of the hospital and only 23 people had taken the opposite view. Wasn't there something wrong with public consultation when the Secretary of State had sided with the 23? Her work largely done by others, Margaret Beckett, the Labour health spokeswoman, told Mrs Bottomley: \"I hope you now recognise that your case is as dubious as your excuses for not putting that case to the House?\"\n\nBut though sounding nervous at times, the Secretary of State, stuck by her plans. They enjoyed \"widespread support within the clinical and academic worlds\" she said, and quoted so many eminent figures that Speaker Betty Boothroyd lost patience.\n\nMrs Bottomley's vision was of \"multi-faculty colleges with hospital clusters around them. That is the way to be world-class centres for research and education\". Longer journeys to hospital would be met by increased use of paramedics at the scene, she suggested.\n\nShe said the changes - covering hospitals in south and east London and around Barnet and Edgware - would be backed by \u00a3400m of capital investment on top of the \u00a3210m already being spent on improving primary care.\n\nRevenue savings would amount to some \u00a375m a year compared to a cost of \u00a328m at the moment from duplication and fragmentation.\n\n\"My job must be, if we are to have a comprehensive service, free at the point of use, able to pioneer new treatments ... to address the need for change,\" Mrs Bottomley insisted.\n\nBut the shouts of \"resign\" from the Opposition benches and the steam from Tory MPs spoke more of a change for the minister."}, {"url": "https://therealslog.com/2012/10/10/revealed-at-last-the-hunt-bottomley-link/", "page_content": "The one-word secret of Hunt\u2019s success:\n\nNEPOTISM\n\nHis relationship to Virginia Bottomley\u2026..his dealings with the British Council\u2026.his inheritance of the SW Surrey constituency\u2026.his father\u2019s history in UK Health provision\u2026.the Health interests for whom Bottomley now works\u2026.his capture of the Health portfolio in the recent reshuffle.\n\n\u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663 \u2663\n\nThroughout his career, Jeremy Hunt\u2019s advancement somehow always seemed to involve his path crossing that of the former Virginia Bottomley, known since 2005 as Baroness Nettlestone. Now \u2013 with the help of some initial sleuthing by regular Slogger Jackie \u2013 I can offer readers a big clue: they are cousins. Laid out below (for anyone with any feeling for the importance of meritocracy) is how still, in 2012, career progress of the type admired by David Cameron \u2013 \u201cthe leg up\u201d \u2013 is alive and well. One where the right tie, who you know, and above all a well-connected family, are all you need to prosper.\n\nHaving studied the modus operandi of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for some eighteen months now, the most striking thing about him is a penchant for toughing out any and all criticisms with a bare face. Almost nothing uttered in public by this man is ever anything other than an embellishment, or a distortion, or a boldly stated but clearly inaccurate statement: \u201cI gave full disclosure\u201d, \u201cI have done nothing wrong\u201d, \u201cIt was a purely fact-finding mission\u201d and so forth.\n\nToday at the Conservative Party conference, Hunt excelled himself by suggesting to his audience that his father \u201cworked as a manager for the NHS\u201d. It is an exaggeration served with lashings of deception: Sir Nicholas John Streynsham Hunt (Daddy) was Admiral of the Fleet in his main career and, once retired, became a quangoista par excellence. He was Chairman of the South West Surrey District Health Authority from 1990 to 1995 and then Chairman of Nuffield Hospitals from 1996 to 2001.\n\nRing any bells? The clues are \u2018South West Surrey\u2019, \u2018Health\u2019 and \u2018Nuffield\u2019. And it might not be too hard to imagine where he got the assist into those cosy sinecures: for not long previously, his niece Virginia Bottomley had been\u2026.Minister of Health.\n\nAdmiral Sir John had an elder brother (now carefully airbrushed out of the Wikipedias and other genealogies), one Roland Colin Charles Hunt. He married Hilda Pauline Garnett, whose brother was W. John Garnett. WJG had a daughter called Hilda Brunette Maxwell Garnett\u2026.aka, Virginia Bottomley.\n\nVirginia Bottomley eventually became MP for South West Surrey.\n\nRing any bells? Ah yes, that\u2019ll be the same South West Surrey for which her cousin Jeremy Hunt became MP when Virginia decided to quit open politics and become a quangoista\u2026just like her uncle the Admiral of the Fleet.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t the first time La Bottomley had been helpful to cousin Jeremy. She\u2019d joined infamous quango The British Council. And it might not be too hard to imagine where Jezzer got the assist into becoming a monopoly supplier to the British Council with his company Hotcourses.\n\nNor would it involve much of a lateral leap in thought to understand how \u2013 after Hotcourses completely cocked up the first job it did for the Council \u2013 an elaborate system of shelf companies and oddly-headed invoices enabled Jeremy to carry on secretly being a preferred monopoly supplier to The British Council for the next five years\u2026on the back of which he amassed the fortune of which he is so proud today.\n\nThen Virginia moved upwards into Another House, becoming Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone in 2005 \u2013 handing her seat to Jeremy Hunt as if it might be a family heirloom. Hunt was duly elected, and South West Surrey thus became a Rotten Borough.\n\nThis is what Baroness Nettlestone mainly gets up to in the Lords: she lobbies on behalf of the private health sector via her directorship of BUPA. She must\u2019ve been a shoe-in for that little earner, she having been Health Secretary in charge of the public sector an\u2019 all\u2026but then, probably Uncle Admiral\u2019s contacts at Nuffield helped. You know how these things work.\n\nRight then\u2026.private health lobbying, and a creeping pauperisation of NHS hospitals by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. But Andrew was a bit accident-prone \u2013 rather like his Cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt, who partnered Newscorp in his educational supplies business, went to New York to broker a change of Newscorp\u2019s Party preference from Labour to Tory, and then was quite coincidentally put in charge of adjudicating on the Newscorp bid for BSkyB. As we all know, that ended in tears.\n\nBut Jeremy Richard Streynsham Hunt didn\u2019t go down a snake like the luckless Lansley. He went two rungs up the ladder to become\u2026.Secretary of State for Health. To paraphrase the old Lord Robert Cecil gag about \u2018Bob\u2019s yer uncle\u2019 it seems the only way is up if Ginny\u2019s yer cousin. As I blogged yesterday, Cameron didn\u2019t want to give Jezzer the job. But Mr Hunt appears to have three very strong holds on the Prime Minister.\n\nFirst, he is very \u2013 like I mean extremely \u2013 well in at Newscorp. \u201cJeremy is our man now: don\u2019t mess with him\u201d. Second, he is bankrolled by murky mega-donor JHJ Lewis \u2013 Chairman of the Groucho Club (a media-luvvie venue proven to have illegally recorded the coke-snorting antics of its celebrity customers) and influential eminence grise in the Conservative Party. And third, he has the influence and contacts via Bottomley to oil wheels here and there in the gradual sale of an insolvent NHS to organisation like \u2013 and here I\u2019m only offering suggestions of course \u2013 BUPA and Nuffield.\n\nSo there\u2019s Jeremy newly installed as Health Secretary after just seven short years as an MP. This is a summary of his meteoric rise:\n\nHe made a fortune at the taxpayers\u2019 expense as monopoly supplier to a notorious quango where, by happy coincidence, his cousin sat on the Board. He became MP for SW Surrey where, by happy coincidence, his cousin had been MP previously. He became Minister in charge of Media & Culture where, by happy coincidence, he wound up steering his pals at Newscorp in the right direction. And he became Health Secretary partly because, by happy coincidence, his cousin is a lobbyist for the private health sector.\n\nThe Conservative Party claims to be all about the Bonfire of the Quangos, the Party where everyone who wants to work hard can get an even break, and the Big Society. But its members, acolytes and backers remain what they\u2019ve always been: a small Secret Society where who is far more important than what you know. Hilariously, Virginia Bottomley has described herself as \u201ca one-nation\u201d Conservative. Well I guess we now know which of Disraeli\u2019s two nations she was talking about.\n\nSadly, \u2018Red\u2019 Ed\u2019s flimsy attempt to take on the mantle of Benjamin Dizziband last week is no kind of alternative to the privatisation and commercial exploitation of Westminster by the Tory Party\u2019s mates in big business and banking. The Ed Miller Band too has its UNITE mates who must be satisfied, its largely pro-Labour immigrants who must be loved up, its teachers who resist real educational reform, and its public sector employees who vote Labour by a margin of two to one.\n\nThe truth is that none of our triumvirate of Westminster Parties has the majority citizen in mind when formulating policy. The Libdems represent slavish support for Brussels and all its works. Labour thinks equality is about affirmative, favouritist action for noisy minorities. And the Tories think they work for anyone with money and power. Brick by brick, the Wall of Class knocked down during the 1950s has been replaced by the Barrier of Influence in the 21st century. Merit? It doesn\u2019t even get a look in. Decency? That\u2019s for wimps.\n\nAll this disgusting graft, influence and interest-group manipulation can only be ended by banning all monied political lobbying and all political Party contributions, whatever their size. I repeat, the State must fund all political Parties and keep commerce out: it is the only way our once great and respected political culture can be revived.\n\nI would urge all those reading this piece to examine the evidence presented as to the character of Our Jeremy at The Slog\u2019s dedicated page, Hunt Balls.\n\nI think the time may have come for an all-voter petition demanding the removal of Mr Hunt from the Health Secretaryship.\n\nRelated in a rather vomit-inducing way: why the forces ranged against Cameron will prove irresistible\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/virginia-bottomley/biography", "page_content": "Virginia Bottomley Biography\n\nBritish politician\n\nPersonal detailsBorn (1948-03-12) 12 March 1948 (age:75)Dunoon, ScotlandPolitical partyConservativeSpousePeter Bottomley \u200b(m.:1967)\u200bChildrenJosh \u00b7 Cecilia \u00b7 AdelaEducationPutney High SchoolAlma materUniversity of Essex (BA)London School of Economics (MA)SignatureWebsiteOfficial websiteVirginia Bottomley's voicefrom the BBC Front Row, 25 April 2013\n\nVirginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Bottomley, Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, PC DL (n\u00e9e Garnett, born 12 March 1948) is a British Conservative Party politician and headhunter.
