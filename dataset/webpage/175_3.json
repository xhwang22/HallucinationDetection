It may impact her 2024 Olympic plans, too.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone strays from the 400m hurdles \u2014 where she is the reigning Olympic and world champion and four times broke the world record \u2014 to race her first flat 400m in two years at a Diamond League meet in Paris.\n\nPeacock streams it live from 3-5 p.m. ET. CNBC airs coverage Saturday at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat we know is this: On Friday, McLaughlin-Levrone will race against the Olympic and world silver medalist in the 400m (Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic) and the 2019 World champion (Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain).\n\nNext month, McLaughlin-Levrone will race the flat 400m at the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships, the qualifying meet for August\u2019s world championships. She is racing that flat 400m at USATF Outdoors at least in part because she already has a bye into the 400m hurdles at worlds as defending champion.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: which race McLaughlin-Levrone will enter at worlds. Her coach, Bobby Kersee, said last month that she will choose between the 400m and 400m hurdles for worlds, should she finish top three in the 400m at USATF Outdoors to qualify in that second event. She will not try a 400m-400m hurdles double at worlds.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone was asked Thursday which event she would pick if given the choice.\n\n\u201cIs it bad to say I don\u2019t know?\u201d she said in a press conference. \u201cHonestly, ask me after tomorrow.

That includes fellow American Sandi Morris, who won the first three Diamond League meets last year, then took silver behind Moon at worlds on count back. Plus 34-year-old Slovenian Tina Sutej, who ranks second in the world this season.\n\nWomen\u2019s 5000m \u2014 3:24 p.m. ET\n\nIncludes the world record holders at 1500m (Kenyan Faith Kipyegon in her first 5000m since 2015), 3000m steeplechase (Kenyan Beatrice Chepkoech) and the 5000m and 10,000m (Ethiopian Letesenbet Gidey). Plus new American 10,000m record holder Alicia Monson, who is third on the U.S. all-time 5000m list at 14:31.11.

Holloway, who has a bye into worlds as defending champion, overcame a rare defeat in the Diamond League opener in Rabat to win his last two races. He is the fastest man in the world this year at 13.01 seconds.

Reigning Olympic and world champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas is on maternity leave. Paulino is the only other woman to break 49 seconds since the start of the pandemic, and she\u2019s done it each of the last two years. Naser is the only other active woman to have broken 49 seconds, doing so in winning the 2019 World title (before she was banned for two years, through the Tokyo Olympics, for missing drug tests). McLaughlin-Levrone\u2019s personal best from 2018 is 50.07 seconds, but she was just 18 years old then and focusing on the hurdles. Still, that time would have won the 2022 U.S. title. Last month, University of Arkansas junior Britton Wilson ran the fastest time by an American since 2009 \u2014 49.13 \u2014 but she might bypass the flat 400m to focus on the hurdles this summer.\n\nMen\u2019s 100m \u2014 4:12 p.m. ET\n\nCould be a meeting between the reigning Olympic men\u2019s 100m champion (Marcell Jacobs of Italy) and world men\u2019s 200m champion (American Noah Lyles), which hasn\u2019t happened since the 2009 World Championships 100m final, where Usain Bolt lowered the world record to 9.58 seconds and American Tyson Gay was second in a then-American record 9.71. Later in that meet, Bolt won his first world 200m title, a crown he held concurrently with his Olympic 100m titles through his 2017 retirement. But Jacobs, citing nerve pain, scratched out of the last two Diamond League meets, which were to be showdowns with world 100m champion Fred Kerley. Jacobs did show up for Thursday\u2019s press conference. Lyles has a bye onto the world team in the 200m, but also wants to make the four-man U.S. team in the 100m. He ranks fifth among Americans by best time this season \u2014 9.95.\n\nMen\u2019s 800m \u2014 4:51 p.m. ET\n\nThe top five from the world championships are entered, led by Olympic and world champion Emmanuel Korir of Kenya. This event was in an international doldrums for much of the time since Kenyan David Rudisha repeated as Olympic champion in 2016, then faded away from competition. But the emergence of 18-year-old Kenyan Emmanuel Wanyonyi has injected excitement this season. Wanyonyi is the world\u2019s fastest man this year.

And that means more to me than anything \u2014 the ability to put a smile on someone\u2019s face,\u201d emotional Ledecky said. \u201cI just really wanted to get a gold medal to have that opportunity again.\u201d\n\nKatie Ledecky achievements\n\nThe swimming prowess in Katie has made her record an impressive performance.
