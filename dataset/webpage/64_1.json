She warmly welcomes her new class, but Yamaguchi has to find out, that she has gotten the short straw at school. Her class consists of the worst thugs and wanna-be gangsters, who have everything else in their head but learning. The class leader is Sawada Shin (Jun Matsumoto), who is always very quiet and has his heart at the right place. It's just that he has been let down by adults one time too often.\n\nYamaguchi's initial attempts to win the students' trust remain without success, but as time goes by the students realize that their new teacher in fact always is on their side, no matter what, and keeps supporting them whereever she can. This not only includes Yamaguchi shielding her students from hateful head teacher Sawatari (Katsuhisa Namase), but also means that she fights for them with bare fists, while also giving them important lessons in life. However, there is one thing that neither students nor the teaching staff should find out: Yamaguchi is actually the daughter of a Yakuza leader, prefering her job as a teacher to becoming the new leader of a gangster organisation...\n\n\n\n\n\nReview: \"Gokusen\" is not your standard high-school drama series. With a lot of fresh humor, which is always very Japanese and therefore quite wacky, this lighthearted comedy show makes for a compelling series, despite its sometimes more serious undertone. Unfortunately, latter fact proves to be the evident downside of \"Gokusen\". Over and over again we are bombarded with educational monologues of Yankumi, who always wins over her listeners despite the initial doubt of her students. Therefore, the show is compelled to get something artificial to it, which becomes even more bothering when looking at the fact that the humor is actually simply great at times. No doubt, it's all about slapstick, but it works out nonetheless, thanks to oddball characters and some off-the-wall moments, which certainly will make you laugh out loud. That is if you are into Japanese humor, of course. If that's the case then you will have one hell of a fun ride with \"Gokusen\", despite its minor flaws.\n\n\n\nThe main premise may already sound familiar, but a female teacher who in reality is a Yakuza member is still something that serves fantastically as the groundwork to weave some funny stories around it. Yankumi, as she is called by her students more or less fondly, is idealistic, also lives in her own world of dreams and has something innocent about her, which is also carried by her appearance. With her glasses and pigtails she somehow depicts your typical picture of a shy wallflower, even though she certainly is everything but that, as we find out later. Although she gets bullied by her students at first, she only overlooks this behaviour as long as it takes place within the borders of what's justifiable. As soon as her students cross the line, she also shows another different side of her. Most of the time she only shows this new face of hers when it comes to protecting her students, though. Shin and his buddies always end up with problems and Yankumi fights their battles for them - literally.\n\n\n\nAs a Yakuza-daughter Yankumi, naturally, knows how to stand up to any challange and so she even beats up a whole bunch of gangster, if these thugs think of hurting her students. There isn't anything great to say about the fights themselves, sometimes you can just tell that they are merely posed, but what gets really annoying is Yankumi's general appearance during those scenes. She takes off her glasses, opens her hair and suddenly there is a new person standing in front of us, whose gaze can make your blood run cold. The first two or three times this may be somewhat stylish and cool, but before long it really gets annoying. The show has the same problem on other ocassions, too. For example: The students get into trouble in every single episode and Yankumi eventually gets them out of it, while also providing them with an important lesson for life. As time goes on, this just happens to get repeated too often, so that Yankumi's speeches become very contrived.\n\n\n\nInstead of focusing too much on this more serious aspect of the show - and in fact, some few episodes are so serious in tone over a longer period, that it becomes quite bothersome - \"Gokusen\" would have done well if it had completely put its focus on the humor. Because that's where the show really can score. Yankumi often shifts to Yakuza language when she gets excited, she surprises her students on the most inappropriate ocassions and before long even manages to build a buddy-like relationship towards them. The humor is always inventive, not really smart, but it always hits the right notes. For most part this is thanks to the characters, of whom head teacher Sawatari stands out the most. He doesn't only produce some laughter because of his appearance and his hair cut alone, but also manages to create a truely comical role. In further roles you get to see Itoh Misaki (\"Train Man - Series\"), as a beautiful teacher and ex-\"Morning Musume\" member Nakazawa Yuko, who all do a great job of bringing some charming characters onto screen.\n\n\n\nAt home Yankumi shows her true self, which means that she oftentimes scolds her \"subordinates\", and still seems to be the daughter of a Yakuza boss, even though there is no doubt that her path is set and that she won't take over the \"family business\", yet instead wants to stay a teacher. A decision her father is approving. Every time Yankumi finds herself in a dead end her father sets her back on track. Utsui Ken depicts the Yakuza boss as a good-natured and loving father, and not as the kind of person you would expect a Yakuza boss to be, which once again shows that \"Gokusen\" simply wants to be lighthearted entertainment and nothing more.\n\nA little bit sad though, is that many of the supporting characters remain quite shallow. Yankumi even has a small love story with a policeman, which is only sketched out, however, yet this policeman as well as his partner and many of the teachers at school remain colourless.\n\n\n\nThe chemistry between the characters is great, which makes it easy for us to forgive the unnecessarily overdone serious moments and educational speeches of Yankumi, as well as the fact that Yankumi herself also could have been elaborated better. Nevertheless, Yukie Nakama (\"Shinobi - Heart under Blade\") does a fantastic job of portraying this wacky character of a loving teacher, who always wants to be there for her students.\n\nThe relationship of Yankumi and Shin depicts something like the show's center. Shin is the representative of the class, even though he is of the quiet and cool kind. At first he denies Yankumi any access to his train of throughts, because he has been disappointed by adults one time too often. But eventually he has to understand that Yankumi is different. This slightly dramatic touch fits pretty well into the series, if it weren't for the overdone drama that can also be found every now and then, and which can't be called convincing.\n\nDespite all that, the creators/directors deliver a show that is a lot of fun and provides you with nice humor, as well as refreshingly wacky characters. No wonder that there is already a third season being aired at the moment. Definitely recommendable!\n\n(Author: Manfred Selzer)\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy this movie:\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/gokusen/drama", "page_content": "Drama\n\nThe drama aired on Nippon TV from April 1, 2002 to July 3, 2002.

Her class, 3-D, is apparently \"the class from hell\" (misfits, rebels, lazies, bullies, etc.); they are disrespectful and downright violent towards her. But she's actually the third generation heir of the Oedo yakuza family and therefore unfazed by their threats. This drama basically follows Yankumi as she earns the respect of her class by helping them become more than just delinquents. Although the story lines are somewhat formulaic and you can kind of predict what will happen, it's still a very enjoyable watch because all the characters are interesting, the acting is terrific, and the morals are inspiring. It also has plenty of good stuff to say about friendships and family.\n\n\n\nIn each episode, she helps a new and different student with their problems by either kicking ass or talking her way out of it. It's quite formulaic, but the stories are still entertaining. And often hilarious. One of my favorite stories was the one revolving around the Oguri Shun character, Uchiyama Haruhiko; his friends attempt to catch a purse-snatcher to clear his name. Yankumi dressing up as a naive schoolgirl and other hijinx occur. Other stories include helping a classmate get over a family death, beating up rival school gangs, high school romances, etc. Each incident unites the class even more.\n\n\n\nYukie Nakama acts very well, effectively capturing Yankumi's idealism, spunk, and tough-love. She's a riot in this show, often interrupting her students' discussions or kicking their asses. The only part that is off about her performance is the fight scenes are laughable, even though she's supposed to be a skilled fighter. There's even a humorous romantic sideplot for her; she battles with the other teachers for the handsome Detective Shinohara's attention, which often results in embarrassing and funny situations. The actors playing her family are also hilarious. And finally, the actors playing her 3-D students were really impressive, especially Jun Matsumoto. This was the first drama I've seen him in and he's terrific here playing the mysterious Sawada Shin. He's the only student that seems to suspect Yankumi is not your everyday teacher...and soon they're trading sarcastic quips and other hilarious barbs. For example, Yankumi: \"Is that Keita's girlfriend? Is he going to as her out?\" Shin: \"Why are you here? Go away.\" etc. There are many good verbal barbs in this show.\n\n\n\nBottom line: Although a little formulaic, Gokusen succeeds because of its interesting characters and the wonderful actors playing them. Really enjoyable and addictive drama. I enjoyed every single episode, even if I knew what was going to happen, because it was just plain good television: great acting, good writing, and interesting characters.\n\n\n\n9/10."}, {"url": "http://futureblues.com/gokusen/drama.html", "page_content": "Gokusen (Series 1) is an NTV drama that originally aired in Japan from April 17 to July 3, 2002.

This movie is set to be the final Gokusen live action production, and will serve as a cap to the whole series. While the movie focuses on the students of season 3's Class 3-D, there are some notable appearances from some of Yankumi's previous students from both seasons 1 and 2.\n\nA trailer for the movie can be viewed at the film's Official Site\n\n\n\nAs for finding the drama? Well, it has been released on four Region 2 DVDs in Japan, with 3 episodes per DVD. (This seems like a pretty good deal to me, Japanese DVDs can be evil and only have one episode sometimes). These DVDs are only in Japanese of course, with no English subtitles. However the acting and plots in this series are often so exaggerated and manga-like, that it usually isn't that hard to figure out what is going on, even without subtitles. In my opninon, anyway ^_^ You can buy these Region 2 DVDs Through Amazon Japan.

Will check any mistake when I wake up later. xD\n\nGokusen's 1st season aired in Japan in 2002.In May of 2006, the series made its way to the local TV as the very first Japanese drama to be shown in the Philippines via GMA (Channel 7).Anyway, going back, the reason I decided to post this is because I realized I never got to mention Gokusen that much here in my journal. Good thing I checked on my older blogs and found THIS , though quite embarrassing to look back at how I used to write.\ud83d\ude02I'm really a big Yankumi fan and until now I want to achieve her coolness and passion. Because of her, I always think that connecting well with students is so important not just inside the classroom but also outside - - and guess what, I'm still in touch with my students especially those I handled back in 2007-2008. So much nostlgia just remembering the good old days.GOKUSEN is a drama that touches lives of both students and teachers. We all became a student once in our lives so it's not impossible to relate to the fun, adventures and struggles of the students in the series. Each episode has a lesson to teach. Each character has words of wisdom to live by. We're not just an audience but a part of Yankumi's big classroom. That must be the reason why it left an impact to us.So,- for the life lessons- for making us value our friends and our school days- for showing us the real meaning of being \"strong\"- for proving that people can change as long as someone believes in them- for being an eye opener to the adults that what's problematic to their perspective may actually be a call for help- for all the laughters and tears- for the casts that made us love and hate their characters- for the awesome OST- for the happy memories of going home just to be able to catch you on TV- for letting us meet a wonderful teacher named Kumiko Yamaguchi a.k.a. Yankumi- for the friends we met because of a shared passion- for introducing me to Matsujun, that lead me to listening to Arashi, that also lead me to Johnny's Entertainment, and look where I am now, still a J&A trash HAHAHAHAHAHAhahahaha- for being the gateway to more Japanese dramas- for the consistent reminder that anime-guys exist in real life (oh yes I'm looking at you ALL GOKUSEN main student casts from S1 to S3)- and finally, for being the first Jdrama to enter our lives after all the Taiwanese and Kdrama craze in PHI might still talk about Gokusen in the next 15 years. Might still tell same things over and over again as if it was just yesterday. Hopefully people would still consider Gokusen as something \"good to watch\" someday despite the numerous dramas shown seasonally. Who knows, we might even get a new adaptation. But this Gokusen remains legendary and most memorable.

That means minus Oguri Shun and Horitaki Maki, everyone else was spot on in their characters no matter how ridiculous and illogical the scripts asked of them. Don\u2019t complain since they warn you about it in the 1st episode. Suspend your beliefs and enjoy the view.\n\n\u2014 The Plot \u2014\n\n\n\nChant with me: \u201cYou\u2019re watching nonsense makes sense. Totally.\u201d\n\nSano: I\u2019m gonna sulk for the first half of the drama! My ankle was injured but that\u2019s not the main reason why I quit high-jump. Mizuki shouldn\u2019t know this.\n\nMizuki: Oh no! My super idol quits high-jump because of me! Me! Clearly, there\u2019s only ONE solution to solve this dilemma! I\u2019m leaving my high-school life behind and join an all-boy school! AM NOT A STALKER! Just a supportive FAN! That\u2019s the foundation of love!\n\nWriter: Remember, your hair must be short. That\u2019s the only requirement to BE a boy. Your soft voice is fine. Cause the boys are dumb.\n\nMizuki: What about my growing curve?\n\nWriter: Let\u2019s not flatter yourself kiddo. Your acceptance to the school promises ensuing hijinks!\n\nKaptain: Uh, sad to pop your bubbles, Writer. The boys here don\u2019t need additional stimuli (Mizuki). They don\u2019t sit around and wait for Crazy to come. They bring insanity to the table!\n\n\u2014 The Characters & Performances \u2014\n\nSano Izumi is played by everyone (mine too)\u2019s favorite actor, Oguri Shun, and I\u2019ll say this \u2013 he was pretty much sleepwalking in the first half of the drama. I didn\u2019t see life in his eyes until episode 6/7 when he began showing signs of concern in regards to the blossoming friendship between Mizuki and Nakatsu. Needless to say, Sano is one of my least favorite characters. He\u2019s the popular kid at school, however introverted he may be, a champion in high jump; someone who isn\u2019t worry of being friendless because other students swarm around him all day and night. His character design is the type I dislike because the connection doesn\u2019t work both ways. Whenever he\u2019s in trouble, countless hands would offer to help and yet when it comes to the strong bond shared between the classmates, I didn\u2019t see it from him. Thus, my indifference towards Sano is due to his lack of involvement with the students on campus. Heck, his friendship with Nakatsu was barely there.\n\nSome moments where Sano\u2019s not busy being a grumpy couch:\n\nSilly, silly boys.\n\nThanks to Nakatsu, Sano isn\u2019t completely boring in my book. He finally has someone to play off with.\n\nhehehe Oscar doesn\u2019t look forgiving. \ud83d\ude1b\n\nThe Maid & The Nurse: Front View\n\nBack View\n\nHorikita Maki portrayed Ashiya Mizuki and the acting made me wail in despair. Oh Maki, Maki. I adore you, I really do. Ever since I saw her in Atashinchi no Danshi, I loved that she doesn\u2019t overact. But apparently, that has become a dangerous trait because her characters are usually unmistakably her, the star everyone loves for being proper and quiet. I found myself restraining from grabbing her shoulders and screaming, \u201cBring some life into your character!\u201d It\u2019s fitting in Nobuta wo Produce where she portrayed a lonely and cynical teenager. It\u2019s not a sin to be a boring person in real life (she said so herself). However, as an actor, she needs to immerse herself in the role and bring the paper personality to life. If she can\u2019t bring chops to the acting plate, prepare to be served cold on that plate instead. Harsh, but true.\n\nThe other problem is\u2026she can\u2019t emote. She can\u2019t make me feel for her characters (unless she\u2019s being bullied and I\u2019m manipulated by the situation, not her acting). It\u2019s the same case for Mizuki. Maki is flat and bland in this role. She didn\u2019t even try to act like a boy, which is essentially the source of comedy for her own character. Is the original heroine in the manga this dull? Because in every scene she was with another actor, 99.9% of the time, I was staring at the other actors simply because they breathed life while she was occupied being the stiff Maki. The other insignificant .1%, I was observing the trees, birds, and you know, the environment. In short, her character just doesn\u2019t stand a chance against the others. You\u2019d think the writer ought to spice up their female lead to avoid the case of Double D (dead & dull), but they didn\u2019t, sadly.\n\nSomeone please reassure me that she has improved in recent projects.\n\nSo not as a surprise, I didn\u2019t care for her and Sano\u2019s nonexistent romance. In one particular scene when they were giving each other the supposed \u201celectric flirty\u201d eyes in front of the class, I mentally checked out briefly because it didn\u2019t make sense with their turtle-paced development. Her constant worries about him quickly became irritating and provoked eye rolls from me. She transforms into a naggy girlfriend who wants to interfere with every aspect of his life.\n\nIkuta Toma as Nakatsu Shuichi\n\nOne episode in and I was asking myself, \u201cWho is this kid?\u201d because he brings light and fun into every scene. Toma played this role, a confused and hormonal teenager, to perfection. I couldn\u2019t imagine Hana Kimi without Nakatsu; that\u2019s how crucial his role is. I went in as a fan of Shun and Maki, but flew out a big fan of his. Frankly, he\u2019s not that handsome or pretty, so looks clearly isn\u2019t the hook element here. (I was paying attention to\u2026um.. Hiro!) What I liked most about his performance is he didn\u2019t try to be cute. His smooth actions, goofy expressions worked well together and in sync with his outrageous thoughts. He didn\u2019t mean for them to be cute but we interpreted them as so because the intention behind is sweet and adorable. (Accepting his homosexuality, imagining a child with two fathers, trying to solve the said dilemma.) I died several times and killed my rewind button. All his monologues crack me up. The best ones CANNOT BE DESCRIBED IN WORDS! See them below in actions.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not HOMO!!\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014> \u201cIKE IKE GO GO ORE GO! GO!\u201d\n\nMy only gripe with Nakatsu lies in the writing. Isn\u2019t he a passionate soccer player? For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t recall a scene where he actually kicks a ball!\n\nHis romance with Mizuki: To be honest, the romance between them is generated mostly because of Nakatsu\u2019s crazy imaginations and devotion. Mizuki does not give him even a glance. There was this moment where the writer could\u2019ve incorporated and built on their friendship \u2013 that scene where she decided to leave in episode 7 like no one else mattered in her decision. He asked her to stay but she just stared blankly at him until Sano made his grand speech which convinced her to stay instantly. You know what? Her bland self can go marry Sano for all I care. There, I said it! I was rooting for Nakatsu and the girl from the high school across from theirs. If memory serves me right, her name\u2019s Komari. She is as cute as a button!\n\nThat was the worst dance ever in the history of high school dances. Nakatsu is a tree, while Mizuki is a log. While still stiff, the tree still has burning desires to love and conquer, but a log is just\u2026. lifeless. I still remember how she neglected him right after the dance to go and violate Sano\u2019s history with his dad.\n\nMizushima Hiro as Nanba Minami (Dorm #2 Leader) & Kimura Ryo as Senri Nakao\n\nHiro, this man is so pretty. His most attractive feature to me, strangely, is the button-like pinch on his chin. It gives his pretty face a unique edge, singling him out from the slew of other boys. But boy does need to eat. Actually, they ALL need to eat. Since I know Annette love Hiro, some screencaps of him for her: Click. Click. Click. Click. \ud83d\ude09\n\nI really loved the chemistry between Nanba and Nakao, and the forbidden love the latter often shows despite the former\u2019s dismay. I appreciated that however biased Nakao is towards Nanba, he isn\u2019t afraid to let him know if he\u2019s misled. There\u2019s this beautiful scene in episode 5 where Nakao posed a big question, \u201cHer happiness or your own happiness\u2026Which one will you pick?\u201d It\u2019s such an important question for youths since they\u2019re mostly about themselves. And I was glad Nanba displays more maturity than we gave him credit for. Choosing to congratulate his ex-girlfriend allows character growth, in that wishing her happiness, he\u2019s become the bigger person.\n\n\n\nIshigaki Yuma as Tennoji Megumi (Dorm #1 Leader) & Kyo Nobuo as Oscar Himejima Masao (Dorm #3 Leader)\n\nThe actor who played Tennoji looks muscular but still manages to exude a favorable amount of likability. Favorite moment is when he consciously squeezes his chest, powers up his arms, and yells, \u201cBABY!\u201d And that classic adorable scene of him holding an elderly woman\u2019s hand and taking her to the beach-flirting contest. If Nakatsu is an energetic ball of hormones, then Oscar is the resilient human form of Over-the-top. And kudos to the actor because he played Oscar unabashedly without holding back. A shy actor wouldn\u2019t have made this role look effortless.\n\n\n\nYamamoto Yusuke as Kayashima Taiki & the Doc Kamikawa Takaya as Umeda Hokuto\n\nDude, I think Yusuke is stalking me! Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around, almost all Jdramas that I have watched, he took part in. In here, he\u2019s known as the Ghost Boy, another oddball, in charge of detecting aura around the school. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find out he knew Mizuki is a girl. Probably the smartest character of them all.\n\nThe doctor is Mr. Hotness. *ring bells*\n\n\u2014 The Ending \u2014\n\nOh lordy, I hate goodbyes from now on. Seriously, after the third set of students, I was ready to let her GO! Nakatsu\u2019s short speech kept me attached. Once again, Toma proved that he can do both wacky and emotional. Just look at the way his eyes droop down ever so sadly and those bright eyes of his brimming with tears. *Heartbreak* Nakatsu, along with the 3 dorm leaders, is a joy to watch.\n\nRecommended? Heck to the YEAH! \u201cBABY!\u201d Although there are holes in the friendship card between Nakatsu and Sano, the overall bond shared between the supporting cast is strong and palpable. I loved these shameless kids. They\u2019re the real scene stealers and every episode is a riot. True to its simplistic storytelling, the angst was kept at bay, not exaggerated or overplayed. Watch if you want to see actors carry out outrageous expressions and idiotic actions. The pure reason why it\u2019s enjoyable is because it\u2019s ridiculous. Don\u2019t try to understand why they do what they do. Embrace it and you\u2019ll be entertained.\n\n\u201cHigh School \u2013 You hate it while you\u2019re at it, but in the end \u2013 you wish you caught every moment on camera.\u201d Nostalgia hits me. *right here*\n\nYou\u2019re sure?\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://channelkoreaar.pages.dev/posts/versions-of-the-k-drama-to-the-beautiful-you-differences-between-the-korean-japanese-and-taiwanese-adaptations/", "page_content": "In this article, Channel-Korea will provide you with everything you need to know about the differences between the Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese version of Hana-Kimi. So, stay tuned!\n\nHanazakari no Kimitachi e, The Original Manga#\n\nWe already know the live-action adaptations of this popular manga, but have you read the original story from the manga? If you haven\u2019t, check out below for further information about Hana-Kimi. Hana-Kimi, or Hanazakari no Kimi Tachi e (official title), or For You in Full Bloom (English title), is a sh\u014djo manga series by Hisaya Nakajo. The story was serialized in the semi-monthly sh\u014djo manga magazine of Hakusensha, Hana to Yume, in Japan. This manga series ended in August 2004 in Japan with volume 23. Hana-Kimi was published by Viz Media in English with the final volume released in April 2008 in the United States. Hana-Kimi tells the story of Ashiya Mizuki, a high school girl living in the United States who disguises herself as a boy to enroll in a private boarding school for all boys in Japan, thus getting closer to her idol, Sano Izumi. Sano is a high jumper, and she is amazed by his form and wants to know him better. Then, Mizuki persuades her parents to send her by herself to Japan. Without knowing that her daughter is going to go to a school for boys, her parents are letting her go. She cuts off her long hair to enter the school, disguises herself as a male, and attempts to give Sano hope after discovering that he is no longer doing high jump. In her new school, Mizuki has been assigned to be Sano\u2019s roommate. He soon finds out about her secret identity, without her knowing, and protects her. Because Mizuki is kinda dumb, she\u2019s revealing herself too often, it\u2019s almost a shame that no one else has found it out before. Yet Sano, this stoic, brave, and wholeheartedly kind guy is putting up with her and slowly starts falling for her. The boarding school has cultural festivals and programs to bring aspects of Japanese culture to you. But one of the main selling points of this manga is that it is very LGBT friendly without drifting to yaoi (boys love) or yuri (girls love) manga. Nakatsu, another school student, soon becomes friends with Mizuki, and although he\u2019s convinced that she\u2019s a male, he feels that he\u2019s falling for her. He is faced with this problem because he is persuaded that he is not gay, but because of Mizuki\u2019s personality, he has fallen wholeheartedly. How cute is that? Sadly, he\u2019s just a secondary character, we all know which the endgame couple is. But it doesn\u2019t hurt to see his cute moments with Mizuki and how adorable Nakatsu is when he\u2019s with her. With its 24 volumes, the manga itself is a little too long. The beginning is light and fun and cute, but for ages the majority drags. We\u2019re going through several story arcs that just feel like filler material, keeping you reading as you want the ship to set sail, but not satisfying you. Nonetheless, the ending was certainly satisfying. The romance is so good and makes you ship them so hard.\n\nTaiwanese Version, Hanazakarino Kimitachihe#\n\nHanazakarino Kimitachihe, or Hu\u0101 Y\u00e0ng Sh\u00e0o Ni\u00e1n Sh\u00e0o Nu, or The Tricks of Boys and Girls, is a 2006 Taiwanese drama featuring Ella Chen of S.H.E, Wu Chun and Jiro Wang of Fahrenheit and Danson Tang. It was based on the popular Japanese manga, Hanazakari no Kimitachi e. The series is the manga\u2019s first live-action television adaptation, preceding the 2007 Japanese version of Hanazakari no Kimitachi e, starring Shun Oguri as Izumi Sano, Maki Horikita as Mizuki Ashiya, and Toma Ikuta as Shuichi Nakatsu, broadcast on Fuji Television; the remake of Hanazakari no Kimitachi e 2011; and the 2012 South Korean adaptation To the Beautiful You. The Taiwanese version tells the story of Lu Rui Xi, a Taiwanese girl living in the United States. Lu Rui Xi (Ella Chen) is watching a Taiwanese high jumper Zuo Yi Quan (Wu Chun) documentary movie in America. Inspired by his performance, Rui Xi wants to pursue her idol and therefore moves to Taiwan\u2019s Ying Kai University. The academy is an all-boys school, though, and so Rui Xi cuts off all her hair and dresses up as a boy to go to school. She encounters Jin Xiu Yi (Jiro Wang) there. Rui Xi gets knocked unconscious during a friendly soccer match between the two, and so Quan helps by taking her to the doctor of the class, Mei Tian. Mei Tian, being gay, finds out Rui Xi to be a girl. He also learns, when Quan takes Rui Xi to take her to the sickbay, that she is actually a girl. He keeps everybody\u2019s identity a secret, including Rui Xi. According to Rui Xi, Quan had left high jumping after a road accident before her arrival and attempting to save her friend from falling over. When Rui Xi convinces Quan to return to high jumping, their relationship begins to blossom.\n\nJapanese Version, Hanazakari no Kimitachi e (2007)#\n\nHanazakari no Kimitachi e, or Ikemen Paradise, or also commonly abbreviated as Ike-para, is a Japanese television drama that aired on Fuji TV in 2007. This drama stars Maki Horikita, Shun Oguri, and Toma Ikuta. This drama was filmed at Keizai Ryutsu University. The Japanese version tells about Mizuki Ashiya (Maki Horikita), a Japanese girl living in the United States. One day, she saw a young athlete Izumi Sano in a high jump competition on television. She began to idolize him. One day, while in America, Sano suffered an injury trying to help Mizuki escape from a criminal. He stopped being a high jump athlete since then. Mizuki blamed herself for the incident and decided to go to Japan and help Sano return to being a high jump athlete. Sano attended an all-boys boarding school, so Mizuki had to pretend to be a boy to meet him again. Sano began to learn about Mizuki\u2019s true identity when Mizuki\u2019s brother came to Japan. Sano hid the fact that he knew Mizuki\u2019s true identity so she did not return to America. Sano who started getting close to Mizuki tried to do the high jump again. In the middle of the story, Mizuki falls in love with Sano. Meanwhile, Shuichi Nakatsu (Toma Ikuta), Sano\u2019s best friend, falls in love with Mizuki. Nakatsu was looking for shampoo when he accidentally saw Mizuki taking a bath and learned that Mizuki was a girl. Then, Nakatsu and Sano try to make Mizuki not return to America. The special episode of the 2007 Hana-Kimi tells about Sano and Nakatsu who remember memories of how Sano fell in love with Mizuki. The story takes place between episodes 7 and 8 in which Mizuki\u2019s American friend, Julie, came to Osaka Gakuen to pick up Mizuki to return to America. When Julie was in Japan, she acted as Mizuki\u2019s lover to see if Sano cared about Mizuki."}, {"url": "https://www.betaseries.com/es/show/hanazakari-no-kimitachi-e-2011", "page_content": "Hanazakari no kimitachi e (2011)\n\n2011 654 miembros 1 temporada 11 episodios\n\nThis drama is a remake of the popular school drama Hanazakari no Kimitachi e that was aired on Fuji TV in 2007.

Drama ini dibintangi oleh Maki Horikita, Shun Oguri, dan Toma Ikuta. Syuting drama ini berlokasi di Universitas Ryutsu Keizai.\n\nSebuah episode spesial telah ditayangkan secara regular dengan pemain yang sama. Cerita berlatar setengah tahun setelah identitas Mizuki sebagai perempuan terbongkar. Itu dekat dengan hari valentine, dan Sano dan Nakatsu sedang membicarakan liburan musim panas minggu lalu. Disitu cerita kembali ke seminggu yang lalu saat liburan musim panas, yang berada di antara episode 7 dan 8. Syuting dimulai pada tanggal 19 Maret 2008.[1] Sebuah konferensi yang diadakan pada tanggal 18 September 2008 mengumumkan keterangan lengkap episode spesial tersebut yang berjudul Sotsugyoshiki & 7 to 1/2 wa Special (\u5352\u696d\u5f0f&7\u30681/2\u8a71\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb ).[2]\n\nSebuah remake drama ini dengan pemeran yang berbeda ditayangkan di Fuji TV saat musim panas tahun 2011.[3]\n\nMizuki Ashiya (Maki Horikita) adalah seorang gadis Jepang yang tinggal di United States. Pada suatu hari, ia melihat seorang atlet muda Izumi Sano dalam suatu kompetisi lompat tinggi di televisi. Ia pun mulai mengidolakannya. Suatu hari, pada saat di Amerika Sano mengalami cedera karena berusaha menolong Mizuki kabur dari penjahat. Ia berhenti menjadi atlet lompat tinggi sejak saat itu. Mizuki menyalahkan dirinya sendiri atas insiden itu dan memutuskan untuk pergi ke Jepang dan membantu Sano untuk kembali menjadi atlet lompat tinggi.\n\nSano bersekolah di sekolah pria, sehingga Mizuki harus berpura-pura menjadi seorang pria untuk bertemu dengannya lagi. Sano mulai mengetahui identitas Mizuki yang sebenarnya ketika kakak Mizuki datang ke Jepang. Sano menyembunyikan fakta bahwa ia tahu identitas Mizuki yang sebenarnya sehingga ia tidak kembali ke Amerika. Sano yang mulai dekat dengan Mizuki mencoba untuk melakukan lompat tinggi lagi. Di tengah cerita, Mizuki jatuh cinta pada Sano. Sementara itu, Shuichi Nakatsu (Toma Ikuta), teman baik Sano, jatuh cinta pada Mizuki. Nakatsu sedang mencari shampoo ketika ia tidak sengaja melihat Mizuki sedang mandi dan mengetahui bahwa Mizuki adalah seorang wanita. Nakatsu dan Sano mencoba untuk membuat Mizuki tidak kembali ke Amerika.\n\nKetika Mizuki berlari ke tempat kompetisi Sano untuk membawakan jimat keberuntungannya, ia menabrak Hibari Hanayashiki (Iwasa Mayuko). Tanpa sengaja ia menjatuhkan dompetnya dan membuat Hibari tahu tentang identitasnya yang sebenarnya. Hibari menunjukkan passport yang ada di dalamnya ke kepala asrama tiga. Ia tidak bisa menunjukkannya kepada kepala asrama karena Nakatsu menganggunya. Ia hanya dapat memberi tahu bahwa ada seorang gadis di sekolah itu. Pencarian pun dimulai dan Mizuki merasa gugup, tetapi Nakatsu dan Sano menyusun rencana untuk menutupi identitas Mizuki yang sebenarnya. Suatu hari, kepala asrama melihat seorang gadis sedang berganti pakaian di kantor dan memanggil Mizuki. Sejak saat itu mereka tahu bahwa Mizuki adalah seorang wanita. Sano dan Nakatsu juga mengaku bahwa ia sudah mengetahui hal itu bahkan sebelum kepala asrama mengetahuinya. Kepala asrama membiarkannya untuk tetap disana hingga kelulusan, tetapi pada suatu hari saat teman-temannya sedang mempersiapkan untuk maid cafe, Mizuki jatuh dari tangga. Teman-temannya membuka pakaiannya dan mengetahui bahwa ia adalah seorang wanita membuat Mizuki memutuskan untuk kembali ke Amerika. Teman-temannya mengantar kepergian Miyuki hingga Miyuki naik mobil untuk pergi ke bandara, sementara Sano dan perawat sekolah mengantarnya hingga ke bandara dan Sano memberikan sebuah ciuman selamat tinggal untuk Mizuki.\n\nUntuk episode special Hana Kimi, menceritakan tentang Sano dan Nakatsu yang mengingat ingatan tentang bagaimana Sano jatuh cinta pada Mizuki. Cerita itu bersetting di antara episode 7 dan 8 di mana teman Mizuki dari Amerika, Julie, datang ke Osaka Gakuen untuk menjemput Mizuki untuk kembali ke Amerika. Ketika Julie berada di Jepang, ia berakting sebagai kekasih Mizuki untuk melihat apakah Sano peduli terhadap Mizuki.[1]\n\nInformasi episode [ sunting | sunting sumber ]\n\nEpisode Tanggal tayang Judul Rating\n\n(Kanto) 1 3 Juli 2007 Masuk ke Asrama Pria Terlarang 15.9% 2 10 Juli 2007 Ciuman yang Salah 16.8% 3 17 Juli 2007 Kakak yang Aneh 16.5% 4 24 Juli 2007 Ruangan Bertiga yang Berbahaya 16.6% 5 30 Juli 2007 Kisah Pantai Tanpa Harapan 15.3% 6 7 Agustus 2007 Permulaan Cinta Badai 14.7% 7 14 Agustus 2007 Tiba-Tiba di Atas Kasur 14.7% 8 21 Agustus 2007 Aku Menyukai Mizuki 17.5% 9 28 Agustus 2007 Terbongkar! 18.2% 10 4 September 2007 Tergantung Padaku 17.8% 11 11 September 2007 Aku Akan Melompat Untukmu 19.5% 12 18 September 2007 Kami Akan Melindungimu 21.0% Rata-rata 17.33%\n\nMeskipun drama ini merupakan adaptasi manga, tetapi ada banyak perbedaan antara manga tersebut dengan drama ini.

Sebagai contoh, di manga Sano cedera karena menyelamatkan temannya, sementara di drama Sano cedera karena menyelamatkan Mizuki. Ada juga yang jenis kelaminnya berbeda di manga dan drama. Akiha merupakan seorang pria dalam manganya, tetapi dalam drama, Akiha adalah seorang wanita. Perbedaan lainnya juga terdapat pada adegan Sano dan Nakatsu yang mengetahui bahwa Mizuki adalah wanita. Dalam manga, Sano mengetahui Mizuki adalah wanita ketika tanpa sengaja \"merasakan tubuhnya\", tetapi di drama Sano mengetahui hal itu ketika ia tanpa sengaja mendengar percakapan Mizuki dengan kakaknya.

Japanese dramas are a fantastic resource for enjoyment and cultural awareness if you have a favorite actor or just want to be entertained while learning Japanese or about Japan. However, the rest of the world is not as familiar with them. They often go unappreciated, and it is an un-sung genre.\n\nJapanese dramas have a certain charm despite possibly not being as well-known outside of Asia as their equivalents. They often serve as both amusement and critical analyses of Japanese society, the wider globe, and human nature. While many present a realistic view of Japan and its contemporary status, if it is in terms of interpersonal relationships, professional life, or culture, some are, of course, fictional.\n\nHere are just a few of the best examples of comedy from a variety of subgenres because the genre has such a wide spectrum. There aren\u2019t many things like it, and Western humor can\u2019t compare to the sardonic surrealism of Japanese comedy.\n\n37 Comedy Japanese Drama\n\nEven if you\u2019re a Westerner who didn\u2019t grow up in a Japanese home, Japanese comedy and other foreign comedic techniques have probably made their way into your culture. To get into the festive mood and help you enjoy some famous Japanese dramas, here is our compilation of the 37 Comedy Japanese Dramas To Watch In 2022.\n\n1. Mr. Nietzsche in the Convenience Store\n\nNietzsche-sensei, his new coworker at the convenience shop, causes Matsukoma-Kun, a veteran part-timer and unemployed university graduate, anguish and confusion. Nietzsche-sensei, also known as Nii Tomoharu, is a Buddhist student at a university with an unusual method of customer service.\n\nThe format of this show is comparable to an American comedy, where the scenes are shot in a limited number of places, and the funny dialogue is given more attention than the intricate plot. The setting of the story is a convenience shop, as you might have guessed from the title, and the characters are largely stored employees. The characters are all rather distinctive, and they communicate nicely with one another, even though the actors don\u2019t necessarily exhibit any award-winning performances.\n\nThere is a lowlife who only considers get-rich-quick schemes, an extremely somber, morbid individual who wants to become a monk, and a self-absorbed, immature manager as examples. The language of a group of people conversing in a convenience store late at night seems like it would be fairly practical and instructive for someone learning Japanese.\n\n2. Yuusha Yoshihiko to Maou no Shiro\n\nThe story takes place in a prehistoric era when dense forests blanketed the entire nation. Numerous people perish as a mysterious plague spreads. Yoshihiko, a heroic young man chosen because of his purity, embarks on a quest to save a community. His two objectives are to rescue his father, Teruhiko, who went in search of the plant but never came back, and to bring the fabled plant that may heal the epidemic back.\n\nThe story follows a motley crew of adventurers as they explore a foreign area while fending off monsters (many of which are paper mache). I\u2019ve never seen a Jdrama with this sense of humor before. On a higher level, it\u2019s completely arbitrary and absurd.\n\nThe characters are developed consistently and pull you into their odd world, even if they are very far from realistic. The performers have excellent comedic timing. It\u2019s possible that the humor in this drama won\u2019t be as fun once I\u2019ve reviewed it, but it fits the bill for a US syndication show.\n\n3. Gomenne Seishun!\n\nHeisuke Hara (Ryo Nishikido), who is plagued by remorse over a transgression from his high school days, teaches at his alma mater, an all-boys Buddhist high school. The plot develops as Heisuke\u2019s homeroom class is combined with a class taught by Risa Hachiya (Hikari Mitsushima) as an experiment as the school prepares to merge with an all-girls Catholic high school.\n\nHara Heisuke, a teacher at a high school in Shizuoka, is 31 years old. He is not an exceptional person; rather, he is like most individuals. But a misfortune accident that happened 14 years ago ruined his life. After that, he stayed with his hometown and alma mater out of responsibility. As a result of a drop in enrollment for the upcoming academic year, the boy\u2019s school where he works will be combined with a nearby girls\u2019 school.\n\n4. Yasuko to Kenji\n\nMasahiro Matsuoka plays Kenji, a former motorcycle gang leader who, at the age of 19, lost both of his parents in an unexpected accident and went on to become a girl\u2019s comic book artist. He puts himself in danger to protect Yasuko (Mikako Tabe), his younger sister, and prays in every aspect of her life. Yasuko, a high school student, is completely fed up with Kenji since he interferes excessively like a father, which is why they argue all the time.\n\nErika (Ryoko Hirosue), a former boss of a group of female motorcycle gangs, now runs a flower shop. Her younger brother, Jun (Tadayoshi Okura), who is quite attractive, is a high school student.\n\nAs in the past, Erika still feels something for Kenji. However, she makes unkind remarks to him when she first meets him that are at odds with her genuine thoughts. On the other hand, Yasuko has a love-at-first-sight relationship with the handsome Jun.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Erika, who is unable to be open about her uneasy but direct sentiments of love for Kenji? What will happen to Yasuko and Jun\u2019s first romance?\n\nAlso Read: 34 Best Noir Korean Drama To Watch: Dark Thriller Dramas\n\n5. Unubore Deka\n\nFriends refer to a 30-year-old single detective as \u201cUnubore\u201d because he thinks he is well-liked by women. He has a strong sense of romanticism and is pompous by nature. He wants to be married so badly that he\u2019s already purchased an apartment for his newlywed life. Every single time, he instantly falls in love with a female criminal. He will discover that the woman is to blame, even though his desire to meet her is overwhelming.\n\nHe will therefore provide her with the marriage license and the arrest warrant, saying, \u201cIf you marry me, I won\u2019t arrest you.\u201d He will then hold out an engagement ring and his handcuffs if that doesn\u2019t work. The criminal will ultimately decide to be arrested, which will break his heart. As he ties her up and puts handcuffs on her, he starts to cry.\n\nThis drama is perfect if you want to watch something entertaining, funny, and lighthearted. I\u2019d highly recommend this if you\u2019re looking for a drama to watch but aren\u2019t sure where to start or if you\u2019re trying to break out of a drama rut. However, this is nothing new; Nagase is amusing. His alternate personality, Unubore, is just absolutely hilarious. She falls in love with a criminal and offers them a choice in every episode of Unubore. He is constantly let down by their decision, though.\n\n6. Legal High\n\nYoung and promising lawyer Machiko Mayuzumi (Yui Aragaki) is dedicated to defending the weak and has a strong sense of justice. She begins her practice by defending a guy accused of murder who is being coerced into confessing to the crime. Mayuzumi\u2019s boss, Miki, requests that the suspect be exonerated of the allegations throughout the investigation, but she is unable to comply.\n\nHowever, Mayuzumi is told by Miki\u2019s assistant, Kimie Sawachi, that there is a lawyer who has won every case he has taken on who might be able to assist. Mayuzumi sets off in search of the man with the will to discover him.\n\nMayuzumi ultimately finds him, and it turns out that he is Kensuke Komikado (Masato Sakai), a superficial man who only cares about fame, money, and women. Mayuzumi, who is adamant about winning the case despite all of his defects, approaches Komikado to see if he can help her represent the defendant.\n\n7. Bitter Blood\n\nHaving been assigned to the Ginza Police Station, rookie detective Natsuki Sahara is partnered with his estranged father, Akimura Shimao, there. In contrast to his father, who is carefree and mostly concerned with fashion, Natsuki is a sensitive, emotional person who makes an effort to do the right thing.\n\nEven though the two usually have opposing personalities, and Natsuki holds the fact that his father, Akimua, abandoned his family when they were young against them, they get along well in cases and have been successful in solving a lot of murders. Natsuki is attracted to Hitomi Maeda, a judo expert on the squad, but quickly realizes that she is interested in his father, who is unaware of this.\n\nWith her father, Maeda has a connection to Akiumura as well. When he was assassinated by an enigmatic serial killer who murders people while listening to opera, her father was working with Akimura. The three attempt to apprehend the serial killer when he resurfaces.\n\nTogether, the three make up the Ginza police department\u2019s investigative squad, which also includes their supervisor, Kensuke Kagiyama, Hisashi Koga, \u201cthe Bachelor,\u201d Toshifumi Inaki, \u201cthe Chaser,\u201d Kaoru Togashi, \u201cthe Skunk,\u201d and Kouji Takano.\n\n8. Seigi no Mikata\n\nMakiko, a self-centered and evil elder sister who graduated from a prestigious university and now works for the government, torments 15-year-old Yoko regularly. Nevertheless, despite her bad character, Makiko often manages to improve the lives of others around her, earning her the title of \u201cally of justice.\u201d\n\nYoko wants to be free because of her sister\u2019s attitude. For her sister to move out, she decides to arrange for her marriage. But her strategy fails. Riku is another boy who teases Yoko relentlessly because of his crush on her. He eventually turns into one of her most trusted confidants.\n\nNaoki, Makiko\u2019s spouse, finally learns the truth about her nature, and he decides to file for divorce. Chika, a close friend of Riku\u2019s, informs Yoko that Riku is getting ready to leave. Yoko\u2019s friends try to get her to confess on a live television program, but just as she is about to do so, her sister barges in and starts shrieking at her. Security drags Makiko away.\n\nA few days later, Makiko is visited by Naoki and his parents. As the divorce is set to be finalized, Makiko informs everyone that she is expecting a child and that the divorce has been canceled since they believe her being distant and unkind was the sole reason.\n\n9. Risou no Musuko\n\nUmi Suzuki, who has had a miserable life and has never been lucky with men, has one very high expectation for her son Daichi: \u201cIt\u2019s payback time, and my son is going to make up for all of my past sufferings!\u201d Umi has played the part of a loving mother despite pushing Daichi to become the \u201cideal kid\u201d who values his mother above all else.\n\nUnaware of her secret purpose, Daichi has developed into a brand-new kind of \u201cmama\u2019s boy,\u201d one who is so forthright that he is not ashamed to remark, \u201cMy mom is the most important person in the entire world.\u201d Daichi is accepted at a prestigious high school, much to Umi\u2019s happiness.\n\nOne day, Umi starts a new part-time job. However, Daichi abruptly leaves his prestigious high school and transfers to this notorious one to protect his mother, which causes Umi\u2019s \u201cideal\u201d scenario to fall apart when he learns that her new employer is a high-school cafeteria full of bad boys.\n\nWhen trying too hard to please his mother, this brilliant, honorable, and charming \u201cideal son\u201d occasionally goes above and beyond Umi\u2019s expectations.\n\n10. 99.9: Keiji Senmon Bengoshi\n\nHiroto Miyama is a poor lawyer who accepts criminal cases but can\u2019t make money from them. He wants to know the truth about the 0.1% of false Japanese beliefs. One day, Haruhiko Madarame scouts Hiroto.. Haruhiko Madarame is the head of Madarame Law Firm, one of the four largest law firms in the country. Hiroto Miyama and Atsuhiro Sada begin working together. Atsuhiro Sada is a well-paid lawyer with a firm that handles civil cases. He has no interest in prosecuting criminal cases that won\u2019t net him money.\n\nThe premise of the story is quite interesting. What makes it exciting is how completely different their personalities are. Even though Sada and Miyama seem to be in a good balance in this first season, I can\u2019t say the same for Tachibana. They nearly lost me in their third episode, but thankfully they gave the show a satisfying conclusion.\n\nRegarding Miyama\u2019s lack of character development this season, I had mixed feelings. However, I anticipate there will be a lot of it in the second season. Although I think they are currently holding back, the story still has a lot of potentials. This results in some repetition in the drama, at least in season 1.\n\n11. Radiation House\n\nRadiographer Iori Igarashi (Masataka Kubota) works at a general hospital. Because his beloved An Amakasu (Tsubasa Honda), whom he adores, has chosen to study overseas at Washington Medical University to advance her career as a radiologist, he has been depressed. Radiation House members support Iori Igarashi.\n\nAn Amakasu hears about her father\u2019s critical condition one day. At a little clinic on a far-off island, her father was the sole physician in active practice. When An Amakasu encounters her father, he advises her to become a doctor who views patients as people rather than as sick people. Afterward, her father passes away. Because of a patient her father cared about, An Amakasu chooses to remain on the island.\n\nSoon after, a powerful hurricane strikes the island, followed by a landslide. Following that, an unknown infectious sickness spreads across the island. Iori Igarashi chooses An Amakasu and the islanders, even though he is aware of how difficult life is for him on the isolated island.\n\n12. Nazotoki wa Dinner no Ato de\n\nReiko is the wealthy heiress of a zaibatsu, yet she decides to become a private eye. She dislikes Kazamatsuri, her superior, who consistently seems to draw unreasonable conclusions that turn murder investigations into cold cases. Her butler abruptly announces his retirement one day and selects Kageyama to take his place. After witnessing Kageyama crack an impenetrable puzzle, Reiko understands how strong Kageyama\u2019s deduction abilities are.\n\nAfter that, anytime Reiko encountered a case that couldn\u2019t be resolved, she would present the facts to Kageyama, and he would explain how to resolve that specific problem after supper. Kageyama also explains to Reikko, after each case, some general truth or aspect of human nature that he believes contributed to the crime.\n\nKageyama is a butler who works for Reiko Hosho, a wealthy heiress. Reiko is a required investigator who is lacking in some deductive abilities. As a result, Reiko looks to Kageyama for assistance in resolving situations. Kageyama isn\u2019t averse to criticizing Reiko harshly, either. This drama focuses on the relationship between the butler and heiress as well as the detective investigations.\n\n13. My Boss, My Hero\n\nHigh school dropout Sakaki Makio, better known as \u201cTornado,\u201d is a tough 27-year-old. He is fairly stupid by academic standards. Makio\u2019s father determines that Makio must go back to high school to earn his diploma, so he approaches an old friend who also serves as the principal of a nearby school to request that Makio be admitted. Mikio, Makio\u2019s younger brother, will take over as boss if Makio doesn\u2019t complete his education.\n\nAdditionally, he has to act like a 17-year-old both inside and outside of school, as well as around other students and teachers. His high school career and aspirations of becoming a boss would be ruined if his cover were to be broken. Things get off to a bad start as Makio\u2019s fiery temper is put to the test. He discovers that school is much more than just tests and homework as the lessons and days pass.\n\n14. The Last Cop\n\nKyogoku is a detective who has solved numerous cases since 1985. He is unusual but ardent to the point of being overeager. When he approaches a dangerous criminal named Kagura, Kagura plants a bomb, which explodes and puts Kyogoku into a coma for 30 years. Kyogoku unexpectedly awakens in 2015 and goes to see his wife, Kanako. She rejects him since she recently got remarried. When he starts acting violently, a rookie investigator named Mochizuki Ryota ends up arresting him.\n\nHe is then taken to the Yokohama Chuo Police Precinct, where he is reconnected with his former subordinates, Suzuki and Kujira. Kyogoku resumes his duties as a detective right away. He is unable to understand modern technology and \u201cnew wisdom,\u201d nevertheless. He continues to disregard contemporary laws carelessly and puts Ryota, who has been designated as his friend, in danger.\n\nDer Letzte Bulle, a 2010 German television drama, served as the inspiration for the Japanese television drama The Last Cop. NTV and Hulu Japan created the version in Japanese. NTV broadcast the first episode on June 19, 2015.\n\n15. Hanazakari no Kimitachi e\n\nA girl who enrolls in a boys\u2019 boarding school dressed as a boy causes mayhem, issues, and friendship in this hilarious comedy. California-born Ashiya Mizuki recently made a trip back to Japan. She fell in love with Sano Izumi, a hopeful high jumper who had given up after an accident. She enrolls in the same high school as a boy to encourage him to pick up the sport again! She starts with short hair, a quiet voice, and a flattened breast, sharing a room with Sano.\n\nHana-Kimi also referred to as IkePara, is a Japanese teen romantic comedy television drama made for Fuji TV and Kyodo TV by Hiroyuki Got. It is based on the same-titled shjo comic series by Hisaya Nakajo. One of the locations for the filming is Ryutsu Keizai University. On July 3, 2007, Fuji TV broadcast its premiere, and on September 18 of that same year, its twelfth episode concluded.\n\n16. Yamada Taro Monogatari\n\nTar Yamada is intelligent, active, and extremely attractive. He appears to be wonderful on the surface, but his mother\u2019s wild spending and his father\u2019s constant absence have left him in abject poverty. Everyone at school believes he is a very modest and affluent lad due to his good looks, even though he never once acknowledges this. At home, he is responsible for looking after his six younger siblings, who live in the same one-bedroom apartment as he and his mother.\n\nYamada Taro, a scholarship student at Ichinomiya Private Senior High School, is a high achiever who also happens to be incredibly athletic and attractive. He appears to be ideal. He is nevertheless incredibly impoverished. Taro, who deals with issues brought on by his poverty, and his six younger siblings and sisters are comically portrayed in the novel.\n\nEven though the plot may not seem particularly noteworthy\u2014indeed, it may seem pretty cliche\u2014Yamada Taro Monogatari had a highly interesting final conflict and resolution. A moving tale of overcoming financial difficulties and finding friendship and family was told. If you\u2019re searching for both chuckles and tears, you\u2019ll simply have to trust me when I say it\u2019s worth a go, despite the cliche.\n\n17. Atashinchi no Danshi\n\nChisato Mineta is a 20-year-old homeless woman who frequents internet cafes and parks. Her father vanished after amassing a staggering 100 million yen debt, and she was forced out of her house after her mother passed away from illness. Chisato lives as a homeless person while evading debt collectors. Debt collectors catch her one day and demand that she pay the 100 million yen debt that her father left behind. When the president of a big toy company arrives, he pays off the debt to save her, but he also connives to get her to marry him. Then she learns he has one month to live and needs a \u201cwife\u201d to take care of him.\n\nShe is not responsible for repaying the loan if she remains his wife, but if she separates from him, she is responsible for paying back the entire amount right away in cash.\n\nShe learns a month later that the president is subject to more restrictions than just being his wife. For the loan to be entirely repaid, she must also reside at Trick Heart Castle with his six adopted sons, who will all take over running the business. However, each son has isolated himself from the rest of the family and treats the others as if they are simply strangers who share a home. Will Chisato be able to change these strangers into a loving family by helping them open their hearts?\n\n18. Nodame Cantabile\n\nMegumi Noda, often known as \u201cNodame,\u201d studies the piano at Momogaoka College of Music. She is a very gifted pianist who wants to teach kindergarten and loves to play by ear as opposed to reading the music. She is sloppy and unorganized, takes baths infrequently, loves to eat, and occasionally steals her friend\u2019s lunchbox when it contains delicious foods.\n\nThe best pupil at Momogaoka is Shinichi Chiaki. He was gifted at the piano and the violin as a child, and he has a deep-seated desire to work as a conductor. He is a haughty, multilingual perfectionist who formerly lived abroad in the world\u2019s music capitals as a young boy and felt stuck in Japan due to a phobia from his youth.\n\nBy chance, they cross paths. Nodame finds love quickly, but Chiaki takes a lot longer to start to understand what makes Nodame special. Both of them grow and change as a result of their relationship. Chiaki was given a chance to conduct a student orchestra thanks to Nodame, and she has since developed a greater understanding of other people\u2019s musical prowess. Nodame faces her worries and enters a piano competition thanks to Chiaki. Opportunities arise when both start taking chances and pushing themselves much further than they ever imagined.\n\n19. Ie Uru Onna\n\nShe is unmarried, attractive, and dresses in a rather showy fashion, but she never smiles in front of her customers. Machi is a real estate salesperson who consistently closes deals, regardless of the customer, 100% of the time. \u201cI can sell any house,\u201d he said. She meddles in her clients\u2019 matters and employs a wide variety of strategies to assist them in solving their issues\u2014selling the house concurrently! Your home \u201creally reflects the kind of life you lead,\u201d as the saying goes.\n\nMachi will put her whole heart and soul into finding the ideal home for you because the home itself can occasionally even transform your life. Being a real estate agent entails having your clients give you control over their lives. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics in four years, so housing sales are incredibly competitive. Sangenya Machi, a top-notch real estate agent, then shows up. She is 30 years old, single, and physically appealing. Machi needs to buy something.\n\nMachi has a special way of persuading people to buy houses. Her distinctive approach is to get involved in the issues that her clients\u2019 families are facing. And she fixes their issues after that. Every single one of Machi\u2019s clients buys a home from her thanks to her clever strategies.\n\n20. Kyou Kara Ore Wa!!\n\nTwo bored high school transfer students, righteous punk-haired Ito Shinji, and cunning but cunning Mitsuhashi Takashi, decide to reinvent themselves as the worst criminals Japan has ever seen! Mitsuhashi Takashi and Itou Shinji, two transfer students, decide to reinvent themselves as criminals because they are dissatisfied with their uninteresting normal lives and lack of popularity. When Itou\u2019s justice and Mitsuhashi\u2019s playful antics clash, they at first turn into enemies but quickly become close friends. The two criminals went on numerous adventures to surpass all other criminals in Japan!\n\nThis was a wonderful series that managed to counteract its constant humor with turns that were either thought-provoking or lovable. Due in large part to the actors\u2019 incredibly amusing performances, nearly every character in the cast was endearing.\n\n21. Keiji Yugami\n\nDetective Yugami merely pursues the facts of numerous cases in a world where justice is incredibly subjective, and the chances of discovering the truth are extremely remote. To learn new information, he will casually approach prospective suspects and speak with them. He is only interested in the facts. According to him, there is no use in trying to read the environment he is in or following the norms. He uses unconventional and unlawful methods of research frequently.\n\nHe also has a sidekick, Torao Hanyu, a serious investigator with a very opposite mentality, who helps him out. Torao\u2019s existence becomes bothersome to Yugami since all he wants is to use his unlawful investigation techniques to apprehend as many crooks as he can. To take on the enemies of society, two detectives who have nothing in common decide to work together.\n\n22. Hakui no Senshi!\n\nTachibana Haruka, a former juvenile offender, is a vivacious but unusual rookie nurse who is 21 years old. Her mentor, 34-year-old senior nurse Mihara Natsumi, wants to get married this year and leave her job as a nurse to become a housewife. Instead of \u201cAngels in White,\u201d they are the \u201cWarriors in White\u201d who laugh, cry, and develop in the hospital, which is a battleground for life.\n\nHaruka Tachibana, a new nurse, has a vivacious personality. Nurse veteran Mihara Natsumi is 34 years old. Both at work and in her romantic life, she is having difficulty. Tachibana Haruka and Mihara Natsumi cry and laugh while working as nurses in a setting that deals with life and death. Through the process, the two ladies change as people.\n\n23. Samurai Sensei\n\nBased on the manga of the same name, Samurai Sensei! is a Japanese television drama. The plot centers on Takechi Hanpeita (Nishikido Ryo), a samurai of the Tosa during the Bakumatsu period, who unexpectedly traveled through time after committing seppuku in contemporary rural Japan. Hanpeita is gradually adjusting to his new life while searching for a means to go back to his wife.\n\nSamurai Sensei! is a live-action translation of the manga. Therefore alterations to the plot are anticipated. However, despite several of its subplots appearing to be repetitive with their \u201chero saves the day\u201d approach, the adjustments are often pretty engaging and good.\n\nThe series\u2019 overall subject mainly focused on several social issues and things that remained the same even after 150 years. Although, as I\u2019ve already mentioned, everything tends to be practically repetitious, the drama truly succeeded in showing and offering life advice regarding the concerns.\n\nIn addition, I like how some of the scenes have been modernized, which brings the whole plot much closer to the present. I was giggling the entire time, especially when the actors began describing to Hanpeita what the \u201cpicture box,\u201d often known as the television, is. I also adored the way the contemporary version of the dish was received by the samurai, which ultimately helped Hanpeita become the talk of the town.\n\n24. Ashi Girl\n\nThe only thing Hayakawa Yui, a 16-year-old girl, excels at is running quickly. She unintentionally travels back in time to the Warring States period when she meets Hagi Tadakiyo, the young lord of the Hagi clan, and falls in love with him. This happens after her reclusive but brilliant younger brother creates a time machine. She learns from her high school instructor that the Hagi clan is destined to perish in history after traveling back to the present. She returns to the Warring States era out of desperation to save this young lord, and so her adventure there begins.\n\nThis is one of those incredibly underestimated, incredibly adorable dramas. This is the one, in my opinion, if you\u2019re searching for something pleasant, amusing, and not too absurd.
