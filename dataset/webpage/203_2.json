Oberon -- though a recent Oscar\u00ae nominee for her first Goldwyn film,(1935) -- was considered more of a great beauty than a great actress. And McCrea was a lightweight leading man.

Unfortunately, Goldwyn later told the leading man that Wyler didn't want him, which caused problems on the set.With his leads already cast for him, Wyler put most of his energies into finding the perfect child actress to play Mary, the student whose lies trigger the film's crises.

During filming, Oberon feared that Wyler was throwing the film to her and even convinced McCrea to complain to the producer, but Goldwyn simply shouted, \"I'm having more trouble with you stars than Mussolini is with Utopia!\"This didn't mean that Goldwyn was giving Wyler a free hand. They fought on the set constantly, though the director usually got his way. Wyler shot Hopkins' big confession scene, in which she admits to being in love with McCrea, from behind the actress, showing Oberon's reaction to her speech. Goldwyn objected. After screening the film with Wyler and Goldwyn's nine-year-old son, Sam, Goldwyn shrieked at the director for an hour, claiming that the audience wouldn't understand the scene if they couldn't see Hopkins' face. Finally, Wyler asked Sam if he understood what the scene was about.

Michelle's nomination, aside from the fact that it took forever, is so refreshing to see. We're in a new Hollywood, where Asian cinema is celebrated, and Asian actresses are celebrated. People don't have to hide anymore.\"\n\nMerle Oberon (1911-1979), British actress, poses with a bouquet of flowers, with flowers in her hair, in a studio portrait, circa 1940.

(Photo by Araya Doheny/Getty Images) Credit: Silver Screen Collection/Getty; Araya Doheny/Getty\n\nThe contrast is even more stark when you consider the radically different roles for which Yeoh and Oberon were nominated. While Yeoh has earned her nod for a project that centers on and celebrates her identity as a Chinese woman, Oberon got hers for The Dark Angel, a film in which she plays a member of the British aristocracy, Kitty Vane, who is caught in a love triangle with two close friends, the dashing Alan Trent (Fredric March) and the kindly Gerald Shannon (Herbert Marshall). There's no trace of her Asian background or even the exoticism that frequently played a role in her image as a movie star. She's the image of British propriety, clipped accent and all.\n\nIn real life, her identity was as much a performance as the one that earned her an Oscar nomination. Though she claimed she was from Tasmania, Australia, throughout her career, Oberon was born in India to a Sri Lankan mother and Anglo-Irish father. Her family line also included M\u0101ori ancestry. Further complicating matters, Charlotte, the woman Oberon called her mother, was actually her grandmother. Oberon was, in fact, the child of her then 12-year-old half-sister, Constance.\n\nOberon seemed to have some sense of the pitfalls of her blurry identity from a young age, growing up in poverty and bullied at school for her mixed ethnicity. \"She started [passing] as a teenager,\" says Bondy. \"She would do posh British accents and she would try to emulate the British colonizers. But she didn't belong either in either world. She didn't really belong with the elite, and she didn't belong in a traditional Indian country.\"\n\n1943: Leading lady Merle Oberon (1911 - 1979) as she appears in the film 'First Comes Courage', a war drama directed by Dorothy Arzner. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Credit: Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nOberon moved to Britain when she was 17, and it was film producer (and her eventual husband), Alexander Korda, who helped complete her transformation into a white-passing actress. Born Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson and using the nickname \"Queenie,\" she was rechristened Merle Oberon by Korda, who cast her in as Anne Boleyn in 1933's The Private Life of Henry VIII.\n\nFrom there, Korda and Hollywood producer Samuel Goldwyn, who purchased shares of Oberon's contract from Korda, continued to mold her into a star. This included the use of a skin bleaching product that contained high levels of poisonous ammoniated mercury. \"They made her last name Oberon to make it seem obscure and vague,\" says Bondy. \"She was unplaceable. Korda helped construct that identity and that look. I don't know if he applied the makeup. I don't know if he was the one who was like, 'You need to look more white.' But I have to assume that since he had so much control over her early film career, he probably played a huge role in that.\"\n\nOberon herself was obsessed with maintaining the illusion of whiteness, even having a portrait of her late \"mother,\" Charlotte, painted with lighter-colored skin. Before Charlotte's death, when traveling together, Oberon passed the older woman off as her maid to avoid anyone questioning her origins.\n\nIt wasn't abnormal for movie stars to undergo physical transformations at the behest of studios, and often, it was done with the aim of obscuring their origins (Rita Hayworth famously endured electrolysis to raise her hairline and reduce the visibility of her Spanish heritage). But Oberon went to further extremes, lying about her place of birth and lightening her skin color.\n\nFredric March looking into the eyes of Merle Oberon in a scene from the film 'The Dark Angel', 1935.

They all liked the image of her being vague \u2014 'Oh, she's from Tasmania,' which nobody knows anything about. She had to live her whole life that way. She never really did have that triumphant moment of coming out and being proud. That was what the studios did. They doctored you into whatever they wanted. If you had talent and presence, they could make you white.\"\n\nThere were Asian actors open about their race during that time, most notably Anna May Wong. But their opportunities in mainstream Hollywood were limited \u2014 and they were even denied roles that aligned with their race in favor of white actors in yellowface. Oberon's beauty allowed her to perpetuate the lie that enabled her to flourish in a more explicitly racist film industry than today's.\n\n\"She was very convincing and opportunistic,\" explains Bondy. \"She'd been that way her whole life. She learned grit and how to get things from men from her mother. So she had a chance of passing, and the chance of winning white American hearts.\" Had she embraced her identity, Bondy adds, Oberon never would've been hired by Samuel Goldwyn, much less been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nFredric March holding Merle Oberon by the window in a scene from the film 'The Dark Angel', 1935. (Photo by United Artists/Getty Images) Credit: United Artists/Getty\n\nBondy claims that The Dark Angel is the film in which Oberon looks the whitest, and certainly, if you compare images of her from earlier projects, there is a noticeable difference.\n\nArguably, Oberon gives her greatest performance as Cathy opposite Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff in the 1939 adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. But by that time, Hollywood had grown suspicious of her. Rumors swirled that she'd been a high-class prostitute, and because her British accent slipped regularly, many began to wonder about her origins.\n\n\"Wuthering Heights was one of the biggest movies of the year, with a huge budget and nominated for all kinds of awards,\" says Bondy. \"Merle was not nominated that year. Given how Hollywood operated and who got nominated for these awards, there was no earthly reason why she wouldn't get nominated. So you have to think that she wasn't entirely welcome into the Hollywood elite.\"\n\nBy this time, Oberon had also suffered serious damage to her face, both the result of a 1937 car accident and the long-term impact of the bleaching creams and makeups, which resulted in pitting and indentation. The damage was extensive enough that cinematographer Lucien Ballard designed a special light to obscure the blemishes and scars and lend her a luminous glamor. To this day, the light is referred to as an \"Obie,\" in reference to her last name.\n\nTHE OSCAR, Merle Oberon, 1966 Credit: Everett\n\nAs she aged, Oberon maintained a complicated relationship with her identity. Her final film grappled with the issue: Interval, released in 1973 and produced by Oberon herself, gave her a role as a woman who didn't know the truth of her own origins and tried to outrun them.\n\nA few years later in 1978, Oberon was invited to Hobart, Tasmania, her long-purported birthplace, for a mayoral reception and the naming of a theater in her honor. Oberon traveled there for the tribute, but at the reception, she denied she'd been born in Tasmania and refused to attend any other planned events on her itinerary.\n\n\"I think that she was just starting to reckon with everything,\" says Bondy of that ill-fated trip. \"We'll never know if she truly ever reckoned with it. But she grew up not just having to conform, but probably believing on some level that she was inferior. She was deeply uncomfortable with [who she was]. Because when you're beaten over the head with racism nonstop, you probably internalize it to some degree.\"\n\nThe truth of Oberon's origins was never disclosed in her lifetime, and she died in 1979 at the age of 68 still maintaining that she was white. It wasn't until the publication of a biography in 1983, Princess Merle: The Romantic Life of Merle Oberon, that the truth was revealed to the public when the authors located her birth records in India, where she was born in 1911.\n\nAlan Trent (Fredric March) and Kitty Vane (Merle Oberon) embracing in The Dark Angel.

Since Michelle Yeoh was first announced as an Oscar nominee, Oberon's name has recirculated with the designation as the first Asian to compete for Best Actress, a record many have disputed because of her obfuscation of her identity.\n\nYeoh herself has been careful to credit the women and pioneers on whose shoulders she now stands. Should that include Merle Oberon?\n\n\"Absolutely, she belongs in that pantheon,\" says Bondy. \"She was a real pioneer even though nobody really knew that at the time. And she probably didn't think about it at the time because her race was shameful [to her].\"\n\nBut what would Oberon make of her place in the history books, and the fact that it took almost 90 years for another Asian woman, this one vociferously proud of her identity and the ways it has shaped her on-screen presence, to get an Oscar nomination?\n\n\"I think she would be stunned to learn that her origin is actually an asset,\" speculates Bondy. \"She would have a lot to wrestle with, because she was very disconnected from reality. She would need a lot of therapy. But I think that she would ultimately be very proud and embrace it, because she loved the spotlight.\""}, {"url": "https://vintagenewsdaily.com/50-gorgeous-photos-of-british-actress-merle-oberon-in-the-1930s-and-40s/", "page_content": "0 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nThis post was originally published on this site\n\nBorn 1911 as Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in Bombay, British India, British actress Merle Oberon began her film career in British films as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933).\n\nAfter her success in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), Oberon travelled to the United States to make films for Samuel Goldwyn.

A Polish immigrant who pulled himself out of poverty through skilled salesmanship and the occasional use of blunt negotiating force, Goldwyn's emphasis was bringing the best in movie entertainment to audiences, instead of feeding them average material en masse. The result was a dedication to quality and talent that made him a major figure in mid-20th-century Hollywood, and a groundbreaker for a generation of independent producers that followed in his wake.\n\nNamed either Shmuel or Schmuel Gelbfisz in Warsaw, Poland on an unspecified date in July of 1879, he was the first of six children by his parents, a used furniture dealer and his wife. At the age of 16, he left his family and crossed Europe on foot, eventually making his way to Birmingham, England, where relatives gave him an Anglicized name, Samuel Goldfish, in order to help him assimilate into an English-language culture. In 1898, he acquired enough money to make the voyage across the Atlantic to America, arriving first in Nova Scotia before settling in Gloversville, NY in January 1899. There, the 19-year-old found work as a floor sweeper at a glove factory. Goldwyn soon discovered that he had a talent for sales and marketing, and within three years' time, he was the top garment salesman in Gloverville. Eventually, he became a partner in the company and moved its base of operations to Manhattan, where he married Blanche Lasky, sister of vaudeville performer Jesse L. Lasky.\n\nIn 1913, he convinced Lasky and a Broadway stage actor and director named Cecil B. DeMille to join forces and start their own motion picture company. The Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company's first project was an adaptation of the play \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), which was notable as both the beginning of DeMille's directorial career and the first feature film shot in Hollywood a small town within Los Angeles. That same year, a film exhibition company called Paramount contracted the Lasky Company to provide feature films for distribution. Another distributor, Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, was brought into the fold and eventually merged with the Lasky Company to form The Famous Players-Lasky Company in 1916. Zukor became president of both Paramount and Famous Players-Lasky, with Goldwyn taking the vice-presidential seat. Clashes between the two future moguls led to Goldwyn abandoning his role at the company, though he retained stock and his chair on the board of directors. The dissolution of his marriage to Blanche Lasky also distanced him from the Lasky Company, which eventually foundered in 1933.\n\nGoldwyn then established a new company, the Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, with Broadway producers Edgar and Archibald Selwyn, and took the company's moniker for his own surname. The company boasted one of the most lavish production facilities in Hollywood, and its logo, Leo the Lion, became one of the most identifiable trademarks in the world, but it proved only moderately successful. By 1922, Goldwyn had been forced out of the company by the Selwyns, who then merged with Marcus Loew's Metro Pictures and Louis B Mayer Productions to form what would become Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His only association with the company was the shared name, which the Selwyns retained.\n\nThe back-to-back ousters underscored the fundamental reasons why Goldwyn would find greater success as an independent than within the studio system. He had a volatile temper, would pursue legal action against opponents long after it was feasible to do so, and could be astonishingly cheap and petty in his financial dealings with his artists. He was also hampered by his limited English skills and education, which produced a string of curious turns of phrase that became known as \"Goldwynisms.\" Among the more famous was \"Gentlemen, include me out;\" \"Give me a smart idiot over a stupid genius any day\" and \"An oral contract isn't worth the paper it's printed on.\" Such idiosyncrasies were better suited for a man in charge of his own company, rather than a team member, and Goldwyn followed that lead shortly after being ousted by the Selwyns.\n\nGoldwyn formed Samuel Goldwyn Productions in 1923, and opened its studio and offices on the Pickford-Fairbanks Studios Lot in West Hollywood. The company's philosophy flew directly in the face of accepted industry wisdom: he would make just one picture at a time, rather than churn them out in assembly-line fashion, and he would devote as much money and energy as possible to the production by bringing in the best talent in front of and behind the camera. A casual list of talent that worked with Goldwyn over the course of his four-decade career as a producer includes some of the most enduring names in film history, including actors Laurence Olivier, Gary Cooper, Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers and Danny Kaye; directors like William Wyler, John Ford, King Vidor, Howard Hawks and Otto Preminger; and writers like George S. Kaufman, Ben Hecht, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, Lillian Hellman, Dorothy Parker, Thornton Wilder, Nunnally Johnson and Edna Ferber.\n\nGoldwyn Pictures began to blossom with the advent of talking pictures. 1929's \"Bulldog Drummond\" began the company's string of successes, and by 1931, he had received the first of numerous Best Picture Oscar nominations for Ford's \"Arrowsmith\" (1931). His emphasis on high-quality entertainment over box office trends allowed him to tackle all genres, from the broad musical comedies of Eddie Cantor like \"The Kid from Spain\" (1932) and \"Roman Scandals\" (1933) to dramas like \"These Three\" (1936), a bowdlerized version of Hellman's \"The Children's Hour\" with all references to lesbianism removed, or \"Dodsworth\" (1936), based on the Sinclair Lewis novel. Hard-hitting social dramas like \"Dead End\" (1937) followed literary adaptations like \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939) with Olivier and Merle Oberon, and \"The Little Foxes\" (1941), with Bette Davis, all of which earned Best Picture Oscar nods. But there were also countless musicals on the production slate, and biographical films, like the much loved \"Pride of the Yankees\" (1941), with Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig. In the mid-'40s, Goldwyn found great success with a string of comedies featuring Danny Kaye, including \"Wonder Man\" (1945), \"The Kid from Brooklyn\" (1946) and \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" (1946).\n\nThe apex of Goldwyn's career was \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), a moving drama about three veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life. The film won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actor (Frederic March) and Best Supporting Actor, as well as an honorary award for non-professional Harold Russell, a real-life veteran who had lost both hands during training. Goldwyn himself was given the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the same ceremony, which marked both the highest achievement of his film career, as well as the launch of a slow, inexorable decline that would precede his retirement in just over a decade.\n\nGoldwyn's stellar track record became to tarnish in the late '40s and early 1950s. For every hit, like \"The Bishop's Wife\" (1947), with Cary Grant and Loretta Young, or his film version of \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955) with Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, there were costly failures, like \"The Elusive Pimpernel\" (1950). His brand of all-American dramas were also turning pass\u00e9; audiences who had flocked to melodramas like \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" in the past were less than enthusiastic about \"Our Very Own\" (1950) and \"I Want You\" (1951) with Susan Hayward. The coup de grace for Goldwyn was the film version of George and Ira Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" (1959), which suffered from numerous production setbacks, not the least of which was a fire that destroyed its sets. Despite a cast that included Sidney Poitier, Dorothy Dandridge and Sammy Davis, Jr., the film was a costly flop and a critical failure. To make matters worse, it earned the ire of the Gershwin estate, which withdrew it from circulation in the late 1960s. Soon afterwards, Goldwyn retired from the film business, bringing an end to the most successful independent film career in motion picture history.\n\nIn the years that followed, Goldwyn's roster enjoyed numerous and lucrative theatrical and television screenings. His status as one of the industry's most talented producers earned him the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1957 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1971. Three years later, Goldwyn died of natural causes at what most sources credited as the age of 94. His son, Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., from his second marriage to actress Frances Howard, carried on in his father's tradition by launching The Samuel Goldwyn Company, which distributed and produced independent features and preserved the rights to his father's films, and later became Samuel Goldwyn Films. Goldwyn's grandchildren also took up the trade, including actor-director Tony Goldwyn and John Goldwyn, who brought the family name full circle by becoming President of Motion Pictures at Paramount in 1991."}, {"url": "https://www.altfg.com/film/wuthering-heights/", "page_content": "Wuthering Heights: \u2018Hollywood\u2019s Greatest Year\u2019 continues with Samuel Goldwyn\u2019s favorite among his films\n\nThe 1939 Best Picture Oscar nominee Wuthering Heights \u2013 directed by William Wyler, and starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier as Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s pathological lovers Cathy Earnshaw and Heathcliff \u2013 will be the next presentation in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 series \u201cHollywood\u2019s Greatest Year: The Best Picture Nominees of 1939.\u201d\n\nThe Wuthering Heights screening will take place on Monday, June 8, \u201909, at 7:30 p.m. at the Academy\u2019s Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills.\n\nStarting at 7 p.m., the feature will be preceded by the fourth chapter of the 1939 serial Buck Rogers, starring Buster Crabbe and Constance Moore, and the animated short The Pointer, toplining Mickey Mouse and Pluto.\n\nExpurgated Emily Bront\u00eb\n\nAccording to Samuel Goldwyn biographer A. Scott Berg, Wuthering Heights was the independent producer\u2019s favorite among his films. Deservedly so. Although one could easily find several things to carp about in this Hollywood adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s 1847 Gothic novel, the positive elements far outweigh the negative ones.\n\nUnderstandably, a large chunk of the novel had to be excised; else the film would have had to run about four hours. As a result, Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht\u2019s screenplay dwells only on the passionate, obsessive, doomed romance between the brooding Heathcliff and the willful Cathy, who love one another but end up married to others.\n\nIf at times the novel\u2019s Gothic feel has been replaced by Hollywood hokum (the initial sequence showing the future lovers as kids is particularly saccharine), William Wyler, with the assistance of cinematographer Gregg Toland and production designer James Basevi, for the most part manages to convey the dark intensity of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s vision. And that was no easy task.\n\nIn fact, Wuthering Heights is far superior to the (otherwise great-looking) 1943 movie adaptation of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s own Gothic romance, Jane Eyre, directed by Robert Stevenson, and starring a capable Joan Fontaine and an absurd Orson Welles.\n\nOverbearing Laurence Olivier\n\nOn the downside, William Wyler failed to tone down the stage-trained Laurence Olivier, then making his Hollywood comeback following his professional debacle six years earlier. That\u2019s when MGM sent Olivier packing back to England after Greta Garbo demanded that John Gilbert be her Queen Christina co-star.\n\nOlivier had been making movies in his native country for quite some time (in addition to a brief Hollywood stint in the early 1930s), so it\u2019s hard to understand why he felt the need to ham it up so much as Heathcliff. His final monologue, for instance, is so over the top that he almost manages to ruin the film\u2019s otherwise touching epilogue, ghosts walking up to heaven and all.\n\nAnother shameless British ham, Robert Newton, had been suggested to play Heathcliff, but Goldwyn found him too ugly. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was another option, but Goldwyn found him too weak. Olivier sure looked the part; it\u2019s just too bad he felt the need to (over)act it out as well.\n\n\u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019: Cathy (Merle Oberon) and Heathcliff (Laurence Olivier) in the former\u2019s memorable \u2013 for different reasons \u2013 death scene. \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019: Cathy (Merle Oberon) and Heathcliff (Laurence Olivier) in the former\u2019s memorable \u2013 for different reasons \u2013 death scene.\n\nMerle Oberon in top form\n\nOn the positive side, top-billed Merle Oberon (in a role intended for Sylvia Sidney)* delivers what may well be the most effective performance of her career, while Geraldine Fitzgerald \u2013 as Heathcliff\u2019s wife Isabella Linton \u2013 and Flora Robson provide solid support.\n\nDavid Niven (as Isabella\u2019s brother and Cathy\u2019s husband, Edgar Linton), Donald Crisp, Hugh Williams, Leo G. Carroll, and Cecil Kellaway were among the other Wuthering Heights cast members.\n\n* According to various sources, Sylvia Sidney and Charles Boyer (!) were originally considered for the roles of Cathy Earnshaw and Heathcliff when independent producer Walter Wanger acquired the property. Sidney ended up playing Cathy in a 1941 presentation of Wuthering Heights on the radio show Philip Morris Playhouse.\n\nAfter Wanger sold the property to Samuel Goldwyn, William Wyler suggested Bette Davis, whom he had directed in Jezebel and with whom he had been having an affair, to play Cathy. Oberon, however, was under contract to Goldwyn (and to Alexander Korda) at the time.\n\nWould-be Cathy Vivien Leigh\n\nGeraldine Fitzgerald\u2019s miserably unhappy Isabella had been initially offered to Laurence Olivier\u2019s lover (and future wife) Vivien Leigh, who refused it for she wanted to play Cathy and only Cathy.\n\nIt was while accompanying Olivier in Hollywood that Leigh was introduced by his agent, Myron Selznick, to the agent\u2019s brother, independent producer David O. Selznick, who eventually hired her to play an even more important film role than that of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s heroine.\n\nNew York Film Critics\u2019 unexpected Best Film\n\nWuthering Heights turned out to be the New York Film Critics Circle\u2019s curious pick for the Best Film of 1939 \u2013 as they couldn\u2019t decide between Frank Capra\u2019s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and producer Selznick and director Victor Fleming\u2019s Gone with the Wind. (Don\u2019t ask.)\n\nSamuel Goldwyn\u2019s United Artists release also went on to win an Academy Award for Best Black-and-White Cinematography.\n\nIn addition to its Best Picture nod, Wuthering Heights was also up for Oscars in the following categories:\n\nBest Actor (Laurence Olivier).\n\nBest Supporting Actress (Geraldine Fitzgerald).\n\nBest Director (William Wyler).\n\nBest Art Direction (James Basevi).\n\nBest Original Score (Alfred Newman).\n\nBest Screenplay (Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht).\n\nMerle Oberon, no matter how outstanding, went nominationless.\n\nProposed title changes\n\nAlso worth noting, in his Samuel Goldwyn biography A. Scott Berg explains that Wuthering Heights almost had its name \u201cbettered\u201d after the producer\u2019s marketing people complained that the title of Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel didn\u2019t have an appealing sound to it.\n\nGoldwyn ordered his story department to come up with something else, but he was eventually convinced that to call Wuthering Heights \u201cThe Wild Heart\u201d (the U.S. title of a 1950/1952 Jennifer Jones movie) or \u201cBring Me the World\u201d would be tantamount to having David O. Selznick \u201cchange David Copperfield to \u2018A Little Boy in England\u2019 or Little Women to \u2018Katy Wins Her Man.'\u201d\n\n\u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019 screening\n\nTickets for Wuthering Heights are $5 for the general public and $3 for Academy members and students with a valid ID.\n\nThe Academy\u2019s Samuel Goldwyn Theater is located at 8949 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills.

She began her film career in British films as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). After her success in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), she travelled to the United States to make films for Samuel Goldwyn. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Dark Angel (1935). A traffic collision in 1937 caused facial injuries that could have ended her career, but she recovered and remained active in film and television until 1973.\n\nEstelle Merle O'Brien Thompson was born in Bombay (now known as Mumbai), British India on 19 February 1911. Merle was given \"Queenie\" as a nickname, in honour of Queen Mary, who visited India along with King George V in 1911.\n\nBorn to a 12-year-old mother, for most of her lifetime Oberon concealed the truth about her parentage. For many years she claimed that she had been born in Tasmania, Australia, and that her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. Some sources have claimed that Merle's parents were Arthur Terrence O'Brien Thompson, a British mechanical engineer from Darlington, who worked in Indian Railways, and Charlotte Selby, a Eurasian from Ceylon who was also of M\u0101ori heritage. However, Charlotte's 12-year-old daughter Constance was actually Merle's biological mother. Charlotte had given birth to Constance at the age of 14, the result of a relationship with Henry Alfred Selby, an Irish foreman of a tea plantation. Charlotte raised Merle as her own child and as Constance's sister. Charlotte's partner, Arthur Thompson, was listed as the father in Merle's birth certificate, with the forename misspelled as \"Arther\". Constance eventually married and had four other children, Edna, Douglas, Harry and Stanislaus (Stan) with her husband Alexander Soares. All the siblings reportedly believed Merle to be their aunt (the sister of their mother Constance), when in fact she was their half-sister. Edna and Douglas moved at an early age to the UK and Harry later in life moved to Toronto, Canada, and retained Constance's maiden name, Selby. Stanislaus was the only child to keep his father's last name of Soares; he has resided in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"url": "https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/hiding-in-plain-sight-merle-oberon-mayukh-sen/", "page_content": "This article appeared in the June 17 edition of The Film Comment Letter, our free weekly newsletter featuring original film criticism and writing. Sign up for the Letter here.\n\nMerle Oberon in Night in Paradise (Arthur Lubin, 1946)\n\nIn May 1935, a new star shone on Hollywood\u2019s horizon. Raven-haired and tan-complexioned, her eyes a striking shape, she looked unlike most leading ladies the industry had seen up until then. To the now-defunct film publication Screen & Radio Weekly, these traits made her \u201cbizarre, bewildering, and different,\u201d as if she were a foreign object who did not quite belong on American screens. Though she\u2019d cut her teeth in British cinema, as the article noted, she had spent her early life in India. Her stage name was Merle Oberon.\n\n\u201cHere they tell fabulous stories about her, one of the most often repeated being that she is Eurasian with a part-Hindu mother,\u201d the piece continued. This rumor conflicted with the claim that Oberon sustained throughout her life: that she was born in Tasmania, Australia, and that her birth records had perished in a fire.\n\nBut the paper\u2019s speculation wasn\u2019t far from the truth, revealed only after Oberon\u2019s death in 1979. In reality, she had been born into poverty in what is now Mumbai to a 12-year-old mother of Sri Lankan, M\u0101ori, and white ancestry, whom Oberon grew up believing was her sister; the identity of her biological father remains unclear. Raised by her grandmother (whom she thought was her mother) in what is today Kolkata, she had an interest in acting early in life and performed with the city\u2019s Amateur Dramatic Society. A boyfriend offered to introduce her to the director Rex Ingram, so, while still in her teens, she pooled enough money to travel to France to meet the filmmaker. Ingram found Oberon\u2019s appearance so entrancing that he cast her as an extra in a film of his, The Three Passions (1928). From there, she went to Britain, where her career took off. As she pursued fame abroad, though, Oberon deliberately concealed two truths about herself: she grew up poor, and she was (at least in part) Brown.\n\nThese were taboos in the era during which Oberon labored against impossible odds to become one of Old Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars. Once in America, she would star in Sidney Franklin\u2019s wartime romance The Dark Angel (1935), which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Though the public had no clue about her mixed-race parentage back then (stories in gossip mills were pure conjecture), she is, to date, the only actress of known Asian descent to be nominated in that category in the 20th century, an embarrassing indictment of the Academy\u2019s institutional blind spots.\n\nFor all its historical significance, though, Oberon\u2019s sterling performance in The Dark Angel is rarely mentioned by critics today, along with her art more generally. Consider how casually the critic David Thomson wrote her off as a \u201crenowned beauty with a graven face and the legend of mixed blood\u201d who was nevertheless \u201coften a dull actress\u201d in his canonical The New Biographical Dictionary of Film. There\u2019s been far more interest in Oberon\u2019s off-screen torment. She inspired the character of Margo Taft (Jennifer Beals), an actress in the studio era who tries to suppress her biracial identity, on Amazon\u2019s 2016-17 series The Last Tycoon; she was the subject of an episode of the You Must Remember This podcast in February of last year. The segment detailed painful stories of how Oberon bleached her skin, passed off her dark-skinned grandmother as her maid, and nearly sued a family member who sought to divulge her ancestry in a book. The ongoing fascination with Oberon\u2019s inner turmoil is understandable in the present-day media landscape, where the history of racial discrimination in entertainment has begun to command greater scrutiny. Yet, as with many actors of color, it has eclipsed her actual work.\n\nOberon\u2019s talents come across in an early appearance as the doomed Anne Boleyn in her future husband Alexander Korda\u2019s The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). The role is tiny\u2014she disappears just after the 15-minute mark, executed for treason\u2014yet she makes a distinct impression as a woman who dutifully accepts her terrible fate. Oberon teems with nervous energy; when she jokes that people will call her \u201cAnne who lost her head,\u201d the line is rattled off in a way that is both sardonic and haunting. The tension that Oberon brought to this and other roles may read as a lack of spontaneity to some, but that studied quality did not translate to discomfort before the camera; rather, Oberon\u2019s agitated demeanor made the predicaments of her women seem compelling in their immediacy.\n\nThe director Harold Young would give this attribute more room to shine in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), where she is enchanting as an aristocratic woman during the French Revolution, unaware that her husband is leading a double life. Oberon projects regality, and Young gives her arresting close-ups that allow the actress to bring her character\u2019s emotional dilemmas\u2014namely her frustration at her husband\u2019s seeming inattentiveness\u2014to the surface. Though The Scarlet Pimpernel has the trappings of an adventure movie, it is Oberon who gives the film its soul.\n\nIn Britain, Oberon usually essayed roles of women with an aura of mystique. Such performances caught the eye of producer Samuel Goldwyn, who brought her to America and in short order cast her in The Dark Angel. The film would offer a change of pace: Oberon reportedly tired of the \u201cexotic\u201d label the press appended to her back in Britain, and grew determined to play more of an everywoman. Set in World War I\u2013era Britain, Franklin\u2019s film hinges on a love triangle involving Oberon\u2019s Kitty Vane and her two male childhood friends. The Dark Angel tends to get classified as a melodrama, yet Oberon plays the film\u2019s most potentially histrionic scenes with control. In a scene right before the film\u2019s finale, she learns that the man she loves (Fredric March) didn\u2019t die in the war as she believed. She\u2019s thrilled that he\u2019s alive, a fact that she mutters to herself repeatedly. The revelation could provoke a theatrical response, but Oberon speaks in a register that\u2019s barely above a whisper, pulling the viewer close in this moment rather than playing to the gallery. It is an intelligent\u2014and effective\u2014actorly gesture.\n\nIn the years that followed, Oberon would give a moving performance in William Wyler\u2019s These Three (1936) as a schoolteacher mired in scandal, and it was indeed Wyler who gave her her finest showcase as Cathy in Wuthering Heights (1939). Detractors might find her performance too stern to express Cathy\u2019s \u201cwild, uncontrollable passion for Heathcliff,\u201d as the film\u2019s narrator puts it. Pauline Kael, for example, described her as \u201cchill and dainty\u201d in the role. But Oberon creates a rich portrait of repressed longing. Cathy has high-society aspirations that clash with her love for Heathcliff (Laurence Olivier), a character termed \u201cgypsy scum\u201d in the film. (References to Heathcliff\u2019s skin tone draw out the contrast with Cathy\u2019s porcelain skin, indicating how successfully Oberon had \u201cwhitened\u201d her public image by that point.) Her feelings for him fluctuate at the snap of a finger, shifting between affection and disgust. Oberon is stellar in wordless scenes\u2014her first, for example, when Cathy must stomach her boorish brother\u2019s disparaging comments about Heathcliff\u2014as the actress\u2019s coolly detached mien conveys the heroine\u2019s struggle to hide her devotion.\n\nBut Oberon makes unexpected choices with dialogue too. In one pivotal scene, when Cathy realizes the depth of her bond with her forbidden lover, she proclaims, \u201cI am Heathcliff!\u201d The sequence may seem to call for a thunderous declaration (it is even accompanied by a strike of lightning), but Oberon resists the temptation for overstatement, her delivery touching in its directness.\n\nFew roles after that would task Oberon with such emotional demands. In the later decades of her life, she still acted, though less often. She succumbed to a stroke in Malibu when she was 68, taking the secrets of her birth and blood to her grave. Biographers Charles Higham and Roy Moseley, authors of the 1983 book Princess Merle, eventually located her birth records, finally unraveling her life\u2019s enigmas.\n\nThe challenges that performers of color faced in Old Hollywood are finally coming to light, as we discover the prevalence of mixed-race actors who passed as white: Frankenstein (1931) star Boris Karloff was of Anglo-Indian heritage; Broadway legend Carol Channing would only disclose her paternal Black heritage in her 2002 autobiography; Fredi Washington of Imitation of Life (1934) found herself accused of passing even though she proudly owned her Blackness.\n\nOberon\u2019s achievements in such a racist milieu are remarkable. It is easy to pity her as a tragic figure haunted by shame, silencing parts of herself to survive an inhospitable era in Hollywood. But maybe it\u2019s possible to also celebrate her as a pioneer of the screen, one who left a lasting impact on an industry within which her success did not allow her a life true to her identity.\n\nIt was the strength of Oberon\u2019s work before the camera, combined with the singularity of her beauty, that first captured the film establishment\u2019s attention, after all\u2014not her parentage, not her upbringing, not her trauma. \u201cMerle Oberon in private life is delightful, but Merle Oberon of the screen is magnificent,\u201d that early Screen & Radio Weekly article concluded. \u201cShe must be kept that way.\u201d\n\nMayukh Sen is the author of Taste Makers: Seven Immigrant Women Who Revolutionized Food in America, out from W.

Raised in India, she did not come to London until she was 17; she then progressed from cafe hostess (name Queenie O'Brien) to film extra. This in turn led to minor roles in undistinguished British films during 1930\u201332 (name Estelle Thompson), until she finally caught the eye of the Hungarian-British producer, Alexander Korda.\n\nKorda gave her the opportunity, personal patronage, and training which was to establish her as a beautiful star (name Merle Oberon) and acceptable actress. She was later to become his wife. Her first role of importance was as Anne Boleyn in Korda's film, The Private Life of Henry VIII, where her dark beauty and svelte grooming made a marked, if short-lived, impression among the King's succession of wives. Her appearance and panache won her many star roles in both London and Hollywood productions, including those in Korda's The Private Life of Don Juan, The Scarlet Pimpernel, and The Dark Angel.\n\nHer career seemed threatened when she was in a severe car accident during the shooting of I, Claudius, in which she was to have played Messalina opposite Charles Laughton. (Korda made her accident his reason for closing down this troubled production.) After successful facial surgery, however, she was able to return to the screen, and starred from 1938 through to the 1960s in a range of films, largely American. The more notable, perhaps, are The Divorce of Lady X, Wuthering Heights (with Laurence Olivier), Ernst Lubitsch's That Uncertain Feeling, Ren\u00e9 Clair's Forever and a Day, and as George Sand in the Chopin biographical film A Song to Remember. Daniel Mann directed her last film, Interval, which she produced herself and co-edited, about an older woman who finds happiness with a younger man, played by Robert Wolders. He went on to become her husband in real life.\n\n\u2014Roger Manvell"}]}
