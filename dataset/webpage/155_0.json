{"Anne de Gaulle's parents were Charles de Gaulle and Yvonne de Gaulle.": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/de-gaulle-yvonne-1900-1979", "page_content": "de Gaulle, Yvonne (1900\u20131979)\n\nFrench first lady who went into exile with her husband Charles de Gaulle when he headed the Free French resistance during WWII and was, in her later years, affectionately known in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne). Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://www.guidelondon.org.uk/blog/around-london/charles-de-gaulle-in-london/", "page_content": "Charles de Gaulle, a junior minister in a collapsing government and a relatively junior general in an army that was ceasing to exist, landed at Heston airport after a gruelling and perilous flight from Bordeaux, on Monday 17 June 1940. Few of his British hosts knew who he was, Winston Churchill being the exception. During his visits to France, Churchill had immediately noticed \u201ca young, energetic general called de Gaulle.\u201d `(In Gabriel Le Bomin\u2019s biopic of de Gaulle, which features the early days of the two men\u2019s relationship, Churchill is brilliantly played by Tim Hudson \u2013 who is also a London Blue Badge Guide!)\n\nThe following evening de Gaulle was at Broadcasting House recording his historic first speech, in which he called upon the French to continue to fight, in defiance of the armistice being negotiated by the P\u00e9tain regime. Over the following three years, as the leader of the Free French, de Gaulle lived and worked mainly in London. And, as a London Blue Badge Tourist Guide can show you, there are many sites and districts of London which have a de Gaulle connection.\n\nBroadcasting House in London.

In July they were able to move into the building that remained the nerve centre of the Free French until 1944: 4 Carlton Gardens, a building in the contemporary neo-Classical style dating from 1923-4.\n\nCharles De Gaulle black plaque \u2013 4 Carlton Gardens St James\u2019s London SW1Y 5AA.

The blue plaque states that de Gaulle, as President of the French National Committee set up the HQ of the Free French Forces here in 1940. The rectangular plaque, placed there in 1947, bears, in French and English, the stirring words of de Gaulle\u2019s Appeal of June 18th. Across the road on a high plinth is Angela Conner\u2019s statue of de Gaulle, unveiled in 1993. It portrays de Gaulle in the unform of a g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade (brigadier), his rank in 1940.\n\nStatue of Charles de Gaulle in London. Photo Credit: \u00a9 Giogo via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nAfter his first few days in London De Gaulle stayed at the Rubens Hotel in Buckingham Palace Road, It was here on 20 June that he was reunited with his family, Mme Yvonne de Gaulle, his teenage children Philippe and Elisabeth and little Anne. They too had had a perilous journey \u2013 by sea from Brest to Plymouth. Philippe de Gaulle later remembered that the meeting at the Rubens was one of the few occasions on which the children saw their parents kissing.\n\nThe family\u2019s first set up home in Birchwood Road, Petts Wood and from here de Gaulle could commute daily to Carlton Gardens. Nearby Chislehurst junction, however, was an obvious target for Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe, and the frequent explosions were particularly distressing to little Anne de Gaulle, who had Down\u2019s syndrome.\n\nSo Yvonne de Gaulle and the children moved to a house in Shropshire, some 300 kilometres from London. There followed a period of isolation for Mme de Gaulle and the children as de Gaulle himself seldom had time to visit them. The family moved again, to Little Gaddesden, a village in Hertfordshire where de Gaulle was able to spend his weekends with them. From Mondays to Fridays he lived at the Connaught Hotel.\n\nFinally, in September 1942, the family took up residence at a London address: 99 Frognal, in Hampstead. Always a devout Catholic, de Gaulle regularly attended mass at the nearby Catholic church, St Mary\u2019s, a church built in the 1790s for French Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s Hampstead, London.

Soho in particular has been home to a thriving French community since the early eighteenth century. There were French shops and restaurants, and it was here that many of the Free French spent their off-duty hours. One spot in Soho which preserves particularly warm memories of the Free French is the former York Minster pub, subsequently renamed the French House in their honour.\n\nThe French House pub in the Soho area of London.

He usually dined at the Connaught, sometimes in a Pall Mall club, sometimes in one of London\u2019s celebrated French restaurants such as the Coq d\u2019Or or the Savoy. He understood that the working lunch was an important social mechanism of the British Establishment and he conducted many important discussions, about the conduct of the war, about the future of France and Britain over lunch \u2026 in French, of course.\n\nThe Connaught Hotel in London. Photo Credit: \u00a9 Soham Banerjee via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nIn fine weather, de Gaulle would often walk from Carlton Gardens to have his lunch at the Connaught. His immensely tall figure, in the familiar uniform of a French officer, was frequently recognised. His uncomfortable relationship with the British government is now a matter of historical record but, at the time, ordinary British people knew little of this. As de Gaulle strode at lunchtime through St James\u2019 and Berkeley Square he would often be greeted and applauded by passers-by.\n\nAs well as 10 Downing Street and Broadcasting House, a number of London\u2019s most famous buildings have a connection with de Gaulle. He spoke a number of times at assemblies of the Free French community in the Albert Hall and his speeches were included in the daily broadcast to occupied France, Les Fran\u00e7ais parlent aux Fran\u00e7ais. On one occasion, he addressed \u2013 in English \u2013 members of the Lords and the Commons at the Houses of Parliament. The statue of Marshal Foch in Grosvenor Gardens was an important rallying point for the Free French. During the war years, a regular parade took place there on Bastille Day, 14th July, and de Gaulle laid the wreath in memory of the former Commander-in-chief.\n\nEquestrian statue of Ferdinand Foch, London.

This visit took place at a delicate time: it was at the height of the Algerian crisis and at the time when the British government was considering its first attempt to join what was then the European Common Market. On arriving at Victoria Station de Gaulle accompanied the Queen in an open carriage to Buckingham Palace. During the four days of the visit, he attended a gala ballet performance at Covent Garden, visited the Royal Hospital, Chelsea and addressed the Houses of Parliament \u2013 in French, this time \u2013 at a ceremony in Westminster Hall, complete with a military band.\n\nHorse Guards Parade in London.

Accompanied by Prince Philip, de Gaulle rode down the Mall in an open carriage in the uniform of a g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade. Out of respect for his guest, Prince Philip also wore a brigadier\u2019s uniform on that day. As the carriage passed the steps leading up to Carlton Gardens de Gaulle raised his hand to his k\u00e9pi in a solemn salute to his old comrades.\n\nThere are many ways to explore London in the long footsteps of Charles de Gaulle.

The largest and busiest airport in France is named after him\n\nA\u00e9roport de Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle or Paris Charles De Gaulle International Airport is recognized as the largest and busiest airport in the country.\n\nLocated in Roissy-en-France, 23 kilometers northeast of the French capital, the Charles de Gaulle Airport also goes by the names Roissy Airport and Paris CDG. It opened in 1974 and spans 32.38 square kilometres of land.\n\nThe Charles de Gaulle Airport is the world\u2019s 9th busiest airport. In Europe, it is second only to London\u2019s Heathrow. Within the EU, it is on the number one spot in terms of passenger numbers.\n\n2. He is known in France simply as \u201cle G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d or \u201cthe General\u201d\n\nGen. Charles de Gaulle was a statesman and officer in the French army who headed the Free French movement that fought the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s interest in the military started when he was a boy. It was not surprising that he decided to attend the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in Guer, France.\n\nIn 1913, de Gaulle, who was then a young second lieutenant, became a member of an infantry regiment that Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain commanded. P\u00e9tain who fought in the First World War would later be imprisoned for treason.\n\nAs a soldier, de Gaulle was brilliant, hardworking, and passionate. Throughout his military career that spanned from 1912 to 1944, he had been known to possess outstanding courge and great self-assurance. His rank was brigadier general.\n\n3. He had fought in 8 battles\n\nGeneral de Gaulle had fought in a total of 8 battles, which were the following: Battle of Verdun, Battle of the Somme, Polish \u2013 Soviet War, Battle of France, Battle of Montcornet, Battle of Abbeville, Battle of Dakar, and the Liberation of Paris.\n\n4. Charles de Gaulle saved France from several crises\n\nGen. de Gaulle had saved his country from several deep crises.\n\nFirst, he was hugely responsible for the liberation of France from the Nazis during the Second World War. This made \u201cle G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d a war and national hero.\n\nWhen World War II was over, de Gaulle became the leader of the nation during some of France\u2019s tensest periods \u2013 from 1944 through 1946 and from 1958 until 1969.\n\nHe is also linked with the founding of the most recent Fifth French Republic as well as the making of a new constitution which strengthened the institution of the presidency.\n\nAs president, Charles de Gaulle worked hard for the French politics to be more nationalist, which reinforced its position in the international scene.\n\n5. Charles de Gaulle married on April 6, 1921\n\nCharles de Gaulle was a military captain who was recently home from a mission in Poland when he met young Yvonne Vendroux.\n\nA year later, on 6 April 1921, the two were married in the Notre-Dame de Calais Church in Calais on the Opal Coast, where the Vendroux family was from.\n\n6. Charles de Gaulle had a daughter with Down syndrome\n\nThe union of Charles de Gaulle and Yvonne Vendroux produced three children: Philippe (born in 1921), \u00c9lisabeth (born in 1924), and Anne (born in 1928).\n\nThe youngest child, Anne de Gaulle, was born in the German city of Trier where her soldier father was stationed. She was born with Down syndome, a genetic disorder that is usually associated with distinct facial features, intellectual disability which can be mild to moderate, and delays in physical growth.\n\nSuffice it to say, Anne was his father\u2019s favorite. He would often sing and dance with her, or do pantomimes to entertain her.\n\nIn 1945, the de Gaulles established the Fondation Anne de Gaulle at the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur at Milon-la-Chapelle, in north-central France. It was a private hospital for handicapped girls like Anne, who succumbed to bronchial pneumonia in 1948.\n\n7. Charles de Gaulles was a devout Catholic\n\nCharles de Gaulle was raised in a strictly Catholic family. Henri de Gaulle, Charles\u2019 father, taught history and literature at a Jesuit high school in Paris.\n\nIt was Charles de Gaulle\u2019s religious parents who were responsible for his spiritual and intellectual formation in the Catholic faith. Prior to the military academy, he attended Catholic schools.\n\nWhen he was 16, Charles de Gaulle volunteered to be a stretcher-bearer at Lourdes. There he witnessed a miracle: a paralyzed Italian girl cured during the holy procession.\n\nDe Gaulle frequently attended the Mass and as a student he was one of the few who joined Congregation of the Holy Virgin, a religious organization devoted to prayer and spiritual meditation.\n\n8. De Gaulle became President of the French Republic on 21 December 1958\n\nDe Gaulle was elected President by an electoral college. He was reelected for a second term in 1965. He resigned from presidency in 1969, following the failure of his referendum in which he proposed more decentralization.\n\n9. His First Lady was also a conservative Catholic\n\nYvonne de Gaulle was strictly Catholic just like her husband. Mrs. de Gaulle fought against prostitution, pornography and its sale in newsstands, and the display of sex and nudity on TV.\n\nFor her conservative Catholic views, Yvonne de Gaulle garned the famous nickname \u201cTante Yvonne,\u201d or \u201cAuntie Yvonne.\u201d\n\n10. Charles de Gaulle survived 30 attempts on his life\n\nIf cats had nine lives, Charles de Gaulle had 30!\n\nThe most prominent of all these attempts was led by Jean Bastien-Thiry, a lieutenant-colonel in the French Air Force and also a military air-weaponry engineer.\n\nBastien-Thiry belonged to the Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te, a right-wing organization that opposed President de Gaulle\u2019s decision to sign the independence of Algeria.\n\nHe was the last man in France to be executed by firing squad for his foiled assassination attempt on the president on August 22, 1962.\n\n11. His daughter Anne\u2019s picture saved General de Gaulle\u2019s life\n\nThe 22 August 1962 failed assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle took place as he was riding his limousine with his wife at Petit-Clamart, a suburb of Paris.\n\nA potentially fatal bullet from the machine gun that ambushed the couple hit the frame of Anne de Gaulle\u2019s picture that her father always carried with him.\n\nThat day, the picture frame was placed on the rear shelf of the de Gaulle\u2019s limo, saving President de Gaulle\u2019s life by stopping the bullet that would have otherwise hit him.\n\n12. Charles de Gaulle died a natural death two weeks shy of his 80th birthday\n\nAfter so many foiled attempts on Charles de Gaulle\u2019s life, he enjoyed a very healthy life until November 9, 1970 \u2013 just a couple of weeks shy of his 80th birthday.\n\nHe died of aneurysm in his home in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, watching TV and playing cards.\n\nThen French President Georges Pompidou announced General de Gaulle\u2019s death the following morning with a simple statement: \u201cLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle est mort; la France est veuve.\u201d Translated to English, it means: \u201cGeneral de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.\u201d\n\nHi, I\u2019m Christine \u2013 a full-time traveler and career woman.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. No one, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petite Anne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love.\n\n________________________________\n\nDr. Samuel Gregg is Research Director at the Acton Institute.

Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces.\n\nArrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne de Gaulle Had Down Syndrome\n\nCharles and Yvonne de Gaulle were both devout Catholics, so when their youngest daughter Anne was born on New Years Day in 1928, they had a strong faith to fall back on when they learned that Anne had Down Syndrome. She also had birth injuries that meant that she would never walk unaided. There was never any question about Anne being institutionalized. She was a member of their family, and she stayed with the family in all their travels. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was noted for his reserve and even with family members he was usually not very demonstrative. Not so with his daughter Anne, who received a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. \u201cPapa\u201d was the one word that Anne could say clearly. He would sing to her, read her stories and play with her. She was, he said simply, \u201cMy joy\u201d. As de Gaulle said, \u201cShe helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them.\u201d\n\nThe De Gaulles Were Heartbroken\n\nYvonne de Gaulle, a formidable woman in her own right, as she demonstrated after the collapse of France in 1940 when by herself she traveled across the war-torn country and made sure her family, including Anne, was on the last transport from Brest to England, in October 1945 bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur and established a hospital for handicapped girls, the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. The de Gaulles were heartbroken when their beloved daughter died on February 6, 1948, in her father\u2019s arms. After they had buried her, Charles gently told his weeping wife, \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nOf course , the de Gaulles did not forget their daughter. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s\u2019 life was saved by his love for Anne on August 22, 1962, when an assassin\u2019s bullet was deflected in the car he was riding by the frame of the picture of his daughter which he carried with him at all times. When he died in 1970 he was buried beside his daughter at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises as he requested. Love gives us no guarantees against the tragedies of life, but it does give us the strength to surmount them."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/09/archives/yvonne-de-gaulle-widow-of-french-leader-dead-undergoes-operation.html", "page_content": "Mrs. de Gaulle was operated on last July 6 for an intestinal obstruction.

Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference In London de Gaulle\u2019s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle\u2019s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/32/a2304532.shtml", "page_content": "On 17 June 1940, the day her husband escaped to England, Madame De Gaulle and her children were at Carantec on the north coast of Brittany. They had taken refuge there with an aunt after leaving the family home at Colombey Les Deux Eglises about a month before. The Germans were advancing fast towards Western France, and when General De Gaulle reached London, he asked that urgent steps be taken to rescue his wife and family.\n\nThe decision was taken with Winston Churchill's agreement to send a plane with an SOE intelligence officer who was fluent in French to carry out this rescue. It had been intended that the mission should be carried out by Colonel Louis Franck, but he was diverted to the important mission of trying to persuade the King of the Belgians not to give up the armed struggle, and to bring him to England. The officer who replaced Colonel Franck was my uncle and godfather, Captain Norman Hope. Employed before the war by BP, he had lived in Saigon in French Indo-China, as it then was,so was a fluent French speaker. It is public knowledge that Madame De Gaulle and her children escaped by boat from Brest on 18 June. The following day, the Germans completed their conquest of Brittany. For 40 years, we did not know what had happened to those on board the plane.\n\nMy father noted laconically in his private war diary, '17 June. Norman Hope flew over to France on a special mission and no further news was received about him.' Some time later, Norman's wristwatch and some other personal effects were brought out of France by an escaping Frenchman. In February 1941, my father noted, 'Marjorie heard from the War Office that Norman must now be presumed to have been killed in France on 17(sic) June 1940.' Marjorie was Norman's wife and my aunt. She never referred to him in the hearing of my brother, my cousin or me, but when she died in 1982, there were instructions that the notice of her death should include the words, 'widow of Norman Hope, Chevalier du Legion'd'Honneur.' And she had the medal. In the way things turn out, it was too late to find out anything from my aunt. But we needed to find out something about Norman's final hours from somebody.\n\nThanks to a small number of important personal contacts, including Colonel Franck, my cousin was put in touch with Flt Lieut Kevin Baff, the historian of No 10 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force. He had been particularly interested in the flight because two of the crew were the first Australian Air force casualties of the war. Kevin Baff had the perseverance of experise of the true researcher, and in the late 1970's and early 1980's, he was gradually piecing the story together. What happened was this.\n\non 17 June, Norman travelled with his orders to a Coastal Command base near Plymouth, and was directed to a Supermarine Walrus, an amphibious aircraft with a crew of three, Flt Lieut John Bell, RAAF, Sgt Charles Harris, RAAF and Cpl Bernard Nowell, RAF. The purpose of the flight was so secret that noone at the base knew where the aircraft was going. Norman's briefing was to the crew only. They took off at about 0300 on 18 June with the intention of reaching Carantec at first light. They crossed the Breton coast about 20km west of Carantec, and it is believed they were fired on by the Germans or possibly the Frenc. Having been hit,the pilot was attempting to land in a field close to Ploudaniel, about 18km inland, when the plane hit a low embankment, burst into flames and all four men were killed.\n\nIt was fortunate that Madame de Gaulle knew nothing of this attempt to rescue her. Had she waited in Carantec, she might have been captured, and the consequences of that would have been extremely serious, to put it mildly. In the event, she found a car in which she drove with her children to Brest. They were delayed, because on the way the car broke down. Had it not, they would have gone on board a ship which later in the day was sunk in the English Channel with the loss of almost all on board. Instead, they found room on the last boat to leave Brest before the Germans arrived.\n\nIn the field near Ploudaniel, a number of people gathered at the site of the crash, and the bodies of my uncle and the crew members were carefully retrieved from the burnt out aircraft, and buried in the town cemetery. All this with the Wehrmacht almost upon them. After the war, the War Graves Commission put headstones on the graves, and the townspeople continue to remember these four casualties of war on All Souls' Day (2 November) and other times of remembrance.\n\nMy cousin, brother and I are certain my aunst never visited the grave. We assume she must have received information from the War Graves Commission that her husband was buried in Ploudaniel. All that is symptom of a family mystery we are unlikely to unravel. However, in 2003, we were able after long preparations, to visit the grave, and get as close as we could to the site of the crash: Kevin Baff had established from contacts in the area that the field layout had been substantially altered. It was deeply moving to be there, and we said prayers of remembrance for Norman and the crew of the Walrus.\n\nThere remains one further uncertainty about which we are looking for help. It is about the award of the Legion d'Honneur to Norman Hope. The medal exists, but the Central Office for Military Archives in France says there is no record of a citation. Can anyone help us reach a solution to this part of a story which remains in part mysterious?\n\nSources\n\nSir Edward Spears. Two Men who saved france. 1966\n\nEdward Ashcroft.

The couple had three children: Philippe (b. 1921), \u00c9lisabeth (1924\u20132013), and Anne (1928\u20131948), who was born with Down syndrome. Yvonne de Gaulle set up a charity, La fondation Anne-de-Gaulle, to help children with disabilities.\n\nYvonne and Charles were married on 6 April 1921.[1] She is known for the quote, \"The presidency is temporary\u2014but the family is permanent.\"[2] She and her husband narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on 22 August 1962, when their Citro\u00ebn DS was targeted by machine gun fire arranged by Jean Bastien-Thiry at the Petit-Clamart.[3]\n\nLike her husband, Yvonne de Gaulle was a conservative Catholic, and campaigned against prostitution, the sale of pornography in newsstands, and the televised display of nudity and sex, for which she earned the nickname Tante (Auntie) Yvonne. Later, she unsuccessfully tried to persuade de Gaulle to outlaw miniskirts in France.[citation needed]\n\nYvonne was reputed to be very discreet; as such, despite numerous appearances, she never gave any radio or televised interviews, and the broader public never learned the sound of her voice.\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nYvonne Vendroux came from an industrial family in Calais. The family name actually originated from The Netherlands, changed from the Dutch \"Van Droeg\" when the family emigrated during the era of William of Orange (also known as William III of England). William had decided to flood the fields during the 17th century to push back against the advance of troops from King Louis XIV. Yvonne's ancestor then married a Calasienne during the French Revolution.\n\nHer father, Jacques, was the president of the Council of Administration of Biscuitry, while her mother, Marguerite (n\u00e9e Forest), came from a family in Ardennes, and became the sixth woman in France to obtain a driver's license. She was the granddaughter of Alfred Corneau, industriel de Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. Les Vendroux passaient leurs \u00e9t\u00e9s dans le ch\u00e2teau ardennais de l\u2019abbaye Notre-Dame de Sept-Fontaines.\n\nHer eldest brother, Jacques Vendroux, (born 1897) became deputy and mayor of Calais. Her younger brother, Jean (born 1901) married Madeleine Schallier (1907-2000), fathered seven children, and died in an auto accident in 1956.\n\nHer sister Suzanne Vendroux (February 28 1905 in Calais - 27 December 1980 in Worthing, England) married Jean Rerolle (July 12 1897 in Ch\u00e2teauroux - 23 March 1978, Neuilly-sur-Seine) on 5 March 1934 in Fagnon. They had two children, Jacques-Henri (21 January 1935, 17th arrondissement, Paris) and Marguerite-Marie.\n\nEducation\n\nYvonne's parents provided her with a strict education in keeping with their elevated social status and the nature of the era.\n\nShe learned to read at home and studied with the Dominican Order of Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine (later moving to P\u00e9rigueux, and was encouraged (as many girls were at the time) to become proficient in needlework. Children were encouraged to use the vousvoyer with their elders, and during World War I, went with their governesses to Canterbury, England, not returning to their parents in France until the end of the year. They were letter settled in Wissant, a seaside community in Calais along the English Channel.\n\nMarriage to Charles de Gaulle\n\nYvonne met Charles de Gaulle in 1920, then a military captain returning from a mission in Poland. It was secretly arranged by the Vendroux family.\n\nTheir first date was to the Grand Palais during the fall exhibition to see the painting The Woman in Blue by Kees van Dongen. At a tea shortly after, Charles spilled his cup on young Yvonne's dress. Nonplussed, she laughed, and they continued courting.\n\nCharles invited Yvonne to a Saint-Cyr military ball at the Hotel des R\u00e9servoirs, in Versailles, in support of the institution where he had studied from 1912-1918. Two days later, Yvonne declared to her parents, \"It will be him, or no one.\"\n\nThey were engaged on 11 November, before the end of Captain de Gaulle's leave, and married on 7 April 1921, in the Notre-Dame de Calais church. De Gaulle played on Yvonne's family business when he expressed his joy on the occasion, writing to a friend, \"I am marrying the biscuits of Vendroux.\"\n\nThey honeymooned in Northern Italy, and went on to have three children, a boy and two girls:\n\nPhilippe de Gaulle, (born 28 December 1921)\n\n\u00c9lisabeth de Gaulle, (married in Boissieu) (15 May 1924 - 2 April 2013)\n\nAnne de Gaulle (1 January 1928 - 6 February 1948) (died of bronchial pneumonia)\n\nWar years\n\nIn 1934, the family maintained the \"Brasserie,\" property and renamed it \"la Boisserie,\" at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. A passionate horticulturist, Yvonne de Gaulle treated the garden as her domain.\n\nThe high-walled surroundings were initially intended to protect their daughter Anne, with Down Syndrome, from the indiscretion of the public. When Anne passed in 1948 the family founded The Anne de-Gaulle Foundation in her memory at the ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur, at Milon-la-Chapelle, directed by Georges Pompidou. Pompidou would subsequently become a close friend to the General.\n\nDuring World War II, Philippe joined the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL), while Yvonne de Gaulle and her husband went to London. General de Gaulle had initially advised her to go south with the children. She managed to make it to London by way of a Dutch ferry to Brest, then Falmouth. It was the last ship leaving the port.\n\nThere they made the acquaintance of Sir Winston Churchill, who provided updates of their daily life until they were able to return home.\n\nSpouse of the President\n\nYvonne de Gaulle became the unofficial First Lady of France on 21 December 1958 when then-General de Gaulle was elected President of the French Republic. The couple took a Citro\u00ebn to the President's residence, Elys\u00e9e Palace. Her couturier was Jacques Heim. She was tenacious, conservative, but could also be warm.\n\nDuring her husband's tenure as president from 1959 to 1969, Yvonne de Gaulle led a sterile and measured life. On a typical day, she would enjoy three meals with her husband, reading Le Figaro at breakfast, evening television sessions, and Sunday masses at the palace chapel. She epitomized tradition, moral values, and a deep sense of duty. Her Catholic faith influenced the conservative view of her husband on moral matters; after her arrival at the palace, one of the first things she asked was for a piet\u00e0 to be supplied to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Later, when her husband invited actress Brigitte Bardot to their residence, she threatened to refuse her on the grounds that she had been divorced. She went on to intervene against the authorization of birth control pills.\n\nThe couple welcomed Dwight Eisenhower and the Kennedys during their tenure. In 1961, when the American presidential couple John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy were invited by General de Gaulle, she took the initiative to forge links with the American first lady by taking her to visit the childcare school located on Boulevard Brune in the 14th arrondissement. After the Assassination of John F. Kennedy two years later, Madame de Gaulle invited her to rest and avoid media scrutiny in Paris.\n\nBut soon the French family would have their own brush with uncertainty: on 22 August 1962, the de Gaulles were the target an assassination attempt in Clamart, organized by the French Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel, Jean Bastien-Thiry. As de Gaulle's black Citro\u00ebn DS 19[2] sped through Petit-Clamart it was met by a barrage of submachine-gun fire. De Gaulle and his entourage, which included his wife, survived the attempt without any casualties or serious injuries while the attempt's perpetrators were subsequently all arrested and put on trial. Bastien-Thiry was convicted of leading the attempt in February 1963 at Fort d'Ivry, becoming the last person to be executed by firing squad in France.\n\nDe Gaulle managed to laugh off the incident without disrespecting police. He was deeply impressed with his wife's stoicism, however, reportedly saying, \"You are brave, Yvonne.\"\n\nDuring the events of May_68, Yvonne accompanied her husband during his displacement to Baden-Baden. She opposed the \"Communist\" uprising and protests.\n\nRetirement and death\n\nUpon Charles' resignation from the presidency in 1969, Yvonne accompanied him on a retirement trip to Ireland, famous for the photos of the couple and the aide-de-camp, General Fran\u00e7ois Flohic, taken on the beach.\n\nMadame de Gaulle was widowed in 1970 and entered the retirement home of the sisters of the Immaculate Conception in Paris in 1978.
