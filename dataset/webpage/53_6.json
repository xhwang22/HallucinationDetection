He opened his first shop in 1969, joining forces with the master cutter Edward Sexton, and backed by Cilla Black and the Beatles executive Peter Brown.\n\nThe shop attracted rock stars and aristocrats who wanted the mix of innovative styling and traditional made-to-measure tailoring. Huge lapels, velvet jackets with nipped-in waists, Oxford bags and mixed-up tweeds fast became his design signatures.\n\nHighlights from the exhibition, Tommy Nutter: Rebel on the Row, include four of Mick Jagger's suits \u2013 boyish-sized save for the shoulders \u2013 in shades of green and lemon. Elton John's stadium-ready two-tone dinner jackets are striking and tasteless in equal measure.\n\n\"Tommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible,\" said Elton John, who often visited the shop to be measured up while drinking a glass of sherry.\n\nIn the early 70s Nutter created suits for Bianca Jagger. \"Bianca really wanted a man's suit and not a suit cut for a woman,\" Everest said. \"She asked for the darts to be taken out of her first pistachio green suit to make it sexier.\"\n\nThe exhibition has recreated Nutter's shop, along with its innovative window displays featuring patchouli-soaked stuffed rats wearing diamond chokers, to demonstrate how pioneering his approach to brand image was at the time.\n\nThe tailor stopped working with Sexton at 35a Savile Row in 1976 but returned to the street some years later to set up business again, at No 19.

The enterprise was funded by the singer Cilla Black and Peter Brown of Apple, the Beatles's record company. Describing his first look Nutter said: 'Everybody was wearing a narrow suit at the end of the 1960s ... so I just went wild with the lapels and cut them as wide as you possibly could - enormous - and it was terribly flared at the jacket. So that was my first look and it was different from anybody else.' Tommy Nutter\u2019s celebrity clientele included Mick Jagger. Eric Clapton and the Beatles, who are pictured wearing his suits on the front cover of 'Abbey Road'. Such connections enabled Nutter to introduce high fashion to Savile Row and thus effect enormous influence on British menswear.\n\n\n\nThis suit was given by Sir Roy Strong, author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dating to around 1980, this suit was worn by Sir Roy for public and formal occasions in his capacity as Museum Director. Sir Roy became known for his vigorous support of modern design and was also recognised for his own sartorial flair."}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@kanupriya.goenka/the-rebel-on-the-row-tommy-nutter-ef1ab1614f78", "page_content": "Born in 1943, Thomas Albert Nutter, revolutionized men\u2019s fashion in the 1970s. In the era when mass production was booming and many ready to wear men\u2019s fashion labels were coming up, Tommy Nutter single-handedly made a mark on men\u2019s couture.\n\nNutter\u2019s impact and influence on menswear was unique because he combined the skills of tailor and designer before Armani and Paul Smith created global empires\n\nIn 1969, at the age of 26, Tommy Nutter opened an unusual new boutique on the \u2018golden mile\u2019 of bespoke tailoring, the first new tailor in Savile Row in over a century. His store was called \u201c Nutters of Savile Row\u201d.\n\nA model wearing a Nutter Suit in New York, 1975. Right:\n\nNutter revolutionized the traditional savile row suit. Nutter created a thrilling new look, with a tighter waist and chest, incredible lapel widths on single-breasted jackets and a structure that was loose enough to dance in. There were wonderfully crazed juxtapositions of plaids and traditional tweeds and worsted cloths reinvented in bold, often clashing, colors, prints, and textures.\n\nThrough the 70s, Nutter even branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing his brand in Japan.\n\nNutter\u2019s life speaks volumes about the British fashion industry, how a designer and their name can be divorced as quickly as the price of a garment is cut for the end-of-season sales. With a slender grasp on the complexities of share ownership, Nutter was forced out of his first operation in 1976 by his business partner, Edward Sexton, and left virtually penniless while the company continued to trade under his name. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row successfully with a ready to wear shop: \u201cTommy Nutter, Savile Row.\n\nTommy Nutter had dressed all the popular actors singers and artists of his time. He dressed three of the four Beatles on the album cover of Abbey Road. He outfitted Mick Jagger \u2014 and then Jagger\u2019s wife. Elton John became one of his muses. Elton John turned to Tommy Nutter for more than 20 years when it came to his offstage getup \u2014 and occasionally his onstage getup, too: see the legendary black and white yin-yang ensemble he wore at Wembley Stadium in 1984.\n\nElton John in Nutter Suit 1975\n\nMick Jagger and Bianca Jagger in Tommy Nutter suits\n\n3 out 4 Beatles members wearing Tommy Nutter Suits\n\nNutter may have died at 49, but his legacy has proved enduring both on and off the Row. Tailor-designers like Timothy Everest, Oswald Boateng and Richard James are indebted to Nutter, and Tom Ford has acknowledged his stylistic influence. Recently, Tommy Hilfiger credited his \u201cirreverent approach\u201d as a source of inspiration, and in February this year, the American designer Todd Snyder debuted a collection at New York Fashion Week directly referencing Nutters of Savile Row.\n\nJ&J Crombie Limited, a British fashion company, today owns the \u201cTommy Nutter\u201d trademark. Crombie continues to produce tailoring and accessories based on the wealth of sketches and designs created by Tommy Nutter during his lifetime and now held in the Crombie archives."}, {"url": "https://theeverydaymagazine.co.uk/fashion/the-history-and-influence-of-punk-in-fashion", "page_content": "Because despite the sex gear clearly on display, punk saxophonist and brief member of X-Ray Spex Lora Logic once said, \"It was an asexual movement. It transcended labels and boundaries: that was really part of the punk spirit.\" For many, Punk was as much about their value systems as their fast music and aesthetic.\n\nDIY was the name of the game both in their fashion and art. Thrift shopping in both the men's and women's sections was common. Many young punks made their own gear, creating their own accessories from everyday items. It didn't have to be pretty \u2013 all the better to shock and offend. The anarchist and sometimes nihilist schools of thought in the punk scene deemed it acceptable to walk around sporting symbols that were more than just simply inflammatory. The Hollywood Brats, the Sex Pistols and Siouxsie and the Banshees \u2013 all wore the Nazi swastika as a fashion statement, something modern appraisals of these bands tend to gloss over. Others both in and out of the scene condemned this at the time. Traditionally leftist symbols such as anarchism were also embraced by many.\n\nSo, where does this primal scream of Punk lead us? Pop Punk, Oi and American Hardcore all share DNA with this movement, including their stylistic choices. But these are subcultures still, underground and niche.\n\nWhat happened when the punk underground became the mainstream?\n\n\u2026AND THEN THE BASTARDS GOT US DOWN\n\nThe frenzy of the eighties was over, and the beer-soaked, cigarette-burned stage was set for Grunge, not necessarily uniform but more accessible. Post-punk powerhouses like The Pixies and Hole (a pioneer of the \"kinderwhore\" look) changed the sound and look, meaning there were babydolls and smeared lipstick between Kurt Cobain's flannels and Trent Reznor's shaggy hair. But gender non-conformity was still there, and LGBT people in the scene were getting loud, proud and more assertive. Queercore bands like Pansy Division were thriving near the turn of the century.\n\nImprints of Punk are now everywhere in music, art and especially fashion.\n\nRiot Grrrl exploded out of America and was a driving force in mainstream fashion and modern ideas. Women who had never picked up a zine in their lives were wearing miniskirts, fishnets and chokers. Slip dresses and smoky eyes were seen on it-girls like Jennifer Anniston \u2013 things that are gaining reappraisal today! This was the beginning of post-punk mainstream as the times and attitudes changed.\n\nThe 21st century meant less DIY and more mass-produced, and more marketable to kids. For young girls like me wanting to look the same as the bands on MTV, Claire's sale racks were a goldmine for cheap chains, lacy chokers and bullet belts. The dog tags with the American Idiot symbol sported on every teenager at Merry Hill in the Midlands had definite Rocker roots. Instead of Vietnam, we were angry at Iraq and shopping accordingly. We experimented with rock, emo, the frustrated scream of nu-metal and its bandanas and Tripp pants. On the more sophisticated side of the red carpet, a definite sign of the times was Elizabeth Hurley's Versace dress, held together on the sides by safety pins.\n\nMoving ahead to now, at the tentative beginning of the 2020s and Punk isn't just mainstream \u2013 it's Gucci and Chanel and Vogue and Cosmo and even Sainsbury's, printed on t-shirts as a skull or a circle-A. It's used for editorials and think pieces and period dramas about the glory days of the \"true punk\" lifestyle.\n\nPost-punk and postmodernism as a concept do not mean Punk, or its power to shake its arse and give the middle finger in front of the establishment is dead. From the gravity-defying hair of the Tokyo rock scene to the Spanish kids cranking up Ska Punk \u2013 to the English girl using a lighter on her eyeliner for the first time, regardless of how messy it will make her mirror. Punk fashion is all around. The primal scream is still going, sometimes loud, sometimes quiet, sometimes distorted, but always there.\n\nSOURCES\n\n'Typical Girls?

However, if you start at its roots, and trace the branches from there, new wave begins to lose some of its ambiguity.\n\nNew wave\u2019s metaphorical roots are planted firmly in the soil of punk rock. In fact, there was a brief moment in early to mid 70s when the terms \u201cnew wave\u201d and \u201cpunk rock\u201d were used almost interchangeably, though the former was more likely to come from the mouths of music critics while the latter was more often embraced by musicians.\n\nAt the tail end of punk rock\u2019s heyday in the late 1970s, the sonic differences between these two genres began to crystallize. Bands that cut their teeth in the belly of the punk rock scene, like Blondie and The Talking Heads, strayed further and further from the aural stylings of their punk rock contemporaries and found themselves sailing in the uncharted waters of new wave.\n\nWhere punk rock was raw and raucous, new wave was bright and euphonic. Where punk rock was angry and abrasive, new wave was quirky and clever. While many new wave artists held onto parts of the punk rock ethos (remaining decidedly anti-establishment and anti-corporate) their music tended to be less political and less anarchistic than most punk rock.\n\nAll of these factors, when combined, led to one huge difference between punk rock and new wave: marketability. While even the most iconic punk rockers seldom enjoyed commercial success (in part by design; anti-capitalism has always been a pillar of punk rock philosophy), new wave artists could chart. In the late 1970s, songs like \u201cHeart of Glass,\u201d by Blondie and \u201cMy Sharona,\u201d by The Knack started hitting number one. The era of new wave was officially underway.\n\nEven as new wave began to take off, the exact characteristics of the genre remained a bit blurry. Bands like Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow became known for their rhythmic experimentation, releasing songs with clear West African, Cuban, and Jamaican influences. Devo leaned into futuristic sci-fi aesthetics. The B-52s infused their music with humor and camp. As a rule, artists who were labelled \u201cnew wave\u201d refused to be pigeon-holed.\n\nHowever, as the 70s gave way to the 80s, one uniting element became more and more ubiquitous within the new wave movement: the synthesizer. The previously undefinable genre of new wave now had a distinct sound, and it was absolutely electric. As the popularity of new wave reached new heights, the strange and sonorous sound of the synth became the most notable leitmotif of the decade.\n\nNew wave peaked in the early 80s, then began to recede into the cultural background, though not without making its mark on the musical landscape. Before fading from the radio, new wave managed to inspire the birth of synth-pop \u2014 a genre that would define an entire musical era.\n\nDespite the fact that new wave has lived well outside of the zeitgeist for years now, it still enjoys occasional bursts of relevance; though it seems many have forgotten that its origins lie in the seedy heart of the 1970s punk rock scene. The likes of Debbie Harry and David Byrne were punk rockers long before they became new wave pioneers. Collective memory sure is a fickle thing.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the history of new wave, check out Michael Grecco\u2019s punk rock coffee table book, \u201cPunk, Post Punk, New Wave: Onstage, Backstage, and In Your Face.\u201d Let Grecco\u2019s photography transport you to the golden age of new wave."}, {"url": "https://mrkantor.com/the-clash-of-punk-rock-and-new-wave-music-is-there-really-a-difference/", "page_content": "\u201cAre Punk and New Wave music identical in genre?\u201d This is a question that has left many a music enthusiast stumped. People on forums like Head- Fi ponder if there is a difference between Punk Rock and New Wave and people on Yahoo even question if Post- Punk and New Wave are the same as well. These listeners inquire about this because most of the time punk and new wave music groups are associated with each other and without distinction between the two different genres of music. Although the common listener might not know the clear differences between the two genres as there are also similarities, there is a line drawn in the hypothetical sand including their history, the artists, and what each label consists of.\n\nPunk Rock\n\nHistory\n\nPunk is a rock music genre that began as a rock and roll revolution in the early 1970\u2019s as an intentionally nonconformist group that held their beliefs in rebellion and anti-establishment ideologies. Punk stemmed from the Garage Rock genre and kept many of its predecessor\u2019s musical tendencies such as heavy guitar riffs, persistent percussion, and screeched vocals and added an easily distinguishable independent inclination. This distinct attitude has become a large part of what defines Punk Rock today. Chris Chouiniere, a music educator with a masters degree in music education, explains, \u201cLyrically, there was no hiding the meaning of punk songs. Topics were anti-establishment, anti-sentimental, confrontational, and controversial. In general, punk music was meant to offend and upset; it was everything that mainstream music was not.\u201d\n\nPunk Rock would come to influence New Wave through the defiant attitude that Punk introduced to the music industry.\n\nArtists\n\nBad Brains, Bad Religion, The Clash, Crass, the Dead Kennedys, the Exploited, the Germs, Good Charlotte, Iggy Pop, the Misfits, New York Dolls, the Offspring, Operation Ivy, the Ramones, Social Distortion, the Stooges, the Velvet Underground etc.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThis is Search and Destroy by the Stooges off of the Raw Power album released in 1973. Iggy Pop (lead singer for the Stooges) is also referenced as the godfather of Punk Rock.\n\nThe song describes a setting of war and possible detonation of the world by way of the Atomic Bomb. It was written in a time where it was viewed as contentious to sing about such a subject as willingly as The Stooges did. The tone of the song and the diction in the lyrics seems to be sarcastically challenging the government and their idea of blowing places up with radioactive explosives so easily. This song is one of the earliest and most defining punk songs in what it stands for and what it sounds like.\n\nNew Wave\n\nHistory\n\nNew Wave music, also known as Post- Punk, is a genre that has roots in punk music, but relies heavily on electronics and synthesizers. New Wave gained massive popularity in 1983 and its relevancy has declined since. New Wave is structured around things like strong melodies with clear harmonies from its Power Pop ancestors, a forceful rhythm from Jazz influences, and its uncooperative attitude and foundation from Punk Rock. The movement was named after an obscure genre of French film that was different from the societal norm at the time and that really makes a statement as to the ground that New Wave was founded on. It prophesied the cultural changes that would be furtherly pushed after its birth. One definition of New Wave from Steven Van Zandt\u2019s Rock and Roll Forever Foundation from Teachrock.org in 2013 divides Punk and New Wave saying that New Wave is \u201c[popular] music less raw than punk rock and typically including unconventional melodies, exaggerated beats, and quirky lyrics.\u201d\n\nIt later inspired Synthpop with synthesizers being an instrument that is frequently used while adding a mostly upbeat tempo and mood. New Wave was also a role model for Electronic music because it uses technology as a main instrument and that was really introduced through New Wave.\n\nArtists\n\nBlondie, Cyndi Lauper, Depeche Mode, Devo, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Gang of Four, Joy Division, Men Without Hats, New Order, Oingo Boingo, the Psychedelic Furs, the Smiths, the Talking Heads, Tears for Fears, the Violent Femmes, etc.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThis song is Walked In Line by Joy Division on their Warsaw album released in 1981.\n\nWalked In Line makes a similar statement about the military and government establishment that the Stooges\u2019 Search and Destroy does. It depicts the negative influences brought on by the corruption of the government. Walked In Line claims that the soldiers are being brainwashed not to question authority as part of their training. This is rebellious ideal is especially apparent in the lyrics of the song: \u201cThey made it through the whole machine/ To never question anymore/ Hypnotic trance/ They never saw/ They walked in line/ They walked in line\u2026\u201d This furtherly proves that Post punk music kept the same founding morals of questioning authority in that was prevalent in Punk. Their training has revoked the troops\u2019 ability to freely think and replaced it with that of a robot programmed to obey every task given to it by the government and nothing more.\n\nConclusion\n\nPunk and Post Punk are similar in establishing principles. Punk created a movement of questioning authority that had not yet been witnessed in such vast numbers at the time. With the challenging and changing of traditions brought on by such a movement it created controversy because it was rather an unwritten law that all people obeyed and to refuse it was deemed taboo. The nonconforming agenda that Punk Rock introduced was carried through New Wave, but it sounded different. New Wave brought with it an electric twist. It also used more versatile tempos that made New Wave easier to dance to in order to differentiate itself from its ancestral raw and unorganized Punk sounds.\n\nAlthough the two are related, they are separate genres with New Wave succeeding the death of Punk music.\n\nPost by KarlyB.

He soon became inspired by changes in popular culture of the 1960s. In 1969 he opened his own shop, House of Nutter, in Savile Row, London. He worked with Edward Sexton, and was backed financially by Cilla Black and Peter Brown of the Beatles\u2019 company Apple He even created clothes for another fashion designer, Hardy Amies.\n\nIn the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan.\n\nNutter\u2019s suits are worn by three of the members of the Beatles on the famous cover of the Abbey Road album. He also created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.\n\nNutter died in 1992 of complications from AIDS.\n\n\u5373\u4fbf\u5df2\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e86\u534a\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\uff0cTommy
