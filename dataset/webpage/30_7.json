At that point the likes of Blackpool, Motherwell, Partick Thistle and St Mirren were vying for his signature, but the 19-year-old's mother was so impressed by the honest approach of the Aberdeen manager David Halliday that the boy heeded her advice to head north-east from his Lanarkshire home to enlist with the Dons.\n\nBaird, who had starred for Strathclyde Juniors alongside the future Rangers luminary Willie Waddell, was an intelligent fellow who nursed ambitions to be an architect, but his football skills had proved impossible to ignore and now he planned to train in the mornings and study for his future career in the afternoons. However, he made a slow start at Pittodrie, struggling for an impact in this new competitive environment, and he was still featuring for the reserves when war broke out in 1939.\n\nNow, all too soon, the youngster who had viewed joining the Dons as a great adventure was to find himself caught up in an expedition of an altogether more daunting nature, one on which failure surely must have carried fatal consequences.\n\nWhile serving in the medical corps for the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, he missed the evacuation at Dunkirk but managed to board the last ship out of St Nazaire when France fell in summer 1940. Awaiting his return to the war, Baird was stationed at Headingley, Yorkshire's cricket headquarters, and while he was there he guested for Leeds United, facing top performers of the day such as the Everton trio Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Cliff Britton.\n\nThe respite was brief, though, and he was dispatched to North Africa, where he was part of the force which confronted Rommel in the Western Desert. When Tobruk was taken in the summer of 1942, his field ambulance was surrounded by German tanks and he was captured and handed over to the Italians, who placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp near Rimini on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMany of his fellow detainees died in what he described later as \"a filthy hell-hole\" but Baird, who whiled away some of his time by day-dreaming about his life as a footballer, remained resilient and in 1943, after 18 months of incarceration, he and a comrade, Harold Smith, managed to escape. Knowing that the Allies had landed in Italy, and aiming to join them, the pair headed south into the lower reaches of the Appenines. They lived off the land, helped on their way by sympathetic Italian farmers, and when severe winter weather set in Baird was sheltered for some months by a compassionate family, the Pilottis, who found other safe billetts for Smith and another fugitive who had joined the pair on their trek towards freedom.\n\nWith his sharp and lively mind, Baird picked up Italian quickly, enabling him to pose convincingly as the son of his courageous benefactors, to whom he became devoted and with whom he embarked on a lifelong friendship. \"They were real heroes,\" he said years later. \"They looked after me despite knowing the Germans would have shot them if they had found out.\"\n\nEventually, as Hitler's forces pulled out of Italy, Baird rejoined the Allied ranks and returned to Britain, guesting as a footballer for Aldershot and non-League Falmouth before returning to Aberdeen following his demob in September 1945. Vastly matured by his recent experiences, he was now a far more confident character than the tentative youth he had been during his initial Pittodrie sojourn, and he became established rapidly in the Dons' first team.\n\nOperating as an incisive prompter alongside his close pal and fellow inside-forward George Hamilton and the diminutive spearhead Stan Williams, Baird proved hugely influential as Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup, an emergency wartime competition and the precursor to the soon-to-be-launched Scottish League Cup. They beat Rangers 3-2 in a see-sawing final in front of 135,000 fans at Hampden Park in May 1946 to claim the first big prize since the club's formation in 1903.\n\nThere was reward on a wider front, too, with an appearance for Scotland in the Victory international against Belgium that January, the game finishing 2-2. Because it was classed as an unofficial wartime encounter, no cap was awarded, and that proved to be his sole outing for his country. He was immensely unfortunate because he had excelled against the Belgians, keeping his feet deftly in thick snow on a foggy Hampden afternoon, and had been selected for the next fixture, against England, only to be forced out through injury.\n\nA season later Baird was prominent again as the Dons beat highly-fancied Hibernian 2-1 to win the Scottish Cup, thus securing their first senior trophy and emphasising the progress they had made in finishing third in that term's title race behind Rangers and Hibs. They reached the inaugural League Cup final, too, losing 4-0 to Rangers, and faced the future on a tide of optimism.\n\nBaird, with his clever passing, neat ball skill and happy knack of contributing important goals, was seen as a major plank of Halliday's entertaining side, but he was hampered cruelly by knee problems which demanded three operations, and also he suffered a fractured leg. His best extended run was in 1950-51, when he scored 10 times in 40 league and cup appearances, but after barely figuring in 1952-53, the 34-year-old \u2013 whose overall record of 37 goals in 144 games for Aberdeen would have been far more extensive had he been blessed with fitness on a consistent basis \u2013 accepted a transfer to second-tier St Johnstone.\n\nAt McDiarmid Park Baird enjoyed a fruitful Indian summer, moving back to wing-half and missing only a handful of matches as the Saints twice finished in upper mid-table, then narrowly missed promotion to the top flight in 1955-56, his last campaign.\n\nAfter leaving the game, Baird \u2013 who until his death was believed to be Aberdeen's oldest surviving player \u2013 embarked on a fulfilling and packed life as a sports writer for the Scottish Sunday Express and a PE teacher who rose to become assistant head of Hilton Academy in Aberdeen by the time he retired in 1979. Somehow he even chiselled out the necessary time from his crowded schedule to qualify as a glider pilot.\n\nBaird believed passionately in education, achieving degrees in English and Italian through the University of London by correspondence course in the 1960s then teaching his second language at evening class. A warm, gregarious and charming man who had come to love all things Italian, he moved to Italy for a year from 1980, along with his wife Nancy, to teach English there.\n\nHis attachment to journalism was equally deep \u2013 many of his family members were practitioners, including his brother-in-law Magnus Magnusson and Magnusson's daughter Sally \u2013 and he became a popular columnist on the Aberdeen-based monthly magazine Leopard.\n\nArchie Baird was an author, too, penning a moving autobiography, Family Of Four (1989). It was a book in which his love of football was abundantly evident, but which illustrated eloquently his appreciation of its rightful place when he came to consider the more profound values of life.\n\nIvan Ponting\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird, footballer, journalist and teacher; born Rutherglen, Lanarkshire 8 May 1919; played for Aberdeen 1938-53, St Johnstone 1953-56; marriedn (one son, one daughter); died Cove, Aberdeen 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/rutherglen-born-aberdeen-fc-hero-2601789", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nTRIBUTES have been paid to Aberdeen Football Club hero Archie Baird, who died recently.\n\nArchie, from Rutherglen, born on May 8 1919, passed away on November 3, when he died in his sleep.\n\nAs well as helping the Dons to their first-ever Scottish Cup win in 1947, the inside-forward and wing-half also played for St Johnstone, and picked up one international cap for Scotland.\n\nBelieved to have been the oldest surviving Aberdeen player, Archie signed for the Pittodrie club from Strathclyde Juniors before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team.\n\nSpeaking to the Aberdeen website earlier this year, he said: \u201cI had always admired the Dons and their style and moving to Aberdeen was a clean break It all happened so quickly; six months after starting as a junior I was away to Aberdeen and earning \u00a34 per week with a \u00a320 signing on fee.\u201d\n\nHe joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He escaped and lived with an Italian family as their \"son\".\n\nIn 1989 he published an autobiography, Family of Four, which described these experiences. In 2001, he was presented with a medal and diploma for his service to Italian language and culture in Scotland.\n\nBaird returned to Aberdeen before the end of the war. His good form in this period earned him selection for Scotland in a friendly match against Belgium in January 1946. The match ended in a 2-2 draw.\n\nArchie was one of nine Scotland players making their international debut in the match, and five of them did not make another international appearance, including the Rutherglen man.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat game should never have been played as the ground was covered in snow. The game ended in a 2-2 draw but the thick fog made conditions all the more difficult.\u201d\n\nBaird helped Aberdeen win the Southern League Cup - a forerunner of the Scottish League Cup - in 1946 and the 1947 Scottish Cup.\n\nArchie recalled: \u201cIt was an amazing experience and after we lost a goal in the opening minute we came back to win with Stan Williams scoring the winner. I took up a position at the near post as Stan cut in from the bye-line.\n\n\u201cI was shouting at Stan to cut the ball back, but he flicked the ball in at the near post for a great goal.\u201d\n\nBut his appearances at Pittodrie were restricted by injuries. In all he made 104 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 26 goals.\n\nHe was transferred in 1953 to St. Johnstone, where he played for three seasons before retiring in 1956.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Archie worked as a teacher and a sports journalist.\n\nAn Aberdeen FC spokesman said: \u201cA tall inside forward, Baird was a master in the air and arguably one of the finest inside forwards to grace Pittodrie.\u201d\n\nArchie celebrated his 90th birthday in May this year. He is survived by his wife Nancy, his son and daughter, and three grandchildren.\n\nHis sister Mamie was married to the late Mastermind host, Magnus Magnusson."}, {"url": "https://www.aberdeenlive.news/sport/aberdeen-footballer-born-day-who-7054265", "page_content": "Inside Forward Archie Baird was born in Rutherglen in 1919.\n\nHe began his playing career with Strathclyde Juniors, quickly catching the eyes of clubs both sides of the border.\n\nBlackpool, Motherwell, St Mirren and Partick Thistle were all fighting for the exciting 19-year-old's signature, however his mother was most impressed with Aberdeen.

He was 95. He passed away very peacefully at Edington Cottage Hospital in North Berwick.\n\nMr. Baird, a former RAF fighter pilot and veterinary surgeon, is survived by his wife, Sheila, a medical doctor and great-grandaughter of the legendary Willie Park Sr., first winner of the Open Championship, Prestwick in 1860. The couple had four great-grandchildren.\n\nEarly in their marriage the couple shared a small flat in Edinburgh. Their tight budget forced the couple to search second-hand shops and auctions for furnishings. It was during one such excursion that Mr. Baird came upon a dusty bag of hickory shafted clubs. One of the log-nosed woods bore the name of Park. Excited by the find of a club connected to a family member, he bought the club for five shillings (less than a dollar), and thus began a lifelong love of golf collecting.\n\nMr. Baird began to scour shops throughout England and eventually amassed an enormous number of especially prized ancient clubs before turning his eye to other golf collectibles such as books, medals, and other odds and ends.

One of the oldest pieces was a tempura painting from the 1850s of the Bruntsfield links. He had also acquired a portrait of W. Goddard.

Thousands of visitors have come through the museum these past 40 years. Mr. Baird charged not a penny, rather wanting visitors to come away with a deeper appreciation of the game\u2019s rich history. He delighted in giving those tours, all delivered in a concise, entertaining style punctuated with dry humor and memorable one-liners. In an interview with Links Magazine he spoke of the Dutch as inventors of the game:\n\n\u201cThey were ahead of the Scots, but they couldn\u2019t make decent clubs\u2014they didn\u2019t need to because they played on iced-over canals, so everyone hit the ball a long way. Nonetheless it was the Scottish craftsmen, with their fine woods of beech and ash, who made the first great golf clubs, and it was the Scots who spread the game.\u201d\n\nHe would often appear at golf functions wearing an original red golf play coat, c. early 1800s, worn by members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, a coat he was said to have found at a Boy Scout rummage sale.\n\nMr. Baird was the author of Golf on Gullane Hill, published in 1982, which recounts 350 years of golf on Gullane links. He was a member of Muirfield Golf Club and assisted in the development of exhibits that display the club\u2019s rich history. He also donated the pocket watch that Old Tom Morris gave his son, Tommy, after he won his first Open Championship, to the St Andrews Golf Club, whose clubhouse faces the 18th fairway of the St Andrews Old Course. A small plaque commemorates the gift.\n\nAmong many other memberships and honors, Mr. Baird was a founding member of the British Golf Collectors Society, latterly an Honorary Life member and an original committee member. He won the BGCS\u2019s Murdoch Medal in 2000 and in June 2018 was honored with the British Empire Medal, both in recognition for services to the history of golf. The BEM was bestowed as part of the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours, which annually recognizes individuals for a variety of services to the Crown.\n\nHe was a past Captain of Gullane Golf Club, and an honorary member the Society of Hickory Golfers, the latter a modest honor, but a testimony to the esteem in which he was held by those around the world who value golf\u2019s traditions.\n\nMr. Baird will long be remembered for his kindness, his keen appreciation for golf\u2019s heritage and his expertise in sharing that knowledge.\n\nAdditional information will be added here as it becomes available."}, {"url": "https://www.eastlothiancourier.com/news/18105409.tributes-paid-death-well-known-golf-historian-archie-baird/", "page_content": "Mr Baird was born in Edinburgh on September 28, 1924.\n\nHe moved to East Lothian after he retired from working as a veterinarian, living in Aberlady for more than 30 years.\n\nArchie met his wife Sheila, whom he was married to for more than 60 years, while he was studying at veterinary college and she was studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nArchie, described as a cheeky man of huge character, founded Gullane Golf Club\u2019s Heritage of Golf Museum, which he opened in 1980.\n\nHe was a long-serving curator at the museum and an author of several books on the history of golf.\n\nHe was also awarded a British Empire Medal last year as part of the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours.\n\nMr Baird was captain of Gullane Golf Club from 1976 to 1978 and an honorary life member at the club.\n\nHe was also a member of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, Muirfield.\n\nA father to Colin, Marion, Mungo and Christine, Mr Baird, who was also a great-grandfather of four, had previously said that Gullane Hill was his favourite golfing spot in the county.\n\nHe was also said to have enjoyed golf for the social interactions and exercise.\n\nTributes have been pouring in since Archie\u2019s passing.\n\nIn a post on Twitter on Monday, Gullane Golf Club said: \u201cWe were saddened at the weekend to learn of the passing of Archie Baird, aged 95, the founder of our Heritage of Golf Museum.\n\n\u201cA warm and charming character, his knowledge and love for golf made him a great source of information for all who met him.

Esq. painted by Charles Lees, RSA as a study for his later masterpiece \u201cA Grand Match Played Over St. Andrews Links.\u201d\n\nIn 1980 wishing to share some of these treasures, and with fellow collector Ben Crenshaw cutting the ribbon, Mr. Baird opened the Heritage of Golf Museum nearly adjacent to the 18th green of the Gullane No. 1 golf course in Aberlady. Thousands of visitors have come through the museum these past 40 years. Mr. Baird charged not a penny, rather wanting visitors to come away with a deeper appreciation of the game\u2019s rich history. He delighted in giving those tours, all delivered in a concise, entertaining style punctuated with dry humor and memorable one-liners. In an interview with Links Magazine he spoke of the Dutch as inventors of the game:\n\n\u201cThey were ahead of the Scots, but they couldn\u2019t make decent clubs\u2014they didn\u2019t need to because they played on iced-over canals, so everyone hit the ball a long way. Nonetheless it was the Scottish craftsmen, with their fine woods of beech and ash, who made the first great golf clubs, and it was the Scots who spread the game.\u201d\n\nHe would often appear at golf functions wearing an original red golf play coat, c. early 1800s, worn by members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, a coat he was said to have found at a Boy Scout rummage sale.\n\nMr. Baird was the author of Golf on Gullane Hill, published in 1982, which recounts 350 years of golf on Gullane links. He was a member of Muirfield Golf Club and assisted in the development of exhibits that display the club\u2019s rich history. He also donated the pocket watch that Old Tom Morris gave his son, Tommy, after he won his first Open Championship, to the St Andrews Golf Club, whose clubhouse faces the 18th fairway of the St Andrews Old Course. A small plaque commemorates the gift.\n\nAmong many other memberships and honors, Mr. Baird was a founding member of the British Golf Collectors Society, latterly an Honorary Life member and an original committee member. He won the BGCS\u2019s Murdoch Medal in 2000 and in June 2018 was honored with the British Empire Medal, both in recognition for services to the history of golf. The BEM was bestowed as part of the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours, which annually recognizes individuals for a variety of services to the Crown.\n\nHe was a past Captain of Gullane Golf Club, and an honorary member the Society of Hickory Golfers, the latter a modest honor, but a testimony to the esteem in which he was held by those around the world who value golf\u2019s traditions.\n\nMr. Baird will long be remembered for his kindness, his keen appreciation for golf\u2019s heritage and his expertise in sharing that knowledge.\n\nAdditional information will be added here as it becomes available."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83643281/archie-albert-baird", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.
