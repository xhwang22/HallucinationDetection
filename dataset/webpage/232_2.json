Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nBritish musician\n\nMusical artist\n\nMichael Joseph Moody (born 30 August 1950) is an English guitarist, and a former member of the rock bands Juicy Lucy and Whitesnake. He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed The Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2011 to 2015, Moody toured and recorded with Snakecharmer, a band he co-formed.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P.

They were subsequently joined by bass player Bruce Thomas, later to play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined recently re-patriated keyboard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guest with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody knew Coverdale \u2013 who had fronted Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture \u2013 from the Middlesbrough music scene in the late sixties. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979), recorded by a modified lineup with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with cowriting four of the tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of 'Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.[citation needed]\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1981, Graham Bonnet's Line-Up featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and three songs written by Moody with Bob Young. Moody maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others.[citation needed] By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was unhappy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite this deteriorating situation, he recorded Slide It In \u2013 a process he described as an 'unhappy experience' \u2013 but then left the band in 1983.[1]\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected TV music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, witty view of some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he and Bob Young wrote a book on musicians' humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band, featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade, he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.[citation needed]\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman. \"What a bloke,\" marvelled the singer. \"Every hotel we stayed in, he used to get his black bin-liners out and start taping them to the windows \u2013 can't sleep if there's any light in the room. They used to think he was mad. Lovely fella though. A great guitarist. And intelligent too. Too intelligent for Coverdale.\"[6]\n\nMoody reunited on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record as the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. They issued two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the US as part of the Best of British Blues tour, also featuring Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers J\u00f8rn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in reproducing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Stefan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.[citation needed]\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[7] to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also played occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George.[citation needed] 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released a live CD (featuring former Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin) and a live DVD with the former The Company Of Snakes singer Stefan Berggren back, and with the special guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. The DVD also featured sessionman Jimmy Copley (who worked with bands such as Go West and Tears for Fears) on drums and Mark Stanway from Magnum on the keyboards.\n\nAround this time Moody played on Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me, released at the same time as his memoirs Playing with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray, former Wishbone Ash guitarist Laurie Wisefield, singer Chris Ousey (Heartland), drummer Gary James (Thunder, Magnum) and Ozzy's keyboardist Adam Wakeman. In 2015, Moody left \"Snakecharmer\" to pursue his solo career. In recent years, Moody also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the \"Sunflower Jam\" house band and the Bad Apples.[citation needed]. In 2016 he and Ali Maas Moody released their first album together. They also played live regularly with their Ali Maas and Micky Moody Band.\n\n2020s\n\nIn 2020 Micky and Ali released their second co-written album and continue to work together.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\n2001 Ozone Friendly\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\n2020 Who's directing your Movie?\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n(VA) 1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n(Zoot Money) 1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n(Paul Williams) 1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n(Tony Kelly) 1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n(VA) 1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n(Patrick Campbell Lyons) 1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n(Bobby Harrison) 1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n(Alan Hull) 1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n(Mickey Jupp) 1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n(Joanna Carlin) 1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n(Gerry Rafferty) 1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1982 Madness, Money & Music (Sheena Easton)\n\n(Sheena Easton) 1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n(Bob Young) 1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n(Mike Oldfield) 1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n(Gary Glitter) 1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n(Paul Millns) 1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n(Mike D'Abo) 1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n(Sanne Salomonsen) 1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n(Jane Harrison) 1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n(Brian Knight) 1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n(John Spencer) 1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n(VA) 1992 Waiting in the Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n(Willy Finlayson and The Hurters) 1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n(Adam Faith) 1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n(Walter Trout) 1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n(Borderline) 1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n(Peter Smith) 1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n(Bernie Marsden) 1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n(Blue Thunder) 1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n(Jackie Lynton) 2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n(Jamie Marshall) 2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 2001 Another Hair of the Dog (VA)\n\n(VA) 2001 Tam de ti ye...

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2010 he has been working with Murray, guitarist Laurie Wisefield, drummer Harry James, singer Chris Ousey and keyboard player Michael Bramwell in Monsters of British Rock which has morphed into Snakecharmer with Adam Wakeman on keyboards.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also worked alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, PP Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner and Uriah Heep. For TV he has also accompanied such stars as Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Ben E. King and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).[1] A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene.[2] His media music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo Selecta, America's Next Top Model, How To Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Mad Men and Wife Swap USA.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and regularly attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed a band named The RoadRunners with several other local boys including Paul Rodgers (later to form Free and Bad Company), and later, Bruce Thomas, who would eventually play bass with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band were kept busy performing a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene so they took the decision to turn professional, change their name to the Wildflowers, and move to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without ever releasing any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur, John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had already split and gone their separate ways. At this point Moody joined Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound who, as well as proving to be a highly-polished Soul band, also acted as Gene Pitney's backing band for his UK tours as well as backing others, such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated Zoot Money before replacing Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy. As a member of Juicy Lucy, he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Micky co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with some down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums - SNAFU, Situation Normal, and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel session, the Old Grey Whistle Test and Supersonic and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue different ventures. Moody undertook occasional work as a session player before, during and after Snafu, most notably for Graham Bonnett. He also contributed to one track on City to City by Gerry Rafferty. Moody performed as an original member of Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist, Bob Young. The result was Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and guested with Hinkley's Heroes before hooking up with another friend from the North East, David Coverdale. Micky had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, but by this point Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. He invited Moody to assist and the result was the album White Snake released in 1977 which was followed by a second album Northwinds in 1978. Moody shared writing credits on four of the nine songs on Whitesnake (including the title track) and three of the eight songs featured on Northwinds. With the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston (replaced after a few months by Pete Solley) to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the EP Snakebite followed by two Studio albums: Trouble (also in 1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble, and was sole author of a fifth (the lively instrumental, Belgian Tom's Hat Trick). He contributed to three of the ten songs on Lovehunter, most notably the title track. While working with Whitesnake he found time to play slide guitar on several tracks on Roger Chapman's debut solo album, Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Andrew King Bernie Marsden (left) and Micky Moody; at Hammersmith Odeon, in 1981Courtesy: Andrew King\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on Ex-Lindisfarne Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, which spawned two UK single hits in the form of Fool for your Loving and the album title track; Moody co-wrote both tracks. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in that year. He also found time to write and record two singles with Bob Young. In 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Micky maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get It that year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. The band was put on hold for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, for the likes of Sheena Easton. By late 1982 Whitesnake were back, (with Mel Galley replacing Marsden), and a re-juvinated Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. Going into 1983, Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. However Micky was not particularly happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody persevered with recording the Slide It In album (which he describes as an 'unhappy experience' ) before quitting the band in 1983 at the end of a tour.[1] Moody went back to session work with a series of artists including Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo, and Roger Chapman as well as selected TV work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with ex-Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language Of Rock And Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring ex-Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with the their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with his erstwhile Whitesnake guitarist-in-crime, Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band, concentrating mostly on the British and western European markets. Featured in various line-ups were drummers Zak Starkey, Terry Williams, John Trotter, Henry Spinetti and Dave Dowle; bass players Jaz Lochrie, Pete Stroud, Steve Price, Neil Murray and David Levy, and keyboard players Don Ariey and Josh Phillips. Guests in the studio included harmonica player Mark Feltham, keyboard player Volker 'Wolfman' Kunschner, brass players Nick Pentelow, Frank Mead and Martin Drover, and backing singers Monica Reed-Price and Mick Lister. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back On the Blues and Live In Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Alvin Lee, Eric Burdon, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set, Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced media music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company Of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[6] to arrange and record a selection of classic Chicago blues tracks in a mostly 'unplugged' fashion; the result was Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional gigs in a duo format with bluesman Papa George, and continues to do so. The next 'Snake' metamorphosis was into M3 Classic Whitesnake, and although ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin was in the starting line-up, Stefan Berggren was soon back in the frontman's spot. M3 released a live CD featuring Martin, and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Richie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were ex-Paul Rodgers Band, Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time, Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German superstar Westernhagen, which eventually topped the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me in tandem with the autobiographical Playing with Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, the latter recounting his early days in the music business, mostly in the company of Paul Rodgers. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums.

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. More recently, he has toured and recorded with Snakecharmer.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P. Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mark King, Alfie Boe, Sandi Thom, Brian Auger, Paul Weller, Eric Bibb, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Mud Morganfield and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009). A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene. His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with several others from the smae area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were joined some time later by bass player Bruce Thomas, who moved onto play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated keybopard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guste with with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, upto this time Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two Studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a stellar line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray. He also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the Sunflower Jam house band and the Bad Apples.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 Snafu\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\n1978 Snakebite\n\n1978 Trouble\n\n1978 Live at Hammersmith\n\n1979 Lovehunter\n\n1980 Ready an' Willing\n\n1980 Live...in the Heart of the City\n\n1981 Come an' Get It\n\n1982 Saints & Sinners\n\n1984 Slide It In (UK version)\n\n(UK version) 1994 Greatest Hits\n\n2003 Best of Whitesnake\n\n2003 The Silver Anniversary Collection\n\n2004 The Early Years\n\n2008 30th Anniversary Collection\n\n2011 Box of Snakes\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\n2016 Black & Chrome (with Ali Maas)\n\nGuest appearances"}, {"url": "https://www.wikilogy.com/biography/micky-moody/", "page_content": "Micky Moody is an English musician, best known as a guitarist.

He says: \"I went to school with Paul Rodgers and we've known each other since we were ten. We were in the same class at school, St Thomas' Secondary Modern, and I started guitar lessons in 1963 having realised that I wasn't going to be playing professionally for Middlesbrough, though I think they could do with me now as a goalscorer.\"\n\nHis experiences up to the 1980s adventures with Whitesnake have been captured in his book Playing With Trumpets... A Rock n Roll Apprenticeship, which has just been released. The book tells how Moody escaped from the prospects of a steelworks apprenticeship on a rollercoaster ride to fame.\n\nIn 1964, he began rehearsing with mates and, by 1965, he, Rogers and Colin Bradley formed a band. There were so many gigs then and the trio were so young that Moody admits: \"We weren't the best in the area but people said 'you're only bairns' and encouraged us.\"\n\nRodgers developed from bass player into the lead vocalist and Bruce Thomas from Eaglescliffe (who went on to become one of Elvis Costello's Attractions) took over on bass. The band, now called The Wildflowers, headed for London.\n\n\"At the time I'd met David Coverdale and Chris Rea who were both Teessiders with Blues roots. We'd started off doing covers of the beat groups like the Beatles, the Stones and the Kinks and discovered blues through Chuck Berry and by the time we reached 16 we were pretty mature and had outgrown the Middlesbrough area. We'd get pretty wild on stage, particularly when you're playing St Patrick's Youth Club in Thornaby, and we'd do mad things like setting fire to an industrial sock that I'd got from my dad who worked at ICI. That was our idea of surrealism. That didn't go too well with the local promoters,\" he says.\n\n\"We were very ambitious, we didn't know we were going to succeed but we didn't think of anything else so we didn't have that negative attitude in our minds,\" adds Moody who recalls that the four-piece lasted most of 1967 in London surviving in a flat and touring.\n\nHaving gone back to the North-East for some classical guitar training, he couldn't resist an offer to join a band called Tramline, which recorded two albums for the famous Island record label.\n\nMoody has lived in Twickenham, London, for many years now and been in \"the softy south since the late sixties. My kids were born down here and my wife's from Twickenham and I've lived down here for 37 years now\".\n\n\"I was back in Middlesbrough two weeks ago for a bit of a sad occasion. In my book I talk about Road Runners and the guy who really put us on the road was called Joe Bradley, the older brother of Colin, and he was our mentor who sadly died three weeks ago. Colin and Dave were at the funeral.\" The guitarist also managed to get news of Joe's illness to Paul Rodgers and the singer dedicated his Newcastle City Hall show to Joe just days before his death.\n\nMoody recently saw Paul Rodgers with his band at the Albert Hall and comments: \"He tours all the time and lives that life still whereas I don't and I pick and choose a bit now. But I think you have to set your sights pretty high because it's not an easy business and very competitive. If you don't set your sights high you really will be swallowed up pretty quickly.\"\n\nThere is obviously an opening for a follow-up book covering Moody's Whitesnake days\n\n\"Initially I met David (Coverdale) back in 1968 because he's from Redcar and we used to hang around a coffee bar called the Purple Onion in Middlesbrough when he was an art student and I was a professional musician. He blossomed into a name with various bands and had been on TV, including Opportunity Knocks, then I got a call in 1974 saying he'd joined Deep Purple,\" says Moody. A few months later he took part in Coverdale's send-off event by ex-Teessiders in London as the performer prepared to go to the US.\n\nA few years later Moody was playing in Munich with the band Snafu when Coverdale approached him about session work which led to the creation of Whitesnake in 1977-78.\n\n\"I was quite surprised I was the only guitarist because I wasn't known as hard rock player but the rest is history,\" said the slide guitar player who enjoyed the camaraderie up to 1981, explaining: \"We were party animals to the point where the music was becoming secondary. It's every bloke's dream to be in a top rock band and I thought 'well I'm here so I'm going to go for it'.\"\n\nMoody returned for more in 1983 but halted his association feeling \"drained from head to toe, partly due to self-indulgence, but didn't enjoy it any more\".\n\nNow he performs regularly at festivals with M3 Classic Whitesnake - involving ex-Whitesnake colleagues Bernie Marsden and Neil Murray - and he's just released a new album called Don't Blame Me.\n\n\"Things take their course and nothing lasts forever. I had a few good years with Whitesnake and I treasure them. I wouldn't have missed it for anything,\" he says.\n\n* Playing With Trumpets...

Here We Go (gathering nuts) Again Following in the tiny footsteps of manufactured band Brown Noser, a new 'supergroup' is about to hit the flacid rollercoaster of rehashed rock. The members of 'Shabby!' forged their alliance at a daycare centre in Leighton Buzzard where they were all queueing up in the hope of some denture-friendly soft food. There was an immediate feeling of empathy between them - a meeting of empty heads. Coincidentally dropping in that day in the hope of a sausage was Baron Von Shitenhausen, a universally detested chancer with a masters degree in talking utter bollocks. They were a perfect match and Shabby! was cleverly formulated. Shitenhausen's masterplan dictated that they played everybody else's music, because this had never been done before. Oh wait....yes it had! Loads of times! A deal was arranged with Flake Records in Albania and their debut album 'Scraping The Bottom Of The Barrel With A Blunt Spoon' will soon be on release exclusively in Help The Aged charity shops. If you want to avoid seeing them live, you can't. And you never know, next week the same grimacing faces may be appearing in a different line up near you. We're all doomed!!\n\n***\n\nThe Scronge Chronicles\n\nThe virtuoso kazoo player, Davina Skronge, has published a book dealing with survival in the cut-throat world of pop music. She states that there are two fundamental choices: be honest, hard-working and kind to your fellow man, or be two-faced, devious, and wear suspect underwear. The music business is, of course, rife with individuals who suffer from 'crotchet blindness', a condition linked to the inability to read music whilst chain smoking. This fact was discovered at an animal-testing laboratory back in the 1970's, when hamsters who had cigarette smoke constantly pumped into their cages found it impossible to continue their enforced studies of the bouzouki and had to resort to impersonating Tom Waites. On discovering the plight of the unfortunate hamsters, Skronge led a crusade to eliminate this practice, and eventually won a court order which stipulated that bouzoukis must never again be a requisite to the line dancing habits of rodents. They are now equipped with tenor banjos.\n\nDavina is a tenacious individual who is determined to get to the truth at all costs, and because of this, her personal life has suffered. Her husband is the renowned pervert Winston Skronge, son of the Danish uilleann pipes player Paddy O' Pedersen, famous for his reels (no, not the traditional Celtic dance tunes, but those things you attach to fishing rods). He himself has published a book on the respiratory habits of both carp and flautists, and cites Piscean breathing techniques as the main cause of flatulence in clarinet-playing bream. Because of his wife's obsession with the risqu\u00e9 lifestyles of certain rock gods, and the time spend pursuing her investigative goals, he has now distanced himself from her thongs and has resorted to varnishing rush matting during Lent.\n\nTo gain access to many of the backstage gatherings and agents seminars, Davina took on the guise of a cultured, loyal drummer to demonstrate the true meaning of non-existent. It worked. On another occasion she walked in unexpectedly on a well-known rock star who was engrossed in a game of Scrabble with three young models. Although deeply shocked by such an image, but well aware of the scoop she could make, she threw caution to the wind and joined in, throwing off her scarf in the process. Undeterred by the unwelcoming stares of the three ladies in question (and conscious of the old adage that three's company, four's a crowd) she stayed just long enough to spell out a winning VACUOUS before taking her leave. Seven-letter words were an unknown quantity in this circle, though one of the flaxen-haired numskulls had once triumphed with DUM.\n\nOur intrepid queen of the kazoo took even more risks by infiltrating various haunts known to turn a blind eye to the underhand and often shifty behaviour of certain booking agents (bukin eid\u04e1(\u04d9)nts). She has written a no-holds account of her experiences in the company of dubious individuals, and as a fitting climax to her book, spent over two hours in the company of a tie pin before presenting herself as a retarded saxophonist from Leeds. Some of the agents bought it, some didn't. It'll probably be the same for her book, The Human Wellington, available from that pie stall near Whitby Abbey.\n\n***\n\nBrown Noser - Latest News! Brown Noser, the well-known musical collective, have finally announced plans to release the follow-up to their debut album,'He Who Smelt It Dealt It', with the mildly anticipated 'Come And Flog It'. The album cover artwork features a dead horse and finely air-brushed images of the band members, making them look at least twenty years younger than they actually were twenty years ago. As singer Barry Loser says: \"If it's good enough for Beyonce and Judith Chalmers, it's good enough for us.\" With one hand poised delicately on his feminine hip, you can tell he's been feeling the burn in the gym. Band leader Craig Tyredan-Jaided adds that \"Looking good is an important counter-balance for throwing shapes and rock riffs, and can compensate for the cliches that inevitably befall one.\" Barry Loser, as well as churning out the vocals, is also the band's hairdresser, agent, tour manager and accountant. He stresses that live performances are pivotal to success; \"There's always a few shreiks of ecstasy when guitarist Twanging Flea strips down to his string vest. And even some of the girls raise their eyebrows!\" According to their manager, the stand-out tracks are: Looks Like A Prat; Quest For A Vest Out West; Denial In Space and Shame I've Got The Runs. A former band member obviously disagrees with the democratic views expressed by the members of Brown Noser, and when approached said simply, \"Bollocks to all that Marxist crap.\" *****\n\nThe Rockfield Incident Little is known about the Rockfield Incident of 1979 when three crackpots disappeared into thin air. After years of unsurpassed disinterest, here is the truth: Patrick O'Williams was born in a Welsh mining village in Belgium, and grew up into something of an oddball who refused to touch cloves and read MFI instruction manuals. He often slept in a shoe repairer's apron and once swore at a dehumidifier. By the age of twelve he claimed to have read only one book - The Kraken Wakes - more than eleven thousand times. When he was sixteen he married a local milkmaid called Glumbirth, and they moved to Rockfield in Monmouthshire to breed narwhals. After a few days, Glumbirth began to show signs of deep psychological problems, and moved into a miniaturized kiln at the bottom of the garden, only venturing outdoors when Radio Luxemburg had closed down for the night. Patrick responded by studying the behavioural patterns of victims of Stockholm Syndrome before breaking the legs off an occasional table. Fortunately, such idiosyncrasies had little effect on their ability to coat sand flies in icing sugar. Every Thursday afternoon they mentored 'Little Bobby' Jenkins, a child glass-blower from Rhyl, in the realization of nonsense. 'Little Bobby' was also a prodigious talent who could hypnotise piglets, advise curlews on tax breaks and count to two in Romansch. He also had an unhealthy obsession towards a game he played with a Pinocchio puppet and a partially-clothed Action Man. When the headmaster at St. Darren's School was required to give him a character reference he described him as \"pointless.\" One rainy Monday evening they were abducted by Disraelians, a race of extra-terrestrials who, along with the Gladstonites, based their entire raison d'etre on the policies of former Victorian Prime Ministers.\n\n***\n\nI recently worked with a vertically challenged guitarist who was very superstitious. He always avoided walking under a black cat. Also, he was very careful with his money and had an annoying habit of giving a tramp 20 pence then asking for a receipt.\n\n***\n\nAlthough I don't subscribe to Facebook, I have no real issues with the service. In fact, I do indulge in the occasional vicarious peek myself! However, I'm quite concerned with this obsession for selfies and, in some cases, preoccupation with their own mugs. Is it because nobody else wants to take a picture of them? Or is it because they think they might be the only people in the world who've had a glass of wine or some food? I know somebody who is so large he has to tie broom handles together to make the selfie stick long enough to get the shot. He still can't get his arse in though!\n\n***\n\nRecently, en route to London, I made a late night stop at the Watford Gap service station on the M1 motorway. How times have changed! Years ago, when bands were traversing the country doing 'one nighters', the place to stop on the way home after a gig was the Blue Boar (as it was then known) at Watford Gap, near Rugby, about 75 miles north of London. You would meet fellow musicians who you'd never see back home in London yet could bump into on a regular basis in this oasis of welcome refreshment. The only other place I can think of where you could have a good natter with your own kind was the Speakeasy Club in London's West End. At the Blue Boar it would have been no surprise to see Steve Winwood chatting to one of Pink Floyd, or a couple of The Hollies enjoying a fry up with members of The Who. I only stopped to use the loo the other night, but I just had to take a peek inside the almost deserted restaurant. I didn't hang about. There were too many ghosts.\n\n***\n\nTwo Days In The Museum\n\nTeddy Driscoll had one passion in life: vintage cars, especially German models from the 1930's. So it was indeed a special thrill when he learned that a 1937 Mercedes Benz 540K was to be exhibited at a nearby museum. When the big day arrived he was first in line to sit in the driving seat of such a wonderful feat of engineering. He sank into the plush leather, held the wheel, and was smiling contentedly when some strange impulse prevailed upon him to press the horn. But there was no sound, just a weird grinding noise and a peculiar coloured mist which surrounded him. Suddenly, he found himself alone in a Mexican style restaurant holding a newspaper, of which the text appeared to be in German. He looked at the date: 1937. Just then, a large man dressed in a black suit appeared at his side. ' I am ze manager Erich von Tabasco. Are you Muslim, Hindu or Hebrew?' he asked. ' No, I'm a Christian,' Teddy answered. 'Prove it,' he demanded. Teddy reached into his chest and pulled out his soul. 'Look,' he remonstrated. ' It bears the original sin.' ' There's nothing original about sin. It's been around for years,' retorted von Tabasco. 'Say three chapters of Mein Kampf and eat a jar of Jalepenos.' Before Teddy could react, the sound of the car horn heralded the face of the museum manager. ' Please don't press that, it alarms the pigeons on the roof,' he said. A peculiar coloured mist faded into the distance along with the faint whiff of Burritos. * There's one good thing about retiring - you get to strike 'To Do's' off your bucket list. Ivor Miles had been determined to trace his family tree for years but there was always something that had to be done. Now there were no excuses, and over a pint in his local he decided that as far as the past was concerned, there was no time like the present. The following day, Ivor visited the municipal museum to study local street maps from the 1880's, a line of enquiry based on his grandfather's boyhood recollections. As he approached the Department of Ancestral Records, he heard murmers of excitement coming from a nearby room, inspiring him to investigate. A small crowd was gathered around a vintage German car whilst an officious man was trying to get them to form an orderly queue: 'Please, we will allow you to sit in the car, but DO NOT sound the horn as this disturbs the pigeons on the roof.' Ivor stared at the jobsworth with a resentment born out of a lifetime of distain for authority. He'd once tipped a tin of blue gloss paint over his neighbour's driveway after a dispute over land rights. Don't mess with Ivor! Before the official could say \"It's more than my job's worth\", Ivor had opened the drivers side door, slid into the leather seat, and with a two-fingered salute sounded the horn. All of a sudden there was a grinding sound, followed by a kaleidoscopic miasma of blue and violet hues and he found himself on an industrial estate in a run-down Berlin neighbourhood. He was confused\u2026from a museum to a music room full of long haired American session musicians. A large sign on the wall spelled out 'Willkommen Malcolm 'Midtown' Witherspoon and his band'. Ivor's taste in music ran more to Frank Sinatra than Frank Zappa, so when the band struck up with a distorted guitar intro, he was momentarily taken aback. To the right of 'Midtown' stood a guitar player who\u2019s greying bouffant was reminiscent of the Elephant Man's head. One look at his jackal-eyed expression told Ivor that he was a moron. \u2018Lets do this doughnut before my limited cerebral capabilities turn to pig shit,' drawled the Elephant Man's head. \u2018 Well the last thing we need is a pig shit doughnut,' responded Ivor. 'Might I suggest a cup of tea and a scone? \u2019 \u2018Hot damn,' snapped the redneck. 'Who is this limey? This ain\u2019t what I expected from Tinder.' 'Really? I thought you session guys would pork anything with a pulse,' a German monitor engineer mumbled under his breath. Before Ivor could comment, the face of the museum manager appeared through the windscreen of the car. 'That's the second time in two days I've had to tell some idiot not to press the horn. It frightens the bloody pigeons on the roof.' Ivor was nonplussed, but at the same time was relieved to be back. The last thing he needed was an encounter with a dodgy wolf-eyed pervert from the deep south of America who probably had crabs.\n\n***\n\n.... 1973.

Afterwards we had a couple of pints before returning home together. It was mid-December and as we dropped off the bass player, the Rotary Club's Christmas sleigh was making it's annual door to door collection, blasting out pop music to ensure that the whole neighbourhood was aware of their presence. Suddenly the strains of 'Rocking Around The Christmas Tree' by Mel Smith and Kim Wilde (Mel and Kim) came blaring from the sleigh's speaker. I mentioned to drummer Chris Hunt that I had played guitar on this particular track. Obviously quite impressed by this piece of information, he decided to leap out of the car and share it with Father Christmas while his little helpers went from door to door collecting donations. 'Hey! My mate in the car there played guitar on this record!'. Father Christmas, unimpressed by the rantings of an obvious drunkard, remained silent. 'Oi! I'm talking to you! My mate played on this record and he's sitting in that car there!' 'Fuck off', said Father Christmas. Somewhat hurt by this response, Chris returned to the car. 'Father Christmas told me to fuck off!' And that, children, ends our lesson for today. Merry Christmas!\n\n< Give Granddads A Chance It's a wonderful thing to honour one's kin, but I think that too many lyricists give far too much creedence to their grandmothers. Just listen to the chorus of 'Kiss Him Goodbye' to experience a typical example of asinine progeny pulp: Nana Nana Nana Nana, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye. Other matriarchal homages include 'Land Of A Thousand Dancers', with the ultimate choral accolade to our foremothers: Na, nana na na, nana na na nana na nana na, nana nana. There are, of course, many more, including 'Getting Jiggy With Me', 'Hey Jude' and 'S&M' but do I need to spell it out? Na nana, I don't think so. So come on writers, how about giving granddads a pat on the back for a change. Let's face it, you wouldn't be here without them. *Lyrics reproduced by kind permission of the Mindless Numbnuts Society\n\n***"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/mick-moody", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMick Moody was born on 30 August, 1950 in Middlesbrough, United Kingdom.
