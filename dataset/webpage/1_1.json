Meath, and his wife Margaret, third daughter of Matthew Plunkett, 5th Lord Louth. Employed to recruit soldiers in Munster, and proving unsuccessful, he distinguished himself c.1676 when he and his brother Gerald, at their own expense, recruited and transported 160 soldiers to Holland to fight against the French. Under the patronage of the duke of Buckingham (1628\u201378), he entered the navy as a lieutenant (1678), was promoted captain (1679), and served in the Mediterranean.\n\nIt was probably while serving in Holland that he gained his admiration for William of Orange (qv), which inspired him to join the revolution of 1688 and become involved in intrigues and negotiations to secure the loyalty of the English fleet for William, for whom he acted as envoy. After the battles of Beachy Head (1690) and La Hogue (1693), he was promoted rear-admiral (1693) and vice-admiral (1693). As commander of the navy (1694\u20131702) he skilfully concluded treaties with the regencies of Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers in 1698. The following year, for reasons not entirely clear, he was superseded as vice-admiral and retired from active service; he was made governor of Deal castle and remained a commissioner of the navy till 1702.\n\nHe entered parliament on the admiralty interest, representing first Portsmouth (1695) then Dover (1697\u20131713, 1715\u201318, 1720). A dedicated whig \u2013 described by Jonathan Swift (qv) as \u2018a virulent party man, born in Ireland\u2019 (Sedgewick, 426) \u2013 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet (1709\u201311). With the return of the whigs to power, he was appointed admiral and commander-in-chief of the fleet (1714\u201318), ranger of Greenwich Park, and governor of the Royal Hospital of Greenwich, London (1714), where he founded the hospital school for sons of seamen. Serving as lord of the admiralty (1717\u201318) \u2013 he was succeeded on the admiralty board by his son-in-law, Sir John Norris (1671\u20131749) \u2013 he was appointed a rear-admiral of Great Britain (1717\u201320) and created baron of Balrath in 1718. He died 18 August 1720 in Queen's House, Greenwich, and is buried in Greenwich church.\n\nHe married (c.1677) Sarah Ellis (d. 1710); they had one son \u2013 Henry, 2nd baron \u2013 and three daughters.

Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of captain; and he appears to have served almost constantly, during the next ten years, on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean. In October 1688 he was appointed captain of the Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delavall who commanded the blue squadron; and in 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, was one of the seconds of the commander-in-chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral, and to that of vice-admiral in the following year, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean. After the peace of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as commander-in-chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers; which he happily accomplished, and returned home towards the end of the next year. In November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the commissioners of the navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in parliament as baron or member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured; the rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the \u200bhaziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711. He held no further command till the accession of George I, when he was again appointed commander-in-chief, ranger of Greenwich Park, and governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death; and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which, from small beginnings, has been gradually developed into the magnificent institution of the present day. In April 1717 he became one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was advanced to be rear-admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage as Lord Aylmer of Balrath. He died 18 Aug. 1720.\n\nA portrait, half-length, presented by his descendant, the fifth Lord Aylmer, is in the Painted Hall at Greenwich.\n\n[Charnock's Biog. Nav. ii. 35; Brit. Mus. MSS.

He became a lieutenant in 1791 and a captain in 1794. In 1798 he participated in an abortive British raid on Ostend (Belgium), was captured, and spent six months in a French prison. He won high praise from his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Brock*, for his role in the battle of Egmont-op-Zee (more properly Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands) in 1799. Two years later he rose to the rank of major in the 85th Foot, and in 1802 to lieutenant-colonel; however, he was then placed on half pay until June 1803 when he joined the Coldstream Foot Guards. On 25 July 1810 he became a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the king and on 4 June 1813 a major-general. He served as the assistant \u2013 and then from January 1812 as the deputy \u2013 adjutant general to Lord Wellington\u2019s army and commanded a brigade in several major battles of the Peninsular War, during which he was awarded the Military Cross with one clasp. He was given a kcb on 2 Jan. 1815 and knighted on 6 June. In 1814 he had been appointed adjutant general of the British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. From 1823 to 1830 he was without employment and spent much of his time wandering across Switzerland and Italy. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825 and that year, upon the death of his uncle, the Earl of Whitworth, he changed his family name to Whitworth-Aylmer. He was made colonel of the 56th Foot in 1827 and transferred to the 18th Foot five years later.\n\nAylmer\u2019s enforced idleness ended when Sir James Kempt* resigned the administration of Lower Canada. In June 1830 the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir George Murray, who had also served with Wellington in the Peninsular War, offered the position to Aylmer. On 11 August Aylmer was appointed commander of the forces in North America, and on 13 October he landed at Quebec; he assumed control of the administration one week later. His commission as governor-in-chief was dated 24 Nov. 1830, but it was not formally registered at Quebec until 12 Feb. 1831. Aylmer had few obvious qualifications for his position; he had never served as a civil administrator, he had no political experience, and he came to Lower Canada, by his own admission, \u201ca perfect stranger to all that relates to the country.\u201d Yet Murray\u2019s choice was based on more than friendship. Aylmer was one of the more distinguished and capable officers of his rank, he was a francophile, and, as Louis-Joseph Papineau* noted, he spoke French \u201cwith the greatest ease and elegance.\u201d Although leaning to the conservative side in British politics, he was not a partisan, and the reformers in the Canadas, reassured by their contacts in Britain, received him as \u201can able and clever man conciliatory in his disposition, liberal in his principles, and cincerely [sic] anxious to do good.\u201d\n\nRecognizing his lack of knowledge, Aylmer none the less predicted that he would soon \u201cbe out of the Awkward Squad.\u201d He embarked on a series of tours which eventually took him to every part of Lower Canada, and he pronounced himself pleased with \u201cthe country, the people and the Climate.\u201d He and Lady Aylmer took their viceregal responsibilities seriously, contributing generously to a variety of causes, such as an emigrant fund, the Female Orphan Asylum, and the Quebec Driving Club (one of a number of organizations of which Lady Aylmer became patroness). They sought to foster the arts and culture, and attended many community activities, from ploughing matches to annual races in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res where Aylmer donated a silver cup to be awarded for a horse bred within the province. A wealthy man, Aylmer entertained frequently and lavishly at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Louis, the governor\u2019s residence; yet he avoided the error \u201cinto which most of our Governors have fallen . . . ,\u201d noted the Montreal reform newspaper, the Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser, \u201cof attempting to impress on the minds of the \u2018natives\u2019 a something transatlantically superior pertaining to themselves.\u201d During a visit to the Indian reserve at Lac des Deux Montagnes he joined in the dancing when \u201cobliged\u201d to do so.\n\nAylmer wished particularly to convince French Canadians of his benevolence. Shortly after his arrival he donated money for a tablet over the spot \u201cwhere lay the remains of brave Montcalm [Louis-Joseph de Montcalm*].\u201d He disagreed vehemently with those who advocated a policy of assimilation, arguing that there were not British subjects \u201cmore loyal and true \u2013 than the People of Lower Canada\u201d and that assimilation would weaken their loyalty and drive them into the arms of the United States. He defended the seigneurial system and sought permission to grant seigneurial lands under crown control to French Canadians who could not afford to purchase on freehold tenure. He exhibited a genuine desire to distribute government patronage with the utmost impartiality, reintegrating militia officers whom a predecessor, Lord Dalhousie [Ramsay], had dismissed for opposition to the administration, increasing the number of French Canadians on the bench, ensuring a balance between francophones and anglophones on the commission of the peace, and making 8 of his first 14 appointees to the Legislative Council French Canadians. In 1831, to prove that he was \u201cfree of all party connections,\u201d he offered seats on the Executive Council to Patriote leaders Papineau and John Neilson. Although both refused, Aylmer successively appointed the francophone reform members of the House of Assembly Philippe Panet*, Dominique Mondelet*, and Hugues Heney. Undeniably, he did not go far enough; the Legislative and Executive councils and the high echelons of the civil service continued to be dominated by anglophones unsympathetic to the demands of the assembly. None the less, he went as far as, and at times farther than, his superiors in London wanted and, at least initially, he convinced Papineau that \u201che likes and desires the good of the province.\u201d\n\nThe legislature met for the first time under Aylmer in January 1831 when, labouring under \u201ca severe indisposition,\u201d he delivered his speech from the throne \u201cliterally from my bed.\u201d Throughout the session he worked diligently to remedy the grievances of the assembly, many of which, he admitted, were \u201cwell founded.\u201d He introduced economies in the civil service, presented nearly all the executive documents requested by the assembly, protested to the British government delays in examining reserved colonial legislation, refused to bend regulations for interested parties, demanded more rigorous standards in accounting for public funds, launched an investigation of abuses in the land-grant system, and induced the judges (with the exception of Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell) not to attend the Legislative Council while the Colonial Office deliberated on a long-standing demand for their exclusion from that body. In proroguing the legislature in March, he enquired for \u201cany stray complaint\u201d which the assembly had neglected.\n\nAylmer\u2019s most controversial effort to appease came after the assembly petitioned for the dismissal of Attorney General James Stuart*, an outspoken opponent of the Patriote party, at the end of the session. Under pressure from the assembly, in September Aylmer suspended Stuart pending adjudication of its charges in Britain. Reprimanded by the Colonial Office for suspending Stuart before he was given the opportunity to defend himself in the assembly, Aylmer rightly pointed out that not to have acted would have provoked \u201cthe utmost degree of ferment and agitation.\u201d In November 1832 the Colonial Office dismissed Stuart, who unsuccessfully challenged Aylmer to a duel. He was hailed as a martyr by those among the British minority in the colony who believed that Aylmer \u201cdare not displease Mr. Citoyen Papineau by whom . . . he is held completely under cow.\u201d Aylmer\u2019s decision had enhanced his reputation with the reformers, however, and particularly with Papineau, who had earlier entertained the Aylmers at his country estate in June 1831. But though \u201con good (I may say cordial) terms\u201d with Papineau, Aylmer was aware that a great gulf existed between them on a number of questions.\n\nFor more than a decade the main preoccupation of the assembly had been to obtain control of the provincial revenues, including those reserved to the crown by the Quebec Revenue Act of 1774 [see Sir Francis Nathaniel Burton*]. Murray\u2019s Whig successor at the Colonial Office, Lord Goderich, instructed Aylmer to submit a pared-down list of estimates to the assembly and to request a permanent civil list preparatory to a surrender of the crown revenues. The assembly paid little attention to Goderich\u2019s estimates and none to his request for a civil list, although it did vote supplies for one year. Ignoring Aylmer\u2019s advice to the contrary and influenced by his parliamentary under-secretary, Lord Howick, Goderich introduced a bill into parliament in the summer of 1831 surrendering the crown revenues unconditionally, and in September he ordered Aylmer to reconvene the legislature and again request a comparatively modest civil list. The assembly, however, refused salaries to several officials on Goderich\u2019s list and, when Aylmer foolishly tried to coerce it by hinting that he would reserve any bill deviating from Goderich\u2019s intentions, it refused permanent salaries to any officials. It seems unlikely that Goderich\u2019s proposals, which were rejected by 42 to 9, would have been accepted by the assembly even had Aylmer been more astute, and the disappointed governor closed the session in late February 1832, acknowledging that his friendly relations with the leaders of the Patriote party had been sorely strained.\n\nIn 1832 deterioration of those relations accelerated after three French-speaking Canadians were shot by British troops on 21 May during a turbulent by-election in Montreal [see Daniel Tracey*]. Aylmer\u2019s sympathies lay with the soldiers, and although he wrote to Papineau regretting the deaths, he refused to intervene in the subsequent judicial process, even when Papineau requested a military inquiry. He encouraged Solicitor General Charles Richard Ogden* to bring the case before a grand jury but later publicly praised the jury\u2019s exoneration of the military. Thereafter Papineau pointedly declined to attend receptions at the Ch\u00e2teau.\n\nThe anger of the Patriote party was fuelled by a cholera epidemic which in 1832 killed more than 7,000 people in the colony. Aylmer had prepared for the outbreak by persuading the legislature to establish a quarantine station at Grosse \u00cele and a board of health at Quebec and to authorize such facilities elsewhere when necessary. Although Aylmer conscientiously enforced the quarantine regulations and issued money to the boards of health and the Montreal Emigrant Society, the measures proved wholly inadequate. Moreover, by insisting that only the law officers of the crown should prosecute he hindered the work of the boards, and by encouraging flight to reduce the incidence of cholera in the cities he contributed to the spread of the disease. Yet, on balance, he did not deserve the censure of the assembly, which also criticized him for issuing funds without its approval and for failing to control the influx of immigrants. In fact, Aylmer did wish to limit immigration and proposed to raise money by a tax on immigrants. When the assembly met in November 1832, it was in an angry mood; it declared Mondelet\u2019s seat vacant on his appointment to the Executive Council, passed a supply bill making no provision for a civil list, which the Legislative Council felt compelled to reject, and adopted an address, similar to one it had itself rejected in the previous session, demanding an elective legislative council.\n\nTo Aylmer these actions demonstrated intransigence, and he requested authorization from London to use the unappropriated funds surrendered to the legislature by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act of 1831. Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, later Lord Stanley, who replaced Goderich at the Colonial Office in April 1833, sympathized but would not act until the assembly had been given an opportunity to reconsider. Consequently, when Aylmer reconvened the legislature in January 1834 he virtually invited a confrontation. He refused to grant the assembly contingency funds of \u00a37,000 and reserved 11 of the 12 bills passed by the legislature, disallowing the 12th. In return the assembly refused to vote supplies and passed 92 resolutions of grievance, including one demanding the governor\u2019s recall. Asserting that the resolutions were tantamount to a \u201cDeclaration of Independence,\u201d Aylmer sent to Stanley a draft bill restoring to the government control over the revenues surrendered to the assembly by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act. Stanley was prepared to rescind Goderich\u2019s act, and he referred the 92 resolutions to a select committee of the House of Commons, which he assumed would exonerate Aylmer. But Stanley was replaced in June 1834 by Thomas Spring-Rice, an easy-going Irish Whig, who was determined to avoid confrontation. Spring-Rice persuaded the Commons committee to attribute the conflict in Lower Canada simply to \u201cmutual misconceptions.\u201d After meeting with delegates from the assembly, he authorized Aylmer in September to borrow \u00a331,000 from the military chest for unpaid salaries, assuming (erroneously) that the assembly would agree to repay the loan. Aylmer was dismayed by Spring-Rice\u2019s actions and by the failure of the select committee to vindicate his conduct.\n\nIronically, Aylmer had led the Colonial Office to adopt a more conciliatory policy by insisting that the radicals in the assembly were losing support. During the sessions of 1833 and 1834 a rift had developed within the Patriote party, and Aylmer sought to exploit it, in particular by cultivating the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposed the policies of the radicals. Although a devout member of the Church of England, Aylmer was unusually tolerant in his religious views, wishing, for example, to alter the oath taken by justices of the peace so that he could appoint Jewish magistrates [see Aaron Ezekiel Hart*]. He attended mass in the Roman Catholic cathedral as well as in his own, refused to go to the services of a local Anglican priest who had protested Aylmer\u2019s giving pecuniary aid to the Catholic Church, offered the Ursulines of Quebec refuge in the Ch\u00e2teau when a fire broke out in their convent, recommended that the Roman Catholic bishop be appointed to the Executive Council, and discouraged the Colonial Office from interfering with the Sulpician estates. In addition to cultivating the church, Aylmer deliberately chose his nominees for government posts from among the more conservative and \u201crespectable\u201d members of the Patriote party.\n\nAylmer\u2019s appointments, however, had the effect of weakening the moderates in the assembly, since appointees lost their seats. In any case Aylmer was himself an inadequate instrument for multiplying vendus. Progressively disenchanted with what he considered to be the ignorance and ingratitude of French Canadians, he had begun by September 1832 to argue that \u201cBritish influence in Lower Canada . . . must ere long be paramount\u201d and that French Canadians must \u201cfinally reconcile themselves to a fate which cannot be averted.\u201d In October he warned Sir John Colborne*, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, that \u201cwhen the king\u2019s Subjects are spoken of as Foreigners and the Canadians as a Nation held in subjection by another Nation, it becomes the constituted Authorities to be upon their Guard.\u201d By the spring of 1834 he was convinced that so long as the assembly was composed largely of French Canadians \u201cthe Constitution of the Province . . . will never work beneficially.\u201d After the passage of the 92 Resolutions his primary concern was to reconcile the American-born population in the Eastern Townships and the rapidly growing Irish communities in Montreal and Quebec by appointing representatives from both groups to positions of importance. In June 1835 he strongly endorsed the application of \u201can association of gentlemen\u201d from the townships for permission to purchase a large quantity of land on terms similar to those given to the British American Land Company [see Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt*], despite vehement opposition from the assembly.\n\nGradually, in fact, Aylmer had come under the influence of the old official group. In April 1834 he appointed David Chisholme, one of Dalhousie\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, coroner of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. When John Fletcher was unable to accept a promotion on the bench suggested as recompense for \u201cthe persecution of the House of Assembly to which he has been exposed for a series of years,\u201d Aylmer recommended Samuel Gale*, who had acted as Dalhousie\u2019s agent in England in 1828 and served as counsel to the officers in command during the Montreal \u201cmassacre.\u201d This recommendation encountered strong opposition at the Colonial Office but was accepted under pressure from Aylmer on condition that the next vacancy would be given to a French Canadian.\n\nGale\u2019s appointment alienated many moderates on both sides. Aylmer added to his unpopularity by refusing money to Montreal during a second outbreak of cholera in 1834 and by retreating to the governor\u2019s cottage at William Henry (Sorel) during the height of the outbreak. Late that year the radicals won a sweeping victory at the polls, virtually eliminating the moderates from the assembly. Aylmer was not displeased with this result, arguing that it had \u201croused a feeling (hitherto dormant) in the British Population,\u201d which might, however, \u201clead to very serious results, unless prudently managed.\u201d He enthusiastically approved the formation of militant constitutional associations at Quebec and Montreal, and warned that the British minority were no longer prepared to accept domination by the assembly. He blamed the Patriote victory on \u201cthe Complacency with which the Canada Committee [of 1834] listened to sham Grievances\u201d and predicted that the new assembly would be less reasonable than its predecessor. When the assembly met in February 1835, he made his prediction reality by refusing to issue money for the assembly\u2019s contingencies. In return the house again refused supplies and complained that Aylmer was prejudiced against French Canadians. On 18 March Aylmer prorogued the legislature and called upon Britain to find a solution to the constitutional and financial impasse.\n\nThe solution adopted by the Colonial Office was to replace Aylmer. Spring-Rice had begun to search for a successor in the autumn of 1834 and had promised Aylmer another government if he would resign. But Aylmer wanted exoneration, and he suggested sending a parliamentary commission to examine the assembly\u2019s charges. In April 1835 a three-man commission was appointed, but its head, Lord Gosford [Acheson], would also become Aylmer\u2019s replacement. Aylmer bitterly resented his dismissal and was further antagonized when Gosford, who assumed control of the government on 24 Aug. 1835, dissociated himself from his predecessor. Aylmer\u2019s mood was not improved by a terrifying return voyage, described by Lady Aylmer in Narrative of the passage of the \u201cPique\u201d across the Atlantic (London, 1837). Once in England, he attempted without success to obtain approval of his conduct by refusing appointment as commander of the forces in Ireland unless he got it. However, he did coerce the government into awarding him a gcb, on 10 Sept. 1836, and on 23 Nov. 1841 he became a general, but he never obtained an English peerage, to which he felt entitled, or another administrative post. On 23 Feb. 1850 he died in his London home of an aneurysm of the heart.\n\nOn leaving the colony Aylmer had expressed regret that his \u201canxious endeavours to promote the general welfare of Lower Canada, should have fallen (as they have) so far short\u201d of his initial expectations and burst into tears when the small crowd which had gathered at the wharf cheered. In truth, Aylmer is a tragic figure. He was well meaning and as competent as most of the military men sent to govern British North America following the Napoleonic Wars. But Lower Canada required a governor with political skill, and as Aylmer had noted in October 1831, \u201cI cannot look for advice, or support here, beyond the circle of my own family composed of Soldiers like myself; & on . . . [the other] side of the Water I am totally destitute of Political Connexions.\u201d Largely unprepared, he had found himself \u201ccalled upon all at once to contend against those whose lives have been devoted to the Study of Law & Politics.\u201d The Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser declared that Aylmer had \u201cearned a niche in Canadian History, alongside of the Craigs [Sir James Henry Craig*] and Dalhousies, and gained for himself the execration of half-a-million people\u201d; the Whigs blamed him for the failure of their conciliatory policy; and historians sympathetic to them, such as Helen Taft Manning, have echoed this assessment. Yet, although Aylmer was guilty of serious errors of judgement, much of the criticism of him is unfair. Many of his blunders, as historian Fernand Ouellet notes, \u201cwere more or less provoked,\u201d and he never became as violently francophobic as Craig or Dalhousie, never lost his temper in public, never closed the doors of the Ch\u00e2teau to his opponents. He contributed to ethnic polarization in Lower Canada, but he was not responsible for it, nor could he, any more than Gosford, a civilian with considerable political experience, have prevented its development. Moreover, Aylmer was handicapped by the rapid changes of government in Britain during the early 1830s, serving under five secretaries whose views on Lower Canada differed sharply. Without \u201cPolitical Connexions\u201d in Britain, he was sacrificed to facilitate accommodation with the Lower Canadian assembly; the sacrifice, ironically, was in vain for by then the train of events leading to the rebellions of 1837\u201338 was probably irreversible.\n\nPhillip Buckner"}, {"url": "https://www.houseofnames.com/aylmer-family-crest", "page_content": "Aylmer History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms Origins Available:\n\nOrigins Available: England\n\nEngland Ireland\n\nWhen the Strongbownians arrived in Ireland, they encountered an established an Irish system for creating hereditary surnames. However, like the Irish, the Anglo-Norman Strongbownians frequently had patronymic surnames, a form of surname that was formed from the name of the bearer's father, or another older relative. Therefore, since the Strongbownians' system was in many ways built on the same principles as the Irish, the two systems eventually attained a sort of merger. Therefore, since the Strongbownians' names often had Norman names which were French, diminutive suffixes, such as -ot, -et, -un, -in, or -el were added to the name of the bearer's father, or older relative. Another Norman way of creating a patronymic name was to use the prefix Fitz-, which was derived from the French word fils, and ultimately from the Latin filius, both of which mean son.

Record numbers died of disease and starvation and many others, deciding against such a fate, boarded ships bound for North America. The largest influx of Irish settlers occurred with Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s. Unfortunately, many of those Irish that arrived in Canada or the United States still experienced economic and racial discrimination. Although often maligned, these Irish people were essential to the rapid development of these countries because they provided the cheap labor required for the many canals, roads, railways, and other projects required for strong national infrastructures. Eventually the Irish went on to make contributions in the less backbreaking and more intellectual arenas of commerce, education, and the arts.

As Catholics they suffered during the Civil Wars, when Aylmer\u2019s grandfather was imprisoned, but were restored at least to some of their lands in 1661. Aylmer\u2019s father, who received a baronetcy at this time, showed a loyalty to King Charles II which extended to a willingness to compromise with the Protestant establishment: he subscribed to the \u2018protestation and remonstrance\u2019 of Catholic gentry in 1661 repudiating papal authority, and both his younger sons, Matthew and George, conformed to the Established Church. As a result, Christopher came into conflict both with his own father, and then with his eldest son, Gerald, who disputed title to the family inheritance before eventually succeeding as 2nd Bt. Gerald then jeopardized the family estates by joining James II in 1689. In October 1690 Matthew Aylmer petitioned for a grant of the property his brother had forfeited, but the outcome is not known.\n\nAs the second son, Matthew embarked on a military career, as did his younger brother, George (d. 1689). He seems to have become a client of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, in whose regiment he was commissioned. After the disbandment of the regiment, family history notes that Aylmer raised troops in Munster for the Dutch, before obtaining a commission in a Tangier regiment in 1677, and then switching to a naval career. While on active service at Tangier, he was raised to captain by Admiral Arthur Herbert\u2020, and continued to serve until the evacuation of the garrison in 1683\u20134. In James II\u2019s reign Aylmer saw service at sea against Monmouth\u2019s rebels, before receiving promotion in the army. Given his Catholic antecedents, and his elder brother\u2019s commitment to Rome, Aylmer\u2019s position was fraught with possibilities and dangers; in July 1687 he received a dispensation from taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy while acting as an army captain. However, in 1688 he showed unequivocal support for the Prince of Orange, and was a leading participant in the \u2018navy plot\u2019 against James II.\n\nAylmer\u2019s main patron at this time appears to have been Edward Russell*. In February 1690, a report that John Hill had been appointed to the Navy Board brought a missive from Russell to Secretary Nottingham (Daniel Finch\u2020), extolling Aylmer\u2019s qualifications for such a post and recalling previous service to the Williamite cause. He was considered for a flag as early as August 1690, but it was as a captain that he was given command of the Mediterranean fleet in 1690\u20131, although he was allowed to retain his lieutenant-colonelcy in the army. In August 1691 Aylmer sought command of the West Indies squadron, but had to wait until 1693 for a flag. He may have tried to take advantage of the Smyrna fleet debacle in 1693, because Sir Ralph Delaval* wrote acidly, \u2018there was not a flag at the council of war so very fond of coming into port as Mr Aylmer who I suppose doth all the good is in his nature but his hand is to every resolution of our councils of war which I hope to see him deny\u2019. The following year saw his appointment to the Navy Board.\n\nAylmer\u2019s first foray into electoral politics ended in a double return at the Portsmouth by-election of 1695 (after Russell himself had created the vacancy by opting to sit for Cambridgeshire). The Commons on 24 Jan. 1696 voted this a void election, and even with Russell\u2019s backing Aylmer\u2019s interest proved insufficient to overcome that of John Gibson, the town\u2019s lieutenant-governor, who was returned unopposed at the second by-election. Early in 1696, the deposition of the Assassination Plotter Peter Cook suggested that the Jacobites thought they could \u2018depend\u2019 upon Aylmer, but nothing incriminating was revealed. In May 1697 he subscribed \u00a31,000 to the contract for lending money to circulate Exchequer bills. The death of James Chadwick* left a vacancy for Dover, a borough in which the navy could exercise considerable influence. Aylmer approached the corporation in June 1697 and, despite snide references by Philip Papillon* to Aylmer\u2019s Irishness and lack of any visible estate in the town or county, he was returned on 15 Dec., taking his seat on the 20th.\n\nIn February 1698 Aylmer was given command of the squadron destined for the Mediterranean. At this point he was \u2018in town\u2019, and presumably attending Parliament. Delays in supplying the fleet, owing to a shortage of funds, meant that he did not sail until September, which may have allowed him to consolidate his position in Dover with timely applications to the government for money to repair Dover harbour. Before leaving England he was re-elected, and was listed as a placeman in September 1698 and as a placeman on a comparative analysis of the old and new Parliaments. In an addendum to this list he was marked as absent, and the House officially excused his attendance on 7 Mar. 1699 because of his duties at sea and as envoy to various North African states.\n\nDuring Aylmer\u2019s absence (he returned at the end of October 1699) there was a lengthy parliamentary inquiry into mismanagements at the Admiralty, one of the allegations being the delay in fitting out Aylmer\u2019s squadron. Other, more specific, charges against him included his detention of the Centurion at Cadiz in order to force its commander, Price, to concede a large share of his profits, and Aylmer\u2019s role as victualler of his own fleet while in the Mediterranean. Opinion divided on party lines as to his culpability. Sir Richard Cocks, 2nd Bt.*, thought Price\u2019s charges \u2018mere malice, nothing in it at all\u2019, while James Vernon I* reported that the House had considered, in regard to victualling, that Aylmer was \u2018too honest and too considerate\u2019 to have submitted false accounts and profit thereby. However, Robert Harley\u2019s* papers contain the draft of a resolution condemning Aylmer for corruption and breach of trust in detaining Price at Cadiz. This may well relate to the debate in the committee of the whole on 10 Mar. 1699, when Aylmer was blamed, but the matter was \u2018let fall before they came to any question\u2019.\n\nWhile Aylmer was at sea during the summer of 1699 Orford resigned his place at the Admiralty. In discussions that followed there was talk of promoting George Churchill* to a flag senior to Aylmer, no doubt as part of the Earl of Marlborough\u2019s (John Churchill\u2020) rapprochement with the Court. Vernon felt that Aylmer might resign over this matter, possibly \u2018to give a handle for finding fault with the partialities of this commission of Admiralty, and to show the case is not much mended in that respect\u2019, and that the appointment of Churchill would be difficult to defend on the grounds of experience and seniority. In the event, Churchill went to the Admiralty in place of Sir Robert Rich, 2nd Bt.*, while Aylmer continued at the Navy Board. An analysis of the House into \u2018interests\u2019 in early 1700 listed Aylmer as a member of the Bedford/Orford connexion. This affiliation did not help him to obtain one of the limited number of peacetime commands, although his name was linked with a squadron going to the Straits. In March 1701 he was listed among those flag officers \u2018unemployed at sea\u2019. Aylmer\u2019s attention to constituency matters, such as his appointment on 12 Feb. 1700 to draft a bill to repair Dover harbour, ensured that he was returned at the election of January 1701; he even appears to have retained the naval interest at Dover although another Court supporter, Secretary of State Sir Charles Hedges*, was also returned. In the ensuing parliamentary session, Aylmer was listed among those thought likely to support the Court in February over the \u2018Great Mortgage\u2019.\n\nWhen Dover corporation rebuffed Hedges in the run-up to the election of December 1701, it was mostly because of Aylmer\u2019s \u2018neglect\u2019 of their interests. In comparison, he had been more attentive, particularly over the harbour. Aylmer was also solicitous for his own interests: hence a petition he signed with three other navy commissioners on 31 Dec. 1701, for the continuance of an allowance of \u00a380 p.a. for housing, in view of the fact that they could not be accommodated in government property. Aylmer had resided in the parish of St. Paul\u2019s, Covent Garden, since at least as early as 1694, moving from St. Martin\u2019s-in-the-Fields at some point after 1690, possibly coincidental with his appointment to the Navy Board in 1692. He had also purchased an estate near Dover, presumably by 1701 when he presented to an advowson at nearby East Langdon. On a list of the new Parliament, Harley classed him as a Whig. With fewer naval duties to perform, Aylmer was more active in the 1701\u20132 session, and was included on the drafting committee of a bill to encourage privateers. On a personal note he also assisted in the management of a private bill for the Fitzgerald and Plunkett families, with both of whom the Irish Aylmers were connected.\n\nAylmer had been appointed vice-admiral of the red in January 1702, but the death of William III saw his naval career at a standstill, following the Queen\u2019s decision to employ George Churchill in that place, and the consequent dispute about seniority which Vernon had predicted three years before. Aylmer was also left out of a revamped Navy Board, for which the governorship of Deal and nomination to the Kentish lieutenancy and the bench were poor recompense. Re-elected for Dover in 1702, in July he petitioned the Queen for a pension, such as had been given by William III to Admirals Delaval and Killigrew (Henry*). Aylmer considered his position to be similar, in that he had been displaced from being vice-admiral of the red by Churchill and then removed from the Navy Board, whereas the official view was that Aylmer had declined to serve and had as a consequence also lost his post as a navy commissioner. Although L\u2019Hermitage had described him in February 1702 as a Whig and a creature of Orford, Aylmer was spotted caballing in September with Lord Burlington (Hon. Charles Boyle I*), Lord Somers (Sir John*), Lord Halifax (Charles Montagu*), (Sir) Thomas Felton* (4th Bt.) and \u2018Mr Hopkins [?Thomas*]\u2019. Nothing came of these discussions between overlooked politicians, but Aylmer remained a Whig, voting on 13 Feb. 1703 to agree with the Lords\u2019 amendments enlarging the time for taking the oaths of abjuration. Forecast as an opponent of the Tack, he did not vote for it on 28 Nov. 1704.\n\nIn January 1705 there was a rumour that Aylmer would serve at sea again the following summer, and in a conciliatory move the Treasury ordered a stay of prosecution against Aylmer and Sir Basill Dixwell, 2nd Bt.*, for failure to account for money given to them to repair Dover harbour. Returned again at the 1705 election, Aylmer was described in an analysis of the new House as a \u2018High Church Courtier\u2019, and his name appears on a list of placemen for 1705, presumably because of his governorship at Deal. On 25 Oct. 1705 he voted for the Court candidate as Speaker, and later in the session, on 18 Feb. 1706, supported the Court in the proceedings on the \u2018place clause\u2019 of the regency bill. He was more active in the Commons in this Parliament, his committee appointments again reflecting his interest in naval affairs, and in 1706 he presented a memorial to the Treasury on the desirability of the Navy Board taking over responsibility for Dover harbour.\n\nRe-elected in 1708, Aylmer was classed as a Whig on two lists of that year. He sought to capitalize on the swing towards the Whigs at this time and gain further preferment. Thus on 25 May, only a few weeks after the general election, he wrote to Marlborough to remind the Duke of a memorial delivered the previous winter, in which Aylmer had asked for the governorship of Greenwich Hospital, \u2018or to be allowed a subsistence\u2019. Since that post had been disposed of, Aylmer recounted the \u2018hardships under which I suffer, and not being conscious that I have done anything can deserve so particular a mark of severeness above all other officers\u2019. Marlborough seems to have responded favourably to this letter, which was referred to Lord Treasurer Godolphin (Sidney\u2020), although nothing was done immediately. In December 1708 a commission was made out for Aylmer as admiral of the fleet, which was superseded the following day. This was a device to provide Aylmer with a \u2018subsistence\u2019 on half pay at a high rank. In 1709 he supported the naturalization of the Palatines. With the Earl of Pembroke (Hon. Thomas Herbert\u2020) as Lord High Admiral, rumours began to circulate as early as March that the Admiralty would be put into a commission which would include Aylmer. The same rumours recurred in October and November, but when Orford was brought back into the Admiralty Aylmer was not one of the commissioners; instead he was given command of the fleet. This did not please everyone: Sir John Jennings* felt rather as Aylmer had done in 1702 when Churchill had been appointed, and Arthur Maynwaring* noted that \u2018the officers have no real value for Mr Aylmer, nor indeed for anyone now but for Jennings\u2019. As a consequence of his appointment Aylmer had to fight a by-election, but was returned unopposed. In the 1709\u201310 session he voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell.\n\nReturned again at the 1710 election, Aylmer soon lost his position as admiral and commander-in-chief of the fleet. Indeed, at the committee of elections on 22 Feb. 1711, both Aylmer and Jennings were \u2018severely criticized\u2019 for interfering at the election for Weymouth by treating the corporation on board ship. However, when the report came before the House on 17 Mar. no resolution critical of Aylmer was passed. The end of the session saw Aylmer appealing to Harley for repayment of the contingency money he had spent while equipping himself for service at sea the previous year and referring again to the hardships he had undergone. In the following session Aylmer voted on 7 Dec. 1711 for the \u2018No Peace without Spain\u2019 motion, but otherwise was not very active. In the 1713 session he was not present in the Commons to vote in the divisions of 18 June over the French commerce bill because he had gone to Deal Castle with Sir John Norris* (his son-in-law) to celebrate the marriage of his younger daughter to Hugh Fortescue*.\n\nNot only was Aylmer defeated at the 1713 general election, it was even felt necessary to scotch a rumour in the following January that he was a Catholic. However, he was soon back in favour after the Hanoverian succession. In October 1714 he was reported to have been made governor of Greenwich Hospital, a post he had long coveted, which \u2018is a very pretty post, and has a very pleasant house to dwell in\u2019. November saw him reappointed admiral of the fleet, and he regained his seat in the Commons at the 1715 general election. On a comparative analysis of the 1713 and 1715 Parliaments he was listed as a Whig. Aylmer continued as admiral until he exchanged the post for the honorific title of rear-admiral of England and an Irish peerage in 1718. He died at Greenwich on 18 Aug. 1720, although his will, dated in June that year, still gave his address as Covent Garden. In it he had appointed as executor his son Henry\u2020, an equerry to the King. Swift wrote off his compatriot as a violent partisan, but Aylmer seems to have been skilled at exploiting the situations available to him. His early naval career was marked by the smooth facility with which he moved between patrons, yet he managed to retain his seat at Dover even after the original backing of the Navy interest had been lost.\n\nRef Volumes: 1690-1715\n\nAuthor: Stuart Handley\n\nNotes"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Admiral-Thomas-Mathews/6000000046908850088", "page_content": "About Admiral Thomas Mathews\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mathews Thomas Mathews (October 1676 \u2013 2 October 1751) was a British officer of the Royal Navy, who rose to the rank of admiral.\n\nMathews joined the navy in 1690 and saw service on a number of ships, including during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession.

Mathews' second in command, Lestock, was tried but acquitted, blaming the outcome on Mathews' poor planning and ill-tempered and unwise attack. Mathews was tried and convicted of the charges, and dismissed from the navy. He returned to his estates at Llandaff, before moving to London and dying there in 1751.\n\nFamily and early life\n\nHe was born at Llandaff Court, Llandaff, the son of Colonel Edward Mathews (died 1700), and grandson on his mother's side of Sir Thomas Armstrong (1624\u20131684) (who was executed in 1684, for his part in the Rye House Plot). Mathews was also a descendant of the Welsh knight Sir David ap Mathew and King Louis VI of France. Mathews joined the navy in 1690, serving aboard HMS Albemarle, which was then under the command of his uncle, Sir Francis Wheler. Mathews served during the Nine Years' War, and may have been present at the Battle of Beachy Head, and was likely in action at the Battle of Barfleur. Mathews went on to serve aboard HMS Portland under Captain James Littleton in 1697, and on 31 October 1699 Vice-Admiral Matthew Aylmer appointed him lieutenant aboard his flagship, HMS Boyne. Mathews served with Aylmer in the Mediterranean, before being moved to HMS Deale Castle in 1700. Mathews went on to serve with John Graydon in the West Indies, being promoted by him to command HMS Yarmouth, a position he took up on 24 May 1703.\n\nCommand\n\nHe commanded HMS Kingsale in the English Channel from 1704, and in October 1708 took command of HMS Gloucester. His next ship was the newly-built HMS Chester, which was attached to the Channel fleet under Lord Berkeley. The fleet encountered a small French squadron under Ren\u00e9 Duguay-Trouin in early 1709. The British gave chase, re-capturing one of Duguay-Trouin's prizes, HMS Bristol, and capturing another of his ships, Gloire.\n\nMathews and Chester were then assigned to the fleet sent to reduce and capture Nova Scotia under Commodore George Martin in 1710, and took over command of the forces after Martin's return to England. He joined Sir Hovenden Walker at Boston in summer 1711, after which he escorted a convoy to New York. Chester was badly damaged by heavy storms during this mission, and returned to Britain for repairs. Mathews then moved ashore, and spent the next few years at the family seat of Llandaff Court.\n\nMathews returned to active service in January 1718, following the outbreak of war with Spain, with a temporary appointment to command HMS Prince Frederick, while a new ship, HMS Kent, was being fitted out. He took command of Kent on 31 March 1718, and joined Sir George Byng's fleet in the Mediterranean. He participated in the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718, and was then detached in command of a squadron assigned to blockade Messina and hopefully intercept Vice-Admiral George Camocke, a British national serving with the Spanish navy. Camocke managed to evade the British and escape in a small boat in January however, and the British squadrons were occupied with blockading Sicily until autumn 1720, when Mathews returned to Britain with Byng.\n\nFrom 1722 to 1724 he was in command of a small squadron sent to the East Indies to expel the Indian Maratha Admiral Kanhoji Angre of the Malabar Coast. The presence of his ships caused Angre's activity to be much reduced, but their strongholds remained impregnable. Mathews' squadron supported Portuguese troops from Goa in an attack on the Maratha fortress at Vijaydurg & Kolaba, but this was repulsed. Mathews returned to Britain in 1724 and thereafter largely retired from the navy, and received no further promotions. It was not until 1736 that he rejoined the service in any capacity, becoming commissioner at Chatham, though the appointment was considered a civil one.\n\nWar of the Austrian Succession\n\nThe outbreak of war with Spain and the imminent threat of war with France during the early stages of the War of the Austrian Succession led to Mathews' return to active service, with a promotion directly to vice-admiral of the red on 13 March 1741. He was given a command in the Mediterranean, and made plenipotentiary to Charles Emmanuel III, king of Sardinia, and the other courts of Italy. The appointment was somewhat unexpected, Mathews was not especially distinguished, and had not served in the navy for a number of years. His second in command in the Mediterranean was Rear-Admiral Richard Lestock, a man Mathews knew from his time as commissioner at Chatham, when Lestock had commanded the guardships stationed in the Medway. The two had not been on good terms, and on receiving the Mediterranean posting, Mathews requested that Lestock be recalled, a request the Admiralty declined to act upon.\n\nThe two men continued their disagreements during their time in the Mediterranean, though Mathews' continued distractions with diplomatic duties meant that they did not break out into an open argument. In 1742 Mathews sent a small squadron to Naples to compel King Charles, later the King of Spain, to remain neutral. It was commanded by Commodore William Martin, who refused to enter into negotiations, and gave the king half an hour in which to return an answer. The Neapolitans were forced to agree to the British demands.\n\nIn June 1742 a squadron of Spanish galleys, which had taken refuge in the Bay of Saint Tropez, was burnt by the fire ships of Mathews' fleet. In the meantime a Spanish squadron had taken refuge in Toulon, and was watched by the British fleet from Hyeres. On 21 February 1744 (N.S., 10 February O.S.) the Spaniards put to sea in company with a French force. Mathews, who had now returned to his flagship, followed, and an engagement took place on the 22 and 23 February.\n\nBattle of Toulon\n\nThe fleets had become scattered in the light winds as they approached, and as they began to form up for the Battle of Toulon on 22 February, Mathews signalled for the formation of the line of battle. The line had still not been formed as night fell, leading Mathews to hoist the signal to come to, intending for his ships to first finish forming the line. The van and centre squadrons did so, but Lestock commanding the rear obeyed the order to come to, without having formed the line. By daybreak on 21 February, the rear of the British fleet was separated by a considerable distance from the van and centre. Mathews signalled for Lestock to make more sail, reluctant to start the attack with his ships still disorganised, but the slowness of Lestock to respond caused the Franco-Spanish force to start to slip away to the south. Mathews feared that they would escape him, and pass through the Straits of Gibraltar to join the French force gathered at Brest for the planned invasion of Britain.\n\nKnowing that his duty was to attack, Mathews hoisted the signal to engage the enemy aboard his flagship HMS Namur, and at one o'clock left the line to attack the Spanish rear, followed by Captain James Cornewall aboard HMS Marlborough. In doing so, the signal to form the line of battle was left flying. The two signals flying simultaneously created confusion, though a number of British commanders, including Captain Edward Hawke, followed Mathews' example. Heavily outnumbered and unsupported, with his other commanders either too uncertain, or in the case of Lestock, possibly pleased to see Mathews in difficulty and unwilling to help him, Namur and Marlborough managed to defeat their opposite numbers in the enemy line, but suffered considerable damage. The French ships came about at 5 o'clock to aid the Spanish, a manoeuvre interpreted by some of the British commanders to be an attempt to double the British line and surround them. With no orders from Mathews and a lack of clear instructions or command structure, the British line broke, and began to flee to the northwest. The Spanish, still on the defensive, neglected to capture the defenceless Marlborough, though they did retake the Poder, which had previously surrendered to the British. The Franco-Spanish fleet then resumed their flight to the southwest, and it was not until 23 February that the British were able to regroup and resume the pursuit. They caught up with the enemy fleet again, which was hampered by towing damaged ships, and were able to retake the Poder, which Mathews ordered to be burnt. By now the British had closed to within a few miles of the enemy fleet but Mathews again signalled for the fleet to come to. The following day, 24 February, the Franco-Spanish fleet was almost out of sight, and Mathews returned to Hyeres, and sailed from there to Port Mahon, where he arrived in early March.\n\nEnquiry and dismissal\n\nThe failure of the British fleet to bring a decisive action against an inferior foe had significant consequences. The opposing fleet was able to deliver troops and supplies to the Spanish army in Italy, swinging the war in their favour. This was widely remarked on back in Britain. The House of Commons petitioned King George II for a public enquiry, and a dozen captains were tried by court-martial and cashiered. Lestock was also tried, but was able to place the blame on Mathews, and with the help of powerful supporters in government, was acquitted and offered further employment. Mathews was tried by court-martial in 1746, on charges of having brought the fleet into action in a disorganised manner, of having fled the enemy, and of having failed to bring the enemy to action when the conditions were advantageous. In his defence it was shown that he had fought bravely, but in June 1747 the court judged the charges were proven, and Mathews was dismissed from the service.\n\nMathews had devoted himself to work at his estate at Llandaff, and did not appear to be affected by the result of the trial. He regarded the outcome as down to factional party politics, rather than as a reflection on his conduct. Mathews moved to Bloomsbury Square in 1749, and died there on 2 October 1751. He was buried at St. George's Church, Bloomsbury.\n\nPersonality\n\nMathews' personality was the subject of particular study during the controversy over Toulon, with his detractors claiming that he was hot-headed, intemperate, and incapable of managing the complex task of commanding a fleet in battle, which had led to the defeat. Horace Walpole, in his correspondence with Sir Horace Mann, noted that \"Mathews believes that Providence lives upon beef and pudding, loves prize-fighting and bull-baiting, and drinks fog to the health of Old England.\"[5] In a speech in the Commons Walpole declared \"Mathews remains in the light of a hot, brave, imperious, dull, confused fellow.\" Mann, who was strongly opposed to how Naples' neutrality had been violated during Mathews' tenure as commander in the Mediterranean, declared \"'Tis wonderful how void Admiral Mathews is of common sense, good manners, or knowledge of the world. He understands nothing but Yes or No, and knows no medium.\" Walpole and his correspondents often referred to Mathews as \"Il Furibondo\". Despite their criticism, those who knew Mathews personally, while admitting that he could be hot-tempered, described him as \"warm-hearted, kindly and affectionate; a clear-sighted magistrate, a capable farmer, and a keen sportsman\".\n\nFamily and issue\n\nMathews married Henrietta Burgess, of Antigua, in 1705. The couple had a son, Thomas, who became a major in the army. Henrietta died about 1740, and Mathews remarried about 1745, to Millicent Powell."}, {"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/whitworth_aylmer_matthew_7E.html", "page_content": "WHITWORTH-AYLMER, MATTHEW, 5th Baron AYLMER, army officer and colonial administrator; b. 24 May 1775, the eldest of five children of Henry Aylmer, 4th Baron Aylmer, and Catherine Whitworth; m. 28 July or 4 Aug. 1801 Louisa Anne Call, daughter of Sir John Call; they had no children; d. 23 Feb. 1850 in London.\n\nMatthew Aylmer was only 10 when he succeeded his father in the ancient Irish barony of Aylmer and 12 when he entered the 49th Foot as an ensign. He became a lieutenant in 1791 and a captain in 1794. In 1798 he participated in an abortive British raid on Ostend (Belgium), was captured, and spent six months in a French prison. He won high praise from his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Brock*, for his role in the battle of Egmont-op-Zee (more properly Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands) in 1799. Two years later he rose to the rank of major in the 85th Foot, and in 1802 to lieutenant-colonel; however, he was then placed on half pay until June 1803 when he joined the Coldstream Foot Guards. On 25 July 1810 he became a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the king and on 4 June 1813 a major-general. He served as the assistant \u2013 and then from January 1812 as the deputy \u2013 adjutant general to Lord Wellington\u2019s army and commanded a brigade in several major battles of the Peninsular War, during which he was awarded the Military Cross with one clasp. He was given a kcb on 2 Jan. 1815 and knighted on 6 June. In 1814 he had been appointed adjutant general of the British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. From 1823 to 1830 he was without employment and spent much of his time wandering across Switzerland and Italy. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825 and that year, upon the death of his uncle, the Earl of Whitworth, he changed his family name to Whitworth-Aylmer. He was made colonel of the 56th Foot in 1827 and transferred to the 18th Foot five years later.\n\nAylmer\u2019s enforced idleness ended when Sir James Kempt* resigned the administration of Lower Canada. In June 1830 the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir George Murray, who had also served with Wellington in the Peninsular War, offered the position to Aylmer. On 11 August Aylmer was appointed commander of the forces in North America, and on 13 October he landed at Quebec; he assumed control of the administration one week later. His commission as governor-in-chief was dated 24 Nov. 1830, but it was not formally registered at Quebec until 12 Feb. 1831. Aylmer had few obvious qualifications for his position; he had never served as a civil administrator, he had no political experience, and he came to Lower Canada, by his own admission, \u201ca perfect stranger to all that relates to the country.\u201d Yet Murray\u2019s choice was based on more than friendship. Aylmer was one of the more distinguished and capable officers of his rank, he was a francophile, and, as Louis-Joseph Papineau* noted, he spoke French \u201cwith the greatest ease and elegance.\u201d Although leaning to the conservative side in British politics, he was not a partisan, and the reformers in the Canadas, reassured by their contacts in Britain, received him as \u201can able and clever man conciliatory in his disposition, liberal in his principles, and cincerely [sic] anxious to do good.\u201d\n\nRecognizing his lack of knowledge, Aylmer none the less predicted that he would soon \u201cbe out of the Awkward Squad.\u201d He embarked on a series of tours which eventually took him to every part of Lower Canada, and he pronounced himself pleased with \u201cthe country, the people and the Climate.\u201d He and Lady Aylmer took their viceregal responsibilities seriously, contributing generously to a variety of causes, such as an emigrant fund, the Female Orphan Asylum, and the Quebec Driving Club (one of a number of organizations of which Lady Aylmer became patroness). They sought to foster the arts and culture, and attended many community activities, from ploughing matches to annual races in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res where Aylmer donated a silver cup to be awarded for a horse bred within the province. A wealthy man, Aylmer entertained frequently and lavishly at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Louis, the governor\u2019s residence; yet he avoided the error \u201cinto which most of our Governors have fallen . . . ,\u201d noted the Montreal reform newspaper, the Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser, \u201cof attempting to impress on the minds of the \u2018natives\u2019 a something transatlantically superior pertaining to themselves.\u201d During a visit to the Indian reserve at Lac des Deux Montagnes he joined in the dancing when \u201cobliged\u201d to do so.\n\nAylmer wished particularly to convince French Canadians of his benevolence. Shortly after his arrival he donated money for a tablet over the spot \u201cwhere lay the remains of brave Montcalm [Louis-Joseph de Montcalm*].\u201d He disagreed vehemently with those who advocated a policy of assimilation, arguing that there were not British subjects \u201cmore loyal and true \u2013 than the People of Lower Canada\u201d and that assimilation would weaken their loyalty and drive them into the arms of the United States. He defended the seigneurial system and sought permission to grant seigneurial lands under crown control to French Canadians who could not afford to purchase on freehold tenure. He exhibited a genuine desire to distribute government patronage with the utmost impartiality, reintegrating militia officers whom a predecessor, Lord Dalhousie [Ramsay], had dismissed for opposition to the administration, increasing the number of French Canadians on the bench, ensuring a balance between francophones and anglophones on the commission of the peace, and making 8 of his first 14 appointees to the Legislative Council French Canadians. In 1831, to prove that he was \u201cfree of all party connections,\u201d he offered seats on the Executive Council to Patriote leaders Papineau and John Neilson. Although both refused, Aylmer successively appointed the francophone reform members of the House of Assembly Philippe Panet*, Dominique Mondelet*, and Hugues Heney. Undeniably, he did not go far enough; the Legislative and Executive councils and the high echelons of the civil service continued to be dominated by anglophones unsympathetic to the demands of the assembly. None the less, he went as far as, and at times farther than, his superiors in London wanted and, at least initially, he convinced Papineau that \u201che likes and desires the good of the province.\u201d\n\nThe legislature met for the first time under Aylmer in January 1831 when, labouring under \u201ca severe indisposition,\u201d he delivered his speech from the throne \u201cliterally from my bed.\u201d Throughout the session he worked diligently to remedy the grievances of the assembly, many of which, he admitted, were \u201cwell founded.\u201d He introduced economies in the civil service, presented nearly all the executive documents requested by the assembly, protested to the British government delays in examining reserved colonial legislation, refused to bend regulations for interested parties, demanded more rigorous standards in accounting for public funds, launched an investigation of abuses in the land-grant system, and induced the judges (with the exception of Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell) not to attend the Legislative Council while the Colonial Office deliberated on a long-standing demand for their exclusion from that body. In proroguing the legislature in March, he enquired for \u201cany stray complaint\u201d which the assembly had neglected.\n\nAylmer\u2019s most controversial effort to appease came after the assembly petitioned for the dismissal of Attorney General James Stuart*, an outspoken opponent of the Patriote party, at the end of the session. Under pressure from the assembly, in September Aylmer suspended Stuart pending adjudication of its charges in Britain. Reprimanded by the Colonial Office for suspending Stuart before he was given the opportunity to defend himself in the assembly, Aylmer rightly pointed out that not to have acted would have provoked \u201cthe utmost degree of ferment and agitation.\u201d In November 1832 the Colonial Office dismissed Stuart, who unsuccessfully challenged Aylmer to a duel. He was hailed as a martyr by those among the British minority in the colony who believed that Aylmer \u201cdare not displease Mr. Citoyen Papineau by whom . . . he is held completely under cow.\u201d Aylmer\u2019s decision had enhanced his reputation with the reformers, however, and particularly with Papineau, who had earlier entertained the Aylmers at his country estate in June 1831. But though \u201con good (I may say cordial) terms\u201d with Papineau, Aylmer was aware that a great gulf existed between them on a number of questions.\n\nFor more than a decade the main preoccupation of the assembly had been to obtain control of the provincial revenues, including those reserved to the crown by the Quebec Revenue Act of 1774 [see Sir Francis Nathaniel Burton*]. Murray\u2019s Whig successor at the Colonial Office, Lord Goderich, instructed Aylmer to submit a pared-down list of estimates to the assembly and to request a permanent civil list preparatory to a surrender of the crown revenues. The assembly paid little attention to Goderich\u2019s estimates and none to his request for a civil list, although it did vote supplies for one year. Ignoring Aylmer\u2019s advice to the contrary and influenced by his parliamentary under-secretary, Lord Howick, Goderich introduced a bill into parliament in the summer of 1831 surrendering the crown revenues unconditionally, and in September he ordered Aylmer to reconvene the legislature and again request a comparatively modest civil list. The assembly, however, refused salaries to several officials on Goderich\u2019s list and, when Aylmer foolishly tried to coerce it by hinting that he would reserve any bill deviating from Goderich\u2019s intentions, it refused permanent salaries to any officials. It seems unlikely that Goderich\u2019s proposals, which were rejected by 42 to 9, would have been accepted by the assembly even had Aylmer been more astute, and the disappointed governor closed the session in late February 1832, acknowledging that his friendly relations with the leaders of the Patriote party had been sorely strained.\n\nIn 1832 deterioration of those relations accelerated after three French-speaking Canadians were shot by British troops on 21 May during a turbulent by-election in Montreal [see Daniel Tracey*]. Aylmer\u2019s sympathies lay with the soldiers, and although he wrote to Papineau regretting the deaths, he refused to intervene in the subsequent judicial process, even when Papineau requested a military inquiry. He encouraged Solicitor General Charles Richard Ogden* to bring the case before a grand jury but later publicly praised the jury\u2019s exoneration of the military. Thereafter Papineau pointedly declined to attend receptions at the Ch\u00e2teau.\n\nThe anger of the Patriote party was fuelled by a cholera epidemic which in 1832 killed more than 7,000 people in the colony. Aylmer had prepared for the outbreak by persuading the legislature to establish a quarantine station at Grosse \u00cele and a board of health at Quebec and to authorize such facilities elsewhere when necessary. Although Aylmer conscientiously enforced the quarantine regulations and issued money to the boards of health and the Montreal Emigrant Society, the measures proved wholly inadequate. Moreover, by insisting that only the law officers of the crown should prosecute he hindered the work of the boards, and by encouraging flight to reduce the incidence of cholera in the cities he contributed to the spread of the disease. Yet, on balance, he did not deserve the censure of the assembly, which also criticized him for issuing funds without its approval and for failing to control the influx of immigrants. In fact, Aylmer did wish to limit immigration and proposed to raise money by a tax on immigrants. When the assembly met in November 1832, it was in an angry mood; it declared Mondelet\u2019s seat vacant on his appointment to the Executive Council, passed a supply bill making no provision for a civil list, which the Legislative Council felt compelled to reject, and adopted an address, similar to one it had itself rejected in the previous session, demanding an elective legislative council.\n\nTo Aylmer these actions demonstrated intransigence, and he requested authorization from London to use the unappropriated funds surrendered to the legislature by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act of 1831. Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, later Lord Stanley, who replaced Goderich at the Colonial Office in April 1833, sympathized but would not act until the assembly had been given an opportunity to reconsider. Consequently, when Aylmer reconvened the legislature in January 1834 he virtually invited a confrontation. He refused to grant the assembly contingency funds of \u00a37,000 and reserved 11 of the 12 bills passed by the legislature, disallowing the 12th. In return the assembly refused to vote supplies and passed 92 resolutions of grievance, including one demanding the governor\u2019s recall. Asserting that the resolutions were tantamount to a \u201cDeclaration of Independence,\u201d Aylmer sent to Stanley a draft bill restoring to the government control over the revenues surrendered to the assembly by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act. Stanley was prepared to rescind Goderich\u2019s act, and he referred the 92 resolutions to a select committee of the House of Commons, which he assumed would exonerate Aylmer. But Stanley was replaced in June 1834 by Thomas Spring-Rice, an easy-going Irish Whig, who was determined to avoid confrontation. Spring-Rice persuaded the Commons committee to attribute the conflict in Lower Canada simply to \u201cmutual misconceptions.\u201d After meeting with delegates from the assembly, he authorized Aylmer in September to borrow \u00a331,000 from the military chest for unpaid salaries, assuming (erroneously) that the assembly would agree to repay the loan. Aylmer was dismayed by Spring-Rice\u2019s actions and by the failure of the select committee to vindicate his conduct.\n\nIronically, Aylmer had led the Colonial Office to adopt a more conciliatory policy by insisting that the radicals in the assembly were losing support. During the sessions of 1833 and 1834 a rift had developed within the Patriote party, and Aylmer sought to exploit it, in particular by cultivating the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposed the policies of the radicals. Although a devout member of the Church of England, Aylmer was unusually tolerant in his religious views, wishing, for example, to alter the oath taken by justices of the peace so that he could appoint Jewish magistrates [see Aaron Ezekiel Hart*]. He attended mass in the Roman Catholic cathedral as well as in his own, refused to go to the services of a local Anglican priest who had protested Aylmer\u2019s giving pecuniary aid to the Catholic Church, offered the Ursulines of Quebec refuge in the Ch\u00e2teau when a fire broke out in their convent, recommended that the Roman Catholic bishop be appointed to the Executive Council, and discouraged the Colonial Office from interfering with the Sulpician estates. In addition to cultivating the church, Aylmer deliberately chose his nominees for government posts from among the more conservative and \u201crespectable\u201d members of the Patriote party.\n\nAylmer\u2019s appointments, however, had the effect of weakening the moderates in the assembly, since appointees lost their seats. In any case Aylmer was himself an inadequate instrument for multiplying vendus. Progressively disenchanted with what he considered to be the ignorance and ingratitude of French Canadians, he had begun by September 1832 to argue that \u201cBritish influence in Lower Canada . . . must ere long be paramount\u201d and that French Canadians must \u201cfinally reconcile themselves to a fate which cannot be averted.\u201d In October he warned Sir John Colborne*, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, that \u201cwhen the king\u2019s Subjects are spoken of as Foreigners and the Canadians as a Nation held in subjection by another Nation, it becomes the constituted Authorities to be upon their Guard.\u201d By the spring of 1834 he was convinced that so long as the assembly was composed largely of French Canadians \u201cthe Constitution of the Province . . . will never work beneficially.\u201d After the passage of the 92 Resolutions his primary concern was to reconcile the American-born population in the Eastern Townships and the rapidly growing Irish communities in Montreal and Quebec by appointing representatives from both groups to positions of importance. In June 1835 he strongly endorsed the application of \u201can association of gentlemen\u201d from the townships for permission to purchase a large quantity of land on terms similar to those given to the British American Land Company [see Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt*], despite vehement opposition from the assembly.\n\nGradually, in fact, Aylmer had come under the influence of the old official group. In April 1834 he appointed David Chisholme, one of Dalhousie\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, coroner of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. When John Fletcher was unable to accept a promotion on the bench suggested as recompense for \u201cthe persecution of the House of Assembly to which he has been exposed for a series of years,\u201d Aylmer recommended Samuel Gale*, who had acted as Dalhousie\u2019s agent in England in 1828 and served as counsel to the officers in command during the Montreal \u201cmassacre.\u201d This recommendation encountered strong opposition at the Colonial Office but was accepted under pressure from Aylmer on condition that the next vacancy would be given to a French Canadian.\n\nGale\u2019s appointment alienated many moderates on both sides. Aylmer added to his unpopularity by refusing money to Montreal during a second outbreak of cholera in 1834 and by retreating to the governor\u2019s cottage at William Henry (Sorel) during the height of the outbreak. Late that year the radicals won a sweeping victory at the polls, virtually eliminating the moderates from the assembly. Aylmer was not displeased with this result, arguing that it had \u201croused a feeling (hitherto dormant) in the British Population,\u201d which might, however, \u201clead to very serious results, unless prudently managed.\u201d He enthusiastically approved the formation of militant constitutional associations at Quebec and Montreal, and warned that the British minority were no longer prepared to accept domination by the assembly. He blamed the Patriote victory on \u201cthe Complacency with which the Canada Committee [of 1834] listened to sham Grievances\u201d and predicted that the new assembly would be less reasonable than its predecessor. When the assembly met in February 1835, he made his prediction reality by refusing to issue money for the assembly\u2019s contingencies. In return the house again refused supplies and complained that Aylmer was prejudiced against French Canadians. On 18 March Aylmer prorogued the legislature and called upon Britain to find a solution to the constitutional and financial impasse.\n\nThe solution adopted by the Colonial Office was to replace Aylmer. Spring-Rice had begun to search for a successor in the autumn of 1834 and had promised Aylmer another government if he would resign. But Aylmer wanted exoneration, and he suggested sending a parliamentary commission to examine the assembly\u2019s charges. In April 1835 a three-man commission was appointed, but its head, Lord Gosford [Acheson], would also become Aylmer\u2019s replacement. Aylmer bitterly resented his dismissal and was further antagonized when Gosford, who assumed control of the government on 24 Aug. 1835, dissociated himself from his predecessor. Aylmer\u2019s mood was not improved by a terrifying return voyage, described by Lady Aylmer in Narrative of the passage of the \u201cPique\u201d across the Atlantic (London, 1837). Once in England, he attempted without success to obtain approval of his conduct by refusing appointment as commander of the forces in Ireland unless he got it. However, he did coerce the government into awarding him a gcb, on 10 Sept. 1836, and on 23 Nov. 1841 he became a general, but he never obtained an English peerage, to which he felt entitled, or another administrative post. On 23 Feb. 1850 he died in his London home of an aneurysm of the heart.\n\nOn leaving the colony Aylmer had expressed regret that his \u201canxious endeavours to promote the general welfare of Lower Canada, should have fallen (as they have) so far short\u201d of his initial expectations and burst into tears when the small crowd which had gathered at the wharf cheered. In truth, Aylmer is a tragic figure. He was well meaning and as competent as most of the military men sent to govern British North America following the Napoleonic Wars. But Lower Canada required a governor with political skill, and as Aylmer had noted in October 1831, \u201cI cannot look for advice, or support here, beyond the circle of my own family composed of Soldiers like myself; & on . . . [the other] side of the Water I am totally destitute of Political Connexions.\u201d Largely unprepared, he had found himself \u201ccalled upon all at once to contend against those whose lives have been devoted to the Study of Law & Politics.\u201d The Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser declared that Aylmer had \u201cearned a niche in Canadian History, alongside of the Craigs [Sir James Henry Craig*] and Dalhousies, and gained for himself the execration of half-a-million people\u201d; the Whigs blamed him for the failure of their conciliatory policy; and historians sympathetic to them, such as Helen Taft Manning, have echoed this assessment. Yet, although Aylmer was guilty of serious errors of judgement, much of the criticism of him is unfair. Many of his blunders, as historian Fernand Ouellet notes, \u201cwere more or less provoked,\u201d and he never became as violently francophobic as Craig or Dalhousie, never lost his temper in public, never closed the doors of the Ch\u00e2teau to his opponents. He contributed to ethnic polarization in Lower Canada, but he was not responsible for it, nor could he, any more than Gosford, a civilian with considerable political experience, have prevented its development. Moreover, Aylmer was handicapped by the rapid changes of government in Britain during the early 1830s, serving under five secretaries whose views on Lower Canada differed sharply. Without \u201cPolitical Connexions\u201d in Britain, he was sacrificed to facilitate accommodation with the Lower Canadian assembly; the sacrifice, ironically, was in vain for by then the train of events leading to the rebellions of 1837\u201338 was probably irreversible.\n\nPhillip Buckner"}, {"url": "https://www.houseofnames.com/aylmer-family-crest", "page_content": "Aylmer History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms Origins Available:\n\nOrigins Available: England\n\nEngland Ireland\n\nWhen the Strongbownians arrived in Ireland, they encountered an established an Irish system for creating hereditary surnames. However, like the Irish, the Anglo-Norman Strongbownians frequently had patronymic surnames, a form of surname that was formed from the name of the bearer's father, or another older relative. Therefore, since the Strongbownians' system was in many ways built on the same principles as the Irish, the two systems eventually attained a sort of merger. Therefore, since the Strongbownians' names often had Norman names which were French, diminutive suffixes, such as -ot, -et, -un, -in, or -el were added to the name of the bearer's father, or older relative. Another Norman way of creating a patronymic name was to use the prefix Fitz-, which was derived from the French word fils, and ultimately from the Latin filius, both of which mean son.

Record numbers died of disease and starvation and many others, deciding against such a fate, boarded ships bound for North America. The largest influx of Irish settlers occurred with Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s. Unfortunately, many of those Irish that arrived in Canada or the United States still experienced economic and racial discrimination. Although often maligned, these Irish people were essential to the rapid development of these countries because they provided the cheap labor required for the many canals, roads, railways, and other projects required for strong national infrastructures.

Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of Captain, and he appears to have served almost constantly during the next ten years on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn October 1688 he was appointed captain of HMS Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delaval who commanded the blue squadron. In 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, he was one of the seconds of the Commander-in-Chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of Rear Admiral, and to that of Vice Admiral in 1694, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean, and was also appointed a Lord of the Admiralty. After the Treaty of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as Commander-in-Chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers. He returned home towards the end of the following year.\n\nIn November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the Admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the Commissioners of the Navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in Parliament as Baron or Member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured. The rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the haziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711.\n\nHe held no further command till the Accession of George I, when he was again appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ranger of Greenwich Park, and the second Governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death, and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which gradually developed into a magnificent institution. In April 1717 he became one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was promoted to Rear Admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage of Ireland as Lord Aylmer of Balrath. He had been elected Whig M.P. for Portsmouth in 1695, and for Dover in 1697, 1713, and 1715.\n\nA portrait, half-length, presented by his descendant, the fifth Lord Aylmer, is in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca. 1650 \u2013 18 August 1720), of Covent Garden, Westminster, and Westcliffe, near Dover, was an Anglo-Irish Royal Navy officer and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1695 and 1720.\n\nAylmer was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support; the Prince's response ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690 and again at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692 during the Nine Years' War.\n\nAylmer became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. However, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun Superbe: the new Harley Ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so a few months later. Following the accession of George I and the appointment of the Townshend Ministry, Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. He was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital: in this post he founded the Royal Hospital School for the sons of seamen.\n\nEarly career\n\nAylmer was the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer of Balrath, county Meath, and Margaret Aylmer (n\u00e9e Plunkett), daughter of Matthew Plunkett, 5th Baron Louth. He served briefly in the Army as Ensign of foot in the Duke of Buckingham\u2019s regiment from 1672 and then joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in the galley HMS Charles in October 1677 before being promoted to lieutenant in April 1678. Promoted to commander on 19 January 1679, he became commanding officer of the sloop HMS Chatham and then transferred to the command of the prize ship HMS Date Tree in Summer 1679. He transferred again to the command of the fire ship HMS Castle in the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year, to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Swann on the Coast of Ireland in July 1680 and to the command of the fourth-rate HMS Tiger in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1682, before becoming commanding officer of the galley HMS Charles in September 1685. Aylmer was a young officer of the \u201ccourtier type\u201d who benefited from the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nPromoted to captain on 1 October 1688, Aylmer was given command of the fourth-rate HMS Swallow in the Thames; he was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support. Indeed, he was perhaps the chief of the cabal. Aylmer followed up the letter with a visit to the Prince's headquarters and arranged that Lieutenant George Byng and Captain Anthony Hastings should accompany him during the visit. The Prince's warm response to the captains ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Mary in December 1688 and was present at the French victory at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689 at an early stage of the Nine Years' War. His brother George Aylmer was killed during the battle.\n\nAylmer transferred again, this time to the command of the second-rate HMS Royal Katherine in Spring 1690 and was present at the French victory at Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690. He transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Monck in the North Sea in Summer 1691 and then took command of the first-rate HMS London in Spring 1692. As Second Captain to Admiral Edward Russell, he saw action again at the tactically indecisive Battle of Barfleur in May 1692. As a captain, Aylmer was quite deferential to his Spanish partners during the War. Samuel Pepys believed that Aylmer should have been hanged for his habit of dipping his colours to Spanish Admirals.\n\nSenior command\n\nPromoted to rear admiral on 8 February 1693 and to vice admiral in June 1693, Aylmer hoisted his flag in the first-rate HMS Royal Sovereign and served under Admiral Edward Russell as second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet. He also became Whig Member of Parliament for Portsmouth at a by-election in 1695 but had to stand down when the House of Commons declared the by-election void in January 1696. Nevertheless, he was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Dover in December 1697. The Treaty of Ryswick was signed in September 1697, bringing the Nine Years' War to an end and, after a delay in fitting out his squadron, Aylmer went out into the Mediterranean, with his flag in the second-rate HMS Boyne, to ensure the treaty was being observed in September 1698; he then retired from active service in October 1699. In around 1700 he acquired Wallett's Court Manor at Westcliffe in Kent as a property in which he would live in retirement. He also had a property at No. 12 Great Piazza in Covent Garden.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince George (Queen Anne's consort), which brought Russell back to the Admiralty, Aylmer was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. He lost his Dover seat at the 1710 British general election which produced a landslide victory for the Tory party in the wake of the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell which Aylmer had supported. In July 1710, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun Superbe: the new Harley Ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so in January 1711.\n\nFollowing the accession of George I in August 1714, which led to the appointment of the Townshend Ministry in September 1714, Russell was back at the Admiralty again and Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. Alymer was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital on the same date: in this post he started to fund education for the sons of seamen from entry charges to the Painted Hall, pensioners' fines and proceeds from the sale of stores. The same day he was also appointed Ranger of Greenwich Park.\n\nAlymer recovered his seat in Parliament at Dover at the 1715 British general election which saw the Whigs win an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. He went on to join the Board of Admiralty led by the Earl of Berkeley, as Senior Naval Lord, in April 1717. He resigned his appointments as a member of the Admiralty Board and as Commander-in-Chief in March 1718 and was rewarded by being appointed Rear-Admiral of Great Britain and also being created Lord Aylmer of Balrath in the Peerage of Ireland on 1 May 1718.\n\nAylmer died at Queen's House in Greenwich on 18 August 1720 and was buried at St Alfege's Church in Greenwich.\n\nFamily\n\nIn circa 1680 Aylmer married Sarah Ellis; they had a son and two daughters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Aylmer,_1st_Baron_Aylmer"}, {"url": "https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/war-of-the-austrian-succession-1740-1748/", "page_content": "War of the Austrian Succession\n\nThe War of the Austrian Succession was a conflict that took place from 16 December 1740 to 18 October 1748 between the various European powers of the time. The conflict was not restricted to Europe, but also spilled into their colonial holdings in Asia.\n\nThe war established Prussia as a regional hegemon for years to come, altering the very balance of power in Europe. In India, the rivalry between Britain and France in the Austrian War of Succession resulted in the First Carnatic War.\n\nThis article will give further details about the War of the Austrian Succession within the context of the UPSC Exams.\n\nWhat was the reason behind the War of the Austrian Succession?\n\nThe pretext for the war came when a succession crisis happened upon the death of the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI in 1740. To understand how this crisis happened, one must keep in mind the following events:\n\nIn 1703, a Mutual Pact of Succession was agreed upon. It stated that should the male line of the Habsburgs become extinct, the female line would take precedence.\n\nIn this case, the female line referred to the heirs of the elder brother of Charles VI, Emperor Joseph I.\n\nBut the Salic law excluded women of the royal family from inheriting the throne. But if the various Habsburk territories and the Imperial Diet granted approval, then exceptions would be made.\n\nEmperor Joseph\u2019s death in 1711 left two potential female heirs, Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia. But in April 1713, the Pragmatic Sanction was issued by Charles, which allowed female inheritance by the progeny of Charles VI.\n\nThis sanction effectively ignored the 1703 agreement and created a potential for conflict because it placed the children of Charles VI ahead of his nieces. The birth of his daughter Maria Theresa in 1717 ensured that conflict was on the horizon.\n\n*Fact About Holy Roman Empire: Founded in 800 AD, the \u2018Holy Roman Empire\u2019 was a misleading name for Europe\u2019s largest collective of kingdoms and fiefdoms. It was not \u2018Holy\u2019 as it had disputes with the Pope in Rome from time to time. In those times, such acts of intransigence were looked down upon by other European kingdoms. It was not \u2018Roman\u2019 as it was Byzantine Empire that continued the legacy of the Romans. At its core, the Holy Roman Empire was Germanic. It was not an Empire, as it consisted of a collection of kingdoms and fiefdoms.\n\nCharles required his nieces to renounce their claim to the imperial throne in favour of their cousin Maria Theresa in 1719 by marrying Frederick Augustus of Saxony and Charles Albert of Bavaria. He believed that it would secure his daughters\u2019 position, as Saxony and Bavaria \u2013 bitter rivals themselves \u2013 could not tolerate either gaining control of the Habsburg inheritance. Instead, he provided a legitimate claim on Habsburg territories.\n\nA family issue became a European one due to tensions within the Holy Roman Empire, caused by dramatic increases in the size and power of Bavaria, Prussia, and Saxony, mirrored by the post-1683 expansion of Habsburg power into lands previously held by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSince theoretically, the Holy Roman Emperor has always been a Habsburg since 1437, Bavaria and Saxony could both lay a claim on the throne. Soon other European powers like France began backing the claims of Charles Albert of Bavaria despite it accepting the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735\n\nCompounded by the failure to prepare Maria Theresa for her new role, many European statesmen were sceptical Austria could survive the contest that would follow Charles\u2019 death, which finally occurred in October 1740. In a matter of months, Europe was on a collision course for a prolonged War.\n\nCourse of the Austrian War of Succession\n\nThe war began on December 16, 1740, when Frederick II of Prussia invaded Silesia, one of the richest Habsburg provinces. His army defeated the Austrians at Mollwitz in April 1741 and overran Silesia.\n\nHis victory enhanced the suspicion in Europe that the Habsburg dominions were incapable of defending themselves, and thus ensured that the war would become general. Within a month, France\u2019s Charles-Louis-Auguste Fouquet, comte (later marshal and duc) de Belle-Isle, constructed an alliance with Bavaria and Spain and, later, with Saxony and Prussia against Austria.\n\nMaria Theresa derived her main foreign support from the British Empire, which feared that, if the French achieved hegemony in Europe, the British commercial and colonial empire would be untenable. Thus, the War of the Austrian Succession was, in part, one phase of the struggle between France and Britain that lasted from 1689 to 1815. As a consequence, the British would clash against their French counterparts in India during the Battle of Madras in 1746. It would end in a French victory.\n\nThe invasion of Austria and Bohemia by the French and Bavarian forces fell apart for lack of unity of purpose and military capability. Austria temporarily neutralized Prussia by allowing it to retain Silesia in July 1742, drove the French and Bavarians out of Bohemia (1742), and overran Bavaria. Austria\u2019s allies\u2014the British, Hanoverians, and Hessians\u2014defeated the French at the Battle of Dettingen (June 27, 1743) in Bavaria.\n\nThis Second Silesian War was concluded by the Treaty of Dresden in December 1745. It confirmed Prussian possession of Silesia.\n\nThe last major French success was Marshal Maurice de Saxe\u2019s conquest of the Austrian Netherlands (1745\u201346), which followed his great victory at the Battle of Fontenoy on May 11, 1745. From 1746 to 1748 the war dragged on indecisively.\n\nThe British had withdrawn their army to England to oppose the French-supported efforts of the young pretender, Charles Edward, to win the thrones of Scotland and England for the Stuarts. The financial burden finally pushed the powers to the conference table.\n\nEnd of the War of the Austrian Succession\n\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) by which Maria Theresa was confirmed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary. The treaty reflected that stalemate since most of the commercial issues that had led to the war were left unresolved, and many of the signatories were unhappy with the terms. Although the war had nearly bankrupted the state, Louis XV of France withdrew from the Low Countries for minimal benefit, to the dismay of France\u2019s nobility and populace.\n\nThe Spanish considered their gains in Italy inadequate since they had failed to recover Menorca or Gibraltar and viewed the reassertion of British commercial rights in the Americas as an insult.\n\nAlthough Maria Theresa was acknowledged as her father\u2019s heir, she did not consider that a concession and deeply resented Britain\u2019s role in forcing her to cede Silesia to Prussia. For British statesmen, the war demonstrated the vulnerability of George II\u2019s German possession of Hanover to Prussia, and many politicians considered they had received little benefit from the enormous subsidies paid to Austria.\n\nThe result was the realignment known as the Diplomatic Revolution in which Austria aligned itself with France, which marked the end of their centuries-old enmity, and Prussia became an ally of Britain. The new alliances would fight the 1756 to 1763 Seven Years\u2019 War.\n\nWar of the Austrian Succession-Download PDF Here\n\nFind out the details regarding the UPSC Syllabus by visiting the linked article.

Its foundation came at a time when many universities were being established across western Europe in the belief that they would give prestige to the state in which they were located and that their graduates, clergy for the most part, would perform a vital service as civil administrators. By the 1590s England had two long established universities, each with an expanding group of colleges, and Scotland four. The idea of a university college for Ireland emerged at a time when the English state was strengthening its control over the kingdom and when Dublin was beginning to function as a capital city. The group of citizens, lay and clerical, who were main promoters of the scheme believed that the establishment of a university was an essential step in bringing Ireland into the mainstream of European learning and in strengthening the Protestant Reformation within the country.\n\nThe organisational design of the new institution was influenced by Oxford, Cambridge and continental precursors, but from the beginning it was an autonomous corporation governed by \u2018provost and fellows\u2019, committed to teaching and to scholarship, the first and (as it turned out) only college of the degree-awarding University of Dublin. The College site, lying some distance east of the small walled city, was far larger than the small community of fellows and students required, and the first brick buildings of the 1590s occupied only a small part of what is now Front Square. But from the beginning the College\u2019s library was a priority, and the energy with which early Trinity scholars (notably Luke Challoner and James Ussher) assembled the initial collections of books marked Trinity out from other sixteenth-century foundations. Many of its early graduates, well grounded in philosophy and theology, proceeded to clerical ordination in the state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland.\n\nDuring the next fifty years the community grew: endowments, including landed estates, were secured, new fellowships founded, a curriculum devised and statutes determining internal governance were framed. The international reputation of Ussher, one of its first alumni, helped place the College on the European map. But its existence was gravely threatened at two points in the seventeenth century, first when central government collapsed in the wake of the 1641 rising, followed by the temporary eclipse of the Church of Ireland in the wake of Cromwell\u2019s victories; secondly, with the roller-coaster events of 1689-91, when Tyrconnell\u2019s short-lived Catholic government closed the university, expelled the fellows and students, and converted the buildings into a Jacobite barracks. The library however was spared.\n\nDespite such dramatic interruptions, the College had become a much more substantial institution by the end of the seventeenth century. Many of the early buildings had recently been replaced, and a number of the fellows, notably William Molyneux and St. George Ashe were centrally involved in the Dublin Philosophical Society, a small body that was closely in touch with the \u2018new learning\u2019 in London.\n\nThe following century was an era of political stability in Ireland, thanks to the firm monopoly on political power held by the land-owning and largely Church of Ireland upper class, and the College was in material terms a great beneficiary from this state of affairs: its landed income grew very substantially in the course of the century and it enjoyed the recurring patronage of the Irish parliament across College Green, evident in the scale and quality of its new buildings. The first structure dating from this era was a massive new library (1712-32), initiated while George Berkeley, another celebrated alumnus of the College, was librarian; its size, far greater than then required, reflected long-sighted enlightenment ambitions, and it was followed by a string of other classical buildings on the western half of the campus: the Printing House (1733-4), the West Front (1752-9), the Dining Hall (c.1760-65), and the Provost\u2019s House (1759-61). During the second half of the century Parliament Square slowly emerged, shaped by the Public Theatre (1777-86) and the new Chapel (1787-98), which were designed from afar by George III\u2019s architect, Sir William Chambers. The great building drive was completed in the early nineteenth century by the residential quadrangles of Botany Bay and New Square.\n\nThese buildings reflected a seriousness of purpose absent from English universities of that era. The fellows were generally hard-worked, both as teachers and administrators; the general curriculum was adapted, albeit slowly, and most of the outstanding Irish politicians and writers of the eighteenth century (Swift, Burke, Goldsmith, Grattan, Fitzgibbon, Tone) were Trinity graduates, the influence of their university discernible in their writings and speeches.\n\nSince the early days, the power of College provosts to re-shape the university had been very considerable: most of them were ordained clergy, but two eighteenth-century laymen who held the office stand out: Francis Andrews (1758-74), whose chief monument is the sumptuous Provost\u2019s House, but who also encouraged science with his endowment of a chair of astronomy and an observatory; and his successor, John Hely-Hutchinson (1774-94), who was an enlightened lawyer but an adversarial public figure: he oversaw the foundation of chairs of modern languages and widened the composition of the student body; Catholics were permitted to enter and take degrees from 1793. Not for the last time, political controversy in the world outside came to be powerfully reflected among the student body in the lead-up to the 1798 rebellion, in which ex-students were involved on both sides, most famously Wolfe Tone.\n\nThe undergraduate curriculum was a prescribed general course, embracing classics, mathematics, a limited exposure to science and some philosophical texts. This began to change from the 1830s when it became possible to specialise for degrees with honours, or moderatorships, in mathematics, in ethics and logic, and in classics. In 1851 a moderatorship in experimental science was added (embracing physics, chemistry and mineralogy at first, and later geology, zoology and botany, which in 1871 was split into two moderatorships, natural and experimental science). And new humanities disciplines emerged as moderatorship subjects at the same time \u2013 in history and modern literature.\n\nThe professional schools were also transformed in the course of the nineteenth century: divinity had been taught since the foundation of the College, but this was now systematised. The Law School was reorganised, and medical teaching placed on a much stronger footing, helped by the emergence early in the century of a group of medical teachers who gained international eminence (notably James Macartney, Robert Graves and William Stokes), practitioners who divided their time between clinical teaching and the lecture theatre. The Engineering School was established in 1842 and was one of the first of its kind in the English-speaking world. Student numbers overall increased in the post-Waterloo generation, and the vibrancy of the institution is evident from the variety of associations and clubs in the city that were dominated by the university. The Dublin University Magazine (1833-82) became one of the most widely circulating monthly reviews in Ireland or Britain, conservative in its politics, highly original in its literary coverage and on occasions quite subversive, not unlike its original College sponsors.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1900 twenty new professorial chairs were founded, and individual scholarship flourished as never before: in mathematics and science William Rowan Hamilton, the Lloyds, George Salmon, George Fitzgerald and John Joly spent most of their working careers based in the College, and in the humanities it was the classicists who led the field in terms of international celebrity.\n\nThe expansion of the College\u2019s teaching activity during the nineteenth century was evident in the changing campus landscape, most strikingly with the Museum Building (1853-7), designed to accommodate civil engineers and geologists. By the late nineteenth century the College had gone some way to fill the ancient site with an ensemble of academic buildings and recreational facilities, museums and terraces of student residences. And new buildings to the east of the College Park reflected the increasing importance of science and medicine in College priorities. However purpose-built science laboratories came late; it was thanks primarily to the philanthropy of the Guinness family that some really fine architecture began to grace the East End when the Physics and Botany buildings appeared c.1903-06.\n\nBehind its high iron railings the Victorian university had become something of a self-contained community, out of sympathy with the increasingly nationalist city and focused on an expanding British empire for opportunities for its graduates. During the sixty-year war of attrition between British governments and the Catholic hierarchy over higher education policy in Ireland, Trinity struggled to accommodate itself to what was a changing Ireland. Between 1873 and 1908 a variety of schemes were proposed that would have made the College a member of a federated Irish (or Dublin) university; these were strenuously and effectively resisted as threats to its independence. As part of this, the College gradually re-positioned itself to become a nondenominational institution: in 1873 all religious tests (except those connected with the Divinity School) were abolished. However despite this, the fractious struggle to retain the College\u2019s separate identity meant that when the battle over Irish higher education was finally resolved in 1908 with the creation of the federal National University, it left a difficult legacy for the defenders of the older institution.\n\nPower within the College was slowly changing too. The creation in 1874 of the University Council, a body representative of non-fellow professors, gave control over the shaping of courses and appointments to the teaching departments, and in 1911 membership of the College Board itself was somewhat widened. But power remained with the senior fellows until the provostship of Albert McConnell (1951-74), who managed to widen the collegiate governance of the College and initiate major administrative reform. More momentously, women students became part of the College: admitted for the first time in 1904, within a decade they amounted to 16 per cent of the student body. But it was not until 1958 that the first female professor sat on the Board, and 1972 before female students could reside within the campus (a women\u2019s hall of residence had however been established in 1908). In 1986 women accounted for more than half of the full-time student body, and have retained that ascendancy ever since. In 2021 Trinity elected its first female provost, Linda Doyle.\n\nThe First World War marked a general turning point in the College\u2019s fortunes, the human cost recognised in the hall of honour (1928), erected in Front Square. The Easter Rising of 1916 had engulfed the College environs, and Trinity was lucky to escape serious physical damage. However wartime inflation and the drastic erosion of its assets threatened the College\u2019s peacetime future. In the new Free State that emerged after the War of Independence in 1922, Trinity lacked the benign support of government that it had always enjoyed, and the new national administration, financially weak and recovering from civil war, had more pressing priorities. Therefore, at a time when the newer universities in Britain were growing in strength and prestige, Trinity found itself without the revenues required to advance research and scholarship in what was an increasingly science-centred world.\n\nStudent numbers however held up well in the inter-war period, but with very limited philanthropic support and none from the state, Trinity\u2019s capacity to develop was severely constrained. Some new disciplines were introduced at little cost, notably degree courses in commerce, economics and politics, and the first night-school diplomas, ranging from art history to public administration, were very successful. But it was only after the end of the Second World War that the university once again sought financial support from government; it was promptly given. That modest agreement in 1947 marks the beginnings of Trinity\u2019s transition towards becoming a large state-funded university, although this was not apparent until the 1970s. In the meantime, cramped by continuing church restrictions on Catholic attendance, the College increased its enrollment of students from Britain and the United States at a time when overall numbers were falling below pre-war levels. In some years around 1960, nearly half the student body was coming from outside Ireland (north and south).\n\nThe overall student population remained small until the mid-1960s, when the cap was raised by a third to 4,000. At that same point the Irish government became involved in capital investment within the College, sharing the costs of building a new library with the College\u2019s fundraisers. In the same period private philanthropy, again led by the Guinness family, and international philanthropic trusts, notably the Wellcome, were dramatically improving the stock of medical and science buildings, and enabling the development of new disciplines such as biochemistry, genetics and preventive medicine.\n\nThe real growth in student numbers began in the 1970s, reflecting the introduction of free second-level education and of third-level student grants, the removal of the Catholic episcopal \u2018ban\u2019 (in 1970), the widening career opportunities for women and a stronger underlying economy in Ireland. Trinity\u2019s recruitment field became much more heavily concentrated within the Republic of Ireland, and College policy in the early 1970s was to bring down the non-Irish proportion to 15 per cent. The new \u2018massification\u2019 of higher education took physical form with the construction of a large Arts and Social Sciences Building on the south side of the campus (opened in 1978). This was almost entirely funded by the national exchequer.\n\nThe diversification of the curriculum continued in the last quarter of the century, with the mushroom growth of information science and computing, the medical therapies, nursing, and teacher training, the latter developed in conjunction with the three Dublin teacher-training colleges with which Trinity had become associated in the 1970s. The College also became involved in the oversight and accreditation of technical degree courses delivered across Dublin by the Vocational Colleges (until the Dublin Institute of Technology (now Technological University Dublin) was established as an independent degree-awarding body). But a more generic change was the huge expansion of postgraduate activity, both of taught courses and research degrees, many of these closely related to the professions. And by the 1990s post-doctoral researchers, scattered across all disciplines, had become a new segment of the academic community, reflecting the scale and complexity of research teams and the opportunities for research funding at national and European levels.\n\nIn the new scheme of things, as the university came to depend on the state it became publicly accountable. Oversight of the universities became the responsibility of the Higher Education Authority, established as a statutory body in 1971, its role and powers being greatly extended by the 1997 Universities Act. The state by the late 1990s had become the principal source of the College\u2019s revenues, both through the direct grant and as a consequence of the state\u2019s adopting a \u2018free fees\u2019 policy for undergraduate tuition. But despite the ever-increasing involvement of the state in directing higher education, the contribution of the state grant to the College\u2019s total income began to decline in the following decade, falling to 27 per cent by 2010 and actually counting for less than the College\u2019s research income (much of the latter coming of course from Irish state agencies). Research income from all sources had contributed a mere one million pounds in 1981, whereas in 2009 it peaked at just under 90 million euro.\n\nThere have been two major internal waves of academic reorganisation over the last fifty years: the incorporation in 1968 of all academic departments into six faculty units, headed by deans, and the integration of academic departments into schools in 2004-08, with in turn a reduction in the number of faculties to three. Faculty deans have now come to play a strategic role in the management of the university. These changes since the 1960s facilitated the incorporation of many new teaching departments (including Business Studies, Dentistry, Drama and Film Studies, History of Art, Linguistics, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Psychology, Sociology and Statistics). And the recent programme of academic restructuring facilitated the establishment of five large transdisciplinary research institutes in areas of particular international strength, one focusing on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices (CRANN), one on Neuroscience (TCIN), one on International Integration Studies (IIIS), one on research in the Arts and Humanities (the Trinity Long Room Hub), and the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI).\n\nIn the wake of the huge growth in Irish student numbers attending the College, there was a new commitment to internationalisation in recent years and a move back towards the recruitment of international students, initially in the field of medicine, latterly across all disciplines, with a particular focus on Asia. The College was an early supporter of undergraduate exchange programmes (notably the E.U.-supported Erasmus/Socrates scheme), which have been in operation since the 1960s, and it has long been a favoured destination for U.S. visiting students. By 2021-22, 8.9 per cent of the student population came from other E.U. countries (including Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, excluding Ireland and the United Kingdom), 6.6 per cent from the United States of America, 14.1 per cent from other parts of the world (not the E.U., Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland or the United States of America), and 14.4 per cent from other parts of the world (not the E.U., Ireland or the United States of America); in all, the College\u2019s population of 20,430 registered undergraduate and postgraduate students was drawn from some 116 nationalities (outside of Ireland).\n\nIn 1993 the College also began to boost recruitment from within Dublin city by developing a series of access programmes (TAP). The aim was to raise the number of young adults from socio-economic and ethnic groups underrepresented in higher education coming to university. At the same time, new efforts were made to recruit mature students. In 2022, approximately 25% of entrants to the university were from groups underrepresented in Irish higher education, comprising socio-economically disadvantaged young adult and mature students, and students with a disability.\n\nAnother major change in the second half of the twentieth century was in the composition of the academic staff: it became progressively more international. Until the 1930s the great majority had been doubly indigenous, being Irish-born and Dublin University graduates, including many who returned, like Ernest Walton who came back from Cambridge in 1934 and shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1951, arising out of his work two decades earlier on splitting the atom. The dominance of indigenous graduates in the academic community had all but disappeared by the 1980s, and the increasingly cosmopolitan character of the College helped drive change in the curriculum, in research, and in the general appetite for innovation across the institution. And there was meanwhile an utter transformation in the scale of the academic community, from the modest group of 125 who had made up the total academic staff in 1950.\n\nIn terms of physical development since that time, the College contributed to the small stock of fine modernist architecture in Dublin, beginning with the Berkeley Library (1965-6), the Arts Building (1977-8), the O\u2019Reilly Institute (1989), the Dental Hospital (1995-8), the Ussher Library (1999-2001) and the Long Room Hub (2008-10). But by 2000 the College had begun to burst out of its campus home, what with a huge expansion of its halls of residence off campus and with Nursing, Drama, and the Social Sciences putting down new roots a short distance away. But the most ambitious construction project in the College\u2019s history, the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute in Pearse St (2008-11), has become the strongest physical statement of the College\u2019s outward movement. The opening of this development, which now houses five academic schools, coincided with the development of the Trinity Academic Medical Centre, an alliance between the university and its two main teaching hospitals, St James\u2019s and AMNCH, Tallaght. And west along Pearse St, the Science Gallery was opened in 2008 as part of the new Naughton Institute: within a short time the Gallery became a highly successful centre for \u2018science outreach\u2019 and art-science collaboration, exploiting to the full the potential for creative interaction between college and capital city. Science Gallery Dublin held its final exhibition in January 2022. Strategic redevelopment along Pearse St is continuing, notably with the construction of a new Business School, completed in 2019, which was followed by a major new student residential block built further west along Pearse St on the campus perimeter and opened in 2022.\n\nThrough times of turmoil as well as progress, Trinity has been the crucible for change across more than four centuries. Today, as Trinity imagines the world in the 21st century, it seeks to inspire new generations in new ways."}, {"url": "https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=mmccaul", "page_content": "Dr Mathew McCauley is Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology at TCD.

Lauded for his wit and flamboyance and widely appreciated works like The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde got a royal scholarship to study classics at Trinity College Dublin from 1871-1874. Amongst the most notable alumni of Trinity College Dublin, Wilde got inspired for many of his works while studying Greek literature there. Wilde was a meritorious student and also won the Berkeley gold medal in Greek in his final year of college. After that, he went on to study at Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nJonathan Swift\n\nCourtesy: Biography.com\n\nJonathan Swift was an Anglo-Irish satirist, writer and an essayist. He is largely known for his internationally famed works such as A Tale of a Tub, A Modest Proposal and Gulliver\u2019s Travels. He joined Trinity College Dublin in 1682 and his education was sponsored by his cousin Willoughby. As one of the notable alumni at Trinity College Dublin, he attended a four-year BA degree at the college and also studied Latin, Hebrew and Greek and further explored Aristotelian philosophy in detail.\n\nPhelim Boyle\n\nCourtesy: Canadian Chinese Finance Association\n\nBorn in Northern Ireland, Irish Economist and Actuary Phelim Boyle completed his BSc from Queen\u2019s University Belfast and later on went to attend Trinity College, Dublin for pursuing an MSc and PhD in Applied Mathematics. One of the key mentions in our list of Trinity College Dublin notable alumni, he was the recipient of IAFE Financial Engineer of the Year in 2005 and is best known for initiating Monte Carlo methods in option pricing and is considered a pioneer in the field of Quantitative Finance.\n\nSean Barrett\n\nCourtesy: Dubbing WIkia\n\nSean Declan Conrad Barrett is an Irish economist. His major areas of expertise are the civil aviation sector and he has also worked on public health and the economy of public policy. Apart from attending the college, Barrett was also a senior lecturer in the economic department in Trinity College, Dublin. He has served several terms on the board of the college and was elected as a pro-chancellor of the university in 2018. His name is also identified with the early policies of the progressive democrats.\n\nAisling Bea\n\nCourtesy: Popsugar\n\nThe well-known Irish Comedian, Actor and Screenwriter, Aisling Bea graduated from Trinity College, Dublin with a French and Philosophy degree and then further went to study in London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. One of the most notable alumni of Trinity College Dublin, Bea conceptualized her own sitcom named C\u2019est La Bea and was also a part of a sketch group called HBAM at Trinity. She has worked in many popular series like Paul Rudd\u2019s Living with Yourself, Dead Boss, Cardinal Burns, amongst others.\n\nWilliam C. Campbell\n\nCourtesy: Irish America Magazine\n\nBorn on 28 June, 1930, Campbell is an Irish biologist and parasitologist. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1952 with first class honors in zoology after which he went down to attend University of Wisconsin in order to earn his PhD. Another prominent one in our list of Trinity College Dublin notable alumni, Campbell is best known for his work in discovering novel therapy against infections caused by roundworms and was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for this in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.\n\nSamuel Beckett\n\nCourtesy: The British Library\n\nThe Nobel Laureate Samuel Beckett acclaimed for his short stories and plays such as Waiting for Godot is also one of the most notable alumni of Trinity College Dublin. The Irish playwright studied his bachelor\u2019s degree at Trinity in 1927.

The partnership is aimed at helping countries to develop their own radiation therapy education programmes.\n\nA webinar series will be launched to provide up-to-date information on recent and new developments impacting the RTT profession and share experiences in the development of radiation therapy education programmes. Interested participants can register for the first webinar on 5 July 2021, which will focus on the evolving roles of RTTs. Following webinars will deal with topics such as development of a learning community, and strategies in advancing the professional profile and education of RTTs.\n\nRTTs are the health professionals responsible for the accurate preparation and delivery of radiation therapy protocols to cancer patients. They also provide key psychosocial support to patients on their cancer treatment journey. However, the education of RTTs globally is very varied, ranging from limited or no radiation therapy-specific education to full 4 years dedicated degree programmes, such as those offered by the Trinity College Dublin.\n\n\u201cThe Trinity College Dublin has had a solid history of collaboration with the IAEA,\u201d said Eduardo Zubizarreta, Head of the IAEA\u2019s Applied Radiation Biology and Radiotherapy Section. \u201cOne notable achievement was the Train-the-Trainers Programme for RTTs we have jointly developed, together with the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, ESTRO. This initiative, which saw its 11th edition in 2019, has been an important driving force in the recognition of the RTT profession, particularly in Europe.\u201d\n\nRadiation therapy is applied to 50-60% of all cancer patients at some point in their cancer care and is responsible for 40% of cancer cures, whether on its own or in combination with other therapies, such as surgery and/or chemotherapy.\n\nMichelle Leech, Associate Professor in Radiation Therapy at Trinity, added that the RTT education was fundamental to the accurate and precise delivery of radiation therapy protocols. \u201cAt Trinity College Dublin, we are committed to providing the highest quality education to all health professionals working in the field of radiation oncology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look forward to adding the Trinity expertise to that of the IAEA in tackling this global inequality and ultimately improving patient care.\u201d\n\nThe Discipline of Radiation Therapy, at Trinity\u2019s School of Medicine, is a recognized world leader in radiation medicine education. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in radiation therapy, and has an active research programme, Applied Radiation Therapy Trinity (ARTT).\n\nThe IAEA supports countries in the use of nuclear and radiation medicine to fight a growing incidence of chronic diseases, such as cancer. It assists its Member States in the procurement of equipment, research, training of medical professionals and in carrying out quality assessments, among others."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Dublin", "page_content": "University of Dublin, the oldest university in Ireland, founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland and endowed by the city of Dublin.\n\nIt was originally intended that Trinity College would be the first of many constituent colleges of the University of Dublin, but none of them have been established. Today the two names\u2014the University of Dublin and Trinity College Dublin\u2014are considered interchangeable in everyday use, though there are legal and other differences between these entities.\n\nThe full benefits of the university\u2014degrees, fellowships, scholarships, and emoluments\u2014were limited to Anglicans for many years, but in 1873 all religious requirements were eliminated. The library, called the Library of Trinity College Dublin, identifies itself as the largest library in Ireland, and it contains many illuminated manuscripts, including the famous Book of Kells."}, {"url": "https://www.tcd.ie/library/research-collections/book-of-kells.php", "page_content": "You are here Research Collections > The Book of Kells\n\nThe Book of Kells\n\nThe Book of Kells Exhibition\n\nWhat is the Book of Kells?\n\nThe Book of Kells (Trinity College Dublin MS 58) contains the four Gospels in Latin based on the Vulgate text which St Jerome completed in 384AD, intermixed with readings from the earlier Old Latin translation. The Gospel texts are prefaced by other texts, including \"canon tables\", or concordances of Gospel passages common to two or more of the evangelists; summaries of the gospel narratives (Breves causae); and prefaces characterizing the evangelists (Argumenta).\n\nThe book is written on vellum (prepared calfskin) in a bold and expert version of the script known as \"insular majuscule\". It contains 340 folios, now measuring approximately 330 x 255 mm; they were severely trimmed, and their edges gilded, in the course of rebinding in the 19th century.\n\nWhere and when was the Book of Kells written?\n\nThe date and place of origin of the Book of Kells have attracted a great deal of scholarly controversy. The majority academic opinion now tends to attribute it to the scriptorium of Iona (Argyllshire), but conflicting claims have located it in Northumbria or in Pictland in eastern Scotland. A monastery founded around 561 by St Colum Cille on Iona, an island off Mull in western Scotland, became the principal house of a large monastic confederation. In 806, following a Viking raid on the island which left 68 of the community dead, the Columban monks took refuge in a new monastery at Kells, County Meath, and for many years the two monasteries were governed as a single community. It must have been close to the year 800 that the Book of Kells was written, although there is no way of knowing if the book was produced wholly at Iona or at Kells, or partially at each location.\n\nWhy is the Book of Kells famous?\n\nThe manuscript\u2019s celebrity derives largely from the impact of its lavish decoration, the extent and artistry of which is incomparable. Abstract decoration and images of plant, animal and human ornament punctuate the text with the aim of glorifying Jesus\u2019 life and message, and keeping his attributes and symbols constantly in the eye of the reader.\n\nThere are full pages of decoration for the canon tables; symbols of the evangelists Matthew (the Man), Mark (the Lion), Luke (the Calf) and John (the Eagle); the opening words of the Gospels; the Virgin and Child; a portrait of Christ; complex narrative scenes, the earliest to survive in gospel manuscripts, representing the arrest of Christ and his temptation by the Devil. The Chi Rho page (folio 34r), introducing Matthew\u2019s account of the nativity, is the single most famous page in medieval art. There are portraits of Matthew and John, but no portrait of Mark or Luke survives. These were probably executed, like other major pages of the manuscript, on single leaves and they are presumed to have become detached over time and lost. In all, around 30 folios went missing in the medieval and early modern periods.\n\nHow many artists produced the Book of Kells?\n\nThree artists seem to have produced the major decorated pages. One of them, whose work can be seen on the Chi Rho page, was capable of ornament of such extraordinary fineness and delicacy that his skills have been likened to those of a goldsmith. Four major scribes copied the text. Each displayed characteristics and stylistic traits while working within a scriptorium style. One, for example, was responsible only for text, and was in the habit of leaving the decoration of letters at the beginning of verses to an artist; while another scribe, who may have been the last in date, tended to use bright colours - red, purple, yellow - for the text, and to fill blank spaces with the unnecessary repetition of certain passages. The extent to which there was an identity between scribe and artist is among the key unanswered questions about the manuscript.\n\nWhat pigments did the Book of Kells artists use?\n\nA range of pigments was employed, including blue made from indigo or woad, native to northern Europe. Recent research in the Library of Trinity College Dublin has indicated that blue from lapis lazuli was probably not used in the manuscript as had previously been thought. Orpiment (yellow arsenic sulphide) was used to produce a vibrant yellow pigment. Red came from red lead or from organic sources which are difficult at present to identify. A copper green, reacting with damp, was responsible for perforating the vellum on a number of folios. The artists employed a technique of adding as many as three pigments on top of a base layer.\n\nHow was the Book of Kells used in the Middle Ages?\n\nThe transcription of the text was remarkably careless, in many cases due to eye-skip, with letters and whole words omitted. Text already copied on one page (folio 218v) was repeated on folio 219r, with the words on 218v elegantly expunged by the addition of red crosses. Such carelessness, taken together with the sumptuousness of the book, have led to the conclusion that it was designed for ceremonial use on special liturgical occasions such as Easter rather than for daily services.\n\nThe history of the Book of Kells\n\nThe Book of Kells seldom comes to view in the historical record. The Annals of Ulster, describing it as \"the chief treasure of the western world\", record that it was stolen in 1006 for its ornamental cumdach (shrine). It remained at Kells throughout the Middle Ages, venerated as the great gospel book of St Colum Cille, a relic of the saint, as indicated by a poem added in the 15th century to folio 289v. In the late 11th and 12th centuries, blank pages and spaces on folios 5v-7v and 27r were used to record property transactions relating to the monastery at Kells. In 1090, it was reported by the Annals of Tigernach, that relics of Colum Cille were brought to Kells from Donegal. These relics included \u2018the two gospels\u2019, one of them probably the Book of Kells, the other perhaps the Book of Durrow. Following the rebellion of 1641, the church at Kells lay in ruins, and around 1653 the book was sent to Dublin by the governor of Kells, Charles Lambert, Earl of Cavan, in the interests of its safety. A few years later it reached Trinity College, the single constituent college of the University of Dublin, through the agency of Henry Jones, a former scoutmaster general to Cromwell\u2019s army in Ireland and Vice-Chancellor of the University, when he became Bishop of Meath in 1661. It has been on display in the Old Library at Trinity College from the mid 19th century, and now attracts in excess of 500,000 visitors a year. Since 1953 it has been bound in four volumes. Two volumes can normally be seen, one opened to display a major decorated page, and one to show two pages of script."}, {"url": "https://www.tcd.ie/Genetics/research/campbell.php", "page_content": "You are here Research\n\nNeurovascular Genetics laboratory, Trinity College Dublin\n\nEmail: matthew.campbell@tcd.ie\n\nBiographical Information\n\nDr Matthew Campbell graduated from University College Dublin (UCD) in 2006 with a PhD in Biochemistry followed by Post-doctoral research in Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in Human Molecular Genetics (2006-2012). He has published extensively on the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to modulate levels of distinct tight junction proteins at the blood-brain barrier/inner blood retina barrier (BBB/iBRB) in vivo. Additionally, he has published numerous articles focused on understanding the molecular pathology of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nResearch Interests\n\nMy laboratory focuses primarily on the molecular biology and physiology of the vasculature associated with neural tissues. We use genetic and molecular biology based approaches to explore the interplay between neural tissues and the systemic circulation. One major topic of my research is centred on the tight junctions located between microvascular endothelial cells of the blood brain and inner blood retina barriers (BBB/iBRB) and how these barriers function in health and disease. We aim to develop technologies to address an unmet clinical need for a range of neural conditions that currently have limited forms of therapeutic intervention and these include Alzheimer Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), traumatic brain injury (TBI), chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nIn addition to translational interests, our lab is also heavily focused on elucidating the under-lying mechanisms of the diseases we are studying and this has led to novel findings associated with the molecular pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and schizophrenia. Identification of novel therapeutic targets has the potential to rapidly translate to new medicines and this is a strong focus of the lab at present.\n\nWhat we work on\n\nRNAi mediated modulation of the BBB and iBRB\n\nWe use in vitro and in vivo methods to investigate the role of distinct tight junction proteins in regulating the BBB and iBRB and how these proteins function in health and disease. Given that almost every neurodegenerative condition has BBB dysfunction as a central hallmark or co-morbidity, a greater understanding of the role played by the molecular components of the BBB is essential in identifying novel therapeutic targets for conditions such as Alzheimer Disease (AD), Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neurotrauma. Modulation of the BBB is also being explored as a strategy to enhance drug delivery to the brain and retina while also being able to alleviate cerebral edema associated with neural malignancies.\n\nGeneration of transgenic/knockout mice\n\nIn order to better explore the role of distinct components of the BBB/iBRB in mediating the development of a range of neural/ophthalmological conditions, we generate murine models in which we can regulate key components of the tight junctions at the BBB/iBRB. In effect, this allows us to establish disease models to better elucidate the role played by the BBB/iBRB in the development of disease states.\n\nElucidation of the molecular aetiology of neural diseases\n\nWhile our lab is heavily focused on translational research and the development of novel therapies for neural conditions, we are actively engaged in research to identify unresolved molecular mechanisms that pre-dispose certain individuals to neural or retinal disease. We are interested in elucidating complex signalling pathways that lead to the development of conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) a common form of central retinal blindness that can affect almost 1 in 10 individuals over the age of 55. Specifically, we are interested in resolving the role of inflammation in the progression of neural/retinal conditions.\n\nInterested in working with us?\n\nWe are always interested in recruiting talented people to the lab and in supporting applications for personal PhD and postdoctoral fellowships.\n\nPlease contact Matthew (matthew.campbell@tcd.ie) for further details.\n\nRelevant links\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nDelaney, C, Farrell, M, Doherty, CP, Brennan, K, O\u2019Keeffe, E, Greene, C, Kelly, E, Birmingham, N, Hickey, P, Cronin, S, Savvides, SN, Doyle, SL, Campbell, M .
