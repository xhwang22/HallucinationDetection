He grew up in Bowling Green Kentucky as his family moved there in 1953. From a young age, showed great interest in films and filmmaking.\n\nThe westerns which were directed by Howard Hawks and John Ford especially captivated him. He was also really fascinated by the low budget horror films of the 1950s like The Thing From Another World and high-budgeted science fiction such as Forbidden Planet. Carpenter began to film short horror films on 8 mm long before he had even entered high school.\n\nJohn\u2019s father Howard Ralph Carpenter, was an established musician and music professor as well who influenced him in polishing his music skills. John attended Western Kentucy University where his father presided over the music department.\n\nLater on he transferred to the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts in 1968. In his early film course at USC Cinema, Carpenter directed and wrote an 8-min short film, Captain Voyeur. The year 2011 brought rediscovery of this film in the USC archives which proved to be interesting due to the revelation of its elements which would be appearing in his later film, Halloween (1978).\n\nCarpenter collaborated with the producer John Longenecker as a film editor, co-writer and music composer for The Resurrection of Broncho Billy (1970).It won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nIt was blown-up to 35mm and sixty prints were made.\n\nJohn Carpenter\u2019s first feature as a director was Dark Star (1974)which was a science fiction black comedy he had co-written with Dan O\u2019Bannon (who later wrote Alien, and borrowed freely from Dark Star). It tells the tale of four astronauts who are on a mission to abolish unstable worlds with hope to make future space exploration and colonization a safe journey. It depicted a postmodernist space-age environment years before the arrival of Alien (1979).It was a challenging film to make with the cost of $60,000 only and O\u2019Bannon and Carpenter had to multitask vigorously. It became an instant cult classic. Efforts made by Carpenter did not go unnoticed and Hollywood praised his filmmaking abilities within the limits of a restricted budget.\n\nAssault on Precinct (1976) was Carpenter\u2019s next film which was low-budget thriller greatly influenced by the film Rio Bravo. It depicts the story of a police station which is under attack by a viciously ruthless gang and how the characters have to endure brutal attack which is carried out by a group of faceless invaders. Carpenter not only directed and scored it but under the pseudonym of John T. Chance, edited it as well. Carpenter enjoyed complete creative control over it enabling him to craft a very violent and stylized tale of urban violence. Assault on Precinct marked the time when Debra Hill worked with Carpenter for the first time and later on went on to become a prominent lead in some of his most important films.\n\nLauren Hutton\u2019s thriller Someone\u2019s Watching Me! was both written and directed by Carpenter. This TV movie happens to be the tale of a single working woman who finds out upon her arrival in L.A. that someone is stalking her.\n\nA thriller film of 1978, Eyes of Laura Mars directed by Irvin Kershner and starring Tommy Lee Jones and Faye Dunaway was adapted from a spec script titled Eyes in collaboration with David Zelag Goodman and written by John Carpenter which became his major studio film career.\n\nThe most successful film of his career, Halloween (1978) was a commercial hit which gave birth to the slasher film genre. It became one of the most enduring and influential films of the horror genre. It was originally Irwin Yablans idea titled as The Babysitter Murders. With another suggestion from Yablans that the movie to be set during Halloween, Carpenter took the idea and developed a story. A very simple storyline of a babysitter being menaced by a stalker and serial killer Carpenter produced a powerful narrative with a relatively small budget. Creating a memorable and frightening experience, Halloween grossed over $65 million initially making it among one of the most successful independent films.\n\nThe theme composed by Carpenter became recognizable apart from the movie in addition to the critical and commercial success of Halloween.\n\nThe year 1979 brought about the first of numerous collaborations with the actor Kurt Rusell when the TV movie Elvis was directed.\n\nThe success of Halloween was followed with The Fog (1980) co-written by Hill was a spooky revenge tale and was inspired by The Crawling Eye (1958)a monster film about monsters hiding in the clouds and horror comics like Tales from the Crypt.\n\nThe Fog\u2019s completion was a difficult process for Carpenter as there were production problems and negative reception mostly. The Fog is considered a minor horror classic by Carpenter. It is a beautifully photographed atmospheric ghost story where the paranormal entities are result of the guilt of a small town community. To make it more frightening, additional shots were added including numerous new scenes. The Fog turned out to be a commercial success grossing over $21,000,000 in the U.S alone and was made on a budget of $1,000,000.\n\nCarpenter realized one of his dream projects Escape from New York (1981) which starred several actors that Carpenter had collaborated with before. Carpenter had its script in mind since the mid of 1970s. It presented a cynical picture of crime, greed, corruption, violence and selfishness found in existing America. It went on to become a critical and commercial success grossing over $25 million. And it not only received warm reception but also happened to become a seminal science fiction film creating various limitations.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s next film, The Thing (1982) is prominent for its special effects by Rob Bottin, matte artist Albert Whitlock\u2019s special visual effects and a score by Ennio Morricone. The cast comprised of rising star Kurt Russell and various respected artists like Richard Masur, Charles Hallahan, Wilford Brimley and Keith David.\n\nThe source material for The Thing came from a 1951 Howard Hawks film, it is more related to Who Goes There?, a John Campbell novella. The Thing was part of Carpenter\u2019s Apocalyptic Trilogy having Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness as other parts all having bleak endings for the characters.\n\nBeing a graphic horror film, it failed to appeal to the audiences as E.T. the Extra Terrestrial had just come out with a light hearted alien theme. It happened to be Carpenter\u2019s first financial disappointment.\n\nSoon after the post-production of The Thing had finished, Universal offered Carpenter to direct Firestarter which was based on a Stephen King\u2019s novel but when The Thing failed to do well, Universal replaced Carpenter by Mark L. Lester.\n\nChristine which was the 1983 adaptation of Stephen King novel of the same name, was Carpenter\u2019s next film. The plot focused around a high school nerd Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who purchases a discarded 1958 Plymouth Fury which happens to have demonic powers. As the car is rebuilt and restored, Arnie becomes unnaturally obsessed and faces horrendous consequences. The movie did respectable business and was well received by critics.\n\nMichael Douglas produced Starman (1984) and he chose Carpenter to be the director because of his repute as an action director who could convey a strong sentiment. The movie was favorably reviewed. It also earned Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Starman character played by Jeff Bridge. It earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Musical Score.\n\nAfter Carpenter\u2019s big budgeted action comedy Big Trouble in Little China (1986), getting his films financed was a struggle and Carpenter retreated to lower budget films.\n\nThe Exorcist III (1989) was also offered to Carpenter and he met with the writer and the co-author of the book Legionon which it was based. However, the seemed to create a clash on the climax resulting in Carpenter passing on the project.\n\nOver the course of 90s, Carpenter faced number of misfires in the form of Memoires of an Invisible Man (1992), Village of the Damned (1995) and Escape from L.A (1996)which were both critical and commercial failures. In the Mouth of Madness (1994) a Lovecraftian tribute, also failed to do well.\n\nJohn Carpenter was supposed to be directing the follow up project for Halloween called the Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998). But he demanded his starting fee to be 10 million dollars which his rationalized by stating that he had not received revenue from the original Halloween which was still a topic of contention between him and the director Moustapha Akkad after passing of 20 years. Carpenter walked away from the project eventually.\n\nFirst movie since Ghost of Mars, The Ward premiered at Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010. Lifetime Achievement Award from the Freak Show Horror Film Festival was awarded to Carpenter in 2010. He is to executively produce a new Halloween film releasing in October 2017."}, {"url": "http://www1.chapman.edu/~lhall/webpage/criticalhistory.html", "page_content": "Points of Difference\n\nFilms and novels differ in many ways, and because of these differences the way they convey their themes, plots, and characters will necessarily differ. Three of the most obvious differences between films and novels are found in the scale, the level of realism they convey, and the reflection of the author or filmmaker's ideology.\n\nA Question of Scale\n\nSince the screenplay for a standard feature film runs between 80 and 110 pages and a novel normally runs more than 200 pages, when a novel is adapted to film the story is necessarily shortened. The screenwriter, director, and producers make decisions to cut scenes, characters, and even major elements of the original piece in order to fit the standard 90 to 120 minute feature film length. Occasionally, the filmmakers will opt to make a longer film, but this is usually considered a risk, unless the original work is so well-known that the audience might invest the extra time in the theatre. (Kenneth Branaugh\u2019s Hamlet, for example, cuts very little of Shakespeare\u2019s original play and runs over three hours.) But the most common preference is to shorten the original story in some significant way.\n\nThe other option that is sometimes taken when adapting literature into film is the mini-series. These adaptations are necessarily television-based and lose some of the visual and aural quality found in films made for the wide-screen. They also run from three to six hours and are generally shown over a period of successive nights or weeks. These showings might include commercials (as was the case with the BBC/A&E version of Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice) or might be shown commercial-free, as in the PPS series, Masterpiece Theatre. In either case, the ultimate viewers will be video-tape or DVD renters or purchasers. The aesthetic value of these adaptations can be very different because of the length and the television-based viewing.\n\nIn any case, when adapting any work of literature\u2014most specifically a novel\u2014into film, the filmmakers must make some changes in scale. When writing an analysis of the adaptation, therefore, the student should carefully consider the value of these changes: how do they affect the ultimate impact of the work of art?\n\nWhat is Real?\n\nHenry James wrote that literature\u2019s aim is to present a version of real life. But each reader \u201csees\u201d a different vision of the work of literature, so the idea of reality is interpreted by each of those readers. Similarly, when filmmakers interpret the \u201creality\u201d found in a work of literature, the final vision reflects not only the ideas of the original author, but also the vision of the filmmakers.\n\nAdaptations can roughly be divided into two categories: straight or loose. For example, Jane Austen\u2019s Emma was adapted to film in 1996 in a Miramax production starring Gwyneth Paltrow. This version retained the original period, setting, and most of the plot and characterization. This production credited Jane Austen and made the most of the Nineteenth Century connection. In 1994, however, Amy Heckerling wrote and produced Clueless, set in contemporary Beverly Hills. Most of the plot and themes of Austen\u2019s original were retained, but many of the characters\u2019 names and all of the original setting were updated. Both adaptations have value in understanding Austen\u2019s work, and each should be considered as a valid, although different adaptations of the original.\n\nIdeology is Relative\n\nSometimes, however, a filmmaker\u2019s attempt to stay true to the original text is thwarted by contemporary sensibilities, and the screenwriter or director\u2019s ideology will come through the film when it was not present in the original work. For example, in Patricia Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Mansfield Park, a bold commentary about slavery is added to the film, where it is a mere reference in the novel. And in Emma Thompson\u2019s 1995 screenplay of Austen\u2019s Sense and Sensibility, she allows one of the main characters, Elinor Dashwood, to make a pointed commentary about the predicament of women in her society that Austen would not have been able to make in her novel. In each of these cases, the film adaptation is changed to project messages deemed important by the filmmakers, not by the original author.\n\nIn a similar way, Steven Spielberg made many ideological changes in his 1985 adaptation of Alice Walker\u2019s novel, The Color Purple. Many of these changes, it is assumed by Walker and various critics, were made in order to popularize the controversial novel. In this case the ideology of the novel was modified, and Walker found it necessary to write a book about her experience with the adaptation process. (The Same River Twice, Simon & Schuster, 1995). Thus, considering the themes as well as the ideological basis for the original work of literature is important in analyzing a film adaptation. Considering the contemporary context of both the original work and the film is important when writing about film adaptation."}, {"url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/1022364/the-failed-project-that-pushed-john-carpenter-to-make-escape-from-new-york/", "page_content": "Carpenter wrote \"Escape from New York\" in the early '70s. The antihero, Snake Plissken, was no doubt inspired by the fallout of the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam war, but Hollywood wasn't ready to project such a dark character and story onto the world. According to Cinephilia and Beyond, when Carpenter attempted to sell the script, studios passed because it was \"too violent, too scary, and too weird.\" So Carpenter put the script away and focused all of his attention on the legendary slasher flick, \"Halloween.\" I guess violence is acceptable if it's committed by a psycho in a mask.\n\nAfter the super low budget \"Halloween\" earned $47 million and \"The Fog\" grossed $21 million, Carpenter recalled struggling to write \"The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility:\"\n\n\"The Philadelphia Experiment\" supposedly occurred on the U.S.S. Eldridge in 1943. According to the story, the U.S. government wanted to render a ship completely invisible to the human eye and to enemy radar, and then make it reappear. The legend is that they actually pulled it off, but the crew on board suffered mental and physical effects of disappearing and reappearing into thin air. Most disturbingly, the rumors state that a few of the crew actually fused with the metal of the ship when it reappeared. It's a hell of a story, but Carpenter admitted that he didn't know how to turn rumor and speculation into an interesting screenplay:"}, {"url": "https://www.filminquiry.com/adaptation-from-novel-to-film/", "page_content": "While I also write original screenplays, I decided to adapt a novel I wrote into a screenplay for a film that I will also direct. The following thoughts on adaptation come from my personal experience of adapting the novel The Metal Girl into the film project \u201cMetal Girl\u201d.\n\nNovels and films are such different species that it can feel unnatural to marry them. After the adaptation, the only thing they will share will be a story, the setting, and the characters. A novel is a completed art form. One author writes the book, and one reader reads the book one at a time. If it\u2019s a successful book, many people, even millions of people will read that same book. While each reader will see the story through their own imagination and personal interpretation, the printed words will never change.\n\nVery few people will ever read the original screenplay. The screenplay will evolve with input from collaborations between the director and the creative team, from pre- to post-production. The screenplay is a fluid and ever evolving document.\n\nAdapting a novel to a film is rather like renovating a house: you will have to destroy it from the inside before you re-build it into something beautiful again. Trust me\u2014I\u2019ve done both.\n\nThe challenge in adapting the novel for a film is how to stay true to the source as you proceed to bend it into the medium of film. The first thing to consider is adapting prose to dramatic writing and the limitations of the screenplay format\n\nFrom Prose to Screenplay Format\n\nTo adapt the prose into a screenplay, you have to think about the story differently, as a series of scenes in three dimensions. Also, to accommodate the average length of a film\u2013one hour and forty-five minutes\u2013most working screenplays are between approximately 90 and 105 pages. The narrative of an average 300-500 page novel simply won\u2019t fit. Something\u2014a lot\u2014has to go. How does one tell a novel length story in a 100 page script?\n\nEfficiently, Using the Language of Film\n\nWhen I adapted The Metal Girl, early on it became quite clear to me that I needed to step away from the novel as written and think about re-telling the same story, this time using pictures, music, sound, and color. How would I tell that story, what would it look like, and how would those characters come to life on the screen?\n\nPlanning the Adaptation: Structure\n\nWhat elements of the story would stay and which could I cut out? Which characters, events, locations? What parts could I eliminate and what parts did I have to keep to portray the theme of the story and the main character\u2019s story arc?\n\nWhat would change, and what would stay the same? This is not always evident at first. Through all the versions of the script, some events, situations, characters in the novel will be lost, but at the same time, other elements that were not in the original story might be added for dramatic effect. Further changes will occur over the course production and editing of the film.\n\nBeginning, Middle, End\n\nThe first consideration is the structure of the film story, which may have to differ from the structure of the novel. Deciding on the best timeline for the events of the story in the film is the first thing to adapt. Surprise is an important element of screenwriting, the twists and turns of the plot, which is one of the devices that holds the attention of the film viewer but one that isn\u2019t always present in a book.\n\nA novel also has to move forward, but doesn\u2019t have to build on emotion in the same way as a film. A film takes the audience on an emotional ride. The film must hold you in your seat in rapt attention for one sitting of 90 to 105 minutes. So the screenplay must be structured in such a way as to build towards a dramatic, emotional climax that is resolved by the end. The words on the page don\u2019t need to do that. The book can be of interest and engaging but we can put it down and come back to it later.\n\nFor example, in the novel The Metal Girl, one very important event in the development of the female protagonist\u2019s character happened in the early part of the novel. But in the screenplay \u201cMetal Girl\u201d, for dramatic purposes, I put off that moment, building up to that point later in the story. When the moment occurs in the film, the audience is ready for her emotional response, and it becomes a turning point for the development of her character and the arc of the story.\n\nCharacters: Subtracting and Adding\n\nIn the same way that the narrative structure may have to change, in the screenplay you may have to make changes with characters in the novel, especially if there are a lot or there are many incidental characters. For the reasons of character development, the story arc, and the time constraints of a film, incidental characters need to be kept to a minimum. Some characters in the novel fell away because I didn\u2019t need them as they weren\u2019t a crucial part of the story. In the novel they may have added another color in the development of the main character or texture to the story, but in the film they were unnecessary extra and distracting details.\n\nThe lead character in the novel The Metal Girl has no name because she is the anonymous first person narrator who tells the story as a more mature woman looking back on her 25-year-old self. I wanted her to be a more universally relatable character and not live in a box of race or ethnicity. Also, the novel\u2019s structure is in the vein of a mock-memoir. But obviously a nameless character was not going to work for a film, so she became Charlotte.\n\nAnother situation is that some new characters may appear in the script to move the narrative forward, as the film will have a different story arc than the novel. Another reason that one might add characters and scenes that don\u2019t appear in the novel is to translate internal thoughts into dialogue. For example, The Metal Girl is written in the first person. Because the entire story is coming from the narrator\u2019s mind, including her commentary on various situations, I sometimes chose to create characters that didn\u2019t exist in the book for Charlotte to interact with in order to turn her thoughts into dialogue and her internal emotional state into her responses to other people.\n\nKeeping what works\n\nIn spite of what I said above, sometimes what is written in the novel works perfectly well in the screenplay and on screen. After all the film is based on the novel, and you want to keep as much of the flavor of the original story as possible. In \u201cMetal Girl\u201d some of the dialogue in the screenplay comes directly from the novel. Parts of the books\u2019 first person narrative were used as bits of voiceover, and some scenes and dialogue were lifted directly as they were written in the novel. If it works, use it.\n\nAbout Judy Sandra Judy Sandra is a director, writer, producer, and author. The screenplay \u201cMetal Girl\u201d is an adaptation of her coming-of-age novel The Metal Girl.

Only at awards ceremonies are their names mentioned and even then, most people don\u2019t give them much thought. From time to time, though, the question is raised as to whether or not authors should write the screenplay adaptations of their novels and non-fiction works. The vote tends to swing toward yes, as many screenplays written by authors have done very well. Some have even won Oscars.\n\nThe Cider House Rules by John Irving\n\nBook Buttons Embed ISBN: 9780345387653\n\nJohn Irving has written only one screenplay, but it is certainly one he can be proud of. In 1999, he adapted his 1985 novel The Cider House Rules into a screenplay. The film version, which starred Toby McGuire and Michael Caine, did very well and has endured almost as well as the book has. Irving received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work. Many people wish he could have adapted more of his books for the screen.\n\nGone Girl by Gillian Flynn\n\nBook Buttons Embed ISBN: 9781594136054\n\nOne of the most popular books and movies of 2015 falls into the same category. Gillian Flynn began writing while working as a journalist for Entertainment Weekly. When the rights to her book were sold, she wanted to adapt it herself and director David Fischer didn\u2019t object. This proved to be a wise choice. Flynn did not receive an Oscar nomination for her work on the screenplay, but many thought she should. The film was nominated for other awards, though, and did extremely well at the box office.\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky\n\nBook Buttons Embed ISBN: 9780671027346\n\nSome authors go beyond screenwriting; they also direct. Such was the case for Stephen Chbosky. Chbosky started his career as a screenwriter while dabbling in directing. He did not achieve any critical acclaim until The Perks of Being a Wallflower was published in 1999. Years later, he would go on to adapt it for the screen and even direct it.\n\nThe Godfather by Mario Puzo\n\nBook Buttons Embed ISBN: 9780613921923\n\nOne of the most iconic films in American history was adapted by the same author who wrote the book it was based off of. This comes as no surprise. Mario Punzo\u2019s crime novel The Godfather was so popular and still is, to a degree, but it has not endured to the extent that its film has. With the help of director Francis Ford Coppola, Punzo crafted a masterful screenplay that followed his skillful novel very closely. He also did most of the writing for its sequel, The Godfather Part II, which is almost as iconic.\n\nCharlie & The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl\n\nBook Buttons Embed ISBN: 9780142418215\n\nOn the subject of iconic books being adapted into iconic films, here\u2019s one for the children among us. Ronald Dahl did most of the writing for the screenplay of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, inspired by his beloved novel. Dahl didn\u2019t write the catchy songs that have become so popular, but that doesn\u2019t mean the film wasn\u2019t great. Both the book and it\u2019s adaptation have endured over decades, so much so that it was remade in 2005, although that version did not do as well, likely because it was missing Dahl\u2019s personal touch.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of thefilmexperience.com."}, {"url": "https://bookriot.com/film-screenplays-written-famous-authors/", "page_content": "This content contains affiliate links. When you buy through these links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nHere at Book Riot we\u2019ve talked a lot about what books inspire directors to create film adaptations. After all, every film needs a screenplay, and a hefty percentage of screenplays originate from books. So logically filmmakers, specifically writers, need a tripod of book knowledge, film knowledge, and creativity. (Along with cash money, luck, yada yada yada) However, a number of famous authors have quietly (to us anyway) made their way into Hollywood and written directly for the silver screen. Here\u2019s a list of movies with screenplays written by famous authors. Some of them might surprise you.\n\nWilliam Faulkner made his way to Hollywood rather transparently and had strong success there. He wrote the screenplay for The Big Sleep which is both a great book and film. (I discussed this book before in my post about the Coen Brothers) Interestingly enough, Faulkner also penned the screenplay for To Have And Have Not, the only time he ever \u201ccollaborated\u201d with Ernest Hemingway. Both films star Humphrey Bogart.\n\nIn Reading Color Newsletter A weekly newsletter focusing on literature by and about people of color! Let's Do This Thank you for signing up!

This film follows the life of Emiliano Zapata, portrayed by Marlon Brando, during the Mexican Revolution. (Though it is somewhat historically inaccurate and many of the events are aggrandized.) Throw in Elia Kazan as director and you have a solid Hollywood Golden Age-style film. Fun fact, Elia Kazan thought his reputation would convince J.D. Salinger to let him make a film out of The Catcher in the Rye, but Salinger said no.\n\nDennis Lehane is known for his novels Mystic River, Shutter Island, and Gone, Baby, Gone, all of which have been adapted to film. However, he has also written for Boardwalk Empire and The Wire, two highly-acclaimed shows that require some major writing chops. He and the rest of the writing team won an Edgar Award for their work on season four of The Wire.\n\nDorothy Parker, most known for her scathing criticisms, moved from New York to LA in the 1930\u2019s to write for Hollywood. Her most famous screenplay is for A Star Is Born, a 1937 hit starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. It was remade in 1954 starring Judy Garland.\n\nAldous Huxley wrote the screenplay for the 1940 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, as well as the 1943 adaptation of Jane Eyre. This version of Pride and Prejudice was considered to be fairly transformed to suit the needs of Hollywood. (As so many film adaptations tend to be) Particularly, the time period was adjusted to allow costumes that were a bit more noticeable on screen.\n\nMore recently, Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the 2005 film The White Countess. He has a new novel coming out next year, his first in a decade.\n\nCormac McCarthy is a writer I love to talk about for his brilliant writing on landscapes. Yet, he wrote a brilliant play-turned-TV-movie that came out in 2011, The Sunset Limited, that takes place in one room and entirely consists of dialogue. The movie stars Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. Needless to say, it\u2019s fantastic. He also wrote The Counselor, which came out last year to mediocre reviews.\n\nThere are certainly plenty of other writers that have dabbled in Hollywood. For some writers, the transition from books to film or vice versa is easy. While writers such as J.D. Salinger have taken extra precautions to make sure their work never is adapted, others would like nothing more. These two mediums are without doubt immutably interconnected, and only continue to evolve with easier access to film equipment and internet broadcasting."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/634198/the-untold-truth-of-john-carpenter/", "page_content": "The Untold Truth Of John Carpenter\n\nVery few directors have as many memorable films and highly regarded classics under their belt as John Carpenter does. For decades now, the man's name has been synonymous with the horror, action and science fiction genres. Many might know him mainly for revolutionizing horror with his 1978 classic \"Halloween\" which sparked the 1980s slasher movie trend. But Carpenter's cinematic accomplishments go much deeper than that. He was also at the helm of several cult classics, such as \"The Thing\" and \"Big Trouble in Little China.\"\n\nAll of Carpenter's passion projects ooze personality from every frame \u2014 and especially from their musical scores, which he also composes. His signature musical style, in addition to his directorial work, is what Carpenter is best known for, even today. At this point, he has nothing left to prove, content to enjoy life and create art with his family. But there are a few facts concerning the legendary director that you just might not be aware of."}, {"url": "https://lithub.com/the-10-best-literary-film-adaptations-of-the-decade/", "page_content": "As you may have noticed, over the past few weeks, we\u2019re been looking back at the best books from the decade, from novels to poetry to nonfiction. As a sort of coda to that project, I\u2019ve also polled the staff about their favorite literary adaptations of the decade, on both the big and small screens. Earlier this week, we published our list of the best television adaptations of the decade, and now, as promised, I present our list of the decade\u2019s best films adapted from books.\n\nTake note that we attempted to judge the films in question on their own independent merits; while many of us have read the books these shows are based on, we didn\u2019t base our decisions on fidelity to, or creativity of departure from, the original text. We just wanted to pick the best movies.\n\nAs with the previous lists, the top ten big screen adaptations were chosen after a lengthy debate among the Literary Hub staff. It got testy, but in the end, we agreed\u2014though many of us had to include our dissenting opinions at the end of the list. If we\u2019ve missed your favorite, tell us why we\u2019re wrong in the comments.\n\n***\n\nThe Top Ten\n\nWinter\u2019s Bone (2010)\n\nBased on: Winter\u2019s Bone by Daniel Woodrell (2006)\n\nDebra Granik\u2019s Winter\u2019s Bone (which she also co-wrote with producer Rosellini) is a beautiful, gritty, horrifying masterpiece. Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell and released in 2010, it is the story of a teenage girl named Ree (Jennifer Lawrence, before her rise to fame and giving the best performance of her career) who lives in the Ozark Mountains with her mother and younger siblings. She serves as the primary caretaker for her whole family\u2014her drug-dealing father has disappeared, and her mother suffers from mental illness. When her family is threatened with eviction, she decides to track down her father. But the neighbors are resistant to her attempts to pry into her father\u2019s life\u2014and she is emphatically discourages by her uncle, a conflicted meth addict named Teardrop (John Hawkes) from searching any further. It is a brutal, cutting film\u2014its pacing is incredibly suspenseful and the acting (often stony), is pitch-perfect. It is a movie of silence, of snow\u2014muted sounds and colors. Until it isn\u2019t, and it transforms into a shocking, scarring, and vibrant spectacle of horror. Debra Granik should direct every movie.\n\n\u2013Olivia Rutigliano, CrimeReads Editorial Fellow\n\nThe Social Network (2010)\n\nBased on: The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich (2009)\n\nIt\u2019s not going to surprise anyone that David Fincher is has a prominent place on a list like this. His 2014 adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl claims one of the spots in the top 10. His 2011 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo very easily could have made it, too\u2014it was arguably one of the most anticipated adaptations in several decades, and despite a lukewarm critical reception at the time has been aging pretty well into something closer to wide acclaim. Mindhunter gets a nod in the TV department. But the real crowning achievement of Fincher\u2019s impressive decade is the one with no killers, no gore, and no brooding violence at all, really, except the violence done to the American social fabric thanks to the rise of a new class of reckless tech billionaires. Somehow, with its dark campus landscapes, Trent Reznor score, and unabashed displays of ambition, The Social Network turns out to be one of Fincher\u2019s most insidious, disturbing works. The adaptation, from Ben Mezrich\u2019s 2009 book, The Accidental Billionaires, was done by none other than Aaron Sorkin, and like Mezrich\u2019s book, the screenplay zeroes in on the lawsuits filed by the various founders and early developers of Facebook. Depositions have never been captured so perfectly on film, with Jesse Eisenberg as the seething anti-hero, Zuckerberg, facing off against rivals, enemies, and himself. Looking back almost ten years later, it\u2019s incredible just how prescient The Social Network was about the principles and players behind social media. Fincher and Sorkin seemed to see clearly the insecurities and threats behind this strange force.\n\n\u2013Dwyer Murphy, CrimeReads Managing Editor\n\nTrue Grit (2010)\n\nBased on: True Grit by Charles Portis (1968)\n\nTrue Grit, directed by Joel and Ethan Coen in 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis\u2019s 1968 novel of the same name. The first one, which was made in 1969 and starred John Wayne (in the November of his career), was a chipper, watered-down version of the original story, a vehicle for Wayne to pastiche his whole career as a crochety, no-nonsense cowboy. Wayne won an Oscar (kind of as a tribute) for his role as the crapulent, cantankerous, eye-patch-wearing U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn, forever associating himself and his legend with the film. The Coen Brothers\u2019 retelling of the story fully (productively) ignores that the first True Grit even happened, drawing its script from Portis\u2019s grim novel, to focus more on the protagonist that the first film dismissed: Mattie Ross, a formidable fourteen-year-old girl who arrives in a small town to retrieve the body of her murdered father. Played to poker-faced perfection by Hailee Steinfeld (and Elizabeth Marvel, later on), Mattie hires Rooster (Jeff Bridges, who has in the last two decades found his calling playing sloppy, insouciant older men) to hunt down and take into custody Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), her father\u2019s murderer. Also along for the ride is a patronizing Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf (Matt Damon, who pronounces it \u201cluh beef\u201d). While the film is structured around the hunt for the killer, it is more about the relationships between the three characters on the journey\u2014or, really, the lack of relationships between them. The film eschews the traditional \u201cit\u2019s the journey, not the destination\u201d clich\u00e9 of so many expedition-focused stories\u2014the yearning for a connection between them is there, but they are not able to bring it to fruition.\n\nBut this is a Western, which means that the relationships that form are not limited to humans. Mattie\u2019s most loving connection will be to Little Blackie, the shiny horse she picks out for herself to ride on the trip. He will (spoiler) ultimately give up his life to save hers, carrying her to medical care after an accident. Horses in True Grit, seem to play a particularly large role in the film\u2019s construction of a moral hierarchy and are represented as providing integrity to an otherwise cold and chaotic world. As emblematized most obviously by the strutting, gauche Rooster, the wild west of True Grit turns everything and everyone into animals. As Mattie (her family\u2019s breadwinner, now) tries to avenge her father, she is truly on the hunt for humanity and support\u2014someone who can help her carry her family through this hard time. But humans, with their nominal superiority of morality and thought, will almost always fail her. And the film beautifully, sadly, darkly, watches humanity leave her with nothing\u2014like the horses who love her back, she too must live as a beast of burden. \u2013Olivia Rutigliano, CrimeReads Editorial Fellow\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)\n\nBased on: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy by John le Carr\u00e9 (1974)\n\nSwedish purveyor of moody, broody atmospherics Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) conjures the beige-hued, ashen-faced world of jaded British spycraft so impeccably in his adaptation of John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s seminal 1974 novel that you can almost smell the stale cigarette smoke and flop sweat, feel the scratchy suit fabric and stained shag carpeting. Gary Oldman plays the latest incarnation of Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s beleaguered-but-deceptively-cunning career intelligence officer George Smiley, here brought out of retirement and tasked with rooting out a Soviet mole in the upper echelons of the secret service. Alongside him is a rogue\u2019s gallery of stony-faced British acting royalty: Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt, and Tom Hardy, to name but a few. These are men whose emotional lives have been slowly eroded by the grim rituals and moral compromises of service. The whole thing is just so damn bleak, but in a transfixing kind of way. I know that\u2019s a strange argument to make for exalting a film to Best of the Decade status, but Alfredson\u2019s remake is such a fully realized vision that every time I sit down to watch TTSS (usually in the dead of night) I am instantly transported, mesmerized. It\u2019s paradoxical, but there\u2019s something both deeply soothing and deeply unnerving about following Oldman\u2019s stoic, melancholy Smiley through the ruins of this fallen kingdom\u2014a post-Kim Philby landscape of stagnating enmities and vanished idealism.\n\n\u2013Dan Sheehan, Book Marks Editor\n\nThe Hunger Games (2012)\n\nBased on: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins (2008)\n\nWith all due respect to everyone who got really mad at Martin Scorcese for saying superhero movies weren\u2019t art, I don\u2019t think that The Hunger Games is great art\u2014but I do think it\u2019s a great adaptation. Not only does it capture the spirit of the book in all its distinctly YA-flavored but still genuinely frightening glory, but it\u2019s also highly entertaining. This is the kind of movie that I\u2019ll watch any time I see it on a screen\u2014much like a character in The Hunger Games unable to look away from the Hunger Games. For one thing, the casting is impeccable: Stanley Tucci at his campy best as Caesar Flickerman! Woody Harrelson as loveable grump Haymitch Abernathy! Wes Bentley! Remember him from American Beauty? He became a director after all! The director of the Hunger Games! This movie\u2019s montage game is also really strong. I think probably what happened was that the directors gave one overarching note on the screenplay, and that note was \u201cCan this be a montage?\u201d And the answer was often yes! As is the answer to \u201cShould I watch The Hunger Games?\u201d Jennifer Lawrence is also in it.\n\n\u2013Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\nGone Girl (2014)\n\nBased on: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn (2012)\n\nAlthough Gone Girl needs no introduction, here I go anyway. Gone Girl, the movie, was adapted from Gone Girl, the book, first published in 2012 by Gillian Flynn to immediately become a bestseller. Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl went on to sell two million copies in its first year. The psychological thriller, directed by David Fincher\u2014director of every film you\u2019ve heard of, including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u2014starred Rosamund Pike, Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris, and Tyler Perry (among the producers is also Reese Witherspoon) with Gillian Flynn at the helm, writing the screenplay, and was released to wide critical acclaim in 2014, grossing to $369 million. Meanwhile, Rosamund Pike\u2019s performance as Amy Dunne earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. With all the official praise out of the way, now I get to lapse into the story that became a phenomenon.\n\nGone Girl opens on the day of Amy Dunne\u2019s disappearance, the same day that marks the beginning of the unravelling of her husband Nick Dunne, who is being accused of her murder. In due course, the narrative pulls out from the investigation into Nick Dunne\u2019s culpability and Amy Dunne\u2019s found diary entries, to switch over to Amy, who really, is alive and framing her husband for her murder to punish him for being a bad husband. He is no longer the man she married. The film opens the same way that it closes, with an intimate close up of Amy who is lying down, and staring back at the camera, in a look that should seem affectionate and flirty but instead is unnerving in how ruthless it is. The line Nick speaks over this scene\u2014held too long for comfort\u2014is, \u201cWhat are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?\u201d These words reverberate throughout the movie only to toll again at the finale.\n\nThe film is full of chilling contrasts that augment its tension and reinforce its suspense. Notable is Fincher\u2019s excellent depiction of Gone Girl\u2019s noir aesthetic: evident, for example, in the very dimly lit, empty (albeit in the morning) bar that Nick and Go own, where they play board games while drinking scotch and making light of crude jokes that make one squirm. They also complain about Amy. Excellent in the film is Detective Rhonda Boney: straight-faced, with a southern accent, and a wry humor that disarms New York-endorsed snob Nick just a few minutes into their meeting. A great scene: Nick has just called the police after seeing the living room furniture overturned and the front door ajar, and as procedure requires, Detective Boney evaluates the house; she steps into his bedroom and inquires, casually, about this profession. Nick says he\u2019s a writer. He also owns a bar, named The Bar. \u201cOh, The Bar,\u201d Boney says, \u201cLove the name. Very meta.\u201d Detective Boney is everything we\u2019ve been taught the crime detective should be, only she is no fool, and she is not arrogant. That is more than we can say about her younger, male lieutenant who is blood-thirsty: he wants Dunne arrested, no matter the evidence. I could go on quite a while about the details of this movie, but the last and very important note I will end on is Amy\u2019s chilling monologue that introduces her true persona to the audience.\n\nWearing sunglasses and driving with one arm out the window\u2014the arm from which she drew blood to stage a convincing crime scene\u2014Amy is cruising down a country road in the sunlight and we, at this point, know what she did. Here, she gives her iconic \u201ccool girl speech,\u201d the speech that makes a convincing case for the adage, \u201cHell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\u201d The beauty of the speech is that it is dramatic, dripping with anger and, even though we know Amy is a psychopath, and we know we would never take things that far . . . . yet, there\u2019s a flash of a second where we\u2014the audience\u2014nod along and say, yes. Yes. After praising it so highly, it would be cruel to leave you hanging, so here\u2019s a piece of that monologue: \u201cMen always say that as the defining compliment, don\u2019t they? She\u2019s a cool girl . . . . Hot and understanding. Cool girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m the Cool Girl. Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they\u2019re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl.\u201d It keeps going\u2014the monologue, in the film, in the book, in your head. Thus is the effect, the phenomenon, of Gone Girl.\n\n\u2013Eleni Theodoropoulos, Editorial Fellow\n\nCarol (2015)\n\nBased on: The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith (1952)\n\nIn the dining room of a nondescript hotel by the side of the highway, Therese and Carol are sharing breakfast when a man can\u2019t resist the chance to intrude. Sitting down at their table, he peppers them with questions, and they reply with brief, vague answers, as a parallel but much more interesting conversation plays out between their faces; the subtle raised eyebrow, the mocking nod, a world of communication in plain sight yet utterly hidden to the man in front of them. Based on Patricia Highsmith\u2019s The Price of Salt\u2014a book that broke new ground when it was published in 1952 for portraying a lesbian relationship that does not end in despair or death\u2014Carol communicates so much with this kind of unspoken connection and understanding, which made it possible for queer women to find and love each other in an era that would have preferred they remain invisible.\n\nThe love story between two women, which begins in the holiday season of 1952, is equally joyful and mindful of the many dangers posed by society\u2019s resistance to queerness and queer sexuality. A.O. Scott wrote for The New York Times that viewers watch the two lovers \u201cin public places, hidden in plain sight, cloaked in unspoken assumptions that are at once painful and protective.\u201d Unlike so many other queer narratives, though, an awareness of that danger does not overshadow their intimacy; instead, it casts light on the tactics that queer women had to employ in order to survive, with incredible results.\n\n\u2013Corinne Segal, Senior Editor\n\nThe Handmaiden (2016)\n\nBased on: Fingersmith by Sarah Waters (2002)\n\nPark Chan-wook\u2019s radical adaptation of Sarah Waters\u2019s novel (by radical I mean he transmuted the action from Victorian-era Britain to 1930s colonial Korea, which was just as rigid and striated by class) was hands-down my favorite film of 2016, never mind my favorite adaptation of a novel. It starts slow, and quiet, which only makes what eventually unfurls\u2014involving an elaborate, multi-faceted con, a torture chamber, a lesbian awakening, a library of porn, and an octopus\u2014that much more striking. Every moment of this film, which is both a love story and a thriller, is gorgeous, and hypnotic, and sexy, and weird as hell. It is beyond good.\n\nAnd though I know we\u2019re not supposed to be considering the adaptation process, this one was remarkable: it improved upon a book that I already loved. As I wrote back in 2016, the film \u201cexcised everything I didn\u2019t like about the book (an over-complicated, fairly slow third act, for one thing) and replaced it with what I really wished for\u2014the collaboration between these two strange, powerful women. The experience of watching the film reminded me of reading contemporary retellings of fairy tales\u2014it\u2019s a deeply satisfying wish-fulfillment that takes something already good and vital and twists it until it\u2019s unbearably delicious, until it\u2019s exactly what you want. This felt like a feminist reimagining of an already feminist novel.\u201d\n\n\u2013Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nArrival (2016)\n\nBased on: \u201cStory of Your Life\u201d by Ted Chiang (1998)\n\nWhat if language was the key to knowledge, not only about your neighbor, but about strangers and yourself as well? By the end of Arrival, the Denis Villeneuve film based on Ted Chiang\u2019s 1998 short story, \u201cStory of Your Life,\u201d the viewer understands this as the movie\u2019s central question. Linguist Louise Banks (played by the ever-reliable Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are called by the US Army to help study one of twelve extraterrestrial spacecrafts that have positioned themselves in scattered locations around the world. What Banks and Donnelly discover aboard the craft are two amorphous alien specimens, which they call \u201cheptapods,\u201d that communicate using a complicated system of logograms, or written characters that represent a word or phrase. This straightforward set-up lays the groundwork for a moving, and often anxiety-inducing, investigation of language, empathy, and miscommunication. Arrival\u2019s surprising endgame cemented it as one of the most heartfelt movies of the last decade. The film\u2019s meditative aesthetic is also boosted by a rather primal, ruminative score by the late, great Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. \u2013Aaron Robertson, Assistant Editor\n\nCall Me By Your Name (2017)\n\nBased on: Call Me By Your Name by Andr\u00e9 Aciman (2007)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Aciman, author of Call Me By Your Name, initially thought he would dislike director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s adaptation; from the moment he arrived on a visit to the set, he wrote for Vanity Fair, it was clear that Guadagnino\u2019s vision for the film was significantly different from the one that had driven his own writing. But the final result, which he saw at the Berlin International Film Festival, and in particular the film\u2019s infamous last shot, floored him. \u201cThe ending captured the very spirit of the novel I had written in ways that I could never have imagined or anticipated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn Guadagnino\u2019s hands, Aciman\u2019s narration of the interior, obsessive Elio, a prodigious 17-year-old, becomes a series of languid Italian summer days over which a love story unfolds between him and Oliver, the older graduate student who comes to stay in their family\u2019s house over the summer. Filmed in the Lombardy region of Italy, the film is so visually lush as to seem unreal, and the intensity of the connection it explores\u2014and all the self-searching that follows it\u2014is almost painful to watch, as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Elio) and Armie Hammer (Oliver) bring a palpable chemistry and sense of constant, unresolved desire to their roles. Its setting, \u201cSomewhere in Northern Italy,\u201d is deliberately vague, Anthony Lane noted for The New Yorker\u2014\u201dthe point of a paradise is that it could exist anywhere but that, once you reach the place, it brims with details so precise in their intensity that you never forget them,\u201d he wrote. This film is a paradise worth your time and definitely one of the best adaptations of the last decade.\n\n\u2013Corinne Segal, Senior Editor\n\n***\n\nDissenting Opinions\n\nThe following adaptations were just barely nudged out of the top twenty, but we (or at least one of us) couldn\u2019t let them pass without comment.\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)\n\nBased on: We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver (2003)\n\nWhat happens when someone you love turns out to be a monster? We Need to Talk About Kevin (WNTTAK) understands the complexities of love, grief, anger, and mourning intimately. Based on Lionel Shriver\u2019s 2005 novel of the same name, the film has quickly surpassed its source material in both reach and reputation. Told from the perspective of Kevin\u2019s mother, played to intense perfection by Tilda Swinton, WNTTAK begins with a lonesome Tilda, living in a rundown house and visiting her teenage son in prison. He\u2019s done something terrible, something so terrible that Swinton\u2019s neighbors no longer talk to her, but what? A gradual series of flashback sequences reveals Kevin\u2019s difficult upbringing, his mother\u2019s growing suspicion of his psychopathy, and finally, the explosive violence that lands him in prison in the first place.\n\nIf you prefer to end every film with the sensation that everything is pointless and we might just as well curl up in the fetal position and die (but also love exists and is very creepy), then this film is for you! It\u2019s also part of a continuum of complex attitudes towards motherhood stretching back to Doris Lessing\u2019s The Fifth Child and beyond. Motherhood is ambiguous. So is love. And so is that ending. . .\n\n\u2013Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Associate Editor\n\n\n\nCloud Atlas . . . but only the trailer (2012)\n\nBased on: Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell (2004)\n\nThe trailer for the film Cloud Atlas, directed by the Wachowski sisters, is the single most moving work of cinema ever made. It is basically as long as a real movie (a 5 minute and 42 second-long movie trailer!) and it is more enjoyable than watching the actual whole film of Cloud Atlas, an extremely ambitious and staggering epic that tells a giant six-generation, cross-continental, time-jumping narrative packed with very famous movie stars (though are they performing as people of other races, at times? Yes. Yes they are.) The novel on which the film is based, which was written by David Mitchell, is a beautiful, complicated tale of different individuals at different moments in time, from an 19th-century voyager in the Pacific, to an impoverished family in a futuristic primitive world. Mitchell\u2019s book is subtle and the connections between the six different stories within are more like soft threads. The film on the whole transforms the book in a somewhat awkward literalization of many of its smaller details (the movie becomes all about reincarnation in a way the book only touches upon it)\u2026 but this movie trailer, which can\u2019t tell the full story of the movie (though it kind of tries, with its expanse), is a collection of stunning notes, coming together much more smoothly and (helpfully) vaguely than in its full iteration. You go watch this trailer, with its perfect deployment of that one M83 song and snare drums and lonely piano themes and stunning colors and heartbeat-matching montage cut points and slow motion and Jim Broadbent and gravelly voiceovers like \u201cI believe there is another world out there, a better world\u2014and I\u2019ll be waiting for you there\u201d and you TELL me that it does not deserve to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. You look me eye and tell me.\n\n\u2013Olivia Rutigliano, CrimeReads Editorial Fellow\n\nThe Great Gatsby (2013)\n\nBased on: The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)\n\nHere are just a few of the (myriad) reasons why Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 2013 lush-as-fuck and much-maligned adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s magnum opus is actually one of the great cinematic achievements of the 21st century: (i) The trailer. Remember how excited we all were when this dope trailer dropped? Remember how alive it made us feel? (ii) The soundtrack: Beyonc\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 3000 covering Back to Black, Jack White covering Love is Blindnessand, most especially, that young and beautiful Lana del Rey song (which I still listen to on the regular on my runs) Luhrmann pipes in over this glorious montage of Nick and Daisy hitting golf balls into the ocean and flinging beautiful silk shirts around the room. (iii) The party scenes. Just look at them all there, having a grand old time with their money and their sparkly clothes. (iv) The casting of Jason Clarke and Isla Fisher as George and Myrtle Wilson. Dead on. (v) The way DiCaprio\u2019s Gatsby says the line \u201cI\u2019m certainly glad to see you, as well.\u201d So intense. DiCaprio, the boyishly handsome rhino and Millennial/Gen Z model enthusiast who has spent a decade in roles that require him to look perennially on the brink of a complete mental breakdown, was born to play this role and I will brook no argument there (vi) Joel Edgerton absolutely going for it as Tom Buchanan. Not since Billy Zane\u2019s Cal Hockley I enjoyed a wealthy shittheel villain so much. (vii) The way the movie wisely tones down the anti-Semitic Meyer Wolfsheim caricature. Good note, Baz. Good note. (viii) That Leo-raising-a-champagne-glass gif we all know and love. (ix) The way Tobey Maguire\u2019s Nick Carraway adds that flourish to his sanatorium framing device novel at the movie\u2019s close. All movie codas should be as bold in their purist-trolling as this.\n\n\u2013Dan Sheehan, Book Marks Editor\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (2013)\n\nBased on: Much Ado About Nothing, by William Shakespeare (1623)\n\nCertain people in the office groaned when I announced that I wanted to write about this film, but those people are foolish. Look, no one would claim that this Much Ado About Nothing, directed by Joss Whedon and staged in his own house, is better than the official Much Ado About Nothing, directed by Kenneth Branagh in the \u201990s (two more groan-worthy things), but it\u2019s certainly more elegant, and hey, it\u2019s the same play (my favorite). You can\u2019t really mess up this play, which contains the best character in Shakespeare\u2019s oeuvre\u2014or maybe I\u2019d give Beatrice and Puck a shared top billing, but the point stands. Perhaps most importantly, if you are a fan of other works created by Joss Whedon, ahem, this movie can be understood as an extended piece of fan fiction in which Wesley and Fred finally get together instead of the latter dying tragically in the former\u2019s arms before they\u2019ve even slept together. I mean, look at them, up there. Trust me when I say it\u2019s very satisfying.\n\n\u2013Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nSnowpiercer (2013)\n\nBased on: Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette\n\nSnowpiercer!!!!!! It\u2019s so good, y\u2019all.\n\nSnowpiercer is a 2013 Korean-American production directed by indie darling Bong Joon-ho and based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob with a striking (get-it?) premise. In an apocalyptic scenario where the world has become too frozen to sustain human life, the only survivors are on board a train called Snowpiercer, barreling around the world just fast enough to preserve the lives of those onboard \u2013 but all survivors are not equal. We begin the narrative in the \u201cthird class\u201d section of the apocalypse, as we learn about the train\u2019s highly stratified class system, held in place by a rigidly applied system of barbaric punishment administered by a terrifying Tilda Swinton.\n\nThe oppressed masses soon begin a rebellion against their fur-clad overlords, and as they journey from the back of the train through gradually increasing opulence, fighting their way to the engine car, audiences are forced to question if this kind of survival is worth surviving at all. Snowpiercer also gets mad props most creative/prolific arm removal \u2013 like, five characters get their arms cut off this movie. Each in a different way. Something to know ahead of time, especially if you\u2019re planning a drinking game around it.\n\nA perfect action film with a solid Marxist message that draws strong visuals from its comic book origins and takes narrative inspiration from video games, Snowpiercer is one of the must-see films of the decade.\n\n\u2013Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Associate Editor\n\nThe Edge of Tomorrow (2014)\n\nBased on: Hiroshi Sakurazaka, All You Need Is Kill (2004)\n\nThe 2014 Tom Cruise sci-fi actioner The Edge of Tomorrow AKA Live Die Repeat is adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka\u2019s light novel, All You Need Is Kill, but perhaps the true ur-text is the 1993 Harold Ramis/Bill Murray classic Groundhog Day. What\u2019s it about? Well, the plot is almost beside the point; its the premise here that\u2019s everything: it\u2019s the near future, and aliens have invaded Europe, and Cruise\u2014a combat-unready military PR sleazeball\u2014is dragooned by Brendan Gleeson into active duty for a D-Day style invasion, where he is almost instantly killed only to awaken the day before with his memory intact and forced to live through the slaughter again and again and again. Until, that is, with the help of badass warrior Emily Blunt, he learns to become a mechanized-bodysuit-fighting master and to better understand his enemy and, maybe, himself? I know, but it\u2019s incredibly satisfying. There\u2019s just so much glee to be had in the bonkersness and boldfaced derivativeness of the conceit, the video-game action sequences and the scenery-chewing supporting performances\u2014and, of course, in watching Cruise (as the type of smarmy bastard that usually gets described as \u201cplaying against type\u201d but always seems to suit him best) get 86-ed over and over. To watch this movie is to appreciate how little so many of its genre-mates are able to enjoy themselves, and how little they seem interested in your enjoyment. The Edge of Tomorrow, above all else, knows what I need to enjoy myself, and it wants me to have it.\n\n\u2013Emily Firetog, Deputy Editor\n\nInherent Vice (2014)\n\nBased on: Inherent Vice by Thomas Pynchon (2009)\n\nThe reputation of Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 2014 adaptation of Pynchon\u2019s gonzo-PI novel has been growing fairly steadily since its first release, when, let\u2019s be honest, it was hard to know exactly what to make of this thing. First off, like just about any PI story worth its salt, the \u201cplot\u201d doesn\u2019t really make a whole lot of sense. Sense isn\u2019t the point. (See, e.g. The Long Goodbye, book and movie; rinse, repeat.) Atmosphere is the point\u2014an ambiance, some style, a little confusion, a little tension, and in this case a fine, drug-laced balancing act somewhere between ennui and paranoia, a certain feeling in the air that went hand-in-glove with the mourning of a decade\u2019s promise, innocence lost, friends disappeared, dead and gone. Based on the 2009 Pynchon neo-noir, Inherent Vice is set in 1970s \u201cGordita Beach\u201d\u2014a stand-in for Manhattan Beach in its scruffy bohemian heyday\u2014and follows the dubious private eye casework of one Doc Sportello, a man capable of walking the city\u2019s mean streets in the mode of Chandler\u2019s Marlowe, though in this case the streets are full of 1960s washouts and burnouts, and the bete noir is one Bigfoot Bjornsen, the LAPD\u2019s local fascist hippie-hater. That\u2019s a fairly ineffable mood but Paul Thomas Anderson manages to capture it along with some help from Joaquin Phoenix, Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and a long, strange cast of characters. What starts out seeming to be an exercise in oddness and unexpected detour slowly, almost inexplicably morphs into something far more tender and poignant, a weird, lovely meditation on the people and scenes that move in and out of our lives, gone forever.\n\n\u2013Dwyer Murphy, CrimeReads Managing Editor\n\nElle (2016)\n\nBased on: Oh\u2026 by Philippe Djian\n\nElleis a brilliant, disturbing movie that I will not watch again. Isabelle Huppert plays Mich\u00e8le Leblanc, the artistic director of a video game company, who is one day raped in her home by a masked assailant. After the assault, Mich\u00e8le does not call the police but instead cleans up the blood and broken glass, and resumes her life. One might list Elle among a long list of \u201crape revenge\u201d movies, as many critics have, though it was immediately clear that the film was attempting something much bolder than the usual fare. The fact that director Paul Verhoeven wasn\u2019t able to convince American actresses or film studios to make the film says something about the ugly frankness of Elle\u2019s Machiavellian attempts to rebuild her life and self-image after such a heinous violation. Elle, which was released in 2016, the year before the #MeToo movement spiked in popularity, was an inadvertent bellwether of soon-to-be-revived debates around male and female power, sex, and sexual ethics. \u2013Aaron Robertson, Assistant Editor\n\nLady Macbeth (2017)\n\nBased on: Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District by Nikolai Leskov (1865)\n\nHas there ever been a protagonist more terrifying than Katherine, the Lady Macbeth of William Oldroyd\u2019s haunting adaptation of Leskov\u2019s novella (itself inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s most famous female character)? Sure, a lot of characters are cold, and a lot of characters start with one little murder and then work their way up in intensity (of method and victim), but as I\u2019ve written in this space before, most of them don\u2019t, well, win at the end, and most of them aren\u2019t played by Florence Pugh, who nails Katherine as a blank, amoral antiheroine in a fairy tale\u2014one of the original fairy tales, where people routinely die, disappear and get dismembered\u2014who suffers, more than anything else, from idle hands. It\u2019s a shame more people didn\u2019t see this film, despite its disturbing imagery; any lovers of Ottessa Moshfegh and Catherine Lacey and yes, the Bard himself, should seek it out.\n\n\u2013Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nHidden Figures (2018)\n\nBased on: Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly (2016)\n\nBased on Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s bestselling nonfiction book of the same name, Hidden Figures tells the little-known story of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson\u2014the brilliant black women who were behind one of NASA\u2019s greatest achievements. (Had you heard of them before this? I certainly hadn\u2019t.) Without these women breaking down barriers and fighting for a seat at the table, astronaut John Glenn never would have been successfully launched into orbit. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e do an incredible job of bringing these women to the forefront of this Space Race story. There is one scene that has stuck in my mind, years after I\u2019ve seen it. Because segregated bathrooms are still in place at NASA when the events of this film unfold, we see Taraji P. Henson running across the campus grounds, crossing a great distance to go to the \u201ccolored bathroom.\u201d At first, it\u2019s almost played up for a little bit of comic relief. But as it goes on, we see the toll it takes on her work. Then her white male supervisor berates her in front of her colleagues for leaving her desk for so long, and she finally fires back telling them where she\u2019s been going for forty minutes at a time, screaming that this is something they would never even have to consider. It\u2019s a real turning point in the movie, a cleverly included detail that hits on a terrible reality of the time. But Hidden Figures doesn\u2019t hit you over the head with it. It doesn\u2019t linger in this injustice. The movie is also filled with joy and laughter and small victories and strong female friendship. The story itself is heartwarming and inspiring, and the film adaptation is a fitting celebration of these game-changing women.\n\n\u2013Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nCan You Ever Forgive Me? (2018)\n\nBased on: Can You Ever Forgive Me? by Lee Israel\n\nI find it very comforting to watch characters act out of desperation and that\u2019s not something I intend to examine at all! Even if you don\u2019t share my totally unremarkably interest in downward spirals, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is worth watching. Adapted from Lee Israel\u2019s memoir of the same name, the film is part buddy comedy (Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant play Israel and her friend/partner in crime Jack Hock), part heist, and all spiny dark comedy. It\u2019s also, as A.O. Scott writes, \u201ccatnip for the bookish,\u201d as the crime in question is selling forged correspondence from literary giants including Dorothy Parker and No\u00ebl Coward. One of the things I love about the film is that while it certainly doesn\u2019t glamorize Israel\u2019s crime spree (she forged 400 letters, which I think qualifies as a spree), it does respect her talent as a mimic. The script\u2014written by Jeff Whitty and the brilliant Nicole Holofcener\u2014is funny and mean and very, very tense, and Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Lee Israel is one of my favorite Unlikeable Women of the decade.\n\n\u2013Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\n***\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nA selection of other adaptations that we seriously considered for both lists\u2014just to be extra about it (and because decisions are hard).\n\n127 Hours (2010) \u00b7 The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011) \u00b7 Moneyball (2011) \u00b7 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1) (2011) \u00b7 Jane Eyre (2011) \u00b7 Anna Karenina (2012) \u00b7 Cloud Atlas itself (2012) \u00b7 The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) \u00b7 Cosmopolis (2012) \u00b7 Under the Skin (2013) \u00b7 Blue is the Warmest Color (2013) \u00b7 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) \u00b7 Divergent (2014) \u00b7 Room (2015) \u00b7 The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015) \u00b7 The Martian (2015) \u00b7 Still Alice (2015) \u00b7 Spotlight (2015) \u00b7 The Lost City of Z (2016) \u00b7 If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) \u00b7 Blackkklansman (2018) \u00b7 We the Animals (2018) \u00b7 The Sisters Brothers (2018) \u00b7 The Wife (2018)."}, {"url": "https://thgmwriters.com/blog/adapting-books-to-film-movie/", "page_content": "There are so many films based on books. You, too, might want to turn a novel into a movie. This complete guide offers 11 screenplay-writing tips to adapt a book into a movie.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve written a novel. Now you want to turn your book into a movie or a TV series. What could be easier?\n\nWriting a book manuscript and writing a screenplay are very different projects. And adapting a book into a TV series or a movie takes more than just reformatting the text. Here are 11 steps for how to adapt a book into a screenplay.\n\nBook to film adaptations \u2013 a complete guide\n\nFollow this guide to for adapting books to film.\n\nHow can I turn my book into a movie? Book to film adaptation process: here are 11 steps for adapting a book into a screenplay for a movie or TV show. Picture the visuals for the screen Watch movie adaptations of similar books Write your movie logline Write your novel out as an outline Optional: hire a screenwriter to adapt your novel for film Convert your novel outline to a screenplay outline Optional: develop the treatment Get screenwriting software Read screenplays Finally, you can write! Get feedback on your screenplay adaptation And that\u2019s how to adapt a book into a screenplay.\n\nStep 1. Picture the visuals for the screen\n\nThe first thing about a book to film adaptation is to stop thinking about words. One of the challenges of adapting a novel to film is that people consume the story differently. Film is all about the visuals. Yes, there are words. Yes, there are sound effects, too. But movies are all about what the viewer views.\n\nIf your book is centered around personal introspection or conversations around a dinner table, it might be challenging to adapt it for film. Indeed, it might not be worth adapting the book for film. Not every book makes a good movie.\n\nIf you can\u2019t picture the visuals, your audience won\u2019t get it, either.\n\nStep 2. Watch movie adaptations of similar books\n\nThis takes some time. It takes time because you have to watch a lot of movies and read a lot of books.\n\nThe payoff is you get to watch a lot of movies and read a lot of books.\n\nPay attention to a few aspects of each pairing:\n\nWhat did they remove when adapting a book for film?\n\nWhat did they add when adapting a book for film?\n\nWhat did they emphasize more in the movie version?\n\nHow did they convey unspoken thoughts in the film?\n\nWhat changes worked? What changes didn\u2019t?\n\nStep 3. Write your movie logline\n\nThis is the pitch to moviegoers. In one or two sentences, you must get someone to think: \u201cOoh, I want to see that one!\u201d This is your logline, and it is around this description that all your writing should be developed. This is where you find your story, so take your time.\n\nThis summary should state three things:\n\nthe protagonist\u2019s goal\n\nwhat\u2019s at stake\n\njust how daunting are the odds\n\nTo give you an idea, here are five great examples of loglines from famous movies. Just for fun, can you identify the movies? The answers are below, at the end of the article.\n\nA family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where a sinister presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from both past and future. The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty in postwar New York City transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant youngest son. In German-occupied Poland during World War II, industrialist Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis. A meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron. A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger.\n\nStep 4. Write your novel out as an outline\n\nThis might be the easiest step in the book to film adaptation process. If you created an outline as a first step to writing your novel, you\u2019re already done. Congratulations!\n\nBut, wait! There\u2019s more\u2026\n\nFor each point, make note of its utility on screen:\n\nadvances plot\n\nadvances character\n\nforeshadows\n\nbuilds suspense\n\nSome points won\u2019t have any onscreen utility. Inner dialogue doesn\u2019t (usually) go into a movie, for example. But don\u2019t lose those points. Keep them in your outline. You might want to find other ways to convey some of that meaning. When you write your screenplay outline, you might want to work those items into different points.\n\nStep 5. Optional: hire a screenwriter to adapt your novel for film\n\nIf you plan to hire a screenwriter to help you write a truly amazing script, this is likely the best time to do so. Bring your book manuscript and the outline with you. We\u2019ll be happy to help adapt your book into a screenplay.\n\nStep 6. Convert your novel outline to a screenplay outline\n\nTo turn a novel into a movie, the first thing you have to adapt is your thinking. For a movie, you have to think in terms of minutes and of action. You might have to cut scenes to make it fit. You might have to remove plot elements. You might have to remove some characters altogether.\n\nI know that hurts. Take your time to absorb it. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nDon\u2019t even think of starting to write until you have this down. You would be wasting a huge amount of time and effort. I am sure you\u2019ve heard the carpenter\u2019s motto: measure twice, cut once.\n\nGet this right, so that you have to write your screenplay adaptation only once.\n\nRush this step, and you might have to write your screenplay over and over and over\u2026\n\nIn fact, it might be a good idea to spend more time perfecting the outline than writing the screenplay itself.\n\nOne of the harder parts of the outline will be threading through the plot all the emotional developments of the main characters. The plot is \u201cthe\u201d story. But the real story, the one moviegoers react to, is the emotional trajectory of the protagonist. Make sure that your outline fully develops that journey.\n\nStep 7. Optional: develop the treatment\n\nA treatment is a narrative of the film. It is what the outline looks like when being told as a story. You might not need this step for your adaptation from novel to film; you can write a great screenplay from an outline.\n\nSo why bother writing a treatment?\n\nto bring other players on board before you have a screenplay ready\n\nto help with collaboration\n\nto send something shorter and easier to read than a screenplay to a producer or funder\n\nto help you better grasp your own vision and get a feel for whether it will work or needs to be re-worked\n\nA treatment might typically run 10-20 pages. You don\u2019t have to emulate James Cameron\u2019s treatments, which are so long they have been dubbed \u201cscriptments.\u201d The treatment for The Terminator ran over 40 pages.\n\nStep 8. Get screenwriting software\n\nYour focus should be on storytelling, not on formatting. A book to screen adaptation is tough enough without distractions. Get screenwriting software to take the mechanics out of formatting. It\u2019s a great timesaver and an even greater way to reduce distractions.\n\nOur screenwriters use Final Draft, Fade In and Movie Magic.\n\nFinal Draft is the best-known screenwriting software. It will do everything you need it to do. But it does cost $200 to buy, and you\u2019ll have to pay for updates down the road.\n\nMovie Magic is the in-between priced software, at $125. But they charge you for updates, too. One of our writers uses it for writing speed, then transfers to Fade In to clean it up and complete the script.\n\nFade In is an inexpensive alternative that does pretty much anything you would want it to. At $80, with free updates, it\u2019s worth the investment. PC Magazine backs up our opinion:\n\n\u201cFade In costs less than half as much as competitor Final Draft (an industry standard), but they have similar features. If you\u2019re not ready to pay the premium cost for Final Draft, Fade In is an excellent alternative.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Fade In makes a great case for having more features.\n\nAll three software have been used in countless Hollywood productions, so you really can\u2019t go wrong with any of them. It doesn\u2019t look like Movie Magic offers a free trial, but both Fade In and Final Draft do \u2013 so you can get a feel for them before committing.\n\nStep 9. Read screenplays\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t try writing a novel without having read books. Don\u2019t try writing a screenplay without having read any scripts. You want to get a feel for how the elements all fit together. You want to get a feel for the flow and the formatting.\n\nThere are plenty of free screenplays online for you to read. Why not be strategic and read some screenplays that were book to screen adaptations?\n\nStep 10. Finally, you can write!\n\nYou have worked hard and waited a long time to finally start writing.\n\nSorry.\n\nOn the plus side, you\u2019re committed. No backing out now.\n\nRemember to keep the writing tight. This might actually be tough for you as a novelist, especially if you feel that you wrote your novel tight to begin with. When adapting a book to film, you\u2019ll remove all that fluff that you thought was tight before.\n\nIf the the carpenter\u2019s motto is \u201cmeasure twice, cut once\u201d, the screenplay writer\u2019s motto is \u201cget in late and leave early.\u201d What does this mean?\n\nTo illustrate, Brad Johnson describes the first scene of The Dark Knight:\n\n\u201cNotice how we don\u2019t see the criminals showing up for the heist. There\u2019s no round of greetings and introductions, or unpacking of equipment. It jumps right into it with the bank job having already started. Any earlier than this, and the audience starts off bored, waiting for the real point of the scene to begin; any later than this and the audience might be confused about what\u2019s actually going on. This scene HAD to start here in order to accomplish the point(s) of the scenes. \u201cAnd now, let\u2019s look at the end of the scene\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s a great character moment for The Joker, and gives us our first glimpse of how deranged he is. But then the scene cuts as he drives away in the bus. We know that the grenade is going to explode; that the poor bank manager is doomed. But we don\u2019t stick around and watch the explosion. Why? The reason is simple: we don\u2019t need to. The point of the scene has been accomplished. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on to the next part of the story.\u201d\n\nTo turn a book into a movie, you might not have to cut much of the dialogue. But you\u2019ll probably have to cut a lot \u2013 maybe even most \u2013 of the scene descriptions. You might also have to cut some backstory and even write some minor characters out of the film.\n\nThis bears overemphasis. You need to focus on the story. Separate the characters that are important from those who are just fillers. If the character doesn\u2019t drive the story, wave them goodbye. This goes back to the \u201cget in late and leave early\u201d motto.\n\nOne of our writers, Mark, was adapting a book into a movie for a client. A character was breaking into a high-security office and hacking a computer to re-arrange some emails. In a later chapter of the book, he was doctoring the evidence from his own computer and sending another email to divert attention and cover his tracks. This second part would have taken a minute or two of precious screen time. To adapt the book for the screen, Mark had the character tell a friend in dialog what he had done to cover his tracks. That saved a whole scene, since Mark wrote it into dialog that was already happening.\n\nOn the other hand, you might need to add a character or a scene to move the story forward in place of some inner dialogue that won\u2019t work in film or some slow action that would take too much screen time.\n\nFor instance, many things you\u2019ve written into your novel might need to be explained out loud. That requires someone to explain them to. Faithful readers of this blog will know what a huge Doctor Who fan I am. The Doctor\u2019s companions play this very important role. Without them, the Doctor would have no way to explain to screen viewers so much of what could simply be narrated for readers into a book.\n\nPay attention to the beginning and the ending of your story. When adapting your book for the screen, you might have to change one or the other. Or both. Yes, sacrilege! That messes up your \u201cperfect\u201d novel.\n\nAgain, sorry.\n\nBut focus on the story. What would make a really great story on film? Often, that means jumping into a place you don\u2019t get to right away in the book. And often it means ending in a different way.\n\nSometimes, you might want to make major changes in between. The 7-8 year old \u201csporty young girl who loves baseball\u201d Lex Murphy of Jurassic Park, the book, becomes a 12-14 year old computer geek in Jurassic Park, the movie. On the other hand, the 11 year old dinosaur- and computer-loving Tim Murphy of Jurassic Park, the book, loses his glasses and interest in computers, as well as a few years of age, in Jurassic Park, the movie. So, go ahead and play with whatever elements of your story will work better on the screen when adapting a novel into film.\n\nStep 11. Get feedback on your screenplay adaptation\n\nAsk people to visualize the movie version as they read your freshly-written script. Now you\u2019re into territory you are surely familiar with from when you sought feedback from beta readers. Seek feedback and edit until it\u2019s a stellar script.\n\nIf you want professional feedback, our screenplay writers can offer a high-level review. We\u2019ll read your screenplay and make suggestions on how to improve it for production. We\u2019ll provide examples whenever appropriate. You\u2019ll typically get a few pages of comments \u2013 solid, practical advice.\n\nAdapting books into film is a lot of work\n\nIn some ways, it is almost more work to adapt a novel into film than it is to write the screenplay from scratch. Yes, you have the story. But you have to un-learn so much of it. You have to re-think so many aspects. One of the main challenges of adapting a novel to film is re-envisaging the story. And even for creative people like authors, that\u2019s not always easy.\n\nBut if your story is good, it can be very rewarding to turn your book into a movie.

He often wrote, produced, and scored the movies he directed, many of which became cult classics.\n\nWhen Carpenter was five years old, he moved with his family from northern New York to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where his father began teaching music history and theory at Western Kentucky University. Carpenter was a fan of western and horror films and wanted to make his own movies from an early age. After high-school graduation he spent two years (1966\u201368) at Western Kentucky before transferring to the University of Southern California\u2019s cinema program (now the School of Cinematic Arts). As a student, he cowrote, composed the music for, and edited a short western film, The Resurrection of Billy Broncho (1970), which won an Academy Award for best live-action short subject. He also began his first feature film as a student, but he left school to complete Dark Star (1974), a science-fiction comedy that he wrote with Dan O\u2019Bannon while they were classmates.\n\nBritannica Quiz Halloween\n\nCarpenter then wrote, directed, scored, and edited the thriller Assault on Precinct 13 (1976). The movie, often described as a combination of Howard Hawks\u2019s Rio Bravo and George Romero\u2019s Night of the Living Dead, was initially poorly received but quickly became regarded as a high achievement. Carpenter then made the classic horror film Halloween (1978). Starring Jamie Lee Curtis as a terrorized babysitter, the movie relied more on creating tension and fear than on ostentatious gore. It won critical praise and immediate popularity, and it inspired numerous imitations, including sequels that Carpenter neither wrote nor directed.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s next movie, The Fog (1980), a ghost story, was not as well reviewed but still found a large audience. The sci-fi thriller Escape from New York (1981) starred Kurt Russell as a convict tasked with rescuing the U.S. president from a New York City converted into a maximum security prison. It was a box-office hit that became another cult favourite. The Thing (1982), the first of several movies for which he served as director only, was more appreciated later than at the time of its release. Christine (1983), adapted from a Stephen King novel about a possessed car, and the sci-fi movie Starman (1984) were both well received.\n\nFollowing the failure of the big-budget action film Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Carpenter returned to writing and directing low-budget horror movies, including Prince of Darkness (1987) and They Live (1988). He also helmed the comic Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), In the Mouth of Madness (1994), Village of the Damned (1995), Escape from L.A. (1996), Vampires (1998), and The Ward (2010). Although these were not as popular as his earlier movies, some of them developed devoted followers. One of his segments for the anthology TV show Masters of Horror, entitled John Carpenter\u2019s Cigarette Burns (2005), was praised as a return to form.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s film scores were regarded as major contributors to the artistic success of his movies, and he began releasing albums of such music, much of it new, in the 21st century. These included Lost Themes (2015), Lost Themes II (2016), Anthology: Movie Themes 1974\u20131998 (2017), and Lost Themes III: Alive After Death (2021)."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/john-carpenter", "page_content": "(1948-)\n\nWho Is John Carpenter?\n\nFilmmaker John Carpenter developed an interest in film and music early on. At the University of Southern California, he had his first success with a short student film. While he enjoyed his biggest hit with 1978's Halloween, Carpenter continues to thrill and disturb audiences with such films as 2011's The Ward.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nCarpenter, born on January 16, 1948, in Carthage, New York, developed an interest in film and music as a young boy. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, where one school project, The Resurrection of Bronco Billy, won him an Academy Award (best live action short subject) in 1970. Carpenter co-wrote the screenplay and composed the music for the film.\n\nWorking with Dan O'Bannon, Carpenter started his first full-length movie while at USC. Dark Star, a sci-fi comedy, started out as a short film about astronauts on a mission to blow up unstable planets, but the pair later expanded it to feature length. Carpenter handled many responsibilities on the film, serving as its director, producer, writer and composer. Made a shoestring budget, Dark Star was released in 1974 and eventually became a cult classic.\n\nPaying to tribute to the westerns of Howard Hawks, especially his masterpiece Rio Bravo, Carpenter next worked on Assault on Precinct 13 (1976). The low-budget film is an urban retelling of a traditional western standoff, with a Los Angeles police station coming under siege by gang members. Carpenter earned kudos for this gritty thriller with the London Times calling him \"a first-rate story-teller.\"\n\nCommercial Success: 'Halloween' and 'The Thing'\n\nWith his next effort, Halloween (1978), Carpenter made his name nearly synonymous with the horror genre. Again wearing many hats, he served as the director, co-writer and composer on what became one of the highest-earning independent films of all time. Costing only $300,000 to make, Halloween terrified movie audiences with the story of Michael Myers, a killer who escapes from a mental institution to returns to his hometown to wreak havoc. Donald Pleasence played Myers's doctor from the institution and Jamie Lee Curtis appeared as a teenage babysitter trying to avoid Myers's murderous wrath.\n\nCarpenter drew comparisons to famed director Alfred Hitchcock for his ability to take the audience on a visual thrill ride. Critics also complimented him for his advanced technical skills. This suspenseful and violent film paved the way for a wave of other slasher movies, such as Friday the 13th. Halloween itself became a film franchise, but without Carpenter onboard. He only penned the screenplay for Halloween II (1981).\n\nWith his initial success, Carpenter found himself working on studio films and with larger budgets. Again turning to horror and suspense, Carpenter wrote and directed The Fog (1980). The residents of a small coastal town had to battle against the zombielike beings, the former inhabitants of an old leper colony. His then-wife, actress Adrienne Barbeau, co-starred with Curtis in the film. Turning to a gritty, futuristic action drama, Carpenter worked on Escape from New York (1981) starring Kurt Russell. Both films opened to disappointing reviews and mixed box office results. Carpenter teamed up with Russell again in 1996 when he directed Escape from L.A. Teaming up with Russell once more, Carpenter directed the cult-classic horror film The Thing in 1982.\n\nTaking on one of the literary masters of horror and suspense, Carpenter directed the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King's Christine. He took a break from his usual fare for the science fiction romance Starman (1984) starring Jeff Bridges. Bridges played an alien who takes over a dead man's body and becomes involved with the man's widow (Karen Allen). The film proved to be a critical and commercial success with Bridges earning an Academy Award nomination for his work.\n\nLater Career\n\nReturning to independent film, Carpenter has continued to work with varying degrees of success, but none matching the heights he reached with Halloween. Horror thriller Prince of Darkness (1987) and sci-fi action flick They Live (1988) failed to attract much of an audience. Carpenter tried comedy, directing 1992's Memoirs of an Invisible Man with Chevy Chase, which also proved to be a disappointment.\n\nAfter the 2001 sci-fi thriller Ghosts of Mars, Carpenter took a break from directing. He worked on a few television episodes, but he did not return to the big screen until 2010 with The Ward. In the thriller starring Amber Heard and Mamie Gummer, young female patients at a mental institution suffer at the hands of an evil ghostly figure.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCarpenter has a son, Cody, from his first marriage to actress Adrienne Barbeau. The couple was married from 1979 to 1984. Carpenter has been married to producer Sandy King since 1990.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: John Howard Carpenter\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: January 16, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Carthage\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: A master of horror, John Carpenter created the 1978 thriller hit 'Halloween,' which has inspired and influenced countless other filmmakers.\n\nIndustries\n\nHorror\n\nAstrological Sign: Capricorn\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\n\n\nWestern Kentucky University\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.audible.com/blog/article-best-sci-fi-adaptations", "page_content": "One of the pleasures of listening to sci-fi books is the ideas they explore, from artificial intelligence to space travel and alien species. Beyond raising fascinating possibilities, the best works of science fiction ask big questions: What does it mean to be human? What will the future look like?

Sci-fi, as a medium, is incredibly well-suited to tackle complex and thorny issues while also telling riveting, imaginative stories.\n\nAnd those riveting, imaginative stories are part of what makes sci-fi books such great candidates for film and television adaptations. Humans may not have figured out interstellar travel yet, but we can do some amazing things with special effects.

In Germany, I\u2019m a filmmaker. In the US, I\u2019m a bum.\u201d\n\n\u2013 John Carpenter\n\nAmerican filmmaker John Carpenter is undoubtedly one of the most influential artistic voices to have ever graced the horror genre. Over the years, Carpenter has produced brilliant cult-classics like the 1978 slasher Halloween and his 1982 magnum opus The Thing. His contribution to his chosen art form is immeasurable, and it was rightly recognised in 2019 when the French Directors\u2019 Guild awarded Carpenter with the Golden Coach Award at the Cannes Film Festival. On his 73rd birthday, we reflect on John Carpenter\u2019s illustrious legacy as a pioneer of horror as a tribute to the talented director.\n\nBorn in 1948 in Carthage, New York, Carpenter displayed a keen interest in films and filmmaking from a very early age. As a child, he was mesmerised by the magical westerns of John Ford and Howard Hawks as well as low-budget sci-fi horror films like 1951 effort The Thing From Another World. He felt drawn towards the possibilities of cinema and began making short horror films on 8mm even before starting high school. The son of an accomplished music professor who was the head of the music department of Western Kentucky University, Carpenter initially enrolled at his father\u2019s university but eventually transferred to the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts in order to fulfil his dreams of learning more about the world of cinema. It was at USC that he gained recognition for his talent, winning an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for his work as the editor, composer and writer of The Resurrection of Broncho Billy (1970). During his time at USC, he also made a fascinating short film about a bored computer worker who becomes obsessed with a woman and begins stalking her. Titled Captain Voyeur, the eight-minute short was only rediscovered in 2011 and proved to be of immense interest to scholars because it had many precursors to Carpenter\u2019s artistic sensibilities.\n\nCarpenter\u2019s first major film as a director came four years after The Resurrection of Broncho Bill when he collaborated with Dan O\u2019Bannon on a sci-fi comedy called Dark Star. An interesting and enjoyable visualisation of space colonisation, Dark Star became a cult-classic which influenced many other works in the same genre. When O\u2019Bannon realised that some of the comedic parts felt flat in the film, he reworked them into Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 magnum opus Alien and turned them into moments of spine-chilling horror. However, Carpenter considers his 1976 work Assault on Precinct 13 to be his first real film because he worked on a proper schedule while making it. Inspired by Howard Hawks\u2019 Rio Bravo (1959) and George A. Romero\u2019s horror classic Night of the Living Dead (1968), the film was made on a budget of under $100,000 and earned Carpenter praise for his ability to be a masterful storyteller even while working with limited financial resources. He would use this valuable skill to its full extent in 1978 when he made his most popular film Halloween on a budget of around $300,000. Halloween would go on to earn $70 million at the box office, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time. Initially dismissed by some critics, Halloween is the gold standard for contemporary horror films now and its omnipresent influence can hardly be overstated. While speaking about the film, Carpenter said:\n\n\u201cI decided to make a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk down the corridor and things jump out at you.\u201d\n\nHalloween showed just how good Carpenter was at translating the horror of the narrative to the cinematic medium, utilising effective camerawork as well as an iconic score that was inspired by Suspiria (1977) and The Exorcist (1973). Halloween is often seen as the definitive slasher film which had a formative influence on the genre, and although many have claimed that the idea was \u201ccopied\u201d from Bob Clark\u2019s 1974 film Black Christmas, Clark himself clarified that Halloween was its own entity. During this time, Carpenter also made televisions films like Someone\u2019s Watching Me! (1978) and Elvis (1979), starring Kurt Russell. He also wrote the script for the 1978 thriller Eyes of Laura Mars, featuring Faye Dunaway and Tommy Lee Jones, which would become his first major studio film. The Halloween franchise remains the most successful project in Carpenter\u2019s career to this date, spawning sequels, remakes, novelisations and even a video game. Even though it wasn\u2019t the best work in Carpenter\u2019s impressive filmography, Halloween was the film that caught the public\u2019s attention and immortalised Carpenter as a master of horror in the mainstream consciousness.\n\nThe filmmaker followed up Halloween with an especially difficult project in 1980 when he made the supernatural horror film The Fog. Drawing inspiration from Tales from the Crypt and The Crawling Eye (1958), Carpenter was extremely dissatisfied with the rough cut of the film and tried to salvage it by including new scenes and editing around the mess. It resulted in further disintegration of his artistic statement and led to an unfavourable critic reception, despite making $21 million in the US. The next couple of years would see Carpenter churning out two amazing films while he worked on getting his career back on track, starting with the 1981 sci-fi adventure film Escape From New York which starred the likes of Kurt Russell and Harry Dean Stanton. He further cemented his filmmaking legacy with the best work of his career, the 1982 sci-fi horror film The Thing. Set in the hostile landscape of Antarctica, Carpenter based his vision on the foundation laid out by the 1951 classic The Thing From Another World and the John W. Campbell, Jr. novella Who Goes There? which was the source material for both the films. It was released in the same year as Spielberg\u2019s phenomenally successful film E.T. and turned out to be the first financial disappointment of Carpenter\u2019s career. However, time has been kind to The Thing and it is now considered to be one of the best films in the sci-fi horror sub-genre. In a 2001 interview, Carpenter reflected, \u201cHad it worked, my career would have been very different. Very different.\u201d\n\n(Credit: Nathan Hartley Maas)\n\nHe tried to move on from the disappointing reception of The Thing by directing a film adaptation of a work by one of the most successful horror novelists of all time, Stephen King. Carpenter\u2019s 1983 rendition of Christine was well received, but the filmmaker maintained that he only took this project on because nothing else was being offered to him at the time. The very next year, he directed a sci-fi romance film called Starman which earned its star Jeff Bridges his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of an alien who finds love when he comes to Earth. A period of decline shortly followed, with big projects slipping through Carpenter\u2019s fingers. He was offered the chance to direct Santa Claus: The Movie and The Exorcist: III but none of it ever materialised, forcing Carpenter to go back to directing low budget films such as Prince of Darkness (1987) and They Live (1988) which would later go on to became cult classics but failed to replicate the commercial successes of his earlier works. The 1990s was a difficult period for Carpenter because he produced multiple critical and commercial failures like Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), Village of the Damned (1995), and Escape from L.A. (1996). He also planned on returning to the Halloween franchise as a director for Halloween H20: 20 Years Later but the producer Moustapha Akkad wasn\u2019t willing to pay Carpenter\u2019s desired starting fee of $10 million.\n\nVery few directorial gigs came Carpenter\u2019s way after this which made him redirect his energies on producing remakes of his films, but his involvement was minimal. \u201cI come in and say hello to everybody. Go home,\u201d Carpenter dejectedly recalled. He returned as a director in 2005 when he made an episode for Showtime\u2019s Masters of Horror and followed up with another episode for the 2006 season. Parallel to his film career, He also expanded his expertise by focusing on his love for video games while designing soundtracks for games like Sentinel Returns and worked as a narrator/consultant for the video game F.E.A.R. 3. Carpenter returned to the big screen in 2010 with The Ward, not having directed any feature film since the 2001 sci-fi thriller Ghosts of Mars. The supernatural psychological horror film was yet another critical and commercial failure, signalling the underwhelming end of Carpenter\u2019s filmmaking legacy.\n\nDespite this, Carpenter remains an important artist who has influenced countless others with his work, including the likes of Danny Boyle, Quentin Tarantino, Edgar Wright and Guillermo del Toro among others. His films have also inspired video games like Dead Space 3, a franchise that Carpenter is especially enthusiastic about adapting for the big screen. When asked about it, he said, \u201cI\u2019d love to do that one. But no one\u2019s even near asking me to do that, so I don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d There have been a lot of regrets in Carpenter\u2019s career, especially when you notice the sheer amount of unrealised projects that the filmmaker could not work on. There are so many that there is a separate Wikipedia page for it.\n\nJohn Carpenter is continuing his legacy by moving in a different direction now. He recently signed a deal for co-producing horror stories with the podcast service Serial Box and is actively looking for a \u201cnew way to strike fear into the hearts of our audience.\u201d In an interview conducted a few days ago, Carpenter was asked about how he felt about the future of the world. He responded:\n\n\u201cI want humanity to survive, as deadly as we are. I think part of us is real good. Art and music are reasons to live and distinguish ourselves above other creatures. So I hope for the future.\u201c"}, {"url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/books/can-authors-control-how-their-work-is-adapted-for-film/", "page_content": "To go from the ridiculous to the sublime, way back in the day, Graham Greene wrote the mystery noir The Third Man as a novella in preparation to write the screenplay for Carol Reed\u2019s film. Though it wasn\u2019t originally intended to be read by anyone, the text was actually published after the release of the film in 1949, which has to be one of the earliest cases of a tie-in novelisation for a film.\n\nBut in most cases, it comes down to deconstructing the story in its original medium and then re-tooling it for a visual medium, a process that can\u2019t possibly be more delicate if undertaken by the author than by an impartial screenwriter.\n\nAs David Nicholls, the screenwriter who adapted his One Day into a 2011 film directed by Lone Scherfig, told Word & Film: \u201cThe best analogy is that adapting your own work is like cutting your own hair; sometimes you want someone to take a look and make sure the back looks okay. The only person who wants the movie to be longer is the screenwriter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely possible for films to miss the point though, and it\u2019s almost as if the less than glowing consensus about films based on books has led to the current trend of getting authors more involved in the process of film adaptations.\n\nIn terms of blockbuster adaptations, the average turnaround from the publication of the book to the release of the film is usually within a decade at the most. For instance, Harry Potter had the gap down to four years, almost all the way through its run. As we\u2019ve said before, those films are almost unusually faithful to JK Rowling\u2019s books, in comparison to other adaptations of its ilk. Any fan who thinks otherwise, and complains that characters like Ludo Bagman didn\u2019t make it into the films, arguably doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re born.\n\nBut the Potter films, together with other adaptations of the 2000s, could be seen to have made the box office environment in which films are unerringly reverent to the source material, especially very recent books. It also set the trend, followed by Twilight, The Hunger Games, and Divergent, of splitting the last book into two films, just to make sure it gets everything in the saga (as well as every last penny out of it.)"}, {"url": "https://lithub.com/the-10-best-literary-film-adaptations-of-the-decade/", "page_content": "As you may have noticed, over the past few weeks, we\u2019re been looking back at the best books from the decade, from novels to poetry to nonfiction.

Earlier this week, we published our list of the best television adaptations of the decade, and now, as promised, I present our list of the decade\u2019s best films adapted from books.\n\nTake note that we attempted to judge the films in question on their own independent merits; while many of us have read the books these shows are based on, we didn\u2019t base our decisions on fidelity to, or creativity of departure from, the original text.

His 2011 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo very easily could have made it, too\u2014it was arguably one of the most anticipated adaptations in several decades, and despite a lukewarm critical reception at the time has been aging pretty well into something closer to wide acclaim. Mindhunter gets a nod in the TV department. But the real crowning achievement of Fincher\u2019s impressive decade is the one with no killers, no gore, and no brooding violence at all, really, except the violence done to the American social fabric thanks to the rise of a new class of reckless tech billionaires. Somehow, with its dark campus landscapes, Trent Reznor score, and unabashed displays of ambition, The Social Network turns out to be one of Fincher\u2019s most insidious, disturbing works. The adaptation, from Ben Mezrich\u2019s 2009 book, The Accidental Billionaires, was done by none other than Aaron Sorkin, and like Mezrich\u2019s book, the screenplay zeroes in on the lawsuits filed by the various founders and early developers of Facebook. Depositions have never been captured so perfectly on film, with Jesse Eisenberg as the seething anti-hero, Zuckerberg, facing off against rivals, enemies, and himself. Looking back almost ten years later, it\u2019s incredible just how prescient The Social Network was about the principles and players behind social media. Fincher and Sorkin seemed to see clearly the insecurities and threats behind this strange force.\n\n\u2013Dwyer Murphy, CrimeReads Managing Editor\n\nTrue Grit (2010)\n\nBased on: True Grit by Charles Portis (1968)\n\nTrue Grit, directed by Joel and Ethan Coen in 2010, is the second adaptation of Charles Portis\u2019s 1968 novel of the same name. The first one, which was made in 1969 and starred John Wayne (in the November of his career), was a chipper, watered-down version of the original story, a vehicle for Wayne to pastiche his whole career as a crochety, no-nonsense cowboy. Wayne won an Oscar (kind of as a tribute) for his role as the crapulent, cantankerous, eye-patch-wearing U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn, forever associating himself and his legend with the film. The Coen Brothers\u2019 retelling of the story fully (productively) ignores that the first True Grit even happened, drawing its script from Portis\u2019s grim novel, to focus more on the protagonist that the first film dismissed: Mattie Ross, a formidable fourteen-year-old girl who arrives in a small town to retrieve the body of her murdered father. Played to poker-faced perfection by Hailee Steinfeld (and Elizabeth Marvel, later on), Mattie hires Rooster (Jeff Bridges, who has in the last two decades found his calling playing sloppy, insouciant older men) to hunt down and take into custody Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), her father\u2019s murderer. Also along for the ride is a patronizing Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf (Matt Damon, who pronounces it \u201cluh beef\u201d). While the film is structured around the hunt for the killer, it is more about the relationships between the three characters on the journey\u2014or, really, the lack of relationships between them. The film eschews the traditional \u201cit\u2019s the journey, not the destination\u201d clich\u00e9 of so many expedition-focused stories\u2014the yearning for a connection between them is there, but they are not able to bring it to fruition.\n\nBut this is a Western, which means that the relationships that form are not limited to humans. Mattie\u2019s most loving connection will be to Little Blackie, the shiny horse she picks out for herself to ride on the trip. He will (spoiler) ultimately give up his life to save hers, carrying her to medical care after an accident. Horses in True Grit, seem to play a particularly large role in the film\u2019s construction of a moral hierarchy and are represented as providing integrity to an otherwise cold and chaotic world. As emblematized most obviously by the strutting, gauche Rooster, the wild west of True Grit turns everything and everyone into animals. As Mattie (her family\u2019s breadwinner, now) tries to avenge her father, she is truly on the hunt for humanity and support\u2014someone who can help her carry her family through this hard time. But humans, with their nominal superiority of morality and thought, will almost always fail her. And the film beautifully, sadly, darkly, watches humanity leave her with nothing\u2014like the horses who love her back, she too must live as a beast of burden. \u2013Olivia Rutigliano, CrimeReads Editorial Fellow\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)\n\nBased on: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy by John le Carr\u00e9 (1974)\n\nSwedish purveyor of moody, broody atmospherics Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) conjures the beige-hued, ashen-faced world of jaded British spycraft so impeccably in his adaptation of John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s seminal 1974 novel that you can almost smell the stale cigarette smoke and flop sweat, feel the scratchy suit fabric and stained shag carpeting. Gary Oldman plays the latest incarnation of Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s beleaguered-but-deceptively-cunning career intelligence officer George Smiley, here brought out of retirement and tasked with rooting out a Soviet mole in the upper echelons of the secret service. Alongside him is a rogue\u2019s gallery of stony-faced British acting royalty: Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt, and Tom Hardy, to name but a few. These are men whose emotional lives have been slowly eroded by the grim rituals and moral compromises of service. The whole thing is just so damn bleak, but in a transfixing kind of way. I know that\u2019s a strange argument to make for exalting a film to Best of the Decade status, but Alfredson\u2019s remake is such a fully realized vision that every time I sit down to watch TTSS (usually in the dead of night) I am instantly transported, mesmerized. It\u2019s paradoxical, but there\u2019s something both deeply soothing and deeply unnerving about following Oldman\u2019s stoic, melancholy Smiley through the ruins of this fallen kingdom\u2014a post-Kim Philby landscape of stagnating enmities and vanished idealism.\n\n\u2013Dan Sheehan, Book Marks Editor\n\nThe Hunger Games (2012)\n\nBased on: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins (2008)\n\nWith all due respect to everyone who got really mad at Martin Scorcese for saying superhero movies weren\u2019t art, I don\u2019t think that The Hunger Games is great art\u2014but I do think it\u2019s a great adaptation. Not only does it capture the spirit of the book in all its distinctly YA-flavored but still genuinely frightening glory, but it\u2019s also highly entertaining. This is the kind of movie that I\u2019ll watch any time I see it on a screen\u2014much like a character in The Hunger Games unable to look away from the Hunger Games. For one thing, the casting is impeccable: Stanley Tucci at his campy best as Caesar Flickerman! Woody Harrelson as loveable grump Haymitch Abernathy! Wes Bentley! Remember him from American Beauty? He became a director after all! The director of the Hunger Games! This movie\u2019s montage game is also really strong. I think probably what happened was that the directors gave one overarching note on the screenplay, and that note was \u201cCan this be a montage?\u201d And the answer was often yes! As is the answer to \u201cShould I watch The Hunger Games?\u201d Jennifer Lawrence is also in it.\n\n\u2013Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\nGone Girl (2014)\n\nBased on: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn (2012)\n\nAlthough Gone Girl needs no introduction, here I go anyway. Gone Girl, the movie, was adapted from Gone Girl, the book, first published in 2012 by Gillian Flynn to immediately become a bestseller. Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl went on to sell two million copies in its first year. The psychological thriller, directed by David Fincher\u2014director of every film you\u2019ve heard of, including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u2014starred Rosamund Pike, Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris, and Tyler Perry (among the producers is also Reese Witherspoon) with Gillian Flynn at the helm, writing the screenplay, and was released to wide critical acclaim in 2014, grossing to $369 million. Meanwhile, Rosamund Pike\u2019s performance as Amy Dunne earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. With all the official praise out of the way, now I get to lapse into the story that became a phenomenon.\n\nGone Girl opens on the day of Amy Dunne\u2019s disappearance, the same day that marks the beginning of the unravelling of her husband Nick Dunne, who is being accused of her murder. In due course, the narrative pulls out from the investigation into Nick Dunne\u2019s culpability and Amy Dunne\u2019s found diary entries, to switch over to Amy, who really, is alive and framing her husband for her murder to punish him for being a bad husband. He is no longer the man she married. The film opens the same way that it closes, with an intimate close up of Amy who is lying down, and staring back at the camera, in a look that should seem affectionate and flirty but instead is unnerving in how ruthless it is. The line Nick speaks over this scene\u2014held too long for comfort\u2014is, \u201cWhat are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?\u201d These words reverberate throughout the movie only to toll again at the finale.\n\nThe film is full of chilling contrasts that augment its tension and reinforce its suspense. Notable is Fincher\u2019s excellent depiction of Gone Girl\u2019s noir aesthetic: evident, for example, in the very dimly lit, empty (albeit in the morning) bar that Nick and Go own, where they play board games while drinking scotch and making light of crude jokes that make one squirm. They also complain about Amy. Excellent in the film is Detective Rhonda Boney: straight-faced, with a southern accent, and a wry humor that disarms New York-endorsed snob Nick just a few minutes into their meeting. A great scene: Nick has just called the police after seeing the living room furniture overturned and the front door ajar, and as procedure requires, Detective Boney evaluates the house; she steps into his bedroom and inquires, casually, about this profession. Nick says he\u2019s a writer. He also owns a bar, named The Bar. \u201cOh, The Bar,\u201d Boney says, \u201cLove the name. Very meta.\u201d Detective Boney is everything we\u2019ve been taught the crime detective should be, only she is no fool, and she is not arrogant. That is more than we can say about her younger, male lieutenant who is blood-thirsty: he wants Dunne arrested, no matter the evidence. I could go on quite a while about the details of this movie, but the last and very important note I will end on is Amy\u2019s chilling monologue that introduces her true persona to the audience.\n\nWearing sunglasses and driving with one arm out the window\u2014the arm from which she drew blood to stage a convincing crime scene\u2014Amy is cruising down a country road in the sunlight and we, at this point, know what she did. Here, she gives her iconic \u201ccool girl speech,\u201d the speech that makes a convincing case for the adage, \u201cHell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\u201d The beauty of the speech is that it is dramatic, dripping with anger and, even though we know Amy is a psychopath, and we know we would never take things that far . . . . yet, there\u2019s a flash of a second where we\u2014the audience\u2014nod along and say, yes. Yes. After praising it so highly, it would be cruel to leave you hanging, so here\u2019s a piece of that monologue: \u201cMen always say that as the defining compliment, don\u2019t they? She\u2019s a cool girl . . . . Hot and understanding. Cool girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m the Cool Girl. Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they\u2019re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl.\u201d It keeps going\u2014the monologue, in the film, in the book, in your head. Thus is the effect, the phenomenon, of Gone Girl.\n\n\u2013Eleni Theodoropoulos, Editorial Fellow\n\nCarol (2015)\n\nBased on: The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith (1952)\n\nIn the dining room of a nondescript hotel by the side of the highway, Therese and Carol are sharing breakfast when a man can\u2019t resist the chance to intrude. Sitting down at their table, he peppers them with questions, and they reply with brief, vague answers, as a parallel but much more interesting conversation plays out between their faces; the subtle raised eyebrow, the mocking nod, a world of communication in plain sight yet utterly hidden to the man in front of them. Based on Patricia Highsmith\u2019s The Price of Salt\u2014a book that broke new ground when it was published in 1952 for portraying a lesbian relationship that does not end in despair or death\u2014Carol communicates so much with this kind of unspoken connection and understanding, which made it possible for queer women to find and love each other in an era that would have preferred they remain invisible.\n\nThe love story between two women, which begins in the holiday season of 1952, is equally joyful and mindful of the many dangers posed by society\u2019s resistance to queerness and queer sexuality. A.O. Scott wrote for The New York Times that viewers watch the two lovers \u201cin public places, hidden in plain sight, cloaked in unspoken assumptions that are at once painful and protective.\u201d Unlike so many other queer narratives, though, an awareness of that danger does not overshadow their intimacy; instead, it casts light on the tactics that queer women had to employ in order to survive, with incredible results.\n\n\u2013Corinne Segal, Senior Editor\n\nThe Handmaiden (2016)\n\nBased on: Fingersmith by Sarah Waters (2002)\n\nPark Chan-wook\u2019s radical adaptation of Sarah Waters\u2019s novel (by radical I mean he transmuted the action from Victorian-era Britain to 1930s colonial Korea, which was just as rigid and striated by class) was hands-down my favorite film of 2016, never mind my favorite adaptation of a novel. It starts slow, and quiet, which only makes what eventually unfurls\u2014involving an elaborate, multi-faceted con, a torture chamber, a lesbian awakening, a library of porn, and an octopus\u2014that much more striking. Every moment of this film, which is both a love story and a thriller, is gorgeous, and hypnotic, and sexy, and weird as hell. It is beyond good.\n\nAnd though I know we\u2019re not supposed to be considering the adaptation process, this one was remarkable: it improved upon a book that I already loved. As I wrote back in 2016, the film \u201cexcised everything I didn\u2019t like about the book (an over-complicated, fairly slow third act, for one thing) and replaced it with what I really wished for\u2014the collaboration between these two strange, powerful women. The experience of watching the film reminded me of reading contemporary retellings of fairy tales\u2014it\u2019s a deeply satisfying wish-fulfillment that takes something already good and vital and twists it until it\u2019s unbearably delicious, until it\u2019s exactly what you want. This felt like a feminist reimagining of an already feminist novel.\u201d\n\n\u2013Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nArrival (2016)\n\nBased on: \u201cStory of Your Life\u201d by Ted Chiang (1998)\n\nWhat if language was the key to knowledge, not only about your neighbor, but about strangers and yourself as well? By the end of Arrival, the Denis Villeneuve film based on Ted Chiang\u2019s 1998 short story, \u201cStory of Your Life,\u201d the viewer understands this as the movie\u2019s central question. Linguist Louise Banks (played by the ever-reliable Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are called by the US Army to help study one of twelve extraterrestrial spacecrafts that have positioned themselves in scattered locations around the world. What Banks and Donnelly discover aboard the craft are two amorphous alien specimens, which they call \u201cheptapods,\u201d that communicate using a complicated system of logograms, or written characters that represent a word or phrase. This straightforward set-up lays the groundwork for a moving, and often anxiety-inducing, investigation of language, empathy, and miscommunication. Arrival\u2019s surprising endgame cemented it as one of the most heartfelt movies of the last decade. The film\u2019s meditative aesthetic is also boosted by a rather primal, ruminative score by the late, great Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. \u2013Aaron Robertson, Assistant Editor\n\nCall Me By Your Name (2017)\n\nBased on: Call Me By Your Name by Andr\u00e9 Aciman (2007)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Aciman, author of Call Me By Your Name, initially thought he would dislike director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s adaptation; from the moment he arrived on a visit to the set, he wrote for Vanity Fair, it was clear that Guadagnino\u2019s vision for the film was significantly different from the one that had driven his own writing. But the final result, which he saw at the Berlin International Film Festival, and in particular the film\u2019s infamous last shot, floored him. \u201cThe ending captured the very spirit of the novel I had written in ways that I could never have imagined or anticipated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn Guadagnino\u2019s hands, Aciman\u2019s narration of the interior, obsessive Elio, a prodigious 17-year-old, becomes a series of languid Italian summer days over which a love story unfolds between him and Oliver, the older graduate student who comes to stay in their family\u2019s house over the summer. Filmed in the Lombardy region of Italy, the film is so visually lush as to seem unreal, and the intensity of the connection it explores\u2014and all the self-searching that follows it\u2014is almost painful to watch, as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Elio) and Armie Hammer (Oliver) bring a palpable chemistry and sense of constant, unresolved desire to their roles. Its setting, \u201cSomewhere in Northern Italy,\u201d is deliberately vague, Anthony Lane noted for The New Yorker\u2014\u201dthe point of a paradise is that it could exist anywhere but that, once you reach the place, it brims with details so precise in their intensity that you never forget them,\u201d he wrote. This film is a paradise worth your time and definitely one of the best adaptations of the last decade.\n\n\u2013Corinne Segal, Senior Editor\n\n***\n\nDissenting Opinions\n\nThe following adaptations were just barely nudged out of the top twenty, but we (or at least one of us) couldn\u2019t let them pass without comment.\n\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)\n\nBased on: We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver (2003)\n\nWhat happens when someone you love turns out to be a monster? We Need to Talk About Kevin (WNTTAK) understands the complexities of love, grief, anger, and mourning intimately. Based on Lionel Shriver\u2019s 2005 novel of the same name, the film has quickly surpassed its source material in both reach and reputation. Told from the perspective of Kevin\u2019s mother, played to intense perfection by Tilda Swinton, WNTTAK begins with a lonesome Tilda, living in a rundown house and visiting her teenage son in prison. He\u2019s done something terrible, something so terrible that Swinton\u2019s neighbors no longer talk to her, but what? A gradual series of flashback sequences reveals Kevin\u2019s difficult upbringing, his mother\u2019s growing suspicion of his psychopathy, and finally, the explosive violence that lands him in prison in the first place.\n\nIf you prefer to end every film with the sensation that everything is pointless and we might just as well curl up in the fetal position and die (but also love exists and is very creepy), then this film is for you! It\u2019s also part of a continuum of complex attitudes towards motherhood stretching back to Doris Lessing\u2019s The Fifth Child and beyond. Motherhood is ambiguous. So is love. And so is that ending. . .\n\n\u2013Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Associate Editor\n\n\n\nCloud Atlas . . . but only the trailer (2012)\n\nBased on: Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell (2004)\n\nThe trailer for the film Cloud Atlas, directed by the Wachowski sisters, is the single most moving work of cinema ever made. It is basically as long as a real movie (a 5 minute and 42 second-long movie trailer!) and it is more enjoyable than watching the actual whole film of Cloud Atlas, an extremely ambitious and staggering epic that tells a giant six-generation, cross-continental, time-jumping narrative packed with very famous movie stars (though are they performing as people of other races, at times? Yes. Yes they are.) The novel on which the film is based, which was written by David Mitchell, is a beautiful, complicated tale of different individuals at different moments in time, from an 19th-century voyager in the Pacific, to an impoverished family in a futuristic primitive world. Mitchell\u2019s book is subtle and the connections between the six different stories within are more like soft threads. The film on the whole transforms the book in a somewhat awkward literalization of many of its smaller details (the movie becomes all about reincarnation in a way the book only touches upon it)\u2026 but this movie trailer, which can\u2019t tell the full story of the movie (though it kind of tries, with its expanse), is a collection of stunning notes, coming together much more smoothly and (helpfully) vaguely than in its full iteration. You go watch this trailer, with its perfect deployment of that one M83 song and snare drums and lonely piano themes and stunning colors and heartbeat-matching montage cut points and slow motion and Jim Broadbent and gravelly voiceovers like \u201cI believe there is another world out there, a better world\u2014and I\u2019ll be waiting for you there\u201d and you TELL me that it does not deserve to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. You look me eye and tell me.\n\n\u2013Olivia Rutigliano, CrimeReads Editorial Fellow\n\nThe Great Gatsby (2013)\n\nBased on: The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)\n\nHere are just a few of the (myriad) reasons why Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 2013 lush-as-fuck and much-maligned adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s magnum opus is actually one of the great cinematic achievements of the 21st century: (i) The trailer. Remember how excited we all were when this dope trailer dropped? Remember how alive it made us feel? (ii) The soundtrack: Beyonc\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 3000 covering Back to Black, Jack White covering Love is Blindnessand, most especially, that young and beautiful Lana del Rey song (which I still listen to on the regular on my runs) Luhrmann pipes in over this glorious montage of Nick and Daisy hitting golf balls into the ocean and flinging beautiful silk shirts around the room. (iii) The party scenes. Just look at them all there, having a grand old time with their money and their sparkly clothes. (iv) The casting of Jason Clarke and Isla Fisher as George and Myrtle Wilson. Dead on. (v) The way DiCaprio\u2019s Gatsby says the line \u201cI\u2019m certainly glad to see you, as well.\u201d So intense. DiCaprio, the boyishly handsome rhino and Millennial/Gen Z model enthusiast who has spent a decade in roles that require him to look perennially on the brink of a complete mental breakdown, was born to play this role and I will brook no argument there (vi) Joel Edgerton absolutely going for it as Tom Buchanan. Not since Billy Zane\u2019s Cal Hockley I enjoyed a wealthy shittheel villain so much. (vii) The way the movie wisely tones down the anti-Semitic Meyer Wolfsheim caricature. Good note, Baz. Good note. (viii) That Leo-raising-a-champagne-glass gif we all know and love. (ix) The way Tobey Maguire\u2019s Nick Carraway adds that flourish to his sanatorium framing device novel at the movie\u2019s close. All movie codas should be as bold in their purist-trolling as this.\n\n\u2013Dan Sheehan, Book Marks Editor\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (2013)\n\nBased on: Much Ado About Nothing, by William Shakespeare (1623)\n\nCertain people in the office groaned when I announced that I wanted to write about this film, but those people are foolish. Look, no one would claim that this Much Ado About Nothing, directed by Joss Whedon and staged in his own house, is better than the official Much Ado About Nothing, directed by Kenneth Branagh in the \u201990s (two more groan-worthy things), but it\u2019s certainly more elegant, and hey, it\u2019s the same play (my favorite). You can\u2019t really mess up this play, which contains the best character in Shakespeare\u2019s oeuvre\u2014or maybe I\u2019d give Beatrice and Puck a shared top billing, but the point stands. Perhaps most importantly, if you are a fan of other works created by Joss Whedon, ahem, this movie can be understood as an extended piece of fan fiction in which Wesley and Fred finally get together instead of the latter dying tragically in the former\u2019s arms before they\u2019ve even slept together. I mean, look at them, up there. Trust me when I say it\u2019s very satisfying.\n\n\u2013Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nSnowpiercer (2013)\n\nBased on: Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette\n\nSnowpiercer!!!!!! It\u2019s so good, y\u2019all.\n\nSnowpiercer is a 2013 Korean-American production directed by indie darling Bong Joon-ho and based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob with a striking (get-it?) premise. In an apocalyptic scenario where the world has become too frozen to sustain human life, the only survivors are on board a train called Snowpiercer, barreling around the world just fast enough to preserve the lives of those onboard \u2013 but all survivors are not equal. We begin the narrative in the \u201cthird class\u201d section of the apocalypse, as we learn about the train\u2019s highly stratified class system, held in place by a rigidly applied system of barbaric punishment administered by a terrifying Tilda Swinton.\n\nThe oppressed masses soon begin a rebellion against their fur-clad overlords, and as they journey from the back of the train through gradually increasing opulence, fighting their way to the engine car, audiences are forced to question if this kind of survival is worth surviving at all. Snowpiercer also gets mad props most creative/prolific arm removal \u2013 like, five characters get their arms cut off this movie. Each in a different way. Something to know ahead of time, especially if you\u2019re planning a drinking game around it.\n\nA perfect action film with a solid Marxist message that draws strong visuals from its comic book origins and takes narrative inspiration from video games, Snowpiercer is one of the must-see films of the decade.\n\n\u2013Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Associate Editor\n\nThe Edge of Tomorrow (2014)\n\nBased on: Hiroshi Sakurazaka, All You Need Is Kill (2004)\n\nThe 2014 Tom Cruise sci-fi actioner The Edge of Tomorrow AKA Live Die Repeat is adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka\u2019s light novel, All You Need Is Kill, but perhaps the true ur-text is the 1993 Harold Ramis/Bill Murray classic Groundhog Day. What\u2019s it about? Well, the plot is almost beside the point; its the premise here that\u2019s everything: it\u2019s the near future, and aliens have invaded Europe, and Cruise\u2014a combat-unready military PR sleazeball\u2014is dragooned by Brendan Gleeson into active duty for a D-Day style invasion, where he is almost instantly killed only to awaken the day before with his memory intact and forced to live through the slaughter again and again and again. Until, that is, with the help of badass warrior Emily Blunt, he learns to become a mechanized-bodysuit-fighting master and to better understand his enemy and, maybe, himself? I know, but it\u2019s incredibly satisfying. There\u2019s just so much glee to be had in the bonkersness and boldfaced derivativeness of the conceit, the video-game action sequences and the scenery-chewing supporting performances\u2014and, of course, in watching Cruise (as the type of smarmy bastard that usually gets described as \u201cplaying against type\u201d but always seems to suit him best) get 86-ed over and over. To watch this movie is to appreciate how little so many of its genre-mates are able to enjoy themselves, and how little they seem interested in your enjoyment. The Edge of Tomorrow, above all else, knows what I need to enjoy myself, and it wants me to have it.\n\n\u2013Emily Firetog, Deputy Editor\n\nInherent Vice (2014)\n\nBased on: Inherent Vice by Thomas Pynchon (2009)\n\nThe reputation of Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 2014 adaptation of Pynchon\u2019s gonzo-PI novel has been growing fairly steadily since its first release, when, let\u2019s be honest, it was hard to know exactly what to make of this thing. First off, like just about any PI story worth its salt, the \u201cplot\u201d doesn\u2019t really make a whole lot of sense. Sense isn\u2019t the point. (See, e.g. The Long Goodbye, book and movie; rinse, repeat.) Atmosphere is the point\u2014an ambiance, some style, a little confusion, a little tension, and in this case a fine, drug-laced balancing act somewhere between ennui and paranoia, a certain feeling in the air that went hand-in-glove with the mourning of a decade\u2019s promise, innocence lost, friends disappeared, dead and gone. Based on the 2009 Pynchon neo-noir, Inherent Vice is set in 1970s \u201cGordita Beach\u201d\u2014a stand-in for Manhattan Beach in its scruffy bohemian heyday\u2014and follows the dubious private eye casework of one Doc Sportello, a man capable of walking the city\u2019s mean streets in the mode of Chandler\u2019s Marlowe, though in this case the streets are full of 1960s washouts and burnouts, and the bete noir is one Bigfoot Bjornsen, the LAPD\u2019s local fascist hippie-hater. That\u2019s a fairly ineffable mood but Paul Thomas Anderson manages to capture it along with some help from Joaquin Phoenix, Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and a long, strange cast of characters. What starts out seeming to be an exercise in oddness and unexpected detour slowly, almost inexplicably morphs into something far more tender and poignant, a weird, lovely meditation on the people and scenes that move in and out of our lives, gone forever.\n\n\u2013Dwyer Murphy, CrimeReads Managing Editor\n\nElle (2016)\n\nBased on: Oh\u2026 by Philippe Djian\n\nElleis a brilliant, disturbing movie that I will not watch again. Isabelle Huppert plays Mich\u00e8le Leblanc, the artistic director of a video game company, who is one day raped in her home by a masked assailant. After the assault, Mich\u00e8le does not call the police but instead cleans up the blood and broken glass, and resumes her life. One might list Elle among a long list of \u201crape revenge\u201d movies, as many critics have, though it was immediately clear that the film was attempting something much bolder than the usual fare. The fact that director Paul Verhoeven wasn\u2019t able to convince American actresses or film studios to make the film says something about the ugly frankness of Elle\u2019s Machiavellian attempts to rebuild her life and self-image after such a heinous violation. Elle, which was released in 2016, the year before the #MeToo movement spiked in popularity, was an inadvertent bellwether of soon-to-be-revived debates around male and female power, sex, and sexual ethics. \u2013Aaron Robertson, Assistant Editor\n\nLady Macbeth (2017)\n\nBased on: Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District by Nikolai Leskov (1865)\n\nHas there ever been a protagonist more terrifying than Katherine, the Lady Macbeth of William Oldroyd\u2019s haunting adaptation of Leskov\u2019s novella (itself inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s most famous female character)? Sure, a lot of characters are cold, and a lot of characters start with one little murder and then work their way up in intensity (of method and victim), but as I\u2019ve written in this space before, most of them don\u2019t, well, win at the end, and most of them aren\u2019t played by Florence Pugh, who nails Katherine as a blank, amoral antiheroine in a fairy tale\u2014one of the original fairy tales, where people routinely die, disappear and get dismembered\u2014who suffers, more than anything else, from idle hands. It\u2019s a shame more people didn\u2019t see this film, despite its disturbing imagery; any lovers of Ottessa Moshfegh and Catherine Lacey and yes, the Bard himself, should seek it out.\n\n\u2013Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nHidden Figures (2018)\n\nBased on: Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly (2016)\n\nBased on Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s bestselling nonfiction book of the same name, Hidden Figures tells the little-known story of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson\u2014the brilliant black women who were behind one of NASA\u2019s greatest achievements. (Had you heard of them before this? I certainly hadn\u2019t.) Without these women breaking down barriers and fighting for a seat at the table, astronaut John Glenn never would have been successfully launched into orbit. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e do an incredible job of bringing these women to the forefront of this Space Race story. There is one scene that has stuck in my mind, years after I\u2019ve seen it. Because segregated bathrooms are still in place at NASA when the events of this film unfold, we see Taraji P. Henson running across the campus grounds, crossing a great distance to go to the \u201ccolored bathroom.\u201d At first, it\u2019s almost played up for a little bit of comic relief. But as it goes on, we see the toll it takes on her work. Then her white male supervisor berates her in front of her colleagues for leaving her desk for so long, and she finally fires back telling them where she\u2019s been going for forty minutes at a time, screaming that this is something they would never even have to consider. It\u2019s a real turning point in the movie, a cleverly included detail that hits on a terrible reality of the time. But Hidden Figures doesn\u2019t hit you over the head with it. It doesn\u2019t linger in this injustice. The movie is also filled with joy and laughter and small victories and strong female friendship. The story itself is heartwarming and inspiring, and the film adaptation is a fitting celebration of these game-changing women.\n\n\u2013Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nCan You Ever Forgive Me? (2018)\n\nBased on: Can You Ever Forgive Me? by Lee Israel\n\nI find it very comforting to watch characters act out of desperation and that\u2019s not something I intend to examine at all! Even if you don\u2019t share my totally unremarkably interest in downward spirals, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is worth watching. Adapted from Lee Israel\u2019s memoir of the same name, the film is part buddy comedy (Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant play Israel and her friend/partner in crime Jack Hock), part heist, and all spiny dark comedy. It\u2019s also, as A.O. Scott writes, \u201ccatnip for the bookish,\u201d as the crime in question is selling forged correspondence from literary giants including Dorothy Parker and No\u00ebl Coward. One of the things I love about the film is that while it certainly doesn\u2019t glamorize Israel\u2019s crime spree (she forged 400 letters, which I think qualifies as a spree), it does respect her talent as a mimic. The script\u2014written by Jeff Whitty and the brilliant Nicole Holofcener\u2014is funny and mean and very, very tense, and Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Lee Israel is one of my favorite Unlikeable Women of the decade.\n\n\u2013Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\n***\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nA selection of other adaptations that we seriously considered for both lists\u2014just to be extra about it (and because decisions are hard).\n\n127 Hours (2010) \u00b7 The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011) \u00b7 Moneyball (2011) \u00b7 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1) (2011) \u00b7 Jane Eyre (2011) \u00b7 Anna Karenina (2012) \u00b7 Cloud Atlas itself (2012) \u00b7 The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) \u00b7 Cosmopolis (2012) \u00b7 Under the Skin (2013) \u00b7 Blue is the Warmest Color (2013) \u00b7 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) \u00b7 Divergent (2014) \u00b7 Room (2015) \u00b7 The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015) \u00b7 The Martian (2015) \u00b7 Still Alice (2015) \u00b7 Spotlight (2015) \u00b7 The Lost City of Z (2016) \u00b7 If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) \u00b7 Blackkklansman (2018) \u00b7 We the Animals (2018) \u00b7 The Sisters Brothers (2018) \u00b7 The Wife (2018)."}, {"url": "https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/all-john-carpenter-movies-ranked-by-tomatometer/", "page_content": "(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAll John Carpenter Movies Ranked by Tomatometer\n\nJohn Carpenter was still a student at USC when he started piecing together what would become his first feature: 1974\u2019s Dark Star, a sci-fi comedy about intrepid goofballs in deep space. Carpenter not only directed, but also wrote, produced, and scored the music \u2014 a DIY approach that would characterize his most legendary work.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Carpenter\u2019s relentless synth theme that opens 1978\u2019s Halloween, his third feature (made after the claustrophobic Assault on Precinct 13) that would go on to shock audiences with its violation of suburban idyll, break box office records, and change the face of horror for decades to come. Though Michael Myers quickly grew up in the hands of other producers, Carpenter was never too far from his baby in the genre/horror world. 1980\u2019s The Fog was icily efficient, while Escape From New York gave us sardonic action icon Snake Plissken and a blueprint of infiltration-and-rescue movies for plenty of low-budget directors to copy. Carpenter followed that up with his paranoid masterpiece, The Thing, in 1982, a year that gave us a bonanza of other sci-fi influencers like Blade Runner, E.T., and Tron.\n\nStill, Carpenter showed no sign of slowing down in the \u201980s, with the release Stephen King adaptation Christine, softening his image with Starman, and putting out beloved goofy lark Big Trouble in Little China. 1988\u2019s They Live, the action/horror hybrid satire that body checked consumerism and media propaganda, would mark his last Fresh movie to date.\n\nSome of his work in the \u201990s certainly has its legions of fans \u2014 the Lovecraftian In the Mouth of Madness and Escape From L.A. especially \u2014 but critics and audiences were losing patience with his cobbled-together filmmaking style. 2001\u2019s Ghosts of Mars was a bomb that effectively sent him to Hollywood jail, insomuch as it would be 10 years before his next (and perhaps final) feature, The Ward. Carpenter has since focused on his moody synth music, putting out albums and performing live. Thus, he was able to return to the Halloween franchise with the Certified Fresh 2018 sequel as composer and executive producer.\n\nAnd now we look at his directorial work as we rank all John Carpenter movies by Tomatometer. \u2014Alex Vo\n\n#16 The Ward (2010) 33% #16 Adjusted Score: 34947% Critics Consensus: Lacking the hallmarks of his best work, The Ward proves to be a disappointingly mundane swan song for director John Carpenter.

Hell, that summer saw a spate of genre classics released, including \u201cThe Road Warrior,\u201d \u201cPoltergeist,\u201d and \u201cE.T.\u201d But June 25th in particular saw not only the release, as we discussed earlier today, of \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d but also another legendary sci-fi picture, which like Ridley Scott\u2019s film, wasn\u2019t well-received at the time, and flopped at the box office, but went on to be enshrined in the geek hall of fame. No, it\u2019s not Barry Bostwyck vehicle \u201cMegaForce,\u201d but John Carpenter\u2018s terrifying \u201cThe Thing,\u201d which despite the efforts of last year\u2019s poor retread/prequel, remains one of the greatest sci-fi/horrors ever made.\n\nTechnically a remake of Howard Hawks\u2018 well-loved 1951 \u201cThe Thing From Another World,\u201d which Carpenter pays tribute to in the opening moments, the new film took a very different approach, ramping up both the paranoia and the eye-popping physical effects, which maintain the power to disgust even today. To mark the 30th anniversary of John Carpenter\u2019s \u201cThe Thing,\u201d we\u2019ve assembled five facts you may not be aware of. Unless you\u2019re one of them\u2026 Check them out below.\n\n1. \u201cTexas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d helmer Tobe Hooper was the first director attached.\n\nProducer Stuart Cohen (who keeps an excellent and detailed blog about the making of the film), David Foster and Lawrence Turman took the prospect of a remake of Howard Hawks\u2018 \u201cThe Thing From Another World\u201d (or more accurately, a new, more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell\u2019s story \u201cWho Goes There?\u201c), to Universal, where Turman-Foster Productions had a deal, in the mid 1970s. \u201cThe Sugarland Express\u201d writers Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins had the rights, but they passed on the new adaptation, and Universal picked up the book from them. While Cohen says he wanted his old USC classmate John Carpenter involved from the start, the director hadn\u2019t yet broken out with \u201cHalloween,\u201d and Universal had Tobe Hooper, director of \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\u201d under contract at that point, and he was hired along with writing partner Kim Henkel. However, producers weren\u2019t pleased with their script, described by Cohen as \u201ca sort of Antarctica \u2018Moby Dick\u2019 with an Ahab-like character (I believe his name was The Captain) battling a large, but decidedly non-shape shifting creature\u2026a tone poem with a stab at a Southern, Davis Grubb-like feel\u201d After a meeting with \u201cAnimal House\u201d helmer John Landis, playwright David Wiltse was brought on, but that draft too failed to meet muster, and neither did a treatment from \u201cLogan\u2019s Run\u201d scribe William F. Nolan. The project then languished for a few years until the success of \u201cAlien\u201d saw it pick up steam again, and Carpenter, who\u2019d reinvented the horror genre with \u201cHalloween,\u201d was loosely attached, although didn\u2019t want to write the script himself. A number of scribes were approached, including sci-fi legend Richard Matheson (who turned it down), \u201cQuatermass\u201d creator Nigel Kneale, and \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d writer Derek Washburn, but it was Bill Lancaster, son of screen legend Burt Lancaster, and writer of the \u201cBad News Bears\u201d movies, who proved the right fit, with Carpenter declaring his eventual draft \u2014 delivered three and a half months late \u2014 as the best script he\u2019d ever read. Even then, there was nearly another hitch \u2014 just as the film threatened to be greenlit, Carpenter thought that a horror-western passion project \u201cEl Diablo,\u201d was close to being made at EMI Films, and nearly bailed. Walter Hill, Michael Ritchie and even Sam Peckinpah were all discussed as replacements before Carpenter came back to the fold.\n\n2. Australian actor Jack Thompson was nearly cast in the lead role, while Ernie Hudson, Donald Pleasance, Brian Dennehy and Lee Van Cleef all came close to parts too.\n\nKurt Russell had starred in two of Carpenter\u2019s last three pictures: 1979\u2019s TV movie \u201cElvis\u201d and 1981\u2019s \u201cEscape From New York,\u201d but the director was wary of working with him too many times, and initially looked elsewhere for an actor to play MacReady. Overtures were made to Jeff Bridges, Christopher Walken, Nick Nolte, Kris Kristofferson and Sam Shepard, but all were unavailable, or turned the project down. More serious meetings were held with John Heard, Tom Berenger, Fred Ward, Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Peter Coyote and Tim McIntyre (the latter four all passing on the project), while Carpenter favorite Tom Atkins (\u201cThe Fog,\u201d \u201cEscape From New York\u201c) was an early front-runner. Surprisingly, it was Australian actor Jack Thompson who\u2019d won Best Supporting Actor at Cannes for \u201cBreaker Morant\u201d (and has gone on more recently to parts in films including \u201cDecember Boys,\u201d \u201cAustralia\u201d and the upcoming \u201cGreat Gatsby\u201c) who came closest, being flown in to read for Carpenter personally. But ultimately, the director decided the project would be best served with a reunion with Russell. Other Carpenter vets were in the running for parts too \u2014 \u201cHalloween\u201d star Donald Pleasance was considered for Blair, but it was decided to go for a less familiar face, and Wilford Brimley got the gig instead. Meanwhile, Lee Van Cleef was up for Garry, along with Jerry Orbach, Kevin Conway, Richard Mulligan and Powers Boothe, while Russell\u2019s \u201cEscape From New York\u201d co-star Isaac Hayes was in consideration to play Childs, as were Geoffrey Holder, Carl Weathers and Bernie Casey, while Ernie Hudson came very close. In the end, Donald Moffat and Keith David took the roles. Finally, Brian Dennehy, who\u2019d also been up to play MacReady, was very nearly Dr. Copper (William Daniels also read), before Carpenter decided on Richard Dysart.\n\n3. Keep your eyes (and ears) peeled for cameos from John Carpenter and his then-wife Adrienne Barbeau.\n\nThanks to Alfred Hitchcock, directors are more keen to make some kind of brief cameo in their own work (or worse, want to cast themselves in a lead role they\u2019re entirely ill-suited for \u2014 M. Night Shyamalan, we\u2019re looking at you\u2026) And true to form, Carpenter. who made physical or vocal cameos in most of his films from \u201cDark Star\u201d to \u201cMemoirs Of An Invisible Man,\u201d does crop up in \u201cThe Thing,\u201d as one of the Norwegians in the video footage. Meanwhile, the director\u2019s then-wife Adrienne Barbeau, who\u2019d starred in \u201cThe Fog\u201d and \u201cEscape From New York,\u201d lends her voice to the chess computer. Probably less recognizable is the rifle-carrying Norwegian in the opening; the part was played by Larry J. Franco, who was an associate producer, the 2nd unit director, and at the time, was married to Russell\u2019s sister Jill (he\u2019s gone on produce \u201cBatman Begins\u201d and \u201c2012\u201d among many others). Carpenter claims on the DVD commentary that Franco was making up his Norwegian lines, speaking nonsense, but in fact, it does make sense, albeit in a broken way. It does give the game away to any Norwegian viewers, however; the lines translate as \u201c\u201dGet the hell outta there. That\u2019s not a dog, it\u2019s some sort of thing! It\u2019s imitating a dog, it isn\u2019t real! Get away you idiots!\u201d\n\n4. Special effects whiz Rob Bottin was only 22 when he handled most of the effects, although Stan Winston was brought on for one particular creature.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the most sickeningly memorable aspects of the film are the gruesome special effects, handled with puppets (and occasionally stop-motion, although Carpenter scrapped much of what was planned, finding it unconvincing); they still hold up, and churn stomachs today, even in adorable claymation form (see below). The man responsible for achieving most of the effects was Rob Bottin, who was a mere 22 years old when the film was in production. Bottin had been hired by effects legend Rick Baker at the age of 14, and went on to work with the maestro on \u201cKing Kong\u201d and \u201cPiranha,\u201d among others (as well as some of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d creatures \u2014 Bottin even plays in the cantina band in the original film). The 20-year-old was introduced to Carpenter by DoP Dean Cundey, and got a credit for contributing special makeup for \u201cThe Fog,\u201d before going on to his first solo gig on Joe Dante\u2018s \u201cThe Howling,\u201d where he created an astonishing werewolf transformation sequence that still vies with Baker\u2019s in \u201cAn American Werewolf In London\u201d for the finest ever. He went straight onto \u201cThe Thing,\u201d and created and operated the majority of effects himself, working seven days a week, and had to check himself into hospital once shooting wrapped to recover from exhaustion. He did, however, have a little help; the late Stan Winston did create the nausea-inducing dog-thing puppet, although was so impressed by Bottin\u2019s work that he refused credit.\n\n5. An alternate, happy ending was shot, but has never been shown.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-Ray do include one alternate ending, where the Thing, taking the form of the sled-dog once again, looks back at the flaming camp before running off into the wilderness, suggesting that attempts at containing the threat have failed, and that mankind is likely doomed. However, a far happier ending does exist, although it\u2019s been seen by only a few who weren\u2019t involved with the production. On the DVD documentary \u201cTerror Takes Shape,\u201d editor Todd C Ramsay details that he suggested to Carpenter that they cover themselves by shooting a happy ending while they still had Russell available (the actor was going on to shoot \u201cSilkwood\u201c), in case it became necessary later on. Carpenter agreed, and an alternate conclusion was filmed, whereby MacReady is rescued, and given a blood test that proves he\u2019s not a creature. Thankfully, it was never used, and has never been included on any release of the film (although a radically different TV edit, disowned by Carpenter, featuring opening voiceover, cuts for violence and language, and longer introductions to the cast, was created by Universal in the 1980s). As for the canonical ending, Carpenter still insists that he doesn\u2019t know which of MacReady or Childs is really The Thing at the end. And that\u2019s the way we like it.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://crimereads.com/the-15-most-film-adapted-women-crime-writers/", "page_content": "While the world at large bemoans the lack of opportunity for women directors, Hollywood has never felt the same reluctance when it comes to female novelists, happily assigning the biggest directors of the era to tackle complex subjects and reinterpret them in filmic code. It\u2019s easy to forget how many films have been adapted from works by women writers, given how frequently the textual basis for famous films has been allowed to go out of print. (Many of the authors mentioned below I came to first through their cinematic mirrors before I came to know them as words.) Thanks to the Feminist Press at CUNY and their Women Write Pulp Series, the Vintage Movie Classics series, the Women Crime Writers series from Library of America, the Dover Crime Classics series, and NYRB\u2019s thankfully endless reissues of classic works (as well as the forthcoming American Classic Mystery series from Mysterious Press) many novels that had been hitherto replaced by their more famous film cousins are now back to being available in print, an essential element in setting text and interpretation up as equally worthy of study.\n\nA note on methodology: Data for this post has been primarily gathered through IMDB, Google searches, and through the CrimeReads\u2019 editors knowledge of crime authors. If there are important names missing from this list, please let us know in the comments section\u2014this is an evolving project. The following writers are ranked by the number of feature films made based on their works, which means TV movies, TV shows, and short films were not counted. This list thus skews towards writers from before the age of television, and many of the 21st century\u2019s biggest crime writers are as consequence missing from the list.All films included are based on work separately published before appearing in film versions, which means that we did not include works where women writers had written an original story for a film. There are also several writers on this list who wrote in multiple genres, included because they had a strong mystery component to their writing, and thus there may be some films counted towards each total that are not strictly mystery films. We also did not count films in production but not yet released, which is why Gillian Flynn is notably absent.\n\nAgatha Christie\n\n45 feature films\n\nThe queen of crime has 45 film adaptations under her belt, with another 3 announced or in production. This giant oeuvre includes at least 7 adaptations of And Then There Were None, filmed all over the world, and with, unfortunately, every version of the title (into the 1980s, a Russian adaptation used a direct translation of the book\u2019s original, and cringe-worthy, title). While most films adapted from Christie\u2019s novels have been British or American productions, there are a number of Soviet and Indian films based on her work. She\u2019s been the darling of various directors\u2014George Pollock directed 4 different films based on her work throughout the 1960s, and now Kenneth Branaugh\u2019s taking his turn revisiting her masterpieces, and yet Christie hasn\u2019t had a single feature film based on her work directed by a woman (the case may be different for tv adaptations\u2014lest we never finish this list, we elected to leave tv for another day). Agatha Christie always pointed to Crooked House as a favorite of her own works and it\u2019s no surprise that Crooked House has been filmed multiple times.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nPatricia Highsmith\n\n20 feature films\n\nWhen I started this list, I thought for sure that Highsmith would top it (although I should never have discounted the vast filmography of Dame Christie), but Highsmith, with 20 feature film adaptations under her belt, came in a respectable second place. Many of these are adaptations of her Ripliad: The Talented Mr. Ripley was first brought to screen in 1960 as Plein Soleil/Purple Noon, directed by R\u00e9n\u00e9 Cl\u00e9mont, and beyond the argument that occasionally consumes our office as to which adaptation is better, Purple Noon or Anthony Minghella\u2019s slicker, more faithful eponymous 90s adaptation, I think everyone can agree that Tom Ripley was meant to be on-screen. Wim Wenders contributed to the filmed Ripliad with The American Friend, adapted from Ripley\u2019s Game and filmed with an unusual approach to language, switching between English and German. Liliana Cavalli, of Night Porter fame, also took a more recent swing at the same story in her 2002 film Ripley\u2019s Game.\n\nBeyond the Ripliad, Highsmith had quite a few big-name directors attached to her work, including Hitchcock\u2019s incomparable adaptation of Strangers on A Train, and Claude Chabrol\u2019s Le Cri de Hibou/The Cry of the Owl, while not as renowned as some of the other adaptations of her work, is still considered a solid contribution to the canon. We can only hope that the success of Carol leads to even more adaptations of her standalone works.\n\nFinally, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and parody is the sincerest form of imitation, then we also have to include a shout-out to Danny Devito\u2019s loving parody of Strangers on a Train, simply titled Throw Mama from the Train, a modern classic. (We assume. We still haven\u2019t seen it\u2026)\n\nDaphne du Maurier\n\n14 feature films\n\nIn third place comes the queen of gothic suspense, Daphne du Maurier, with 14 film adaptations. Du Maurier may be best remembered today for her novel Rebecca, which is either a psychological thriller about the dangers of marriage, a romance for the ages, or a metaphor for closeted lesbian upper-class existence (or all three!), but she also wrote the stories that were the basis for Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds and Nicholas Roeg\u2019s haunting Don\u2019t Look Now, both stories newly available in New York Review of Books\u2019s classic editions. Rebecca was first brought to cinema in 1940 by Hitchcock, then later adapted in Hindi cinema as Kohraa (Fog) in 1964 by Biren Nag, with a twist ending that provided a significant departure from the source material, and the more recent Bollywood film Anamika. Reportedly, Jamaica Inn was both Daphne du Maurier\u2019s least favorite adaptation of her work and one of Hitchcock\u2019s least favorite films, after RKO studios forced Hitchcock to change the film\u2019s ending to preserve the star\u2019s image as a good guy.\n\nBaroness Emma Orczy\n\n14 feature films\n\nTied for third place is golden era crime\u2019s most aristocratic figure, the Baroness Emma Orczy, creator of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the elusive secret agent responsible for rescuing many a French aristocrat from the clutches of the revolution before smuggling them to safety with an utmost amount of derring-do. Many of us may only be familiar with this character because of his unfortunate interactions with Blackadder, but from the silent era through to the talkies, the Scarlet Pimpernel and other characters created by Orczy appeared in 14 feature films (plus tons of shorts), with such winning titles as The Elusive Pimpernel, The Laughing Cavalier, and my favorite, Pimpernel Smith, which is sadly not an exploitation film remake of the Scarlet Pimpernel no matter how much it sounds like it should be. There\u2019s also a Swedish parody called Pimpernel Svensson, and speaking of parodies, now that I\u2019ve typed out those titles next to each other, I realize that these films are EXACTLY what Singing in the Rain is making fun of. I mean, The Dancing Cavalier, come on\u2026The Pimpernel hasn\u2019t appeared in a film since 1950, but thanks to innumerable parodies, the character will live on.\n\nRuth Rendell\n\n9 feature film adaptations\n\nRuth Rendell, who also wrote under the pen name Barbara Vine, dominated the 80s and 90s with her chilling series and feminist stand-alones, so much so that she\u2019s barely been mentioned in the crime world in this century. After years of neglect, it\u2019s time to revisit her work, including the many great films based on her novels (and some mediocre films based on great novels). La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie, Claude Chabrol\u2019s 1995 adaptation of A Judgement in Stone, is reputed to have been her favorite, and Chabrol himself had a life-long interest in adapting English-language crime novels by women into French crime films, as you\u2019ll see when we get Charlotte Armstrong, now little-known in the English-reading public but still revered in France thanks to Chabrol\u2019s many adaptations of her work. Other big-name directors attached to Rendell\u2019s work include Pedro Almod\u00f3var, whose 1997 adaptation of Live Flesh met with much critical acclaim.\n\nMiyuki Miyabe\n\n8 feature films\n\nMiyabe\u2019s known for writing in many genres in her native Japan, but so far, only her books for younger readers seem to have made their way into American hands. Luckily for us, crime cinema knows no bounds (or at least generally comes with an English subtitles option), so we can enjoy her grittier work through numerous film adaptations. Many of her works veer into camp and horror territory, so for a taste of Miyabe at her cold-hearted crime-y best, check out the 2004 flick The Reason, in which the murders of four residents in an apartment block is the catalyst for an unholy reckoning. She\u2019s also now got her own mini-franchise running with two films and one television adaptation of Solomon\u2019s Perjury, in which schoolchildren team up to solve the murder of a classmate.\n\nNatsuo Kirino\n\nFive feature film adaptations\n\nAlso hailing from Japan, Kirino has enjoyed more recognition for her crime fiction in US markets, centered around her classic tale of murder and coverups gone bad, Out. She\u2019s had five novels adapted to cinema, including the critically acclaimed Yawaraka na hou, based on A Tender Place, and the less-than-masterful adaptation of Out, which comes with the wince-worthy tagline of \u201cFour down on their luck housewives murder their husbands and find whacky ways to hide the bodies!\u201d There\u2019s not all that much information in English about the rest of these films, so if you\u2019re into updating IMDB, now\u2019s the time.\n\nCharlotte Armstrong\n\nFive feature film adaptations\n\nCharlotte Armstrong is tied with Natsuo Kirino with five feature film adaptations each. Armstrong, like Ruth Rendell, was a darling of Claude Chabrol, with two novels made into feature films by him, including Merci Pour le Chocolat, based on the novel The Chocolate Spiderweb, and La Rupture, based on the novel The Balloon Man. She also had three films made in English-language markets, including Don\u2019t Bother to Knock, a naughty 1950s mystery starring Marilyn Monroe. Although Armstrong\u2019s works have been out of print in the States for some time, that will soon change with the reissue of several of her works through the new series American Mystery Classics, issued from Penzler Publishers.\n\nVera Caspary\n\nFive feature film adaptations\n\nVera Caspary worked in Hollywood and wrote a number of screenplays as well as treatments, but for the purposes of this list she\u2019s at four feature film adaptions of her separately published work, including three films from the 1930s based on short stories and two films from the 1940s based on her novels Laura and Bedelia, each keeping the same title in film form. Laura, directed by Otto Preminger, is essential viewing to this day (especially in this new era of the girl in the title), while Caspary\u2019s screenwriting talent is on full display in Bedelia, which she adapted herself.\n\nKarin Fossum\n\nFour feature film adaptations\n\nFossum is known as the \u201cNorwegian Queen of Crime,\u201d and her dark, moody thrillers with murder among the fjords have been enjoyed by crime fans across the world, and adapted into four feature films. She tops this list for the number of books adapted to cinema by women directors, with two of the films based on her work directed by women: Eva\u2019s Eye, directed by Berit Nesheim, and House of Fools, directed by Eva Isaksen. No other crime writer on this list has had more than one adaptation with a female director. Her quiet, suspenseful works infuse her Norwegian setting with an unsettling menace, lending a visual quality to her writing that translates well to the screen.\n\nMasako Togawa\n\nFour feature film adaptations\n\nMasako Togawa wore many hats\u2014in addition to writing crime and suspense novels, she was also an early champion of GLBTQ rights in Japan, and worked as an actress, singer, and nightclub owner. So basically, she sounds like the coolest person ever. Her work The Master Key was reissued earlier this year from Pushkin Press, and we hope this signals a new era of appreciation for both her life and works. All of the films adapted from her work came out on the 60s and 70s, and Togawa not only wrote but acted in the first film to be based on her work, The Hunter\u2019s Diary (1964).\n\nClaudia Pi\u00f1eiro\n\nFour feature film adaptations\n\nArgentinian crime writer Claudia Pi\u00f1eiro tops this list from the Latin American crime scene, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, given Argentina\u2019s dedication to both great crime fiction and great filmmaking. Pi\u00f1eiro\u2019s work has recurring themes of secrecy, privilege and corruption, with Argentina\u2019s turbulent history making frequent appearances. Most of the films adapted from her work have come out in the last few years, and we can hopefully expect many more of her novels to make it to the silver screen.\n\nKanae Minato\n\nFour feature film adaptations\n\nKanae Minato led a quiet life as a housewife before she burst onto the international scene with some truly effed up books that explore the many dysfunctions of the modern world and the pressures of childhood in detached, fairy-tale prose. Minato is tied with Pi\u00f1eiro and Togawa at four film adaptations, and what hasn\u2019t been adapted to cinema has made its way to television, with television films and miniseries galore filling out her repertoire. Minato was nominated for an Edgar last year for her ultra-creepy work Penance, and we\u2019re hoping this translates into increased attention for all her works.\n\nElisabeth Sanxay Holding\n\nThree feature film adaptations\n\nSanxay Holding worked as a novelist and screenwriter, and wrote the original stories for a number of films in addition to having three feature film adaptations of her work, including two different films based on The Blank Wall, one of the works included in Sarah Weinman\u2019s seminal anthology of classic women crime writers and one of the greatest works of American mid-century fiction. While her work hasn\u2019t hit the English-language screen since the 1950s, Le Candide Madame Duff, a French film based on her work, was released in 2010, and with recent reissues, the 21st century promises to be kinder to Sanxay Holding\u2019s memory than the latter half of the 20th.\n\nDorothy B. Hughes\n\nThree feature film adaptations\n\nDorothy B. Hughes is another crime writer to be experiencing a renewed interested in recent years, although its been a group effort to keep her classic work In A Lonely Place in print, with three separate reissues in the past 20 years alone, issued by The Feminist Press, Library of America, and New York Review of Books. Nicholas Ray\u2019s 1950 adaptation of In A Lonely Place is not to be missed, although it\u2019s hard to say if any film could measure up to the cool brilliance of Hughes\u2019 greatest work. Hughes also worked as a screenwriter, and you can find her name attached on the Hollywood side to many a picture."}, {"url": "https://deadline.com/2020/05/netflix-david-ayer-direct-harlan-coben-novel-six-years-1202929097/", "page_content": "EXCLUSIVE: David Ayer has found his next film for Netflix.
