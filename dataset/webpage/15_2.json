Although atypical of his usual works, it is widely considered Ford\u2019s last great movie and among his best westerns.\n\nThe story opens with the return of elderly U.S. Sen. Ransom Stoddard (played by James Stewart) and his wife, Hallie (Vera Miles), to their small hometown of Shinbone in the American West. They are there to pay their respects to their old friend Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), who is being buried in a pauper\u2019s grave. Stoddard, who rode to fame as a tenderfoot lawyer credited with having fatally shot the notorious gunman Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), makes a startling confession to local newspaper reporters. In a tale told in flashback, he relates how he arrived in Shinbone hoping to establish a law office but found the town terrorized by Valance and his gang. Although Stoddard was meek in nature, Valance\u2019s continued harassment of him resulted in an impromptu showdown in which Valance was shot dead. Stoddard thus became a local legend, and he was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate. However, he confesses to the local reporters that he had learned years ago that it was Doniphon who actually fired the fatal shot at Valance and later allowed Stoddard to be credited with the deed. Despite his confession, Stoddard finds the press uninterested in publishing the revelation, preferring instead to let his myth remain unaffected. As one journalist says\u2014in the film\u2019s famous tagline\u2014 \u201cThis is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\u201d\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAt the time of its release, the film was not well received by critics, many of whom found it claustrophobic. With mostly interior scenes, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance eschews the lush landscapes and widescreen cinematography that were hallmarks of Ford\u2019s movies. The cast was uniformly superb, even if Wayne and Stewart were arguably too old for their roles. In addition, the film features a host of scene-stealing character actors\u2014including Andy Devine, Woody Strode, Edmond O\u2019Brien, Lee Van Cleef and John Carradine\u2014and Marvin\u2019s Valance is one of the screen\u2019s most notorious villains.

When the local newspaper editor learns he is there, he senses a story. Stoddard explains that he is in town for the funeral of an old friend, Tom Donophin (John Wayne). When pressed further, Stoddard reluctantly decides that it's time to finally tell the tale of his friendship with Donophin and the true story behind his famed shootout with outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).\n\nWhen Stoddard first arrived in Shinbone as a young lawyer, the local area was being terrorised by Valance and his men. Stoddard himself was on a stagecoach held up by the gang on his first trip into Shinbone. The town Marshall, Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), is cowardly and ineffectual and little or nothing is done about Valance's reign. Only Tom Donophin showed any will to resist him.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberty Valance (Lee Marvin, centre) with Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) and Stoddard (James Stewart)\n\nValance's paymasters were local cattle barons, who opposed the territory's forthcoming bid for statehood. As part of their plan, Valance was intended to be selected as one of the territory's two delegates for the territorial convention. When Stoddard and local newspaper editor Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) were selected instead, Valance beat up Peabody and tried to run Stoddard out of town.\n\nBut instead of leaving, Stoddard took his chances against Valance in a shootout and the bandit was killed. This transformed Stoddard's image from a hapless tenderfoot into a man of action and, presumably, helped his political ascent to eventually become a senator. But who really shot Liberty Valance?\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was directed by John Ford, Hollywood's great western maestro. Although he made other notable films, including the thriller The Informer (1935), Best Picture Oscar winner How Green Was My Valley (1941), World War II drama They Were Expendable (1945) and the comedy The Quiet Man (1952), it is with the western genre that he will always be associated. Ford played a major role in shaping the genre in its peak \"classic\" years of the 1940s and 1950s in a series of westerns, including Stagecoach (1939), Mr Darling Clementine (1946), Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and The Searchers (1956).\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance uses the star of most of those films, John Wayne, an actor who could certainly lay claim to being Hollywood's pre-eminent western star. It teamed him with James Stewart, an actor who had put aside his more genial image of the 1930s and '40s in a series of psychological westerns directed by Anthony Mann, beginning with Winchester '73 in 1950.\n\nNeither star is at all stretched by the material they are given in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, but that is precisely why they have been cast. Both Wayne and Stewart are relying on the audience's familiarity with their established screen personas - respectively, Wayne's outlaw western hero and Stewart's mild, likeable man of integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Stewart and Edmond O'Brien with Tom Donophin (John Wayne)\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck (who also produced the film) and based on a 1953 story by Dorothy M. Johnson. James Warner Bellah's own stories had provided the basis for several previous John Ford films, including his \"cavalry trilogy\" -(1948),(1949) and(1950) - and for 1960's, for which Bellah and Goldbeck had written the script. Ford's signature star John Wayne was apparently foisted on him at Paramount's insistence, with Ford taking his displeasure out on Wayne, which caused considerable ill-feeling on the set.\n\nOpinions differ on why the film was made in black and white, with some citing cost issues or technical or aesthetic questions. Others have suggested that it was to cover the stars' age and any ageing make-up required for the film's framing sequence.\n\nJohn Wayne was in many ways the ideal actor to portray the \"old\" West in this film, the west of outlaws, loner heroes, gunslingers and shootouts, and the settlement of disputes with confrontation and violence. Unfortunately, by 1962 he was too old for the part he is required to play here and, even more obviously, so too was his co-star James Stewart.\n\nJohn Wayne's character Tom Donophin is hoping to get married and settle down with Hallie, while James Stewart's Stoddard is a young man making his way in the world and hoping to set himself up as a lawyer. Although why he chose this particular out-of-the-way town is unclear. Both actors were in their fifties at the time the film was made.\n\nVera Miles as Hallie Stoddard\n\n\n\nThe film is much more limited in its settings than the typical Ford western and filmed in stark and serious-looking black and white instead of the vibrant Technicolor of The Searchers or She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. There are no spectacular locations in Ford's familiar Monument Valley here. In fact, there are few locations at all. Instead, the settings are mostly interiors and studio sets, including the generic main street of a frontier town and a small studio canyon where the stagecoach hold up takes place. The studio scenes, filmed at Paramount, are augmented by very limited exterior locations. This gives the film a noticeably darker, more enclosed feel than is usual for a Ford western.\n\n\n\nThere are still some familiar Ford elements, including the usual colourful supporting characters - albeit more subdued than usual. The supporting cast includes Andy Devine as the cowardly Marshall Link Appleyard, who is most interested in his stomach, and Edmond O'Brien as the boozy but righteous newspaperman Dutton Peabody. Liberty Valance's sidekicks, one crazed and one sinister, are played by Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef, the latter before he became a spaghetti western star.\n\nVera Miles (The Searchers) and Jeanette Nolan (Two Rode Together) were both on their second John Ford film and Woody Strode his third, after Two Rode Together and the title role in Sergeant Rutledge. Some more Ford regulars appear in the film, including John Carradine, Willis Bouchey, Carleton Young, Anna Lee, John Qualen, O. Z. Whitehead, Shug Fisher and Denver Pyle.\n\nThe film finds John Ford in a more serious and sombre mood than usual and there is none of the heavy-handed comedy sometimes seen in his westerns and no bar room brawls or punch ups played for laughs. While there are comic touches in the film, they are more subdued than is often the case with this director.\n\nAlthough Ford allows the political meeting scene to go on a little too long, there is humour there from a beer-drinking horse and from John Carradine's self-important delegate. The latter dramatically screws up his supposed prepared speech, only for it to be picked up by a member of the audience who discovers that it's just a piece of blank paper.\n\nStoddard (James Stewart), Valance (Lee Marvin) and Donophin (John Wayne)\n\nis less supple at times than the best of Ford's westerns and the story a little contrived. Some plot elements feel unlikely or under-developed, as when Liberty Valance puts himself up as the candidate for the territorial convention on statehood. He is the preferred man of the (unseen) cattle barons, but it seems unlikely that voters would vote willingly for such a notorious outlaw to represent them. It would be more believable if a \"front\" candidate was proffered instead, with Valance standing behind him to deal out violence to those who vote the wrong way.The duel between Stoddard and Valance is also a little contrived, with Donophin's presence nearby conveniently unnoticed. Fortunately, Valance helpfully falls backwards, in line with Stoddard's own shot, rather than sideways as he would if he were shot from Donophin's position.\n\nLike some other westerns of its time, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance explores the myths and mythologising of the West. It also examines the conflict and contrast between the rule of the gun and the rule of law, the wild and the civilised and, by way of that, with the \"End of the West\". The latter was a recurrent theme in 1960s and early 1970s westerns, and one that seemed to prophecy and parallel the western's own decline as a popular film genre.\n\nThis element of the film is indicated by probably the most famous line from any John Ford film, when the newspaperman learns the truth about Ransom Stoddard's duel with Liberty Valance, and declares emphatically:\n\n\n\n\"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPompey (Woody Strode) with Donophin\n\nLike many of Ford's westerns and others of this genre, this is a film that takes place more in the mythical West than in the historical one. On screen and in fiction, the West was where America was forged - rather than in the revolution of the original thirteen colonies or in the Civil War or in the industrialisation and European mass immigration of the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn the 20th century it was the West that came to be seen as the place where the American spirit was most embodied. Films that deal with the \"taming\" of the West and the closing of the frontier tend to have a bittersweet character, an element captured particularly well in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The transformation and development of the West means a loss as well as a gain. In this case, it's a particular type of American manhood and American character that has been lost, or at least eclipsed, by the coming of schools and railroads and by the arrival of smart guys from out East, with their laws and their rule books.\n\nThe film is not unaware of some of the iniquities of 19th and 20th century American history. When Stoddard is teaching some of the locals in a civics lesson, Donophin's black friend Pompey (Woody Strode) tries to recite from memory the beginning of the Declaration of Independence - in particular, the part where it states that \"all men are created equal\". He loses his way and says that he can't remember the line, to which Stoddard replies that it's alright, a lot of people forget about that part.\n\n\n\nAs Tom Donophin, John Wayne is playing on his established persona as the screen's foremost and most archetypal western star. He is unambiguously masculine and ever-ready to defend himself with a gun if need be, fully understanding of the need to sometimes resort to violence to defend himself and others.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Donophin teaching Stoddard to shoot\n\nJames Stewart's character, Ransom Stoddard, on the other hand, is a man of the East, at least spiritually. While Donophin rides on horseback, Stoddard travels around in a girly carriage, like the typical tenderfoot that he is. When he is waylaid and beaten up by Liberty Valance and his thugs, he doesn't want to shoot him in revenge, as Donophin initially assumes. He just wants to put him in jail. He believes in the rule of law; he is, after all, a lawyer. He is prepared to reluctantly take a stand and defend himself physically if necessary but, crucially, he is not very good at it. He would much rather use the law against his enemies.\n\nQuite apart from his attachment to his law books, Stoddard is often presented as domesticated, even feminised, in the film. He agrees to help out at the local caf\u00e9 and wait on the tables, to the horror of some. And he does the washing up and wears an apron, which he even wears to his shootout with Valance. What could be more feminised than this, the film asks. You wouldn't catch John Wayne wearing a pinny and doing the dishes.\n\nThe town of Shinbone and the surrounding locality, and by extension the wider West, is a world with a degree of ambiguity in its relation to the law. Technically the law exists but, as with the Marshal of Shinbone, it may not be very effective. People should abide by the law, but they also need to be prepared to take it into their own hands and defend themselves if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe clear suggestion in the film is that it takes violence to defeat violence, not law and books and feminised men in aprons. But what comes next? Ironically, the men of violence tame the West and defeat the lawless types like Valance, while making it safe for women and tenderfoots like Stoddard. But ultimately, it's Stoddard who prospers - although only because Donophin brought peace through violent action, something that he was unable to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nValance confronts Donophin, while Stoddard stands by in his apron\n\nJust to make the film's message clear, when the outlaw Valance holds up the stagecoach near the beginning of the film and finds Stoddard's law books, he literally tears them up. There's no law here. And it's the film's outlaw villain, rather than the hero, who is given the suggestive name of Liberty Valance. The character's name almost insists on an interpretation that he represents freedom, as well as lawlessness.\n\nShinbone has liberty (and Liberty), but not the rule of law. The coming of civilization means law and order, but it also means losing some of the freedom and self-reliance that originally created the world of the West.\n\nAs Stoddard's wife Hallie says to him, when they return to Shinbone decades later:\n\n\"It was once a wilderness, now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?\"\n\nThis is a question that the film deliberately leaves hanging, with no answer proffered or implied.\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was a box office success, although the contemporary critical reaction was mixed, with many critics complaining that the film was anti-climactic. More recent commentary has been much more positive and the film is now usually considered to be one of the classic westerns and the last great film of John Ford's career. It was inducted into the US National Film Registry in 2007.\n\nAfter this film, Ford's directorial career would wind down. He contributed a brief section of the Cinerama epic How the West Was Won (1962), which he followed with the broad comedy Donovan's Reef (1963), the unsatisfactory western Cheyenne Autumn (1964) and the female-led non-western Seven Women (1966). Both John Wayne and James Stewart appeared in How the West Was Won, although only Wayne was in the Ford-directed sequence. Wayne also starred in Donovan's Reef, while Stewart appeared in Cheyenne Autumn. The two stars were reunited for John Wayne's final film The Shootist in 1976, directed by Don Siegel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nYear: 1962\n\nGenre: Western\n\nCountry: USA\n\nDirector: John Ford\n\nCast John Wayne (Tom Doniphon), James Stewart (Ransom Stoddard), Vera Miles (Hallie Stoddard), Lee Marvin (Liberty Valance), Edmond O'Brien (Dutton Peabody), Andy Devine (Marshall Link Appleyard), Ken Murray (Doc Willoughby), John Carradine (Major Cassius Starbuckle), Jeanette Nolan (Nora Ericson), John Qualen (Peter Ericson), Willis Bouchey (Jason Tully), Carleton Young (Maxwell Scott), Woody Strode (Pompey), Denver Pyle (Amos Carruthers), Strother Martin (Floyd), Lee Van Cleef (Reese), Robert F.

But two decades later critics see this film quite differently. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is now regarded as one of the greatest works of one of America's greatest filmmakers. It reaffirms John Ford's reputation as the master of the most American of the film genres, the western.\n\nComing late in the career of a director with a long-standing reputation as a creator of popular films, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was completely an auteur project. Ford located the property, developed a script with long-time associates Willis Goldbeck and James Warner Bellah, and raised half the proposed $3.2 million budget needed for an all-star case which included John Wayne and James Stewart in their first film together. Because Wayne had just signed a ten picture contract with Paramount (for which he was paid $6 million in advance), Ford took his package deal to that particular studio. Shooting commenced in September 1961. The completed film was released in April 1962, and quickly played out, to be resurrected a decade later in revivals and retrospectives.\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance presents a very dark view of the western legend. Although the opening sequence is of an \"iron horse,\" confidently moving through the desert, the rest of the film is by and large confined to sequences indoors, usually taking place at night\u2014recorded on a Hollywood sound stage. The Old West has lost the epic proportions of Monument Valley, and moved to a ramshackle town, populated by a handful of people. (An unseen range war occurs off-screen.) The West has been settled; the myth of the western hero is remembered only in flashbacks. Indeed, the western era has already past when the film begins. Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) journey to hometown Shinbone to attend the funeral of an old friend, the true western hero Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Through a long flashback (one that comprises most of the film) we learn how progress came to the West. On his first journey to Shinbone, Stoddard, an earnest young lawyer from the East, is robbed and beaten by archetypal outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Stoddard seeks revenge by trying to civilize the community. But in the end Stoddard can bring the civilized values of the East only through deception and violence. He earns his fame not through the law but as a man who stood up to and killed evil incarnate, Liberty Valance.\n\nTom Doniphon is more tragically caught up in the conflict between civilization and chaos, order and violence. Doniphon is doomed to live in a world to which he can not adapt. Structurally, the film counterpoints the rise of Stoddard with the fall of Doniphon. Gradually Stoddard educates and draws Doniphon's \"girl\" to him through his teachings. (Stoddard literally becomes the school teacher.) Ultimately, when Stoddard does face off with Liberty Valance, the film tells the viewer that it is Doniphon, in a last heroic act, who shoots Liberty Valance. If a viewer looks closely, however, nowhere does the film actually show us who killed Liberty Valance. It is impossible to tell visually whether the bullet was from the gun of Tom Doniphon or that of Ransom Stoddard. But the myth continues. The out-of-date western hero loses his girl, and settles into a life of obscurity, while the lawyer from the East rises to heights of political power, becoming a senator in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the nominating convention for statehood, Stoddard assumes authority. In this sequence Ford mocks the heart of the American political process. This becomes clear when the cattle-baron candidate, one Buck Langhorn, is nominated. Dressed in western dude fashion, this grotesque cowboy \"image\" is all that remains of the values and honor associated with a western hero like Tom Doniphon. Aptly, when the doors swing shut on the convention, that is the last time we see Doniphon alive. As the newspaper editor notes later about Stoddard's rise to power, \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" The desert is now a garden, full of the symbolic cactus rose. The myth is complete with \"progress\" coming to the old West. The honor and values of Stagecoach, the Iron Horse, and earlier Ford westerns will never return again.\n\nTo deconstruct the western as story, Ford finally acknowledged its role as a myth and legend in the history and development of the United States. To create a timeless world of formal artifice, Ford filmed The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance in black and white on a studio soundstage. Furthermore, Ford's distinction between fact and legend also involved the restructuring of the film's time by placing the act of telling between past and present, thus reinforcing the process of deconstructing mythmaking. This narrative framework, the stark stylization of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, and the use of lighting render the flashback (and the flashback in the flashback) into nightmare. This is a stripped down western; the colorful legend and look of Monument Valley have become a barren world of broken dreams.\n\nIn the end The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a great filmmaker's own critique of the form in which he did his best work. It probably now ranks second to The Searchers (1956) in Ford's oeuvre, and is part of what critics and historians now consider Ford's greatest period, the films\u2014especially the westerns\u2014made after World War II. Ford's career is now seen as a slow, steady parabola of change, beginning with certainties about the values of civilization and ending with abject filmmaking, always seeming to follow the rules, yet always breaking with them. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance must be seen as a great achievement of a filmmaker at the height of his power and understanding.\n\n\u2014Douglas Gomery"}, {"url": "https://www.filmsite.org/manwhoshot.html", "page_content": "Background The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) was another nostalgic and memorable B/W John Ford-directed film about the passing of the Old West and the rise of civilization - it was his last great film. James Stewart and Wayne memorably starred together in this picture as contrasting characters - it was their first co-starring appearance in their careers. Wayne's repeated catch-word name for his co-star --- \"Pilgrim\" -- was capitalized upon by Wayne's imitators in later years. Ford had already established himself as one of the greatest and most influential directors of Hollywood westerns of all time (sixteen major feature western films in total), beginning with his two silent era westerns The Iron Horse (1924) about the transcontinental railroad and 3 Bad Men (1926); then came Stagecoach (1939) - a milestone film that revitalized the entire Western genre (and provided a star-making role for John Wayne). Next was the Technicolored colonial frontier drama Drums Along the Mohawk (1939), the retelling of the Wyatt Earp legend in My Darling Clementine (1946), his so-called \"Cavalry Trilogy\" (Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and Rio Grande (1950)), the 3 Godfathers (1948), Wagon Master (1950), his western masterpiece The Searchers (1956), The Horse Soldiers (1959), Sergeant Rutledge (1960), and Two Rode Together (1961). This two hour long, nostalgic modern-day western was one of the master's last westerns, and it had a cynical tone. It was followed by Ford's 22-minute Civil War segment in the middle of the three-screen Cinerama spectacle How the West Was Won (1962) (with John Wayne as General Sherman), and then Ford's last historical epic western Cheyenne Autumn (1964) about the awful late 1870s exodus of three hundred Cheyenne Indians from Oklahoma to their ancestral home in Wyoming. Ford's revisionist or deconstructed 1962 film, a character-driven tale of good (two contrasting male heroes) versus evil incarnate (one major villain), involved a re-examination of Western myth told in a flash-backed story. The theme was about how a significant 'falsehood' and legend had helped to establish the blossoming and flourishing of a \"new\" western political order, and the closing of the frontier characterized by rugged individualism. The new state of things was marked by education and literacy instead of ignorance, the rule of formal, reasoned and written statute law and civil order instead of guns, rose gardens instead of arid deserts, the proliferation of lawyers and politicians, fewer gunslingers and the control of rampant violence. Other revisionist western films would follow: Sam Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969), Arthur Penn's Little Big Man (1970), Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992). There were three important story-telling symbols that were interwoven through the film: a desert cactus rose, a wooden shingle, and a silver-knobbed bull-whip. And although the main locales of the genre-western were archetypal places: the carpentry/undertaker parlor, the newspaper printing office, the restaurant's main dining room, the rowdy saloon, the ranch, and a Convention hall, there were many other minor 'off-stage' areas on the perimeter that played important roles (i.e., the back room with the coffin, the restaurant's kitchen area with a garden and back-alley, the small school-room behind the newspaper office, the ranch's add-on, the side street during the shoot-out, and the back-room at the Convention). In the 1960s, Gene Pitney had recorded a 1962 country-pop hit song, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David) and it was supposed to be the theme song, but it wasn't even featured in the film due allegedly to John Ford's rejection of it, possibly because it sounded too modern. Strangely, the film's main musical theme was taken from Alfred Newman's soundtrack for Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), starring Henry Fonda. There was only one Academy Award nomination, Edith Head's Best B/W Costume Design (won by Norma Koch for What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)). The budget for the black and white film was severely limited, so director Ford didn't have the luxury of on-location filming to showcase the vistas in his favorite locale, Monument Valley. Most of the western was shot on a sound stage, and its set-bound constrictions and cheap look showed in the final print. The script was based on a 1949 short story by Dorothy M. Johnson, written by James Warner Bellah (on whose stories Ford's 'Cavalry Trilogy' were also based) and Willis Goldbeck. This was the second film the two wrote for Ford - the earlier one was Sergeant Rutledge (1960). It starred Ford's frequently-used actor John Wayne (in a quintessential role) in the duo's eighth and last full-length feature film western together, stretching all the way from Stagecoach (1939) to this film 23 years later. In total, Ford directed twenty-one pictures with Wayne, beginning with Mother Machree (1927/1928) and ending with the comedy Donovan's Reef (1963).

William Tecumseh Sherman 9 21 Donovan's Reef (1963) Action Comedy Michael Patrick Donovan * Ford's \"Cavalry\" Trilogy (1948-1950) Plot Synopsis The opening title credits had a wooden signpost design. This foreshadowed a significant and symbolic plot point that referred to the novice lawyer's professional shingle that advertised his profession on the frontier as \"ATTORNEY AT LAW.\" A steam-powered train (an \"iron horse\" with only one passenger car) chugged into the station in the small western town of Shinbone, Arizona, in the year 1910. [Note: Some have also hypothesized that the state (or territory) wasn't Arizona but Colorado, where the oft-mentioned Picket Wire River was located.] Respected, pompous, and elderly Senator Ransom \"Ranse\" Stoddard (James Stewart), a slightly-condescending patrician from the East (Washington DC) had journeyed westward by train with his wife of 25 years Hallie Stoddard (Vera Miles). They arrived unannounced at the depot and were mostly unrecognized, except were greeted and picked up by an old friend, retired Town Marshal Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), buffoonish, slightly obese, squeaky-voiced and jovial, who was commissioned to carry Hallie's huge hatbox. His name signified his \"link\" between the wistful past (\"the old days\") and present, although he had long since given up his star-badge and occupation: \"They haven't elected me Town Marshal for a dog's age.\" The local neophyte Shinbone Star newspaper reporter Charlie Hasbrouck (Joseph Hoover) quickly phoned his editor Maxwell Scott after learning their identity from the train's conductor, Jason Tully (Willis Bouchey). Senator Stoddard happily agreed to an \"exclusive\" interview with Charlie, but for only one reason: \"Dutton Peabody, founder, publisher, editor in chief of the Shinbone Star once fired me.\" The current editor of the newspaper, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) arrived to shake hands, and encouraged Stoddard to be interviewed in the paper's comfortable indoor office. Stoddard claimed he had to again assume the role of politician and \"mend a few political fences,\" and left Hallie in Appleyard's company. Hallie noted how the town had become much more civilized and advanced from the past: \"The place has sure changed. Churches, high school, shops.\" [Note: Already significantly viewed in the small western town setting was a telegraph office, a telephone, overhead electrical wires and a telephone pole on Main Street - signs of progress.] Appleyard confirmed that the coming of the railroad had made a major difference: \"Well, the railroad done that. The desert's still the same.\" She added: \"The cactus rose is in blossom.\" He knew that she was asking to be taken out to the dusty desert, to look once more upon the burned ruins of a remembered but deserted brick ranch-home (with the charred frame of an addition), surrounded by a wild garden of blooming cactus blossoms (\"There's blossoms all around it\"). Hallie left her husband for a short ride with Link to a dilapidated ranch, where outside she reflected: \"He never did finish that room he started to build on, did he?\" She urged Link to cut one of the prettiest lovely blossoms for her - and it was (off-camera) placed in her hat box. [Note: The cactus rose was the film's continuing symbol of the love between Hallie and Doniphon, and of the transformation of the wilderness desert into a lush garden. In the film's conclusion, the dug-up rose from the ranch would be planted atop the coffin of her deceased former lover whom she still revered.] In contrast to Hallie, Senator Stoddard was inside Scott's well-furnished newspaper office with large picture windows separating them from nature. A conspicuous portrait of the paper's esteemed founder, Dutton Peabody, was being honored on the left of the frame. Stoddard held his small audience spellbound (Mayor Winder (Paul Birch) had joined the group), but explained the purpose of his trip was unofficial and \"purely personal.\" When pressed, he said he was there simply to attend the funeral of old friend Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), although the deceased had largely been forgotten and no one knew of anyone significant passing away in town at the time (Maxwell: \"Who's dead, sir?\"). It was ironic that Doniphon had been essentially erased from the past and entered into obscurity, while Stoddard (and Peabody) were both memorialized and remembered. Once Link and Hallie returned, the group ventured down a narrow street and alley into a stable, on their way to a backroom doorway. Inside an undertaker/carpentry shop managed by Clute Dumfries (Earle Hodgins), Stoddard learned there wouldn't be a \"real bang-up funeral\" for Doniphon. The group solemnly viewed the plain pine-box coffin holding Doniphon's body in a back-room - prepared for a simple pauper's burial to be paid for by the county. Sitting near the coffin was Doniphon's trusted black sidekick/farmhand Pompey (Woody Strode), grieving his loss. To comfort him, Hallie sat by the somber Pompey and took his hand. When the casket was opened, Stoddard angrily noted: \"Where are his boots...and his gunbelt and his spurs?\" and demanded that Clute return symbols of Tom's past. The Marshal noted that Doniphon hadn't carried a gun for years -- a sign of his impotence in the face of civilization arriving in Shinbone (\"He didn't carry no handgun, Ranse. He didn't for years\"). The trio of newspaper employees joined them in the quiet back room next to the coffin. The pushy Maxwell Scott pressed Stoddard, citing his responsibility to his readership to know Stoddard's full story, and strongly urged the Senator to reveal more about his reason for attending the funeral of an unknown man: \"I have a right to have the story.\" Stoddard reluctantly agreed, and admitted Link, Hallie, and Pompey were all a \"part of it.\" The revered Senator Stoddard exited the room with the newspaper-men into the outer parlor of the undertaker/carpentry shop, leaving the others to gather around Doniphon's coffin in the back room to mourn. Hallie sat with the unopened hat box on her lap, holding the desert rose. Stoddard admitted that the past was \"a lot different then,\" as he walked over to an antique, run-down, inoperable, cob-webbed OVERLAND STAGECOACH. He rubbed age-old dust off its surface, and surmised that the same exact coach had brought him to the small town many years earlier (\"I think it is the same one\"). [Note: The remainder of the western was a lengthy flashback describing why he had returned to the town after 25 years had passed. He was mainly interested in setting the record straight by explaining why his legendary status as \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" had been unearned and was untrue, although he had maintained a public facade for so many years.] START OF LENGTHY FLASHBACK He began his reflective story by remembering his entry into the wild frontier town decades earlier. As an eastern law school graduate, he had traveled westward to set up a law practice and begin his life and career. He was a young, idealistic, green-horn pacifistic attorney at law from the East Coast: I was just a youngster. Fresh out of law school. Bag full of law books and my father's gold watch, $14.80 in cash. I had taken Horace Greeley's advice literally: 'Go west, young man, go west, and seek fame, fortune, adventure.' [Note: Structurally, during the flashback, there were essentially eight major sequences showing Stoddard's progression (artificially numbered below).] (1) Valance's Stagecoach Hold-up Outside of the town, the stagecoach holding the novice attorney-at-law Ransom was stopped by sudden rifle gun-blasts - it was surrounded by the gang of a tyrannical and ruthless masked outlaw, ironically named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). During the robbery, Valance demanded the cashbox with an archaic phrase (\"Stand and deliver\") directed toward Shotgun (Bryan 'Slim' Hightower) and the stage-driver. When the three hapless passengers were removed from the coach and instructed to relinquish their wallets, purse, and other valuables, the timid Ransom foolishly defended hysterical widow Mrs. Prescott (Anna Lee) (\"What kind of men are you?\"), and was viciously slapped across the face. He then stood up and further claimed the law would eventually apprehend the criminals: I am an Attorney at Law. And I'm duly licensed for the Territory. And you may have us in your guns now, but I'll see you in jail for this! Violent gunman Valance snickered back: \"Jail?\" - and struck him across the head with his signature weapon - a silver-knobbed, leather bullwhip. Ransom was left to die at the side of the trail when the coach was sent on its way. As the outlaws searched through the personal belongings of the passengers, Valance came across Ransom's law books: \"Law?\" and spitefully ripped one of the volumes to shreds. He then strode over to the half-conscious Ransom and beat him senseless with his whip: \"Lawyer, huh? Well, I'll teach you law! Western law!\" before being restrained by his partners. (2) Introduction to Most of the Major Characters The next early morning after the robbery, at 5:30 am, local Shinbone rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), with his farmhand Pompey, rode in darkness through town to the upper-floor residence of young pig-tailed Hallie to awaken her. She brusquely complained about being wakened: \"What's the matter with you?\" [Note: She lived above the town's restaurant known as Peter's Place (famous for Home Cooking), where she was employed as a waitress by the two proprietors: recent Swedish-accented immigrants: Nora (Jeanette Nolan) and Peter Ericson (John Qualen).] Doniphon alerted her to news that Pompey's buckboard was carrying a seriously-injured, unconscious, bloodied and bruised ambush victim that they had found on the outskirts of town following the stagecoach hold-up. The prone Ransom was likely to die without immediate care - Doniphon spoke to Stoddard and for the first time used the famous moniker \"Pilgrim\" for him: \"Think you can make it, Pilgrim?\" [Note: The label 'Pilgrim' signified that Stoddard was on a progressive journey, similar to John Bunyan's 1698 story in The Pilgrim's Progress, from East to West, moving as a newcomer from naivete and innocence, and adjusting to an understanding of the frontier's ways.] As Stoddard was being cared for, the often-drunk Doc Willoughby (Ken Murray) was summoned to administer stitches on his left temple. Meanwhile, Nora poured a strong mixed concoction of \"coffee and aquavit (Swedish brandy)\" for him to drink, as Hallie prepared breakfast and playfully admonished Doniphon not to join him with a swig of alcohol. Doniphon pledged to help Stoddard, now broke, to get back on his feet by offering him his restaurant credit. Stoddard was stubbornly determined to immediately go after Liberty Valance, but Doniphon cautioned him and the two began a crucial debate about the use of guns and gun ownership, and more broadly, personal justice vs. the legal system. Stoddard argued for justice through the local courts and law enforcement to apprehend and prosecute lawbreakers, while Doniphon urged western-styled, armed brute force and personal lawless justice to keep the peace (\"...if that's what you gotta do, you better start packin' a handgun\"). Stoddard vowed that he was adamantly non-violent, and would rely only on his law books and the rule of law to bring justice to the town and to Liberty Valance. He responded to the rugged, tough cowboy frontiersman and gunslinger, cut from the same cloth as Valance - although law-abiding: Stoddard: A gun? I don't want a gun. I don't want a gun. I don't want to kill him. I want to put him in jail.\n\nDoniphon: Oh. Well, I know those law books mean a lot to you, but not out here. Out here, a man settles his own problems. (He patted his gun)\n\nStoddard: No, but, do you know what you're saying to me? You know, you're saying just exactly what Liberty Valance said. What kind of a community have I come to here? You all seem to know about this fella Liberty Valance. He's a no-good, gun-packin', murdering thief, but the only advice you can give to me is to carry a gun. (He stood up.) Well, I'm a lawyer! Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law. And the law is the only - the on... (Doniphon grabbed Stoddard before he collapsed)\n\nHallie: (in agreement, and specifically directed to Doniphon) A little law and order around Shinbone wouldn't hurt anyone.\n\nDoniphon: All right, Hallie. When the town's aggravated Marshal Link Appleyard (providing comic relief) was dragged to the restaurant by Peter Ericson, Doniphon sarcastically gave him a nickname: \"Mr. Law and Order himself.\" The Marshal wanted to avoid the dangerous repercussions of the hold-up by following up, when Doniphon simply stated what Stoddard's complaint was: \"All he wants you to do is put Liberty Valance in jail.\" But the cowardly Marshal would have no part of it: \"Liberty Valance! Do you think l'm crazy? Now Tom, let me out of here!\" Doniphon snapped that Hallie seemed to have already taken sides with Stoddard - an impressively-educated lawyer! The powerless and incompetent Marshal pleaded that he had no authority, interest or gunslinging capability to confront the outlaw, who had committed the crime outside of the town in the outer Territory: As long as he behaves himself in this town, I ain't got no, uh, (jurisdiction)...Now, you all know that I'm only the Town Marshal, and what Liberty does out on the road ain't no business of mine. Ain't that right, Mr. Lawyer?...Now, as how you folks all know that, well, the jail's only got one cell, and the lock's broke, and I sleep in it. Hallie was unimpressed and called the worthless and ineffectual Marshal \"a big old fat water buffalo.\" Doniphon was taken by Hallie's forceful indignation and complimented her spunk: \"You know you look mighty pretty when you get mad.\" As Doniphon left, he offered one final comment to Stoddard about how it was futile for the 'tenderfoot' lawyer to think that he could confront Valance with a gun and fight using Valance's preferred approach: \"You can forget what I said about buyin' the gun. You're a tenderfoot. Liberty Valance's the toughest man south of the Picket Wire - Next to me.\" [Note: The reference to the Picket Wire River, a body of water named by French trappers/explorers, was actually a mispronunciation of the original French name \"Purgatoire.\"]"}, {"url": "https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82756/the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance", "page_content": "Articles\n\nThe Essentials - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nShare SYNOPSIS\n\n\n\nSen.

The location, however, could be New Mexico or possibly Oklahoma (south of the river), since the territory in the film has yet to achieve statehood and the flag in the classroom scene has 38 stars, placing it after Colorado's entry into the union.\n\n\n\nJohn Wayne made a total of 21 films with John Ford. It was Wayne's appearance in Stagecoach (1939) that brought him from the ranks of B pictures to true stardom, and he first received credit for his acting in such Ford films as She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and The Searchers (1956). It's fair to say the actor owed much of his career to his most frequent director and one of the reasons Wayne remained respectful of him even though Ford was often abusive to the actor. After The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, they worked on two more films together, the Civil War sequence of How the West Was Won (1962) and the comedy-action picture Donovan's Reef (1963).\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was James Stewart's second film with John Ford, after Two Rode Together (1961).\n\n\n\nFord also directed Stewart and Wayne in an hour-long Alcoa Premiere teleplay the same year this picture came out, a baseball drama called \"Flashing Spikes.\" Stewart and Wayne appeared together again in Wayne's final film, The Shootist (1976), directed by Don Siegel. They were also both in the cast of How the West Was Won (1962) but in different segments.\n\n\n\nWoody Strode (1914-1994) was a star athlete at UCLA before he was discovered by Ford and put in his first role, a bit part in Stagecoach. Strode played a few small parts in the following years, and after the war he became one of the first black athletes to integrate pro-football as a member of the Los Angeles Rams. Besides Liberty Valance he made two other films for Ford, Two Rode Together and the title role in Sergeant Rutledge (1960). He always gave Ford credit for making him an actor and called him \"the greatest director I ever worked for.\"\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was the second Ford movie each for Vera Miles (The Searchers) and Jeanette Nolan (Two Rode Together). Miles was the sister of the murdered Janet Leigh in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), for which Nolan supplied the voice (uncredited) of Mrs. Bates.\n\n\n\nThis was Andy Devine's third picture with Ford after Stagecoach and Two Rode Together.\n\n\n\nFord stock company sightings: In addition to stars like John Wayne and Henry Fonda, the director often used many of the same character actors and supporting players in his films. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance included the following frequent Ford players : John Carradine, John Qualen, Willis Bouchey, Carleton Young, Anna Lee, Woody Strode, O.Z. Whitehead, Denver Pyle, Shug Fisher. Qualen played Vera Miles's father in The Searchers.\n\n\n\nFord also liked to give work to former silent stars, such as Mae Marsh, who had worked with him in his earliest days but were barely remembered by the public. Gertrude Astor was the first actress signed to a contract with Universal. That was 1915. She made dozens of movies before the end of the 1920s, gaining a reputation as one of the most elegant and best dressed women in the business, but by the mid-30s she was mostly doing uncredited bits. She made two silent films with Ford, a 1917 Western and the lead in a 1925 drama. He cast her in a bit in Three Godfathers (1948) and again in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\n\n\n\nIn the cast as an uncredited townsman was Danny Borzage, brother of director Frank Borzage and something of a Ford mascot. Borzage had been playing bits in Ford's films since The Iron Horse (1924) and was always on set to play mood music on his accordion for the cast and crew between scenes and sometimes during them.\n\n\n\nScenarist James Warner Bellah was a novelist and short story writer before going into screenwriting at the age of 55 with the John Wayne film, The Sea Chase (1955). Ford's cavalry trilogy--Fort Apache(1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande (1950)--all came from Bellah stories, and Ford's Sergeant Rutledge was taken from a Bellah novel, adapted by Bellah and his Liberty Valance co-writer, Willis Goldbeck.\n\n\n\nCinematographer William Clothier worked in Spain and Mexico before the war and got his first break doing photography (uncredited) on William Wyler's war documentary The Memphis Belle (1944). He followed his work on a minor crime drama, For You I Die (1947), with uncredited work on Ford's Fort Apache. He also shot Ford's Donovan's Reef and a few other John Wayne pictures. He received Academy Award nominations for Wayne's The Alamo (1960) and Ford's Cheyenne Autumn (1964).\n\n\n\nThe same year she was nominated for her work on The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Edith Head also designed costumes for eight other pictures, including Hatari! (1962) starring John Wayne. Her 35 Oscar\u00ae nominations and eight awards make Head the most honored costume designer and woman in Academy history.\n\n\n\nLee Marvin's widow Pamela said The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was her \"all-time favorite\" of all the movies her husband made.\n\n\n\n\"Jim Stewart and Duke Wayne gave, for me, topnotch performances in a picture ideally suited to them.\" - cast member Edmond O'Brien\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance went into general release in April 1962 and received mostly unfavorable reviews. In many cases it was relegated to the bottom half of a double bill. It took a few decades before critical reassessment turned in its favor, and it is now regarded as one of John Ford's most significant achievements. There has been a bit of a backlash in recent years, however. Some critics and theorists have gone to great pains to make a case in favor of the film, seeing great significance in every shot and even in the names of the characters, leading some writers to say now that Liberty Valance is solid and worthy but overrated.\n\n\n\nMemorable Quotes from THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\n\n\n\nHALLIE (Vera Miles): The place has sure changed.

Compiled by Rob Nixon\n\nThe Big Idea - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nShare Wagon Train television series and later into a 1970 film. Her novel The Hanging Tree was brought to the screen by director Delmer Daves and star Gary Cooper in 1959. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance began as a short story in Johnson's 1953 collection Indian Country.\n\n\n\nAlthough he had been one of Hollywood's most respected and powerful directors for decades, John Ford was operating in a very different industry by the late 1950s. The old studio system was in its final days; most of the big companies were increasingly functioning as distributors and often only partial financers of projects initiated outside the studio. Ford had been putting together his own productions for years, but now it was becoming harder to find backing. Tastes were changing as well. Ford's work was looked on more and more as sentimental, old fashioned, and unsophisticated, and his most characteristic genre, the Western, although still popular (particularly on the rival medium of television), would not be a viable genre much longer. In this atmosphere, it was more difficult for Ford to get work and took him longer to find projects he could connect with personally. His last two productions, Sergeant Rutledge (1960) and Two Rode Together (1961), a picture that was a disappointment to him, had not been big successes. He busied himself directing his most frequent star, John Wayne, in an episode of TV's Wagon Train and doing some uncredited work on the Duke's film The Alamo (1960). So he was happy when he found Johnson's story, which had themes close to his heart and provided a good role for Wayne. Unfortunately, it would not be smooth sailing into production.\n\n\n\nTo adapt the screenplay, Ford renewed his collaboration with the writers of Sergeant Rutledge, Willis Goldbeck and James Warner Bellah. Goldbeck also signed on as co-producer.\n\n\n\nFor the part of the young lawyer from the East who inadvertently becomes a town hero and successful politician, Ford chose James Stewart, whom he had worked with for the first time on Two Rode Together. Stewart genuinely liked Ford and was eager to work with him again, especially since he was less than happy about the development of his unlikable character in the earlier film, but would be playing an upstanding citizen and idealist in Liberty Valance.\n\n\n\nWayne convinced Ford to cast Lee Marvin, his co-star in The Comancheros (1961), as villain Liberty Valance.\n\n\n\nJohn Wayne was one of Hollywood's biggest stars and had just signed a ten-picture deal with Paramount at $600,000 per film, so Ford took Liberty Valance there. But even with the director's reputation plus his agreement to come up with half the $3.2 million budget and two major stars on board, the studio was not sold on the project and took nearly half a year to greenlight it. The studio had several concerns about the project: It was downbeat in nature; Wayne's character was dead at the outset; and Stewart, who was approaching his mid-50s, would have to play a character fresh out of law school for the extensive flashback structure and a man in his 60s or older for the framing story. The company was also still smarting from the loss they incurred on Marlon Brando's One-Eyed Jacks (1961) and was not eager to make another risky Western.\n\n\n\nUltimately, it was Wayne's clout and his solid deal with Paramount that got the go-ahead on the project. It also probably rankled Ford to have the actor whose career he virtually created be the one he was now dependent on to get his production going.\n\n\n\nWayne was still on location for The Comancheros in early summer 1961 when he began getting memos about their upcoming project from Ford, who was eager to have his star back by summer's end to begin shooting Liberty Valance. \"For a change, no locations,\" Ford wrote on July 7. \"All to be shot on the lot. ... Seriously we have a great script in my humble opinion.\"\n\n\n\nThe script followed Johnson's story and viewpoint fairly closely with one notable exception. On the page, Tom Doniphon (Wayne's character) was more of a mentor to Ranse Stoddard (Stewart), easing him along the road from frontier lawyer to state senator. In the film, except for two notable acts that change Stoddard's life forever, Doniphon isn't quite so proactive with an eye to Stoddard's future.\n\n\n\nIn 1967, Ford was quoted as saying The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was based on historic facts, although he never said, and evidence never revealed, what that facts might have been.\n\n\n\nby Rob Nixon Born in Iowa in 1905, Dorothy M. Johnson grew up in Montana. After graduating from the state university, she moved to New York for work as a writer and editor. In 1950, she returned to Montana, edited the local paper, and joined the university faculty. Over the course of her life, she published 17 books and 52 short stories, becoming one of the most noted female writers of fiction about the American West. Her story \"A Man Called Horse\" was first adapted into an episode of thetelevision series and later into a 1970 film.

Johnson grew up in Montana. After graduating from the state university, she moved to New York for work as a writer and editor. In 1950, she returned to Montana, edited the local paper, and joined the university faculty. Over the course of her life, she published 17 books and 52 short stories, becoming one of the most noted female writers of fiction about the American West. Her story \"A Man Called Horse\" was first adapted into an episode of the Wagon Train television series and later into a 1970 film. Her novel The Hanging Tree was brought to the screen by director Delmer Daves and star Gary Cooper in 1959. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance began as a short story in Johnson's 1953 collection Indian Country. Although he had been one of Hollywood's most respected and powerful directors for decades, John Ford was operating in a very different industry by the late 1950s. The old studio system was in its final days; most of the big companies were increasingly functioning as distributors and often only partial financers of projects initiated outside the studio. Ford had been putting together his own productions for years, but now it was becoming harder to find backing. Tastes were changing as well. Ford's work was looked on more and more as sentimental, old fashioned, and unsophisticated, and his most characteristic genre, the Western, although still popular (particularly on the rival medium of television), would not be a viable genre much longer. In this atmosphere, it was more difficult for Ford to get work and took him longer to find projects he could connect with personally. His last two productions, Sergeant Rutledge (1960) and Two Rode Together (1961), a picture that was a disappointment to him, had not been big successes. He busied himself directing his most frequent star, John Wayne, in an episode of TV's Wagon Train and doing some uncredited work on the Duke's film The Alamo (1960). So he was happy when he found Johnson's story, which had themes close to his heart and provided a good role for Wayne. Unfortunately, it would not be smooth sailing into production. To adapt the screenplay, Ford renewed his collaboration with the writers of Sergeant Rutledge, Willis Goldbeck and James Warner Bellah. Goldbeck also signed on as co-producer. For the part of the young lawyer from the East who inadvertently becomes a town hero and successful politician, Ford chose James Stewart, whom he had worked with for the first time on Two Rode Together. Stewart genuinely liked Ford and was eager to work with him again, especially since he was less than happy about the development of his unlikable character in the earlier film, but would be playing an upstanding citizen and idealist in Liberty Valance. Wayne convinced Ford to cast Lee Marvin, his co-star in The Comancheros (1961), as villain Liberty Valance. John Wayne was one of Hollywood's biggest stars and had just signed a ten-picture deal with Paramount at $600,000 per film, so Ford took Liberty Valance there. But even with the director's reputation plus his agreement to come up with half the $3.2 million budget and two major stars on board, the studio was not sold on the project and took nearly half a year to greenlight it. The studio had several concerns about the project: It was downbeat in nature; Wayne's character was dead at the outset; and Stewart, who was approaching his mid-50s, would have to play a character fresh out of law school for the extensive flashback structure and a man in his 60s or older for the framing story. The company was also still smarting from the loss they incurred on Marlon Brando's One-Eyed Jacks (1961) and was not eager to make another risky Western. Ultimately, it was Wayne's clout and his solid deal with Paramount that got the go-ahead on the project. It also probably rankled Ford to have the actor whose career he virtually created be the one he was now dependent on to get his production going. Wayne was still on location for The Comancheros in early summer 1961 when he began getting memos about their upcoming project from Ford, who was eager to have his star back by summer's end to begin shooting Liberty Valance. \"For a change, no locations,\" Ford wrote on July 7. \"All to be shot on the lot. ...

On the page, Tom Doniphon (Wayne's character) was more of a mentor to Ranse Stoddard (Stewart), easing him along the road from frontier lawyer to state senator. In the film, except for two notable acts that change Stoddard's life forever, Doniphon isn't quite so proactive with an eye to Stoddard's future. In 1967, Ford was quoted as saying The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was based on historic facts, although he never said, and evidence never revealed, what that facts might have been. by Rob Nixon\n\nBehind the Camera - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nShare The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was shot almost entirely at Paramount Studios, with exteriors on the Janss Conejo Ranch in Thousand Oaks, California, a documentary about the making of it revealed that the town and train shots were done on Lot 3 at MGM.\n\n\n\nThere are varying opinions about why The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was shot in black and white in the studio instead of location filming in color. Some accounts have it that Ford was forced to curtail his usual production methods because Paramount would not give him the financing he needed to shoot in one of his favorite locales, such as Monument Valley. Others, particularly critics and film analysts looking back to reclaim the film as one of Ford's major achievements, say the decision was entirely Ford's, a choice that zeroed in on a more intimate and intense character study. Most observers agree that black and white also helped ease the suspension of disbelief necessary to accept Stewart and Wayne as young men and Stewart in his make-up for the character late in life.\n\n\n\nFord himself once said he preferred black and white and that it is actually more difficult than shooting in color. \"In black and white, you've got to be very careful. You've got to know your job, lay your shadows in properly, get your perspective right, but in color, there it is,\" he said. \"You might say I'm old fashioned, but black and white is real photography.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to actor Frank Baker, who played in several Ford movies (but not Liberty Valance), the director substantially improvised on the scenario from day to day.\n\n\n\nFord only shot just what he needed with very little extra coverage on The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. He also preferred to do a minimum of takes, saying that after the first few, the actors get tired and jaded and their performances lack spontaneity. That's why he liked to work with the same people over and over again (the famed Ford \"stock company\"), because he could count on them to know what he wanted and give it to him on the first take.\n\n\n\nAccording to his grandson Dan Ford, many people involved in the shooting remarked on Ford's lack of energy and complete disregard for details such as background effects. Lindsay Anderson, in his book-length study of the director, says, \"No doubt this was yet another instance of Ford's growing impatience with the business of shooting: it was no longer 'fun.' He resented the demands of narrative, of crowd-pleasing spectacle, the trappings of 'art.' And in places the work suffered.\"\n\n\n\nIf Ford was sick of filmmaking, it wasn't apparent to cast member Edmond O'Brien, who said, \"I have never seen Ford happier than he was in making this; he came on the set positively beaming every morning, and that was not the usual thing with him.\" O'Brien also said everyone involved seemed to enjoy making The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\n\n\n\nWhen he saw the set for the town of Shinbone, assistant director Wingate Smith remarked that it didn't looked lived in enough. Ford replied, \"If they don't like it, we'll give them their nickel back.\"\n\n\n\nDuring shooting of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Wayne was already suffering from the cancer that would take his life in 1979.\n\n\n\nWayne said Liberty Valance was \"a tough assignment\" for him. While everyone else seemed to have well-rounded characters, he saw his role as merely functional for the plot. \"I just had to wander around in that son of a bitch [Tom Doniphon] and try to make a part for myself.\" When someone suggested to Wayne that his role was a complicated one, full of ambiguity, he reportedly shot back, \"Screw ambiguity. Perversion and corruption masquerade as ambiguity. I don't like ambiguity. I don't trust ambiguity.\"\n\n\n\nKnown for his tendency to be disagreeable at times, Ford was always rough on Wayne, who usually took the rough treatment with equanimity, but on this production, the abusiveness was raised a few notches. Some have ascribed it to Ford's age and increasing impatience with filmmaking; others say he resented Wayne because so few of the scenes Ford worked on without credit for Wayne's film The Alamo (1960) actually made it to the screen. In any case, the days when Ford, Wayne, and others would carouse or play cards all night or spend time on Ford's yacht were behind them, and the relationship was more strained than usual. Ford deliberately goaded Wayne repeatedly, hitting a particularly sore spot by pointing out publicly that many on the set - James Stewart, Lee Marvin, Woody Strode - had served during World War II while Wayne did not.\n\n\n\nJealousy might also have been a factor in Ford's treatment of Wayne, who was perhaps the biggest movie star in the world at this time while the man who helped him reach that status now had to scramble for work and depend on his star to get backing from studios. One day when Wayne casually suggested a minor scene change, Ford lost his temper and screamed, \"Jesus Christ, here I take you out of eight-day Westerns, I put you in big movies, and you give me a stupid suggestion like that!\"\n\n\n\nFord seemed to be determined to make bad blood between Wayne and Strode. Ford needled Wayne, who had attended the University of Southern California on a football scholarship, by insisting that Strode, a decathlete and football star at UCLA, was \"the real football player.\" Tensions came to a head during a scene in which Wayne was supposed to be driving a wagon back to his ranch with Strode in the back. Strode noticed that Wayne was having trouble controlling the horses and getting them to stop, so he reached forward to grab the reins to help. Wayne swung his arm and knocked him back roughly. When the wagon was finally brought to a halt, Strode jumped down, ready to fight Wayne. \"Woody don't hit him! We need him,\" Ford said, likely antagonizing Wayne further. Shooting was halted a couple of hours until both men cooled off.\n\n\n\nStrode frequently performed his own stunts, partly because he was such a good athlete and partly because it was hard to find a black double to match his build and looks (this had also been the case on Spartacus, 1960). In the scene where Wayne's character sets fire to his house, Strode had to race in and drag him out of the building. Wayne was using a double but the 47-year-old Strode wasn't. Ford told his star, \"Duke, Woody is an old man, and he's got to carry you and he doesn't need a double!\" Wayne decided to do the scene without one.\n\n\n\nStrode was amazed that a man of Wayne's professional and physical stature was so subservient to Ford. \"Sometimes [Ford] would holler, 'Duke!,' and whatever John Wayne was doing, I don't care if his pants were down around his ankles, he'd stop and come running,\" Strode wrote in his autobiography. \"I told the other actors, 'You see Duke running? He's a millionaire. He doesn't have to do that. But that old man made him a millionaire. That's respect.'\"\n\n\n\nAlthough he had his problems with Wayne, Strode said Stewart was \"one of the nicest men you'll ever meet anywhere in the world.\"\n\n\n\nWayne and Stewart got along very well during production. Stewart also liked Ford immensely and was glad to be working with him again after Two Rode Together (1961). He appreciated Ford's subtle direction, such as in the stage hold-up scene where Stewart's character first encounters Liberty Valance. Stewart couldn't get a handle on it and kept flubbing his lines until Ford walked over and repeated quietly in his ear, \"You are not a coward, you are not a coward.\" That gave Stewart just the cue he needed to nail the take.\n\n\n\nStewart's ease with the director might have had something to do with the fact that Ford was easy on him, unlike the treatment of his co-star. Wayne used to ask Stewart with envy why it was that he never incurred the director's wrath. One day, however, Stewart made the mistake of giving his honest opinion when Ford asked what he thought of Strode's costume. Stewart said he found it a little \"Uncle Remus-like.\" Ford then embarrassed him in front of everyone, saying, \"One of the players seems to have some objection. One of the players here doesn't seem to like Uncle Remus. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure he even likes negroes.\" Wayne was visibly delighted.\n\n\n\nCast member Ken Murray called Ford an ogre and said he was scared of him.\n\n\n\nThe one cast member who could get away with just about anything on the set was Lee Marvin. Ford appreciated him not only for his acting and his World War II service as a Marine, but for Marvin's genuineness as a person. One day, Ford came on the set and Marvin whistled loudly through his teeth. The crew froze, certain there would be trouble. Instead Ford just smiled, because he recognized that what Marvin was doing was giving the admiral's whistle and piping the director \"on board.\"\n\n\n\nOn Marvin's first day on the set, Ford called him over and said, \"You just did a movie with John Wayne [The Comancheros, 1961]. Wayne did some directing on that, right? Well, that's not happening here. Duke's not doing anything on this picture but what I tell him.\"\n\n\n\nMarvin's first scene (the stage hold-up) in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance presented problems for the actor; he couldn't seem to get a handle on his character. After several takes, Ford instructed the stage driver not to throw down the cash box when Marvin demanded it. This had the effect of greatly notching up Marvin's anger, causing him to shout, \"NOW!\" The take was printed.\n\n\n\nCyril Mockridge was hired to score the picture, but Ford used a bit of music from his 1939 Young Mr. Lincoln score under some of Vera Miles's scenes as Hallie. Ford later told Peter Bogdanovich that he used Alfred Newman's \"Ann Rutledge\" theme for the same reason in both films, to evoke the feeling of lost love. He also told Bogdanovich that he made it apparent (through this music and other means) that Miles's character Hallie had never gotten over Tom Doniphon (Wayne) because he wanted Wayne to be the lead rather than Stewart.\n\n\n\nPhotographs exist of the entire cast of Liberty Valance seated around a table for what was a Ford tradition: formal tea time on the set.\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was completed on November 7, 1961.\n\n\n\nby Rob Nixon Although most sources saywas shot almost entirely at Paramount Studios, with exteriors on the Janss Conejo Ranch in Thousand Oaks, California, a documentary about the making of it revealed that the town and train shots were done on Lot 3 at MGM.There are varying opinions about whywas shot in black and white in the studio instead of location filming in color.

He appreciated Ford's subtle direction, such as in the stage hold-up scene where Stewart's character first encounters Liberty Valance. Stewart couldn't get a handle on it and kept flubbing his lines until Ford walked over and repeated quietly in his ear, \"You are not a coward, you are not a coward.\" That gave Stewart just the cue he needed to nail the take. Stewart's ease with the director might have had something to do with the fact that Ford was easy on him, unlike the treatment of his co-star. Wayne used to ask Stewart with envy why it was that he never incurred the director's wrath. One day, however, Stewart made the mistake of giving his honest opinion when Ford asked what he thought of Strode's costume. Stewart said he found it a little \"Uncle Remus-like.\" Ford then embarrassed him in front of everyone, saying, \"One of the players seems to have some objection. One of the players here doesn't seem to like Uncle Remus. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure he even likes negroes.\" Wayne was visibly delighted. Cast member Ken Murray called Ford an ogre and said he was scared of him. The one cast member who could get away with just about anything on the set was Lee Marvin. Ford appreciated him not only for his acting and his World War II service as a Marine, but for Marvin's genuineness as a person. One day, Ford came on the set and Marvin whistled loudly through his teeth. The crew froze, certain there would be trouble. Instead Ford just smiled, because he recognized that what Marvin was doing was giving the admiral's whistle and piping the director \"on board.\" On Marvin's first day on the set, Ford called him over and said, \"You just did a movie with John Wayne [The Comancheros, 1961]. Wayne did some directing on that, right? Well, that's not happening here. Duke's not doing anything on this picture but what I tell him.\" Marvin's first scene (the stage hold-up) in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance presented problems for the actor; he couldn't seem to get a handle on his character. After several takes, Ford instructed the stage driver not to throw down the cash box when Marvin demanded it. This had the effect of greatly notching up Marvin's anger, causing him to shout, \"NOW!\" The take was printed. Cyril Mockridge was hired to score the picture, but Ford used a bit of music from his 1939 Young Mr. Lincoln score under some of Vera Miles's scenes as Hallie. Ford later told Peter Bogdanovich that he used Alfred Newman's \"Ann Rutledge\" theme for the same reason in both films, to evoke the feeling of lost love. He also told Bogdanovich that he made it apparent (through this music and other means) that Miles's character Hallie had never gotten over Tom Doniphon (Wayne) because he wanted Wayne to be the lead rather than Stewart. Photographs exist of the entire cast of Liberty Valance seated around a table for what was a Ford tradition: formal tea time on the set. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was completed on November 7, 1961. by Rob Nixon\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance - The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\nShare\n\n\n\nSen. Ransom Stoddard and his wife Hallie, visitors from Washington, D.C., arrive in the Western town of Shinbone, where they met and married years before, to attend the funeral of their old friend Tom Doniphon. The couple finds the town changed from the lawless frontier they once knew. Except for a few old- timers, no one in Shinbone even remembers Tom, once the toughest and fastest gunman in the territory. Yet, everybody has heard about Stoddard, the man who shot Liberty Valance, a murderous outlaw who terrorized the town until his death brought law and order to the district. While Doniphon's simple coffin is readied for a pauper's burial, reporters gather around Stoddard with questions about his life and past deeds. But the senator insists on setting the record straight about the incident that made him famous. \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" The most memorable line from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance might also be the motto for John Ford's career. Although he directed in a wide range of genres, Ford is best known for his Westerns, and along with writer Zane Grey, artist Frederick Remington and perhaps a few others, no one did more to forge the myths of the Old West \u00ad its heroes and villains, its codes and philosophies, the look and sound and feel of it. Ford's perspective is often a romantic, even sentimental vision of our historical past, but it's a viewpoint that confirms the indomitable nature of America's Western pioneers.\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance predates by just a few years \"revisionist\" Westerns like Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969) and even Ford's own Cheyenne Autumn (1964), in which the brutality and ambiguous morality of America's relentless drive across the continent were thrown into a harsher light. This film is not exactly a reversal of Ford's vision of the frontier, but it is shot through with the darkness, regret and a touch of cynicism of an older and wiser man.

Fittingly so, as this late work is a sombre reflection on what was lost when education and morality \u2013 incarnated by Stewart as East Coast lawyer Ransom Stoddard \u2013 crept westward as civilising influences.\n\nTold within a flashback framework, as Stoddard comes clean to the press about who really shot outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), Ford\u2019s classic waves a bittersweet adieu to the bygone values of the Old West, typified by the rough justice of rancher Tom Doniphon (Wayne).

Yet, while it is an enjoyable film it falls distinctly shy of its innate story potential.\n\nDirector John Ford and the writers have somewhat overplayed their hands. They have taken a disarmingly simple and affecting premise, developed it with craft and skill to a natural point of conclusion, and then have proceeded to run it into the ground, destroying the simplicity and intimacy for which they have striven. The long screenplay from a short story by Dorothy M. Johnson has Stewart as a dude eastern attorney forging idealistically into lawless western territory, where he is promptly greeted by the sadistic, though sponsored, brutality of Valance (Lee Marvin), a killer who owes his allegiance to the vested interests of wealthy cattlemen opposed to statehood, law and order.\n\nThe audience instantly senses that Stewart did not fire the fatal shot that gives him his reputation and destines him for political fame. Because the audience knows that: (1) Stewart can\u2019t hit a paint can at 15 paces, (2) Stewart has won the heart of the sweetheart of John Wayne, best shot in the territory and a man of few words but heroically alert and forthright. Had the body of the film (it is told in flashback) ended at this maximum point, it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny.\n\nStewart and Wayne do what comes naturally in an engagingly effortless manner. Vera Miles is consistently effective. Marvin is evil as they come. There is a portrayal of great strength and dignity by Woody Strode. But the most memorable characterization in the film is that of Edmond O\u2019Brien as a tippling newspaper editor deeply proud of his profession.\n\n1962: Nomination: Best B&W Costume Design"}, {"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance-1962", "page_content": "As a showdown between Stoddard and Valance Ford begins to seem inevitable, Ford creates considerable tension. I will not go into details because the suspense should not be spoiled. Look instead at a debate that continues between the lawyer and the farmer about guns. Ransom Stoddard believes in the U. S. Constitution, the rule by law, the trust in government. Tom Doniphon tells him that without a gun in his hand and the experience to use it, he will sooner or later certainly be killed by Valance. Stoddard believes so firmly in the law that he is willing to lose his life for his principles. The drunken marshal won't protect him. The newspaper editor prints the truth about Valance, and for his pains has his office trashed and is whipped nearly dead.\n\nThis is fascism against democracy: the tyranny of the strongman over the ordinary people. Everyone in Shinbone hates Liberty Valance, but they're powerless against him and his two sidekicks, one of them a giggling fool. Tom could stand up to Valance, but it would suit him to have Stoddard out of the way so that he could bring Hallie home to that porch with its rocking chair.\n\nThere is a purity to the John Ford style. His composition is classical. He arranges his characters within the frame to reflect power dynamics--or sometimes to suggest a balance is changing. His magnificent Western landscapes are always there, but as environment, not travelogue. He films mostly on sets, but we're not particularly aware. In a film with Lee Marvin's snarl, Andy Devine's squeaky voice and the accent of the Swedes, John Wayne as usual provides the calm center, never trying for an effect. (One stylistic touch: In this film, he habitually calls Stoddard \"Pilgrim,\" which expresses an insight into the lawyer's character.)\n\nFord's view of women is interesting. Shinbone is the only Western town I've seen in a movie with no prostitutes. Indeed Hallie and Nora Ericson (Jeanette Nolan) are the only two noticeable women in town; little wonder Tom's love for Hallie is intense. As played by Jimmy Stewart, Stoddard spends much of the film wearing an apron and washing dishes in the restaurant, sending a hardly ambiguous message about a man who doesn't wear a gun.\n\nThe way Ford employs the African-American Pompey is observant. The tall, confident Woody Strode appeared in five Ford pictures, all the way from \"Stagecoach\" to Ford's final film, \"7 Women\" (1966). It is made clear in \"Liberty Valance\" that segregation was the practice in the territory. When a meeting is held to vote on statehood, Pompey sits outside on the porch. When he walks into a bar to fetch Tom, the bartender won't serve him, and Tom slams hard on the bar: \"Give him a drink.\" But Pompey won't drink. He is Tom's farmhand and seems to be his only confidant, a protective presence; he always has Tom's back. Ford isn't making an anachronistic statement on racism, but he's being sure we notice it."}]}
