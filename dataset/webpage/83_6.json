While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport.

He could not hide his disappointment as he marched past a cluster of reporters in the mixed zone, paused for a beat to consider speaking, before hurrying off toward the dressing room to look toward Saturday, when the men\u2019s singles competition begins in earnest.\n\nBut while the temporary sour of his first taste of sliding\u2019s biggest stage will pass, Kumaritashvili\u2019s participation at these Beijing Games is a triumph that embodies the resilience and courage at the foundation of the Olympics.\n\nTwelve years ago in Vancouver, Kumaritashvili\u2019s cousin was fatally injured after crashing in a training session just hours before the opening ceremony. Nodar Kumaritashvili was 21, same as Saba today, and one practice run away from his Olympic debut when he lost control on the insidious 13th turn at Whistler Sliding Centre, a course that had already prompted whispers among the competitors over safety concerns because of the breakneck speeds it was abetting.\n\nThinking about my cousin is painful but gives me strength Saba Kumaritashvili\n\nNodar\u2019s sled was traveling at nearly 145kmh when it catapulted off the surface and over the sidewall near the finish line, propelling his 176lb form into an unprotected metal support pole by the end of the track.\n\nHe was pronounced dead less than an hour after he was airlifted to a Whistler hospital and resuscitation efforts failed, becoming the fourth athlete to die in preparations for a Winter Olympics after the British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki, the Australian skier Ross Milne and and the Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay.\n\nThe first on-track fatality in 35 years rocked the sport to its foundation and generated worldwide media attention and sympathy.

He catapulted over the outer lip of the track and slammed into an unpadded roof support post.\n\nTrack and medical workers began performing CPR as an ambulance parked nearby raced to the scene. Kumaritashvili was motionless as he was loaded onto a stretcher. The venue\u2019s video screens replaced live images with an Olympic logo.\n\nThe Georgian was taken by an air-rescue helicopter to the Whistler trauma center, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nHe is the third training fatality in Winter Olympics history.\n\nAthletes quickly left the Whistler Sliding Centre and shaken track workers and volunteers gave each other bearhugs. Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers cordoned off the accident site, and training was suspended on the year-old track as Olympic officials met to review the situation. Late Friday, after the Coroners Service of British Columbia concluded its investigation, it turned the track over to the luge federation.\n\nIt issued this statement:\n\n\u201cIt appears after a routine run, the athlete came late out of curve 15 and did not compensate properly to make correct entrance into curve 16. This resulted in a late entrance into curve 16 and although the athlete worked to correct the problem he eventually lost control of the sled resulting in the tragic accident. The technical officials of the FIL were able to retrace the path of the athlete and concluded there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track.\u201d\n\nThe track will reopen Saturday for practice followed by competition at 5 p.m.\n\nLuge is a highly technical sport that requires precision driving. Elite athletes take years to develop, and many of the best are in their mid- to late 30s.\n\nIt would have been difficult for Kumaritashvili, who has been competing at the elite level for only two seasons, to have mastered the track\u2019s intricacies. Last season, he competed in five of eight World Cup races and was ranked 44th, a 10-place improvement over his rookie year.\n\nHe crashed in an earlier training run.

The IOC is in deep mourning. Here you have a young athlete who died pursuing his passion. I have no words to say what we feel.\u201d\n\nRogge turned aside questions about the future of the competition, saying he would await the results of the investigation. He also sidestepped whether Kumaritashvili lacked the experience to be sliding on the track.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for sorrow. It is not a time to look for reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is possible to reduce the track\u2019s speed by adjusting the temperature and adding frost. But the allure of this year\u2019s luge competition -- and the bobsled and skeleton events that also are held here -- is the fact that the world\u2019s best athletes are trying to tame a course that has bested most of them to this point.\n\nArmin Zoeggeler, the two-time Olympic gold medalist from Italy, crashed in training. Germany\u2019s Felix Loch, considered a medal favorite, injured his shoulder last November during international training week.\n\nDuring a Thursday training run, Romanian slider Violeta Stramaturaru was briefly knocked unconscious and required medical treatment.\n\nJohn Rosen, an official with the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, was working as a course volunteer when the accident occurred. \u201cThe tracks are designed to capture the athletes,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThe fact that someone could fly out of the track is extremely rare. This was just a tragic accident. These are dangerous sports, but serious accidents are rare.\u201d\n\nAthletes have been circumspect in discussing the dangers and whether track designers have pushed athletes and equipment beyond the breaking point.\n\nBut Thursday evening, after she nearly crashed in a training run, Australia\u2019s Hannah Campbell-Pegg spoke out.\n\n\u201cI think they are pushing it a little too much,\u201d she said. \u201cTo what extent are we just little lemmings that they just throw down a track and we\u2019re crash-test dummies?

He pulled his hips forward and clenched his lips, then pushed back, and flung himself into this treacherous, frozen strait. He careened around corners, and flirted with walls, and hit 78 miles per hour.\n\nBut he \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid,\u201d he said after his second run.\u201d Tragedy never threatened to drive him away from the sport.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cafter Nodar, I didn\u2019t want luge to die in Georgia. I wanted to keep it going.\u201d\n\nSo he did what so many members of his family had done for decades. His story, like Nodar\u2019s, is so much more than a crash or a single-minded Olympic pursuit. It begins with his great grandfather, Aleko, who laid the groundwork, literally. Aleko oversaw the construction of Georgia\u2019s first luge track in the 1970s. His son and grandson took advantage. Saba\u2019s grandfather, Felix, slid to the Junior European Championships a few years later. Saba\u2019s uncle \u2014 Nodar\u2019s father \u2014 then won a USSR youth championship in the final years before the Soviet split. Multiple family members, including Saba\u2019s father, have run the Georgian luge federation since.\n\nDavid Kumaritashvili, father of the Georgia luger Nodar Kumaritashvili who killed on an Olympic training run, shows a photo his son e-mailed from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.

Nodar, he said, was also one of his reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cousins were 12 years apart. Saba was 9 in 2010 when Nodar did what so many other family members had dreamed of, and then what every luger fears. Saba doesn\u2019t \u201cremember much of him, only moments.\u201d But enough to have Nodar at the forefront of his mind when he posed with Olympic rings, and walked the Olympic track, and stepped into Friday\u2019s Opening Ceremony.\n\nHis continued participation in luge made some family members apprehensive. But Saba never wavered.\n\nNodar had laid down a path. Saba followed it. Nodar was 21 when he qualified for the 2010 Olympics. Saba was 21 when he did last month, and when he completed his final run here on Sunday, with smile and a shake of his head.\n\nHe did not win a medal. He didn\u2019t come close, finishing 31st of 34 in the men\u2019s singles competition.\n\nBut he was here. He was emotional. He was proud of himself.

The men's luge competition is scheduled to begin Saturday afternoon. Officials at the Whistler track said they were uncertain if the schedule would be affected.\n\nGlor reports that there are serious discussions taking place about whether this year's luge competition should be changed, possibly to a lower starting point, which would decrease speeds.\n\nRescue workers were at Kumaritashvili's side within seconds. Chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation started less than one minute after the crash, and he was quickly airlifted to a trauma center in Whistler.\n\nKumaritashvili struck the inside wall of the track on the final turn. His body immediately went airborne and cleared the ice-coated concrete wall along the left side of the sliding surface. His sled remained in the track, and it appeared his helmet visor skidded down the ice.\n\nThe remainder of men's training was canceled for the day, with VANOC officials saying an investigation was taking place to \"ensure a safe field of play.\" Men's luge competition is to begin Saturday. It's unclear if the schedule will change.\n\nThe danger of the Whistler track has been talked about for months - particularly after several nations, including the U.S., were upset over restrictions regarding access to the facility by nations other than Canada, with some noting it could lead to a safety issue.\n\nLuge is already one of the most dangerous sports in the world - so fast it's the only winter Olympic sport timed to a thousandth of a second, reports Glor.\n\nKumaritashvili is the fourth competitor to die at the Winter Games and the first since 1992.\n\nAthlete Deaths Rare During Olympics\n\n\"It's a very rare situation,\" three-time Olympic champion and German coach Georg Hackl said before learning of the death, clearly shaken after seeing Kumaritashvili tended to furiously by medical workers.\n\n\n\nWatch CBS News Videos Online\n\nShortly before the accident, Hackl said he didn't believe the track was unsafe.\n\n\"People have the opinion it is dangerous but the track crew does the best it can and they are working hard to make sure the track is in good shape and everyone is safe,\" he said. \"My opinion is that it's not anymore dangerous that anywhere else.\"\n\n(AP)\n\nFive-time Olympian Mark Grimmette, chosen as the U.S. team's flag bearer, said the speeds on the track are pushing the boundaries of safety.\n\n\"We're probably getting close,\" he said the night before the death. \"This track is fast and you definitely have to be on your game. ...

I'm on fire.\"'\n\nThis was Kumaritashvili's second crash during training for the games. He also failed to finish his second of six practice runs, and in the runs he did finish, his average speed was about 88 mph - significantly less than the speed the top sliders are managing on this lightning-fast course.\n\nMany sliders have exceeded 90 mph on this course. More than a dozen athletes have crashed during Olympic training for luge, and some questioned whether athletes from smaller nations - like Georgia - had enough time to prepare for the daunting track.\n\nAt the finish area, not far from where Kumaritashvili lost control, athletes, coaches and officials solemnly awaited word on Kumaritashvili before eventually being ushered away. Access to the crash area was closed within about 30 minutes.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Shiva Keshavan, a four-time Olympian from India.\n\nRepresentatives from the three U.S. sliding federations were to release a joint statement later Friday. American athletes were not immediately made available for reaction after news of the death was confirmed.\n\n\"My thoughts and prayers are with the Georgian Olympic team,\" U.S. bobsled pilot Steven Holcomb said on Twitter. \"The sliding community suffered a tragic and devastating loss to our family today.\"\n\n\"RIP Nodar Kumaritashvili,\" wrote American skeleton athlete Kyle Tress, who did not qualify for the Olympic team. \"Let's never forget how dangerous these sports can be.\"\n\nKumaritashvili competed in five World Cup races this season, finishing 44th in the world standings.\n\nEarlier in the day, gold-medal favorite Armin Zoeggeler of Italy crashed, losing control of his sled on Curve 11. Zoeggeler came off his sled and held it with his left arm to keep it from smashing atop his body. He slid on his back down several curves before coming to a stop and walking away.\n\nTraining days in Whistler have been crash-filled. A Romanian woman was briefly knocked unconscious and at least four Americans - Chris Mazdzer on Wednesday, Megan Sweeney on Thursday and both Tony Benshoof and Bengt Walden on Friday in the same training session where Zoeggeler wrecked - have had serious trouble just getting down the track.\n\n\"I think they are pushing it a little too much,\" Australia's Hannah Campbell-Pegg said Thursday night after she nearly lost control in training. \"To what extent are we just little lemmings that they just throw down a track and we're crash-test dummies?

four years on from his son\u2019s death - his father David spoke of his plans for his 18-month-old grandson Nikayo to \u201ccontinue our luging dynasty\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt three we\u2019ll start training him,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nErin Hamlin, the first singles slider ever to win an Olympic medal in luge for Team USA, told The Independent she isn\u2019t surprised to see Nodar\u2019s cousin continuing the family tradition even in light of his death.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cThe family has a lot of connection to the sport.\u201d\n\nIt was Ms Hamlin\u2019s second Olympic Games in Vancouver when the luge community was rocked by Nodar\u2019s horrific crash.\n\nHis death made him the first athlete to die in Olympic training or competition in almost half a century after luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki died in a crash during practice in the 1964 Games.\n\nMs Hamlin said \u201cthere was a lot of shock\u201d at Nodar\u2019s death but says it never even crossed her mind to pull out of the competition.\n\n\u201cObviously it shook us all. You never want to see something like that happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I was never in a mindset that I wouldn\u2019t compete. I was comfortable on the track.\u201d\n\nThe same mentality appears to be true of Saba.\n\nMs Hamlin added: \u201cThere\u2019s risks every time you slide. I was never fearful about continuing to slide.\n\n\u201cThe track was definitely fast and challenging but it was new and most new tracks are challenging to figure out and come with risk. I enjoyed the track quite a bit.\u201d\n\nQuestions were instantly raised after Nodar\u2019s death about the safety of the track.\n\nThe Whistler course was the fastest track in Olympic history and speeds of 96 miles per hour had been recorded ahead of the Games.\n\nThe 16th curve where Nodar had flown off the track had earned the nickname the \u201cThunderbird\u201d.\n\nDavid revealed that his son had told him just three days before his death that he was \u201cvery scared\u201d of the turn where he flipped off the sled.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m very scared of this spot on the track,\u201d he recalled to ABC News .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very fast. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll handle it well.\u201d\n\nDavid said he urged him not to \u201crisk it\u201d but that his son was insistent that he was going to go for it.\n\n\u201cWhat will be, will be,\u201d he recalled him saying.\n\nNodar\u2019s father David Kumaritashvili at his son\u2019s grave in Bakuriani, Georgia, in 2014 (AP)\n\nIt was Nodar\u2019s fifth and final training run before he would have competed in the Games the following day when tragedy struck.\n\nThe track was hurriedly altered following the crash in time for the first race less than 24 hours later.\n\nThe start was lowered in an effort to reduce the speed.\n\nThe exposed metal poles which Nodar struck were covered with a 12-foot-high wall made of wood and padding.\n\nAnd the Thunderbird was reconfigured so that the sleds didn\u2019t slide too high on the walls.\n\nInternational Luge Federation officials said at the time that the changes were made with the \u201cemotional component\u201d of the athletes in mind and insisted that there were no \u201cdeficiencies in the track\u201d.\n\nInstead, they said that the crash was caused by errors made by Nodar when he \u201cdid not compensate properly to make correct entrance into Curve 16\u201d.\n\nFor several athletes, the last-minute change in start proved difficult.\n\nMs Hamlin had been expected to take home at least bronze but ended up missing out on the medal table. She won bronze four years later in Sochi.\n\nShe told The Independent that Nodar\u2019s death did lead to changes in the sport in terms of focusing on safety over speed.\n\n\u201cI think it was a movement where everyone stopped to look at ways we could try to see if it was possible to make the track safer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much that could be done other than moving the starts as it was kind of a freak accident.\n\n\u201cBut the trend of just building faster and faster tracks did change.\u201d\n\nNodar\u2019s sled is seen just after the fatal crash. It crossed the finish line moments after he was killed (AP)\n\nFor Saba, he feels he is now ready to represent his family - particularly his cousin - in Beijing.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals\u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am happy and proud that I have the opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics.\n\n\u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me. It\u2019s really big motivation, so I will try to do my best for them.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/4909034", "page_content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- A men's luger from the former Soviet republic of Georgia died Friday after a high-speed crash during training for the Winter Games.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said doctors were unable to revive Nodar Kumaritashvili, and the 21-year-old died at a hospital, hours before the Vancouver Olympics' opening ceremonies were to start.\n\nIOC president Jacques Rogge said the death \"clearly casts a shadow over these Games.\"\n\n\"The IOC is in deep mourning,'' said Rogge, who wiped his eyes and appeared choked up before speaking. \"[Kumaritashvili] lost his life pursuing his passion. I have no words to say what we feel.''\n\nOfficials from the International Luge Federation and the Vancouver 2010 organizing committee said late Friday their investigation found \"no indication the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track.\" They said the track would reopen Saturday morning with changes \"to avoid that such an extremely exceptional accident could occur again.\"\n\nWomen's luge Olympians were scheduled to train at the track Saturday morning, nine hours before the men's two-day competition is set to begin.\n\nThe remaining seven members of the Georgian Olympic delegation planned to compete despite the tragedy and dedicated their performances to their fallen teammate. The athletes \"decided to be loyal to the spirit of the Olympic Games,\" Nikolos Rurua, Georgia's minister of culture and sport, said.\n\nKumaritashvili's teammates marched somberly into BC Place Stadium for the opening ceremonies. They wore black armbands and scarves, behind a flag draped with a black ribbon, as spectators, Olympic officials and competitors stood and saluted them with applause. Later, there was a moment of silence for Kumaritashvili.\n\n\"When we get here, we're all part of the same family. It's definitely affected everyone here,\" U.S. snowboarding star Shaun White said.\n\nKumaritashvili lost control of his sled, went over the track wall and struck an unpadded steel pole near the finish line at Whistler Sliding Center.\n\nRescue workers were at Kumaritashvili's side within seconds, chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation started less than one minute after the crash, and he was quickly airlifted to a trauma center in Whistler.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili lost control of his sled Friday, went over a track wall and struck a steel pole near the finish line at Whistler Sliding Center. Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe IOC said Kumaritashvili was pronounced dead at a trauma center in Whistler.\n\nVancouver organizing chief John Furlong said, \"We are heartbroken beyond words.\"\n\nRogge said he spoke with the president of Georgia to express his sympathy.\n\nLess than an hour after the accident, a representative from each team was told the grim news.\n\nKumaritashvili became the fourth Winter Olympics athlete to die since the Winter Games began in 1924 and the first since 1992.\n\n\"USA Luge expresses its deepest sympathies to the family of Nodar Kumaritashvili, his teammates and coaches as well as the entire delegation from Georgia,\" USA Luge president Dwight Bell and CEO Ron Rossi said in a statement. \"He will remain in our prayers.\"\n\nThe first sign Kumaritashvili was truly in trouble came only three seconds before the crash on Curve 13, the most perilous turn. His speed of 89.4 mph -- his best during six training runs on this track -- almost certainly means he had never gone faster.\n\nKumaritashvili's line -- as the path is known in luge -- entering the next-to-last curve had him traveling along a higher route than most racers prefer. That's where it got especially dangerous. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces along that sweeping turn. That, plus the high rate of speed, sent him careening up the high, banked, ice-covered wall.\n\nSliding diagonally down the wall, Kumaritashvili hit the corner entering the final straightaway with his lower body. The impact knocked him off the sled and flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nAfter smashing into the pole, he was motionless on a metal walkway. His left leg was in the air and his left foot was propped atop the track wall when the first rescue worker arrived and placed both hands on his helmet.\n\n\"It's a very rare situation,\" three-time Olympic champion and German coach Georg Hackl said before news of Kumaritashvili's death broke, clearly shaken moments after seeing Kumaritashvili tended to furiously by medical officials.\n\nShortly before the accident, Hackl said he didn't believe the track was unsafe."}, {"url": "https://www.wired.com/2010/02/death-on-vancouvers-fast-track/", "page_content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died today after losing control of his sled on the last turn of a training run at the Whistler Sliding Centre.\n\nKumaritashviliwent over the track wall and struck an unpadded metal pole. International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said an investigation is underway, but would not comment on whether the accident will affect scheduling for the sliding events. The men's luge is scheduled to begin Saturday.\n\nThe sliding track for the Vancouver Games is considered to be one of the fastest in the world, and there were questions before the Games about whether athletes would have enough time to master it. Is it too fast?\n\nKumaritashvili was not considered a serious contender in the men's event, and he had crashed in a previous training run. His average speed on his practice runs was 88 mph, while the top speeds during practice have exceeded 95 mph.\n\nU.S. bobsled driver Steven Holcomb has named curve 13 on the track \"50/50,\" which he says is the odds of making the turn. \"If you look at any track in the world, they all have curves that are a challenge. Now add over-95-mile-an-hour speed, and the exact same curve goes from 'tricky,' to 'I hope I get lucky.'\"\n\nPhoto: The sled belonging to Nodar Kumaritashvili of Georgia is seen just after he crashed during a training run for the men's singles luge at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics in Whistler, British Columbia, Friday.\n\nMichael Sohn/AP"}]}
