Micky quickly graduated to the recording studios via the R&B combo Tramline before touring Britain and Europe with some of the countrys top soul musicians.\n\nJoining the highly acclaimed Juicy Lucy was a large step towards rock stardom, and major tours of Britain, Europe and the USA accompanied a regular output of recorded works. After Juicy Lucy split, Micky co-founded Snafu, combining his rock-style guitar with down-home stateside grooves, and became a major contributor on the song-writing front. Snafu recorded three albums and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue their different ventures. Micky then became engrossed in session work as his reputation as a versatile performer spread. Soon a phone call from David Coverdale assured Micky of a vital place in his future plans, starting with the guitar slot and co-writing position on his forthcoming solo albums, Whitesnake and Northwinds.\n\n\n\nAs a sideman, Micky has featured alongside such classic British singers as Graham Bonnet, Frankie Miller, Chris Farlowe, Sheena Easton, Roger Chapman, Elkie Brookes and Eric Burdon. Visitors from the states such as Meat Loaf, Matt guitar Murphy, Ben E. King and Walter Trout have all employed his talents to enhance their performances.\n\nMicky's session work has included many T.V. commercials and some film scores. As a writer or co-writer his credits are numerous and include many of the classic Whitesnake favourites. With the Moody Marsden band, he and his guitar sparring partner Bernie Marsden toured extensively and released four albums before continuing their Whitesnake legacy with the Snakes and the Company of Snakes.\n\nIn 2000 Micky finally released his first solo album I Eat Them For Breakfast on Armadillo records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the first gig you ever went to & what were the first songs you learned?\n\nAs a child I was taken by my parents to a Christmas pantomime where the special guests were Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I was aware of their music and, like a lot of youngsters who took up the guitar in the early 1960's, I was especially drawn to the playing of Hank Marvin. I went to private guitar lessons from the age of twelve, so the first tunes I learned to play where from guitar tutor books.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich was the best moment of your career and which was the worst?\n\nGetting my first gold album (Ready an'Willing - Whitesnake) was a great moment. Playing onstage with Eric Clapton was also special.\n\nThe worst was performing with Snafu at the huge Roosevelt Stadium in New Jersey supporting Emerson Lake & Palmer. It was the ugliest drink and drug-sodden atmosphere I have ever experienced. We should never have supported ELP, this was not our audience and our management were to blame. We had to leave the stage because of the abuse, and also to avoid the missiles that were thrown at us from a truly dystopian gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn about yourself from music? What experiences in your life make you a GOOD musician?\n\nI believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom whom have you have learned the most secrets about blues rock music & in which songs can someone hear the best of your work?\n\nI loved the Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals. They could take blues and soul songs and heavy them up, and some of their originals songs sounded very inspired. Beck played like nobody else, and still does. I'm also a fan of American guitarist Harvey Mandel, especially the stuff he did in the late 6o's-early 70's and, of course, Eric Clapton in Cream. Blues rock slide? Early Johnny Winter; Duane Allman; Lowell George; Ry Cooder; Zoot Horn Rollo; Sonny Landreth, and Glenn Ross Campbell's steel playing.\n\nI think I improved with age! Some of my best playing is on my solo albums 'I Eat Them For Breakfast' and 'Don't Blame Me'. I was more in control of my own destiny on those albums.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat characterizes your \u201cphilosophy\u201d about the music?\n\nI've always been fascinated by the number of different styles of music that you can coax from the guitar. I'm known primarily as an electric guitarist but I have always loved the natural sound of acoustic music. I've discovered a lot of open tunings throughout the years, and different types of right-hand picking techniques from pick and fingers, thumpick and fingers and flesh (no picks at all). In the last few years I have written and produced two instrumental albums: 'Acoustic Journeyman' and 'Electric Journeyman'. Although I've been involved in a lot of song writing over the years, playing the guitar is still my main passion. People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you think that Micky Moody, continues to generate such a devoted following?\n\nI don't know if I have a devoted following! Maybe people appreciate that I've never been afraid to attempt different styles and that I try to express a range of emotions when I play.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201cthing\u201d you miss most from the Tramline? Which memory from the Wildflowers makes you smile?\n\nTramline: I was only seventeen at the time, in great health with my whole life ahead of me. Yes, I miss that feeling! The Wildflowers: Traveling to London with the other three guys in an old van fitted-out with bunk beds; we were so dedicated!\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me about the beginning of Juicy Lucy. How did you get together and where did it start?\n\nJuicy Lucy's Singer Paul Williams had seen me perform in Tramline, Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound and Zoot Money's band. He must have been impressed because when Neil Hubbard left Juicy Lucy to join the Grease Band he suggested me to the other guys. They were rehearsing at a house in the countryside so I went and rehearsed with them and got the job.\n\n\"I believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\"\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable stories you've had from Juice Lucy?\n\nSoon after I joined Juicy Lucy we flew to the United States for a tour which lasted for nearly a month. It was my first time in America and suddenly I was looking at things and visiting places I'd only seen on television. New York: we played at the legendary Fillmore East supporting Cactus and Lee Michaels; visited Atlantic's famous recording studio where Roberts Flack was recording with some of the greatest session musicians in the US (including the great Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie on drums). The Fillmore West, San Francisco where we supported Elton John and The Kinks, and looking out on a warm November day at Alcatraz Prison and the San Francisco Bay. Los Angeles: two or three nights at the Whiskey A Go- Go, staying at the Tropicana Hotel - Californian groupies! Boston: two nights at the Boston Tea Party supporting Leon Russell and Elvin Bishop - both had great bands. Went to Chicago and Madison WN too.\n\nLots of touring, especially in Germany, and taking over as lead guitarist when members from the original line-up quit. It was all great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments about your experiences with Chris Farlowe, Roger Chapman & Bernie Marsden? Would you like to tell your best memory about them?\n\nI was aware of Chris and Roger from my teens back in the north of England. Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds featured Albert Lee on guitar which was a real bonus for us guitar players. Tramline supported Family on a club date so I got see them live; Roger singing in that unusual fashion over very original-sounding songs. So it's been a thrill to actually work with them. Other great singers I've worked on stage with include Frankie Miller, Graham Bonnet, Gary Brooker, , Paul Rodgers in the Roadrunners/Wildflowers and David Coverdale in Whitesnake. Bernie and I developed a special understanding as dual guitarists, firstly with Whitesnake, then with the Moody Marsden Band. It had very little to do with Wishbone Ash or Thin Lizzie, and was influenced by the 60's British Blues players and American Southern Rockers like the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nWould you mind telling me your most vivid memory from Snafu?\n\nSee above! On a more positive note, recording the first album at the Manor Studios. We had a nice, tight funky thing going on in the early days.\n\n\"People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\"\n\nDo you remember anything interesting stories from Whitesnake?\n\nI have an incredible amount of interesting stories from my days with Whitesnake. How many weeks do you have to listen to them?!! It's impossible to pick out a few as there were so many. I had some of the best times of my life - it was the 70s, totally politically-incorrect, sexy and indulgent. That's all I'm saying!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you first meet John Mayall, do you remember anything interesting from touring with him?\n\nI was still in London after the breakup of the Wildflowers (1967) and Bruce Thomas, the bass player, discovered where John Mayall lived. Although I'd already decided that I would move back to my home town and spend some time studying the classical guitar, Bruce wanted to progress in the blues scene. We took the tube train to Paddington Station and walked a few blocks to Mayall's flat, which was at the top of a house close to the station. He had no idea who we were but was kind enough to invite us up to his flat, where his new guitarist Mick Taylor sat listening to blues albums. Bruce gave him his number for future reference and we had a nice cup of tea!\n\nI met him again the following year when Tramline supported his 'Crusade' band at the Marquee Club in London. In the spring of 1970, when I was playing with Zoot Money, we supported him and his drummer-less band on a number of shows on his British tour. His line-up was very odd: Jon Mark on nylon-strung guitar; Johnny Almond on Saxophones and Alex Dmochowski on bass. He seemed like quite a private, laid-back person.\n\n\"Being in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\"\n\nHow has the music business changed over the years since you first started in music?\n\nI was very lucky to have started my career in the Sixties and to have developed it in the Seventies. There was very little in the way of entertainment for the masses apart from music, TV (very limited those days) and film, and most people went to gigs and bought records. The opportunities were immense, unlike today were the public have so much choice, most of it available through the internet or multimedia. Recorded works and live performances were treated with respect and giving things for free, or worse, having them pirated, was rarely an option. I also think that, in some regards, technology has made the art of creating and performing music too accessible and instantaneous. If utilized correctly technology can be put to good use, but practice and dedication to one's instrument will always produce the better musician.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that the blues doesn\u2019t quite get the recognition and respect that other genres seem to get? Give one wish for the BLUES\n\nI'm not sure I agree with your opinion! I think that after pop and rock, blues is one of the most accepted forms of music to be embraced by a wide audience. Long may the Blues continue!\n\n\"I would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\"\n\nWith such an illustrious career, what has given you the most satisfaction musically?\n\nBeing in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference and similarity between the LIVE/GIG and the STUDIO feeling? And between your session projects, solo albums and the band\u2019s recording?\n\nThere's obviously a big difference between playing live and playing in a recording studio; some people excel in one and struggle with the other. I think that for most people, playing live is their raison d'etre, whilst the recording studio is a workshop within which you can create. I've been lucky enough to have had a lot of experience in both, some experiences turning out better than others. Playing live, there is (hopefully) an atmosphere created by both performers and audience, whereas you have to create an atmosphere in a studio - and concentrate - you have to live with the results!\n\nI'm in control of my own projects so I'm responsible for the outcome. On sessions you have to try and make the artist/producer comfortable and pleased with your efforts. I'm involved in a new band called Snakecharmer and we're all very experienced - watch out for us!\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any memories from the US tour \u201cBest of British Blues\u201d, which you\u2019d like to share with us?\n\nUnfortunately the 'Best of British Blues' tour of 1996 was memorable for the wrong reasons. The line-up consisted of featured artists Eric Burdon and Alvin Lee, and the band was Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell, Tim Hinkley and myself. I don't like to talk ill of the dead, but Boz created problems right from the first gig; he was unhappy with the promoter and seemed uncomfortable with the personnel. Halfway through the tour he went to pieces and couldn't continue, so Aynsley suggested Tony Franklin who'd played with bass with The Firm (Paul Rodgers/Jimmy Page). The band then seemed to split into two camps: Burdon, Dunbar and Franklin, and Lee, Hinkley and Moody. Eric Burdon thought that his guitarist should come to the House of Blues in L.A. and perform on stage with us just to show me how it should be done! What a fucking insult! Alvin sensed the vibes and a couple of gigs later he booked a plane home. We didn't even finish the tour. There were some good moments, but overall, definitely one to forget!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go back to the past what things you would do better and what things you would avoid to do again?\n\nI would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\n\n\n\nMicky Moody - Official website\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.wikilogy.com/biography/micky-moody/", "page_content": "Micky Moody is an English musician, best known as a guitarist.

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. From 2010 he has been working with Murray, guitarist Laurie Wisefield, drummer Harry James, singer Chris Ousey and keyboard player Michael Bramwell in Monsters of British Rock which has morphed into Snakecharmer with Adam Wakeman on keyboards.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also worked alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, PP Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner and Uriah Heep. For TV he has also accompanied such stars as Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Ben E. King and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).[1] A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene.[2] His media music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo Selecta, America's Next Top Model, How To Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Mad Men and Wife Swap USA.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and regularly attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed a band named The RoadRunners with several other local boys including Paul Rodgers (later to form Free and Bad Company), and later, Bruce Thomas, who would eventually play bass with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band were kept busy performing a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene so they took the decision to turn professional, change their name to the Wildflowers, and move to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without ever releasing any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur, John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had already split and gone their separate ways. At this point Moody joined Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound who, as well as proving to be a highly-polished Soul band, also acted as Gene Pitney's backing band for his UK tours as well as backing others, such as Paul Jones.[3][4]\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated Zoot Money before replacing Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy. As a member of Juicy Lucy, he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Micky co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with some down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums - SNAFU, Situation Normal, and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel session, the Old Grey Whistle Test and Supersonic and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue different ventures. Moody undertook occasional work as a session player before, during and after Snafu, most notably for Graham Bonnett. He also contributed to one track on City to City by Gerry Rafferty. Moody performed as an original member of Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist, Bob Young. The result was Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and guested with Hinkley's Heroes before hooking up with another friend from the North East, David Coverdale. Micky had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, but by this point Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. He invited Moody to assist and the result was the album White Snake released in 1977 which was followed by a second album Northwinds in 1978. Moody shared writing credits on four of the nine songs on Whitesnake (including the title track) and three of the eight songs featured on Northwinds. With the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston (replaced after a few months by Pete Solley) to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the EP Snakebite followed by two Studio albums: Trouble (also in 1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble, and was sole author of a fifth (the lively instrumental, Belgian Tom's Hat Trick). He contributed to three of the ten songs on Lovehunter, most notably the title track. While working with Whitesnake he found time to play slide guitar on several tracks on Roger Chapman's debut solo album, Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Andrew King Bernie Marsden (left) and Micky Moody; at Hammersmith Odeon, in 1981Courtesy: Andrew King\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on Ex-Lindisfarne Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, which spawned two UK single hits in the form of Fool for your Loving and the album title track; Moody co-wrote both tracks. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in that year. He also found time to write and record two singles with Bob Young. In 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Micky maintained a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get It that year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. The band was put on hold for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, for the likes of Sheena Easton. By late 1982 Whitesnake were back, (with Mel Galley replacing Marsden), and a re-juvinated Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. Going into 1983, Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. However Micky was not particularly happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale.[5] Despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody persevered with recording the Slide It In album (which he describes as an 'unhappy experience' ) before quitting the band in 1983 at the end of a tour.[1] Moody went back to session work with a series of artists including Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo, and Roger Chapman as well as selected TV work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with ex-Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language Of Rock And Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring ex-Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with the their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with his erstwhile Whitesnake guitarist-in-crime, Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band, concentrating mostly on the British and western European markets. Featured in various line-ups were drummers Zak Starkey, Terry Williams, John Trotter, Henry Spinetti and Dave Dowle; bass players Jaz Lochrie, Pete Stroud, Steve Price, Neil Murray and David Levy, and keyboard players Don Ariey and Josh Phillips. Guests in the studio included harmonica player Mark Feltham, keyboard player Volker 'Wolfman' Kunschner, brass players Nick Pentelow, Frank Mead and Martin Drover, and backing singers Monica Reed-Price and Mick Lister. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back On the Blues and Live In Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Alvin Lee, Eric Burdon, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set, Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced media music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company Of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams[6] to arrange and record a selection of classic Chicago blues tracks in a mostly 'unplugged' fashion; the result was Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional gigs in a duo format with bluesman Papa George, and continues to do so. The next 'Snake' metamorphosis was into M3 Classic Whitesnake, and although ex-Black Sabbath singer Tony Martin was in the starting line-up, Stefan Berggren was soon back in the frontman's spot. M3 released a live CD featuring Martin, and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Richie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were ex-Paul Rodgers Band, Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time, Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German superstar Westernhagen, which eventually topped the national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me in tandem with the autobiographical Playing with Trumpets - A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, the latter recounting his early days in the music business, mostly in the company of Paul Rodgers. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums. In 2008 he toured Japan as special guest of Jimmy Copley and Japanese guitar legend Char. Also featured was ex-Herbie Hancock bassist Paul Jackson and keyboard wizard Yoshinobu Kojima. The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before forming Snakecharmer with Neil Murray, also formerly of Whitesnake and The Company of Snakes.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 SNAFU (album)\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back On The Blues\n\n1994 live In Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst The Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them For Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! - Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\nGuest appearances\n\n1969 You Can All Join In (VA)\n\n(VA) 1970 Zoot Money (Zoot Money)\n\n(Zoot Money) 1973 In Memory of Robert Johnson (Paul Williams)\n\n(Paul Williams) 1973 I Never Got (Tony Kelly)\n\n(Tony Kelly) 1973 Manor Live (VA)\n\n(VA) 1973 Me and My Friend (Patrick Campbell Lyons)\n\n(Patrick Campbell Lyons) 1974 Funkist (Bobby Harrison)\n\n(Bobby Harrison) 1975 Squire (Alan Hull)\n\n(Alan Hull) 1975 Legend (Mickey Jupp)\n\n(Mickey Jupp) 1977 Graham Bonnet (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1977 Fancy That (Joanna Carlin)\n\n(Joanna Carlin) 1977 City to City (Gerry Rafferty)\n\n(Gerry Rafferty) 1979 Chappo (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1981 Line Up (Graham Bonnet)\n\n(Graham Bonnet) 1982 Riff Burglars (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1982 Music Money And Madness (Sheena Easton)\n\n(Sheena Easton) 1986 In Quo Country (Bob Young)\n\n(Bob Young) 1987 Islands (Mike Oldfield)\n\n(Mike Oldfield) 1987 Party Album (Gary Glitter)\n\n(Gary Glitter) 1987 Reaching Out (Paul Millns)\n\n(Paul Millns) 1987 Indestructible (Mike D'Abo)\n\n(Mike D'Abo) 1987 No Angel (Sanne Salomonsen)\n\n(Sanne Salomonsen) 1988 New Day (Jane Harrison)\n\n(Jane Harrison) 1989 Walking The Cat (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1990 Hybrid and Lowdown (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1991 Blue-Eyed Slide (Brian Knight)\n\n(Brian Knight) 1992 Parlour Games (John Spencer)\n\n(John Spencer) 1992 Blues Brittania (VA)\n\n(VA) 1992 Waiting In The Wings (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 1992 Very Much Alive (Willy Finlayson and The Hurters)\n\n(Willy Finlayson and The Hurters) 1993 Midnight Postcards (Adam Faith)\n\n(Adam Faith) 1994 Tellin' Stories (Walter Trout)\n\n(Walter Trout) 1994 Line Up (Borderline)\n\n(Borderline) 1995 Together (Peter Smith)\n\n(Peter Smith) 1995 Green and Blues (Bernie Marsden)\n\n(Bernie Marsden) 1996 Kiss My Soul (Roger Chapman)\n\n(Roger Chapman) 1996 Blue Thunder (Blue Thunder)\n\n(Blue Thunder) 1998 Pinboard Wizards (Jackie Lynton)\n\n(Jackie Lynton) 2000 Here After (Jamie Marshall)\n\n(Jamie Marshall) 2000 Gimme All Your Topp (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Snakebites (VA)\n\n(VA) 2000 Glory Bound (Chris Farlowe)\n\n(Chris Farlowe) 2001 Another Hair Of the Dog (VA)\n\n(VA) 2001 Tam de ti ye...

He was also a founder-member of Snafu. Together with his former Whitesnake colleague Bernie Marsden he founded the Moody Marsden Band, and later, The Snakes, having previously collaborated with unofficial 5th Status Quo member Bob Young in Young & Moody. Along with Marsden and ex-Whitesnake bassist, Neil Murray, he formed Company of Snakes and M3 Classic Whitesnake with which they mainly performed early Whitesnake songs. More recently, he has toured and recorded with Snakecharmer.\n\nBesides this, Moody has also toured with Roger Chapman, Frankie Miller and Chris Farlowe. He has also performed live alongside the likes of Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor, Bruce Dickinson, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Suggs, Dennis Locorriere, Paul Jones, P. P. Arnold, James Hunter, Rick Wakeman, Jon Lord, Newton Faulkner, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mark King, Alfie Boe, Sandi Thom, Brian Auger, Paul Weller, Eric Bibb, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Elkie Brooks, Nona Hendryx, Mud Morganfield and one of his early guitar heroes, Duane Eddy. Since 2000 he has released several solo albums: I Eat Them For Breakfast (2000), Don't Blame Me (2006), Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009). A versatile guitarist, Moody has been an active session musician and his own website lists over 100 albums to which he has contributed musically. 2006 saw the release of the autobiographical Playing With Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship, a memoir about his early days on the music scene. His library music has been featured on such TV programmes as Waking the Dead, Bo' Selecta!, America's Next Top Model, How to Look Good Naked, Top Gear, Horizon, Jersey Shore, Mad Men, Wife Swap and Paul Hollywood's Bread.\n\nBiography\n\n1960s\n\nWhile still at school in Middlesbrough and attending private guitar lessons, Moody formed The Roadrunners with several others from the smae area including Paul Rodgers (later of Free and Bad Company). They were joined some time later by bass player Bruce Thomas, who moved onto play with Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The band performed a range of covers in local halls and clubs. By 1967 they had developed and outgrown the local music scene and turned professional, changing their name to The Wildflowers and subsequently moving to London. They had some success and undertook some touring, but relationships within the band frayed and they eventually split without making any recordings. Moody returned home to Middlesbrough where for a while he widened his musical horizons by taking classical guitar lessons. He also became increasingly interested in slide guitar techniques (a style he would later be closely associated with). While living in Middlesbrough he was asked by local singer and entrepreneur John McCoy, to form a group which became Tramline. A deal for two albums was signed with Island Records, but by the time the second album was released the band had broken up. Moody joined Lucas and the professional Soul band Mike Cotton Sound who became Gene Pitney's backing band for UK tours as well as others such as Paul Jones.\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1970 he joined the recently re-patriated keybopard player Zoot Money as guitarist. He then replaced Neil Hubbard in Juicy Lucy with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively before the group disbanded. After the band split, Moody co-founded Snafu which combined his funk-rock guitar style with U.S down-home stateside grooves. The band recorded three albums SNAFU, Situation Normal and All Funked Up. They also appeared on a John Peel The Old Grey Whistle Test session and the T.V series Supersonic. Extensive touring followed before the band broke up. At this time Moody undertook occasional work as a session player most notably for Graham Bonnet. He also contributed to one track on Gerry Rafferty's City to City. He performed with the former Status Quo drummer John Coghlan's Diesel Band, then recorded an album with the band's tour manager and lyricist Bob Young which became Young & Moody. He then toured with Frankie Miller and stood in as a guste with with Hinkley's Heroes before joining his friend David Coverdale. Moody had known Coverdale from the local music scene in the Middlesbrough area in the late sixties, upto this time Coverdale had been fronting Deep Purple and was looking to undertake a solo venture. Coverdale invited Moody to work with him and the album White Snake was released in 1977. Moody shared writing credits on four songs including the title track. A second album Northwinds followed in 1978, on which Moody contributed to three songs. Following the demise of Deep Purple MkIV, Coverdale and Moody joined forces with Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Dave 'Duck' Dowle and keyboardist Brian Johnston to form a band that took its name Whitesnake from the title of Coverdale's first solo album. In 1978 they recorded the E.P Snakebite followed by two Studio albums, Trouble (1978) and Lovehunter (1979) which were recorded by a modified line up with Jon Lord on keyboards. Moody is credited with co-writing four of the ten tracks on Trouble and was sole writer of Belgian Tom's Hat Trick', an instrumental. While working with Whitesnake he also played slide guitar on Roger Chapman's debut solo album Chappo.\n\n1980s\n\nMoody contributed slide guitar to three tracks on former Lindisfarne member Ray Jackson's solo debut In the Night, which was released in 1980. By this point Whitesnake now featured Ian Paice from Deep Purple on drums, who had been brought into the group to replace Dowle. In 1980 this line up released the album Ready an' Willing, from which two UK singles were taken, Fool for Your Loving and the album title track, both co-written by Moody. The band also released the double album Live...in the Heart of the City in the same year. At his time he recorded two singles with Bob Young, with all tracks written by Moody.\n\nIn 1981 Graham Bonnet released his album Line-Up which featured Moody playing guitar on all tracks and also featured three songs written by Moody in partnership with Bob Young. Moody continued to maintain a busy schedule with Whitesnake and the band released the album Come an' Get Itin the same year. Relationships within the band were beginning to sour and Moody's guitar partner Bernie Marsden left prior to the final completion of the next album Saints and Sinners. Moody himself followed soon after. Whitesnake took time out for much of 1982 and Moody undertook some session work, with Sheena Easton and others. By late 1982 Whitesnake was reformed with Mel Galley replacing Marsden and Moody joining Galley on the album's backing vocal sessions. In 1983 Coverdale replaced Ian Paice and Neil Murray with Cozy Powell and Colin Hodgkinson. Moody was not happy with the direction the new band was taking and felt increasingly sidelined by Coverdale. However, despite the deteriorating situation within Whitesnake, Moody recorded Slide It In with them. A process he described as an 'unhappy experience' and after which he left the band in 1983.\n\nMoody returned to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, as well as selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the Hurters. Taking a wry, yet witty view on some of the people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards the end of the decade he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Moody toured extensively with Roger Chapman before re-uniting on a more permanent basis with Whitesnake guitarist Bernie Marsden, to tour and record with the Moody Marsden Band in U.K and Europe. The Moody Marsden Band recorded two live albums, Never Turn Our Back on the Blues and Live in Hell and a studio set, Real Faith. In 1996, Moody toured the USA as part of the Best of British Blues tour which also featured Eric Burdon, Alvin Lee, Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell and Tim Hinkley. The following year, Moody and Marsden teamed up with Norwegian rockers Jorn Lande, Willy Bendickson and Sid Ringsby to form The Snakes, a band that specialised in re-producing the sounds of the original Whitesnake. Don Airey would often be brought in to augment them on keyboards. The band recorded two albums, Once Bitten and Live in Europe before making way for The Company of Snakes, which featured in its line up former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart, original Whitesnake bass player Neil Murray and ex-Manfred Mann's Earth Band drummer John Lingwood. Hart was eventually replaced by ex-Snakes in Paradise frontman Steffan Berggren, and the band released two albums, Burst the Bubble and a live set Here They Go Again.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Micky wrote and produced library music prior to the release of his first official solo album, I Eat Them For Breakfast. Whilst continuing to perform with Company of Snakes and take on occasional session work, Moody joined his former Juicy Lucy bandmate Paul Williams to arrange and record a selection of acoustic classic Chicago blues tracks for the album Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men. He also started to play occasional duo gigs with bluesman Papa George. 'Snake' metamorphosed into M3 Classic Whitesnake and also released released a live CD featuring Martin and a live DVD featuring Berggren with a guest appearance from former Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen frontman Doogie White. Also featured in this line-up were Go West and Tears for Fears drummer Jimmy Copley and keyboard player Mark Stanway from Magnum.\n\nAround this time Moody played on the album Nah Aufnahme by German musician Westernhagen, which eventually appeared in thethe national charts. 2006 saw the release of Moody's self-produced solo album Don't Blame Me which was released at the same time as publication of his autobiographical memoirsPlaying with Trumpets \u2013 A Rock 'n' Roll Apprenticeship. M3 broke up later that year, after which Moody performed more shows with Roger Chapman plus selected dates with a line-up of the Micky Moody Band that featured his eldest son Micky Moody Jr. on drums.

The shows were recorded and released on DVD as Jimmy Copley & Char: Special Session. To celebrate his love of instrumental music, Micky wrote and produced the albums Acoustic Journeyman (2007) and Electric Journeyman (2009).\n\n2010s\n\nIn 2011, Moody co-wrote library music for both Warner/Chapell and Universal before co-forming Snakecharmer, a stellar line up which also includes former Whitesnake colleague Neil Murray. He also made regular appearances alongside blues guitarist Papa George and has been an active member of the Sunflower Jam house band and the Bad Apples.\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Tramline\n\n1968 Somewhere Down The Line\n\n1969 Moves of Vegetable Centuries\n\nWith Juicy Lucy\n\n1970 Lie Back and Enjoy It\n\n1971 Get a Whiff a This\n\n1972 Pieces\n\nWith Snafu\n\n1973 Snafu\n\n1974 Situation Normal\n\n1975 All Funked Up\n\nWith The Moody Marsden Band\n\n1992 Never Turn Our Back on the Blues\n\n1994 live in Hell\n\n1994 The Time Is Right For Live\n\n1994 Real Faith\n\n2000 The Night the Guitars Came to Play\n\nWith Bob Young\n\n1977 Young and Moody\n\n1995 The Nearest Hits Album\n\n2010 Back for the Last Time Again\n\nWith David Coverdale\n\n1977 White Snake\n\n1978 Northwinds\n\n2003 The Early Years\n\nWith Whitesnake\n\n1978 Snakebite\n\n1978 Trouble\n\n1978 Live at Hammersmith\n\n1979 Lovehunter\n\n1980 Ready an' Willing\n\n1980 Live...in the Heart of the City\n\n1981 Come an' Get It\n\n1982 Saints & Sinners\n\n1984 Slide It In (UK version)\n\n(UK version) 1994 Greatest Hits\n\n2003 Best of Whitesnake\n\n2003 The Silver Anniversary Collection\n\n2004 The Early Years\n\n2008 30th Anniversary Collection\n\n2011 Box of Snakes\n\nWith The Snakes, Company of Snakes & M3\n\n1998 Once Bitten (Japan)\n\n(Japan) 1998 Live in Europe\n\n2001 Here They Go Again\n\n2002 Burst the Bubble\n\n2005 Classic Snake Live\n\n2005 Rough An' Ready (live album, CD)\n\n(live album, CD) 2007 Rough An' Ready (live album, DVD)\n\nWith Snakecharmer\n\n2013 Snakecharmer\n\nWith The Bad Apples\n\n2014 Played\n\nWith Ali Maas\n\n2016 Black & Chrome\n\nSolo\n\n2000 I Eat Them for Breakfast\n\n2002 Smokestacks Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men (with Paul Williams)\n\n(with Paul Williams) 2006 Don't Blame Me\n\n2007 Acoustic Journeyman\n\n2008 Live and Rocking! \u2013 Live at the Hell Blues Festival 2000 (Micky Moody & Friends)\n\n(Micky Moody & Friends) 2009 Electric Journeyman\n\n2016 Black & Chrome (with Ali Maas)\n\nGuest appearances"}, {"url": "https://blabbermouth.net/news/former-whitesnake-guitarist-micky-moody-plays-with-trumpets", "page_content": "M3 guitarist Micky Moody (ex-WHITESNAKE) has just had his book, \"Playing with Trumpets - A Rock and Roll Apprenticeship\", released by SAF Publishing.\n\nThe book's description reads as follows: \"In 1981, whilst onstage with hard rockers WHITESNAKE at the Monsters of Rock Festival at Donington Park, in a rare moment of self-analysis as he raised a clenched fist in salute to 65,000 faithful fans, Micky Moody pondered the question, 'How the hell did I get here?'

Micky quickly graduated to the recording studios via the R&B combo Tramline before touring Britain and Europe with some of the countrys top soul musicians.\n\nJoining the highly acclaimed Juicy Lucy was a large step towards rock stardom, and major tours of Britain, Europe and the USA accompanied a regular output of recorded works. After Juicy Lucy split, Micky co-founded Snafu, combining his rock-style guitar with down-home stateside grooves, and became a major contributor on the song-writing front. Snafu recorded three albums and toured extensively before the individual members headed off to pursue their different ventures. Micky then became engrossed in session work as his reputation as a versatile performer spread. Soon a phone call from David Coverdale assured Micky of a vital place in his future plans, starting with the guitar slot and co-writing position on his forthcoming solo albums, Whitesnake and Northwinds.\n\n\n\nAs a sideman, Micky has featured alongside such classic British singers as Graham Bonnet, Frankie Miller, Chris Farlowe, Sheena Easton, Roger Chapman, Elkie Brookes and Eric Burdon. Visitors from the states such as Meat Loaf, Matt guitar Murphy, Ben E. King and Walter Trout have all employed his talents to enhance their performances.\n\nMicky's session work has included many T.V. commercials and some film scores. As a writer or co-writer his credits are numerous and include many of the classic Whitesnake favourites. With the Moody Marsden band, he and his guitar sparring partner Bernie Marsden toured extensively and released four albums before continuing their Whitesnake legacy with the Snakes and the Company of Snakes.\n\nIn 2000 Micky finally released his first solo album I Eat Them For Breakfast on Armadillo records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview by Michael Limnios\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the first gig you ever went to & what were the first songs you learned?\n\nAs a child I was taken by my parents to a Christmas pantomime where the special guests were Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I was aware of their music and, like a lot of youngsters who took up the guitar in the early 1960's, I was especially drawn to the playing of Hank Marvin. I went to private guitar lessons from the age of twelve, so the first tunes I learned to play where from guitar tutor books.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich was the best moment of your career and which was the worst?\n\nGetting my first gold album (Ready an'Willing - Whitesnake) was a great moment. Playing onstage with Eric Clapton was also special.\n\nThe worst was performing with Snafu at the huge Roosevelt Stadium in New Jersey supporting Emerson Lake & Palmer. It was the ugliest drink and drug-sodden atmosphere I have ever experienced. We should never have supported ELP, this was not our audience and our management were to blame. We had to leave the stage because of the abuse, and also to avoid the missiles that were thrown at us from a truly dystopian gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn about yourself from music? What experiences in your life make you a GOOD musician?\n\nI believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom whom have you have learned the most secrets about blues rock music & in which songs can someone hear the best of your work?\n\nI loved the Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals. They could take blues and soul songs and heavy them up, and some of their originals songs sounded very inspired. Beck played like nobody else, and still does. I'm also a fan of American guitarist Harvey Mandel, especially the stuff he did in the late 6o's-early 70's and, of course, Eric Clapton in Cream. Blues rock slide? Early Johnny Winter; Duane Allman; Lowell George; Ry Cooder; Zoot Horn Rollo; Sonny Landreth, and Glenn Ross Campbell's steel playing.\n\nI think I improved with age! Some of my best playing is on my solo albums 'I Eat Them For Breakfast' and 'Don't Blame Me'. I was more in control of my own destiny on those albums.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat characterizes your \u201cphilosophy\u201d about the music?\n\nI've always been fascinated by the number of different styles of music that you can coax from the guitar. I'm known primarily as an electric guitarist but I have always loved the natural sound of acoustic music. I've discovered a lot of open tunings throughout the years, and different types of right-hand picking techniques from pick and fingers, thumpick and fingers and flesh (no picks at all). In the last few years I have written and produced two instrumental albums: 'Acoustic Journeyman' and 'Electric Journeyman'. Although I've been involved in a lot of song writing over the years, playing the guitar is still my main passion. People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did you think that Micky Moody, continues to generate such a devoted following?\n\nI don't know if I have a devoted following! Maybe people appreciate that I've never been afraid to attempt different styles and that I try to express a range of emotions when I play.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201cthing\u201d you miss most from the Tramline? Which memory from the Wildflowers makes you smile?\n\nTramline: I was only seventeen at the time, in great health with my whole life ahead of me. Yes, I miss that feeling! The Wildflowers: Traveling to London with the other three guys in an old van fitted-out with bunk beds; we were so dedicated!\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me about the beginning of Juicy Lucy. How did you get together and where did it start?\n\nJuicy Lucy's Singer Paul Williams had seen me perform in Tramline, Lucas and the Mike Cotton Sound and Zoot Money's band. He must have been impressed because when Neil Hubbard left Juicy Lucy to join the Grease Band he suggested me to the other guys. They were rehearsing at a house in the countryside so I went and rehearsed with them and got the job.\n\n\"I believe the special 'something' that differentiates a good musician from a not-so-good musician is natural ability; you either have it or you don't. Practice, dedication, experience and inventiveness helps too!\"\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable stories you've had from Juice Lucy?\n\nSoon after I joined Juicy Lucy we flew to the United States for a tour which lasted for nearly a month. It was my first time in America and suddenly I was looking at things and visiting places I'd only seen on television. New York: we played at the legendary Fillmore East supporting Cactus and Lee Michaels; visited Atlantic's famous recording studio where Roberts Flack was recording with some of the greatest session musicians in the US (including the great Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie on drums). The Fillmore West, San Francisco where we supported Elton John and The Kinks, and looking out on a warm November day at Alcatraz Prison and the San Francisco Bay. Los Angeles: two or three nights at the Whiskey A Go- Go, staying at the Tropicana Hotel - Californian groupies! Boston: two nights at the Boston Tea Party supporting Leon Russell and Elvin Bishop - both had great bands. Went to Chicago and Madison WN too.\n\nLots of touring, especially in Germany, and taking over as lead guitarist when members from the original line-up quit. It was all great experience!\n\n\n\n\n\nAny comments about your experiences with Chris Farlowe, Roger Chapman & Bernie Marsden? Would you like to tell your best memory about them?\n\nI was aware of Chris and Roger from my teens back in the north of England. Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds featured Albert Lee on guitar which was a real bonus for us guitar players. Tramline supported Family on a club date so I got see them live; Roger singing in that unusual fashion over very original-sounding songs. So it's been a thrill to actually work with them. Other great singers I've worked on stage with include Frankie Miller, Graham Bonnet, Gary Brooker, , Paul Rodgers in the Roadrunners/Wildflowers and David Coverdale in Whitesnake. Bernie and I developed a special understanding as dual guitarists, firstly with Whitesnake, then with the Moody Marsden Band. It had very little to do with Wishbone Ash or Thin Lizzie, and was influenced by the 60's British Blues players and American Southern Rockers like the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nWould you mind telling me your most vivid memory from Snafu?\n\nSee above! On a more positive note, recording the first album at the Manor Studios. We had a nice, tight funky thing going on in the early days.\n\n\"People sometimes ask me what is my favourite kind of music, and my answer is always \"Good music!\" If possible, always play the kind of music that stimulates your emotions, and try to keep an open mind.\"\n\nDo you remember anything interesting stories from Whitesnake?\n\nI have an incredible amount of interesting stories from my days with Whitesnake. How many weeks do you have to listen to them?!! It's impossible to pick out a few as there were so many. I had some of the best times of my life - it was the 70s, totally politically-incorrect, sexy and indulgent. That's all I'm saying!\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you first meet John Mayall, do you remember anything interesting from touring with him?\n\nI was still in London after the breakup of the Wildflowers (1967) and Bruce Thomas, the bass player, discovered where John Mayall lived. Although I'd already decided that I would move back to my home town and spend some time studying the classical guitar, Bruce wanted to progress in the blues scene. We took the tube train to Paddington Station and walked a few blocks to Mayall's flat, which was at the top of a house close to the station. He had no idea who we were but was kind enough to invite us up to his flat, where his new guitarist Mick Taylor sat listening to blues albums. Bruce gave him his number for future reference and we had a nice cup of tea!\n\nI met him again the following year when Tramline supported his 'Crusade' band at the Marquee Club in London. In the spring of 1970, when I was playing with Zoot Money, we supported him and his drummer-less band on a number of shows on his British tour. His line-up was very odd: Jon Mark on nylon-strung guitar; Johnny Almond on Saxophones and Alex Dmochowski on bass. He seemed like quite a private, laid-back person.\n\n\"Being in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\"\n\nHow has the music business changed over the years since you first started in music?\n\nI was very lucky to have started my career in the Sixties and to have developed it in the Seventies. There was very little in the way of entertainment for the masses apart from music, TV (very limited those days) and film, and most people went to gigs and bought records. The opportunities were immense, unlike today were the public have so much choice, most of it available through the internet or multimedia. Recorded works and live performances were treated with respect and giving things for free, or worse, having them pirated, was rarely an option. I also think that, in some regards, technology has made the art of creating and performing music too accessible and instantaneous. If utilized correctly technology can be put to good use, but practice and dedication to one's instrument will always produce the better musician.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that the blues doesn\u2019t quite get the recognition and respect that other genres seem to get? Give one wish for the BLUES\n\nI'm not sure I agree with your opinion! I think that after pop and rock, blues is one of the most accepted forms of music to be embraced by a wide audience. Long may the Blues continue!\n\n\"I would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\"\n\nWith such an illustrious career, what has given you the most satisfaction musically?\n\nBeing in a position to enjoy playing the guitar professionally, working with hundreds of talented people, writing songs and instrumentals pieces, and being able to afford good instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference and similarity between the LIVE/GIG and the STUDIO feeling? And between your session projects, solo albums and the band\u2019s recording?\n\nThere's obviously a big difference between playing live and playing in a recording studio; some people excel in one and struggle with the other. I think that for most people, playing live is their raison d'etre, whilst the recording studio is a workshop within which you can create. I've been lucky enough to have had a lot of experience in both, some experiences turning out better than others. Playing live, there is (hopefully) an atmosphere created by both performers and audience, whereas you have to create an atmosphere in a studio - and concentrate - you have to live with the results!\n\nI'm in control of my own projects so I'm responsible for the outcome. On sessions you have to try and make the artist/producer comfortable and pleased with your efforts. I'm involved in a new band called Snakecharmer and we're all very experienced - watch out for us!\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any memories from the US tour \u201cBest of British Blues\u201d, which you\u2019d like to share with us?\n\nUnfortunately the 'Best of British Blues' tour of 1996 was memorable for the wrong reasons. The line-up consisted of featured artists Eric Burdon and Alvin Lee, and the band was Aynsley Dunbar, Boz Burrell, Tim Hinkley and myself. I don't like to talk ill of the dead, but Boz created problems right from the first gig; he was unhappy with the promoter and seemed uncomfortable with the personnel. Halfway through the tour he went to pieces and couldn't continue, so Aynsley suggested Tony Franklin who'd played with bass with The Firm (Paul Rodgers/Jimmy Page). The band then seemed to split into two camps: Burdon, Dunbar and Franklin, and Lee, Hinkley and Moody. Eric Burdon thought that his guitarist should come to the House of Blues in L.A. and perform on stage with us just to show me how it should be done! What a fucking insult! Alvin sensed the vibes and a couple of gigs later he booked a plane home. We didn't even finish the tour. There were some good moments, but overall, definitely one to forget!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go back to the past what things you would do better and what things you would avoid to do again?\n\nI would give more thought to the business side of things; there are a lot of smiling assassins out there who have no second thoughts about taking things that do not belong to them - usually money.\n\n\n\nMicky Moody - Official website\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.mickymoody.com/biography/", "page_content": "Me and my Harmony H77,\n\nWhere it all began.\n\nI can't remember anything since I was fifteen.

She formed the rock band McQueen with Levitation producer Mike Dignam and she met up with the Russian rockers Mumiytroll appearing on their albums as a backing vocalist.\n\nWe had already seen this talented blues singer performing with Papa George as well as with Alan Glen, John O\u2019leary and the Allstar Blues Revue.\n\nMicky Moody is most famous for his work with rock bands Juicy Lucy and Whitesnake. More recently he has been working with the Chris Ousey/ Laurie Wisefield project SNAKECHARMER.\n\nWe sat down with both musicians to discuss their plans:\n\nTell us about your new project\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called MAAS and MOODY and it features ALI MAAS on vocals and myself (MOODY) on guitars, as usual\u2026 And there\u2019s gonna be a brand new album \u2014 all original material \u2014 which has already been mastered (last week) \u2014 we haven\u2019t got a release date as yet but it will probably be out the end of July, with a bit of luck. It will be released on Armadillo Music. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing\u2026\u201d\n\nHow many shows have you done together?\n\n\u201cJust done a couple of local ones, really. The BULL\u2019S HEAD in London. It\u2019s been building up and we have been incorporating the songs gradually. It\u2019s been more writing, really. Though here at the HRH BLUES festival we are performing a MICKY MOODY show\u2014 though we will be doing some of our new stuff from the album.\u201d\n\nWe have heard rumours that your son is involved with new project?\n\n\u201cYes, my son\u2019s on drums. My elder son, yeah. With Roy Parsons on bass [also with Tim Hain Band] Stuart Dixon on guitar. Stuart hasn\u2019t worked with us before. But we\u2019ve had a couple of gigs, as I told you. I haven\u2019t been on the road, really, since I did the Snakecharmer gigs, back in November\u2026 so we\u2019re looking forwards to doing a tour \u2014 probably more towards the end of the year \u2014 once the album is out. \u201d\n\nSo did ALI help with the writing process?\n\n\u201c Yes, we co-wrote everything. And it\u2019s not like Snakecharmer! I think we have gone back to the kind of stuff I used to do in the 1970s. A lot of slide stuff. Down-home. Swampy. Bluesy. Rocky.\u201d\n\nALI MAAS: \u201c Yes, we feel definitely swampy! And it\u2019s quite an eclectic sound that we are developing. And there\u2019s a rock element to it. I have got rock blood. And Micky has got all sorts of blood \u2014 God knows what kind of blood is in there \u2014 but there\u2019s all sorts..\u201d\n\nHow do you keep the energy and the vitality up?\n\nMoody: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t intend to be living on the road all the time. And this project won\u2019t interfere with my other gigs\u2026 I really love playing with Papa George, for example. We\u2019ll obviously be doing live shows but I have done a lot in my time. I like work. That\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t want to spend my life on the road. \u201d\n\n\u201cWe have already started writing the next album! And the first one isn\u2019t even out yet! We can\u2019t stop. We love the creative process. And I think I just have a natural energy inside. And of course its the excitement. I think basically, its just that we both do what we wanna do! Without being too indulgent, you know what I mean, it\u2019s still lively stuff (it won\u2019t bore anyone) but we\u2019re not gonna do the obvious stuff. \u201d\n\nMy final Hoorah! With the rock stuff and the Whitesnake associated stuff was with Snakecharmer. Yeah, that didn\u2019t really work out for me. For whatever reasons. So this new project is really what I wanna do. It\u2019s the stuff I was actually doing before I joined Whitesnake. In 1978 I helped form Whitesnake but I had been a pro for 10 years before that. Playing all kinds of stuff. And that\u2019s what I like to do. And you\u2019ve seen me with George, the kind of roots we have, we just wanna keep it soulful and happy. And cool too\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Whitesnake material is great stuff. But I don\u2019t want to do it any more. I just did it with Snakecharmer\u2026 It\u2019s great stuff but I\u2019d rather leave it to other people to do. I can\u2019t go any further with it. I want to do something different now. \u201d\n\n\u201cI really enjoy working with the people in this new band. We\u2019re all friends and there\u2019s no shit going on, you know what I mean? It\u2019s good vibes with this band. \u201d\n\nWhat is the title of the new album ?\n\n\u201cThe title is Black and Chrome\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cIt sounds good! \u201d\n\nALI MAAS: \u201c There\u2019s a lyric on the album\u2026 One of the songs is about a trip up the Mississippi on the back of a Harley and motorbikes and that do figure in the subject matter of the album\u2026 \u201d\n\n\u201cAlso Black and Chrome are the optimum colours for a classic looking finish. The colours go well together. It\u2019s classic rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Stylish. Timeless. And that\u2019s what we are gonna try and emulate. It may been sleek and sharply clean, but occasionally there might be a bit of mud up the side\u2026 \u201d\n\nWell, good luck with your new project and the release of the album. We cannot wait to hear it!\n\nMicky Moody (with Ali Maas) was talking to @neilmach \u00a9 at HRH BLUES 2016\n\nAll Images: @neilmach 2016 \u00a9\n\nLink: https://www.facebook.com/hrhblues/\n\n"}]}
