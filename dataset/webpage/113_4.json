{"Clay timpani is known for its warm, mellow tone.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/timpani", "page_content": "timpani, (Italian: \u201cdrums\u201d) also spelled tympani, orchestral kettledrums. The name has been applied to large kettledrums since at least the 17th century. The permanent orchestral use of timpani dates from the mid-17th century, early examples being in Matthew Locke\u2019s Psyche (1673) and Jean-Baptiste Lully\u2019s opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e (1675). At first they were mainly confined to expressions of rejoicing or to supporting the brass in loud passages. Two instruments, one tuned to the tonic and the other to the dominant (first and fifth notes of the scale), were normal in 17th- and 18th-century scores. Later, more instruments were used with a variety of tunings. In the 19th century the timpani were used in more varied and expressive ways, a development stimulated in large part by the innovations of Ludwig van Beethoven. The French composer Hector Berlioz, who required 16 kettledrums in his Grand Messe des morts (1837; Requiem), even urged composers to specify which type of hard or soft sticks they wished used.\n\nIn modern timpani the bowl-shaped shell is usually of copper or brass. The membrane, of calfskin or synthetic material, is secured by a metal hoop. Its tension is varied by hand screws fixed to the shell and acting on the hoop, or, more often, by one of several 19th- and 20th-century devices: pedal or hand mechanisms that control the tension by rods connected to the hoop. A hole is pierced at the bottom of the shell to avoid air concussion splitting the head in loud passages. The tone varies according to the texture of the head of the stick and the area of the membrane struck. Occasionally, composers specify using the fingers to set the membrane in vibration.\n\nBritannica Quiz Musical Instruments\n\nThe orchestral kettledrum has a practical compass of five full tones. The compass of a pair of timpani is normally an octave from F below middle C downward; for an orchestral set of three, the tuning ranges are generally c\u2013g, G\u2013d, and E\u266d\u2013B\u266d (g = the G below middle C; E\u266d = the second E\u266d below). Such composers as Igor Stravinsky and Gustav Mahler have extended this range. The expressive resources of the timpani include reiteration of persistent rhythms, dramatic crescendos, sudden stresses, and atmospheric rolls. Special effects include damped or muffled notes, striking a note with two sticks, pedal glissando (sliding pitch) on a roll, and muting by placing a cloth on the drumhead."}, {"url": "https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/facts-about-the-timpani/", "page_content": "By Robert Jackson\n\nTimpani are those large semi-spherical drums that look like big shiny bowls or upside-down tea-kettles\u2014which is why they\u2019re also called kettledrums.\n\nA classical percussion section would never be complete without timpani. They\u2019re important both in classical orchestras and musical ensembles, including concert, marching, and even rock and roll bands.\n\nThe sound of timpani can be energetic and thunderous, as well as smooth and velvety, which is why they\u2019re considered extremely versatile.\n\nTo help acquaint you with this fascinating percussive instrument, here are 20 interesting facts about the timpani.\n\n1. The Timpani is a Pitched Percussion Instrument\n\nModern pedal timpani can be instantly tuned through a movable foot pedal to adjust the tension of the head as well as the pitch.\n\nAlthough convenient, that could still pose a challenge during a concert, since it\u2019ll require the timpanist to have a perfect ear to keep the instrument in key with the rest of the ensemble.\n\nTuning a chain timpani, which is much less common nowadays, is even more difficult since they don\u2019t have pedals.\n\nInstead, they have a roller chain and a crank.\n\n2. The Timpani Were Initially Military Drums\n\nArabian Naqqara\n\nTimpani started as military drums.\n\nTheir use dates back to the 13th century when they were introduced to Europe by crusaders who brought similar but much smaller Arabian Naqqara.\n\nBefore timpani came to be a staple instrument in the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century, they were used in military ceremonies throughout Europe until the 16th century.\n\nThey were even used during the American Civil war where they were played by musicians on horseback.\n\nIn the late 19th century, modern machine timpani were developed for easier adjustment of drumhead tension.\n\n3. The Timpani Has a Wide Range of Sounds\n\nTimpani produce a wide dynamic range of sounds.\n\nTheir various sounds could best be described as dull, thunderous, rumbling, booming, deep, heavy, powerful, round, mellow, velvety, substantial, resonant, dry, or hollow.\n\nThe timbre of the timpani is affected by what the mallets are made of, where the head is struck, and how hard it\u2019s struck.\n\nThe purest tone is produced from the middle of a timpani drum.\n\n4. Timpani Belong to the Percussion Family\n\nThe percussion family is the largest in the orchestra, and timpani are a central part of it because they support rhythm, add melody and color, and enhance harmony.\n\nThe timpani, along with the xylophone and piano, are percussion instruments that are tuned and can sound different notes.\n\nThe bass drums, cymbals, and castanets are examples of untuned percussion instruments with no definite pitch.\n\n5. Timpani Have a Wide Pitch Range\n\nEach timpano (the singular or timpani) has a tonal range of about an interval of a sixth, with the pitch of the lower note dependant on its size.\n\nIn a four-timpani set, the range of pitch of the four drums can therefore span around 3 octaves!\n\n6. Timpani Are Traditionally Made of Copper\n\nTimpani sets today come in a host of materials, including fiber-reinforced plastic and aluminum.\n\nHowever, the traditional copper remains the best material for the bowl since it keeps the timpani in tune more effectively, and resists temperature changes.\n\nCopper also has properties that allow it to easily stretch and shape, and allows sound to resonate deeply.\n\n7. Animal Skins are Preferred for Timpani Heads\n\nTypically, timpani heads used to cover the bowl are made of calfskin or goatskin.\n\nAlthough costly, professional timpanists prefer these skins for the warmer quality of sound they produce.\n\nHeads are also often made of plastic, which is more durable, more affordable, and less affected by temperature and humidity than animal skin.\n\n8. There Are Two Styles of Timpani Placement\n\nIn German-speaking countries, including Germany and Austria, large timpani are usually placed at the right side of the timpanist with smaller timpani to the left, increasing the pitch from right to left.\n\nInternationally, especially in Japan, the direction of the timpani is reversed so that the pitch increases from left to right, similar to a piano keyboard.\n\n9. Timpanists Are Very Well Paid\n\nTimpanists are some of the highest-earning musicians in the music industry.\n\nTheir role is central in an orchestra, and there are few of them due to the difficulty of the instrument.\n\nOf course, the more skilled and experienced a timpanist is, the higher their earning potential, especially in performing arts companies or professional symphonies.\n\nIn the US, it\u2019s reported that the median salary for a timpanist is just under $50,000 a year with some paid well over $100k a year too!\n\n10. Timpani are Very Expensive Instruments\n\nBuying a quality set of timpani could cost you. Prices vary depending on factors like brand, size, and material.\n\nA timpani set can take up to two years to build and could cost an average of $12,000-$17,000.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be careful while moving them around to avoid costly damages.\n\n11. Timpani Are Heavy\n\nTimpani are among the largest and heaviest musical instruments.\n\nA single timpani drum can weigh up to 140 lbs\u2026\n\nMultiply that by 4 or 5 for a whole set, and you\u2019ve got a challenge on your hands.\n\nTransporting these drums can be difficult and it\u2019ll give you a good workout.\n\n12. There Are Many Different Styles of Timpani\n\nTimpani come in various shapes and sizes.\n\nThere\u2019s a cambered type with a flat bottom like a pot, and a parabolic type that\u2019s nearly hemispherical.\n\nGenerally, the smaller the drums, the higher the pitches.\n\nThe timbre is also decided by where the drum head is stricken.\n\n13. Different Timpani Mallets Give Different Sounds\n\nThere are different categories of mallets used for striking the timpani, including hard, medium-hard, soft, flannel, and wood.\n\nEach kind is used according to the sheet music to express different sounds.\n\nThey come in various sizes, weights, coverings, and lengths of handles.\n\nThe mallet tip is often made out of felt, flannel, or cork, with a bamboo or wood handle.\n\nFelt ball mallets result in a soft attack, while wood balls produce a sharp attack and greater volume.\n\nMany professional musicians prefer to make their own mallets to customize them according to their needs.\n\n14. There Are Different Grips For The Timpani Mallet\n\nTwo common grips for the timpani mallet are the German grip and the French grip.\n\nIn the German grip, the palm is almost parallel with the drum head with the thumb on the side of the mallet.\n\nIn the French grip, the palm is almost perpendicular with the drum head and the thumb is on top of the mallet.\n\nThe American grip is a combination of both.\n\n15. Timpani Go Into All Kinds of Contemporary Music\n\nMusic created by timpani has a lengthy repertoire; it has invaded many rock and roll bands, as well as pop music.\n\nFrom the Beach Boys, Queen, The Beatles, and Emerson, to Led Zeppelin, timpani have taken pride of place in the 60s-70s pop-rock music.\n\nThey\u2019re also featured in electronic music!\n\nSounds created by the timpani are versatile, and stand out in any music style or genre.\n\n16. Playing the Timpani Can Be Tricky But Fun\n\nPlaying the timpani might seem easy\u2014the rhythms are simple, and you often play only a couple of notes\u2014but in reality, there\u2019s so much technique involved.\n\nYou need a very strong musical ear to successfully tune and play your timpani.\n\nYou also need to know how to maintain your drums and mallets to ensure a longer lifespan for them.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, playing the timpani is so much fun.\n\n17. Playing the Timpani Requires Sensitivity Over Strength\n\nIt\u2019s often thought that playing a large musical instrument like the timpani requires a lot of physical strength, but that\u2019s not true.\n\nIn fact, a large volume of sound can be given through the drum reverberations, using only a little amount of force.\n\nAll you need is to create vibration as naturally as you can.\n\nIt actually takes a lot of sensitivity to create soft sounds and maintain a steady tempo.\n\n18. The Largest Timpani in the World is in Bali\n\nThe largest timpani in the world is in Bali.\n\nAt 73 inches in tall and 63 inches in diameter, the Moon of Pejeng is an ancient kettledrum that is thought to date back to 300 BC.\n\nIt has a story attached to it too, with a Balinese legend claiming that this drum was one of the wheels of a chariot on which they pulled the moon through sky until it fell to earth.\n\nWrap-Up\n\nAs you can see, a timpanist\u2019s job isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nWhile playing the timpani isn\u2019t easy at first, it sure is fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nWe hope the 20 facts we\u2019ve shared in this post have inspired you to delve deeper into the world of percussive instruments and enjoy some fascinating timpani solos and ensembles."}, {"url": "https://www.vsl.info/en/academy/percussion/timpani", "page_content": "Timpani\n\nBrief description Name : Timpani, Kettledrums\n\n: Timpani, Kettledrums Spelling German: Pauken Italian: timpani French: timbales\n\nClassification : Percussion instrument, membranophone, skin-covered instrument with definite pitch\n\n: Percussion instrument, membranophone, skin-covered instrument with definite pitch Bowl : Copper, brass\n\n: Copper, brass Diameter : From 52 cm (piccolo kettledrum) to 76 cm (bass kettledrum)\n\n: From 52 cm (piccolo kettledrum) to 76 cm (bass kettledrum) Height : Approx. 80 cm\n\n: Approx. 80 cm Wall thickness : 0.5 mm\n\n: 0.5 mm Skin (vellum) : Calf, goat or donkey skin.

It is the loudest of all orchestra instruments and as such requires tremendous precision of the timpanist. Great sensitivity is also necessary to get the pitch right: timpani are the only membranophones in the orchestra with definite pitch and the timpanist needs extremely sensitive hearing to find the correct pitch. The volume and pitch of the timpani are far more heavily influenced by the prevailing atmospheric conditions (temperature and humidity) than other instruments. It is for this reason that the performance of the timpani part in the orchestra is generally only entrusted to trained timpanists. The difference between timpanists and the percussionists who play the other percussion instruments lies in the intensity of the timpanist's tasks; this makes it essential that the instruments are played by a specialist. The timpani are therefore always played by a timpanist; \u201cnormal\u201d percussionists are very rarely permitted to indulge. In Romantic and modern works four timpani are usual. In the Classical period one pair was standard.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly timpani in Europe\n\nThe first timpani were brought to southern and western Europe in the 13th century by Crusaders and Saracens, from where they spread quickly to the north. These instruments (known in Arabic as naqq\u00e2ra) were pairs of kettledrums about 20-22 cm in diameter. These small drums (draped kettledrums) remained in use until the 16th century. They were attached to the player' s belt and beaten with a pair of sticks. Draped kettledrums were played primarily in military contexts, for example triumphal marches and processions. Later on they found their way into ensembles and appeared at court festivities and dances.\n\nIn the middle of the 15th century a second wave of kettledrums spread across Europe from the east of the continent. These instruments were the larger timpani.\n\nIn 1457 a legation sent by King Ladislaus of Hungary set off for the court of Charles VII in France. Their horses carried large kettledrums. Instruments of this size had never been seen in Europe before. These loud and booming drums had been played in royal bands in the Middle East since the 12th century, and in Europe they soon advanced together with the trumpets to become the quintessential instrument of the cavalry and a symbol of courtly life and knighthood.\n\n\n\nA pair of kettledrums\n\nDuring the 15th century a number of technical improvements were made to the kettledrum, including a change in the way the vellums were tensioned, the old method of bracing or nailing being gradually replaced by skins lapped on by a hoop. At the beginning of the 16th century kettledrums in German-speaking countries began to be equipped with screws to tension the vellum, which was stretched over a hoop.\n\nThe term timpani and the French word timbales are derived from the Greek word tympanon (Latin: tympanum) which referred to a drum with a skin.\n\nThe power of timpani and trumpets\n\nKettledrums and trumpets came to be used as signaling instruments by the cavalry of the aristocracy, while the serfs and footmen were equipped with side drums and fifes. Kettledrums and trumpets were therefore held in much higher regard as instruments of royalty and the nobility than those of the \"ordinary folk\". Although the invention of gunpowder meant that the kettledrums (and trumpets) lost their role of signalers in battle they nevertheless remained symbols of horsemanship and continued to be the object of further development as art instruments. A form of courtly art emerged which gave rise to playing techniques of extreme virtuosity.\n\nIn keeping with this image, kettledrums came to symbolize the power of monarchs and princes. In 1542, for instance, Henry VIII ordered the purchase of Viennese kettledrums for his court, which were to be played on horseback. Kettledrummers and trumpeters formed their own guilds which enjoyed royal privileges. In 1528 Emperor Charles V granted the Company of Court and Field Trumpeters, which had merged with the Court and Field Kettledrummers, the status of an imperial guild. The kettledrummers, who were obliged to perform other tasks for the prince beside the playing of music and were directly subject to his jurisdiction, were jealous guardians of the secrets of their playing and improvisation techniques, the so-called Schlagmanieren, details of which they passed on only to their successors within the guild. In this way the Kettledrummers' and Trumpeters' Guild, which from time to time found itself facing competition from the Waits' Guild, managed to retain a certain monopoly.\n\nKettledrummers were equal in rank to officers and were dressed in the same way as knights. For many years the granting to a town of the right to keep city trumpeters and kettledrummers was regarded as a privilege.\n\nDuring the course of the 16th century kettledrums were not only played at festivities but began to be used in church music in company with the organ and choirs, especially for trumpet and kettledrum flourishes as a ceremonial glorification in masses. In addition, kettledrums and trumpets appeared more and more frequently as consorts in ballet and stage music (intermedia or interludes), in which they symbolized warlike moods and aristocratic power in keeping with their character. Ensembles consisting of kettledrums and trumpets only remained in existence into the Baroque period. It was not until later, when the power of the guilds was slowly waning, that the kettledrum was accepted as a fully-fledged member of the orchestra.\n\nIn his 1675 opera Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Jean Baptiste Lully became the first composer to use the kettledrum as an orchestral instrument in the modern sense.\n\nThe guilds disbanded between 1810 and 1831. Up to that point it had been customary to play many extra notes (embellishments) that were not actually in the score; these embellishments were part of the Schlagmanieren. It was not until the 19th century that composers began to gain full control of the timpani and took greater interest in the instrument's playing techniques.\n\nScrews, machines and pedals\n\nThe earliest method of changing a kettledrum's tuning was bracing, but in the 16th century tensioning screws were introduced. The vellum was stretched over an iron hoop with eyes; the shell was also equipped with eyes. The corresponding eyes of the hoop and the shell were screwed together with about ten iron screws which altered the skin tension and therefore also the pitch. This tuning mechanism remained widespread into the 19th century. The problem with this method was twofold: on the one hand it was difficult to place the tension evenly on all parts of the vellum, which is vital for the production of a pure tone. On the other hand it took a long time to retune hand-tuned kettledrums. The advantage of the hand-tuned kettledrum was its lightness, which made it easier to transport.\n\nIn about 1812 the Munich court timpanist Gerhard Kramer designed a mechanism that attached all the screws to a master screw so that the skin tension could be altered by means of a single handle or pedal. The machine drum, which made rapid tuning possible, had arrived. Rotary-tuned machine timpani were also developed which were retuned by giving the bowl a turn. The disadvantage of this method was that the spot on the vellum which must be struck to achieve the best sound (beating spot) changed its position.\n\nThe pedal drum was invented in the 1870s by C. Pittrich in Dresden and is now the standard orchestral kettledrum. By operating a pedal, energy is transferred along drawbars, which run up the shell either on the inside or the outside, to the hoop over which the vellum is stretched and alter its tension. A tuning gauge gives a rough indication of the compass and a handle is used for fine-tuning. Since the beginning of the 19th century rapid retuning during playing has been required by composers more and more often. This demand was a result of chromaticization, which began at the turn of the 19th century, and was one that the new pedal drums could meet with ease.\n\nA peaceable role as an orchestral instrument\n\nThe kettledrum established itself in the orchestra during the 17th century (representational music, church music, opera). As a result its mechanical development was dictated increasingly by the need for rapid and accurate retuning.\n\nIn the Baroque era and Classical period it was usual to use hard mallets, sticks with covered heads being used only for tremolo playing. In the works of Purcell, Bach, Handel and their contemporaries the two kettledrums retained the tuning given at the beginning for the duration of the entire work. In the 18th century the bowls had a diameter of between 41 and 62 cm for the smaller drum and 43 and 65 cm for the larger. The difference in size between the pair was relatively small, a ratio of about 4:3, which remains unchanged today.\n\nBeethoven (1770-1827) was the first composer to expand the role of the timpani in the orchestra, which he did in two ways: on the one hand he used tuning intervals other than the fourths or fifths (tonic and dominant) which had hitherto been usual; examples of this are the minor sixth A-F in his 7th symphony and the octave Fs in his 8th and 9th symphonies. On the other hand he entrusted the timpani with rhythmic and thematic tasks (in his violin concerto and his 5th piano concerto). Like his \u201cclassical\u201d colleagues, Beethoven scored the timpani parts with great precision and unobtrusiveness. Kettledrum rolls are used mainly in the build-up to a climax, solo passages are rare and produce remarkable effects.\n\nThe brilliant orchestrator Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) not only revolutionized the art of instrumentation; he was also a pioneer of new roles for percussion instruments. He was the first composer to include instructions in the score about the type of mallet to be used. This gave him great influence over the overall sound, because there is an enormous difference between striking the drum with a stick the head of which is covered by sponge, felt or leather or with one that is made of wood. This precise style of notation was adopted by later composers. In his requiem Grande Messe des Morts, which requires an orchestra of enormous size, Berlioz scored no less than sixteen timpani for ten players (six of whom played a pair, while the other four played one each); in his Symphonie Fantastique four timpanists are required.\n\nIn the course of the 19th century the earlier tasks of the timpani (emphasizing the rhythm, marking the tonic and dominant) changed and it was given new ones in addition.\n\nIn the early 20th century B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (1881-1945) was one of those primarily responsible for extending the role of percussion instruments in the symphony orchestra and in chamber music. In particular he increased the timpani's range of playing techniques, requiring them to perform bass lines at a fast tempo (Concerto for Orchestra, 1944) and pedal glissandos (Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, 1937).\n\nTimpani sizes\n\nTimpani and their diameters\n\nD bass kettledrum : 76 cm\n\n: 76 cm F kettledrum : 73,5 cm (29 in.)\n\n: 73,5 cm (29 in.) A kettledrum (or G, large kettledrum) : 66-71 cm (26 in.)\n\n: 66-71 cm (26 in.) D kettledrum (or C, small kettledrum) : 58,5-64 cm (23 in.)\n\n: 58,5-64 cm (23 in.) E kettledrum : 53 cm (21 in.)\n\n: 53 cm (21 in.) A kettledrum (piccolo kettledrum): 52 cm\n\nConstruction\n\nBowl\n\nThe largest part of the kettledrum is the bowl, or pan, which is made of sheet copper. Its shape ranges from hemispherical to funnel-shaped, depending on the period it dates from, its size and the acoustic demands made on it - large kettledrums have a deeper bowl. The bowl is the resonator.\n\nThe open top of the bowl is covered by calf or goat skin stretched across a counterhoop. The counterhoop is joined to the bowl by a pull ring; the skin tension can be altered by means of a screw mechanism which presses the pull ring against the vellum. On the underside of the shell there is a small aperture; this does not serve to project the sound but to maintain even air pressure inside the bowl. A closed bowl would hinder the free vibration of the vellum after it had been struck.\n\nThe bowl is mounted on an iron stand which rests on a heavy metal base. The iron bars do not touch the bowl so as not to damp its vibrations.\n\nVellum\n\nThe most sensitive part of the timpani is the vellum, an evenly-surfaced calf skin which has been smoothed during production with a scraper or pumice-stone. To attain a pure tone it is vital that the skin tension is absolutely even over its entire surface. In addition, the vellum is very sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity; during a concert or an opera the instrument's tuning must be checked several times because the change in temperature and humidity caused by the audience quickly affects the vellum and therefore the pitch. A high level of humidity slackens the vellum. Since the middle of the 20th century plastic skins have also been used, and these have the advantage of being impervious to changes in the atmospheric conditions.\n\nTuning pedal\n\nModern timpani are tuned with a tuning pedal which operates the pull rings by way of rods on the outside (and occasionally on the inside) of the shell. Activating the pedal increases the tension of the vellum, which raises the pitch. In this way a kettledrum's pitch can be altered by as much as a sixth. The purest tone is produced in the middle of the compass. A tuning gauge with a scale of pitches is mounted on the rim and is used as a rough check on the tuning. For fine-tuning, which is done with a handle, the so-called fine-tuning handle, the timpanist must rely on his own exceptionally sensitive sense of hearing.\n\nMallets\n\nTimpanists use a variety of sticks, or mallets, which have different head sizes, coverings, weights and handle lengths. Each particular mallet produces a different sound. Mallets can be divided into roughly five categories:\n\nMallets with a wood or cork head which is covered by felt of varying thickness. These heads result in hard, medium hard and soft mallets. In addition, special wood mallets and flannel sticks are used. Wood mallets, which were widespread in the Baroque era, are nowadays regarded as a separate category.\n\n\n\nTimpani mallets, from soft to hard.\n\nHandle:\n\nAsh, tonkin, ebony, cherrywood, beech\n\nLength:\n\n30-35 cm (felt head)\n\n30-32 cm (flannel head)\n\nHead:\n\nWood (hard), cork (soft), flannel, hard felt\n\n2.5-4.5 cm (felt head)\n\n2.5-5 cm (flannel head)\n\nCovering:\n\nSoft felt of various hardness, leather\n\nNotation\n\nModern-day notation\n\nNon-transposing, always in bass clef.\n\nDetailed and precise notation of the dynamic behavior of the timpani part is recommended due to the instrument's enormous dynamic range. It must also always be borne in mind that the timpani can drown out other instruments.\n\nSince the middle of the 19th century instructions as to the type of mallet to be used have become increasingly common in scores. In the 20th century changes of mallet began to be precisely indicated by individual symbols. This system applies not only to the timpani but to all the other percussion instruments as well.\n\nHistorical notation\n\nUntil about 1800 timpani were transposing instruments. The notes were notated in bass clef as C and G with no accidentals, regardless of the key the piece was in. At the beginning of the score the actual sounded notes of the timpani were written: timpani in C and G, Bb and F, D and A.\n\nThis made sense for as long as the timpani only played the tonic and the dominant; it was also the reason for which the large kettledrum was also called the G drum while the small one was known as the C drum. When other notes began to be demanded - from Beethoven - composers began notating the actual pitch.\n\nRange\n\nA kettledrum has a range of about a sixth.\n\nA timpani group composed of several instruments covers approximately three octaves.\n\nThe purest tone is produced in the middle of a kettledrum's compass. Very high notes sound too strained and too thin, very low notes sound too \u201cwoolly\u201d and weak. For this reason timpanists allocate the pitches demanded in the score to the available drums in such a way that the pitch each drum plays is in the middle of its compass.\n\nD kettledrum (bass kettledrum: 75-80 cm): C2, D2 - H2, C3\n\n(bass kettledrum: 75-80 cm): C2, D2 - H2, C3 G kettledrum (large kettledrum: 65-70cm): E2, F2 - D3, E3\n\n(large kettledrum: 65-70cm): E2, F2 - D3, E3 C kettledrum (small kettledrum: 60-65cm): Ab2, Bb2 - G3, Ab3\n\n(small kettledrum: 60-65cm): Ab2, Bb2 - G3, Ab3 F kettledrum (high kettledrum: 55-60 cm): C3 - G#3\n\n(high kettledrum: 55-60 cm): C3 - G#3 A kettledrum (high kettledrum: 50-60 cm): C3, D3 - Bb3, C#4\n\n(high kettledrum: 50-60 cm): C3, D3 - Bb3, C#4 B kettledrum (45-50 cm): G3 - C4\n\nThe range of historical (baroque, classical) timpani was limited solely to the octave F2 to F3.\n\nThis meant that certain keys could not be played in the instruments' usual tuning - low drum = dominant, high drum = tonic. In such instances the usual tuning was reversed: low drum = tonic, high drum = dominant (e.g. A major).\n\nSound production\n\nGerman layout\n\nPair of timpani\n\nThe drums are placed in front of the timpanist, the higher one (small bowl, C or D drum) on his left, the lower (large bowl, G or A drum) on his right.\n\n4 timpani\n\nThe same principle applies as to the pair: the highest drum (smallest bowl) is placed on the extreme left, the lowest on the extreme right. The timpani form a semicircle in front of the musician.\n\nThis arrangement does not correspond to the sequence of notes on the piano.\n\nAmerican layout\n\nPair of timpani\n\nThe drums are placed in front of the timpanist, the lower one (large bowl, G or A drum) on his left, the higher (small bowl, C or D drum) on his right.\n\n4 timpani\n\nThe same principle applies as to the pair: the lowest drum (largest bowl) is placed on the extreme left, the highest on the extreme right. The timpani form a semicircle in front of the musician.\n\nThis arrangement corresponds to the sequence of notes on the piano.\n\nThe use of timpani in the modern-day orchestra is dependent on the work being performed: either the classic pair is used or four timpani. In works from the Romantic literature it has become standard to use four timpani.\n\nA timpanist can play a set of six or seven drums at the most. This is not usual, however, and is only asked for in 20th century solo works (and then very rarely).\n\nDrumming techniques\n\nThe drumstick rebounds after every beat. This bounce is exploited for rapid repetitions and rolls.\n\nThe \u201cstriking spot\u201d is the mysterious part of the skin that produces the purest tone. It is a hand-width from the rim. Strokes on the middle of the skin (\u201csecond striking spot\u201d) do not produce a clear pitch; they sound like a drum and are only asked for in more modern music.\n\nThe marked resonance is generally damped with the fingertips.\n\nModern tuning techniques\n\nIn contemporary orchestras pedal timpani are used. Rapid retuning is possible by means of a gauged pedal, the pitches are shown as a scale on the tuning gauge on the upper rim of the shell. The range, i.e. the relation between the used scale of pitches and the tuning, must be set with the fine-tuner before playing.\n\nOn a pedal drum roughly half an octave can be played as a scale (maximum range: a major sixth). Up to a tempo of quarter note = 150 a new step of the scale can be played every quarter note. Scales or parts of scales are played on one kettledrum - the sound is more consistent. The wider the interval the longer it takes to retune.\n\nDuring a performance timpanists must retune unobtrusively in the background; this is done while the timpani are pausing (usually, (-;).\n\nHistorical tuning techniques\n\nThe traditional hand-tuned kettledrums, a few of which could still be found in orchestras in the 1950s, were tuned with six or eight screws which all had to be turned the same distance. This was relatively time-consuming and the timpanist needed at least eight bars' rest for it. Fortunately for the timpanists, works of the Classical era hardly ever required retuning during a piece. When from the Romantic period onward this began to be demanded the machine drum and later the pedal drum were invented, which made it possible to retune fairly quickly. In addition, the number of timpani used in the orchestra increased from two to three from the middle of the 19th century.\n\nPlaying Techniques\n\nSingle stroke\n\nRapid scales are not usual due to the marked resonance.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nCoperto\n\nIn the past the vellum was covered by a piece of flannel and struck. Nowadays a piece of felt is placed on the skin. This reduces resonance and produces a dry tone.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nSecco\n\nDry-sounding single stroke, immediately damped.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nWith the hand\n\nThe head is beaten by the fingers.\n\nRepetitions\n\nHand to hand strokes.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nAlternating striking spot\n\nThe head is struck alternately on the striking spot and in the middle or near the rim.\n\nCross beat\n\nThe right hand crosses the left, or vice versa: either right over left or left over right. Nowadays this technique is only used if it cannot be avoided\n\nDouble cross beat\n\nHistorical technique: both hands cross alternately, right over left and left over right. This old technique was used primarily for show and is no longer usual.\n\nGrace notes\n\nOne or more lightly struck auxiliary notes before the principal note. The grace notes can either have the same pitch as the principal note or a different one. If they have a different pitch they are played on a different kettledrum from the principal note.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nMultiple strokes\n\nSimultaneous strokes with two sticks on one or two timpani. It is even possible to play single strokes on four timpani with four sticks - two in each hand.\n\nTwo sticks in unison on one drum\n\nTo achieve striking fortissimo effects the vellum is struck with both sticks simultaneously. Strokes with both sticks in unison are used to achieve a higher dynamic level (e.g. in Gustav Mahler).\n\nParadiddle\n\nEven length stroke, the same pitch being struck once or twice on two timpani in succession. Effective American drumming technique.\n\nRolls\n\nNowadays notated as a tremolo at one pitch (= two sticks on one kettledrum) or one after the other or as a chord consisting of two pitches. Either as sixteenths (measured) or thirty-seconds (unmeasured). Before the 20th century the roll was indicated by the trill sign. Timpani rolls can last some considerable time (e.g. in Beethoven).\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nRolls with dynamics\n\nRolls with changing dynamics.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nDouble roll\n\nA roll performed by one player on two timpani.\n\nTransition roll\n\nThe roll moves as smoothly as possible from one kettledrum to the next; no break should be discernible.\n\nCut-off stroke\n\nThe stroke that ends a roll. It is usually sharply accented and often sounds together with the final note of an orchestral piece, for which reason its resonance must be damped with the hand.\n\nResonance glissando\n\nThe glissando effect is achieved by operating the pedal shortly after the note has been struck, in other words, while the note is still ringing. This glissando is very effective rising, but rather weak falling. This is a solo effect, as it is barely audible in tutti passages. It can only be played on pedal drums.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nGlissando roll\n\nThe glissando effect is achieved by operating the pedal during the roll. It is possible at any volume and both upward and downward. Glissando can only be played on pedal drums.\n\nLegend of sticks\n\nTimpani sticks:\n\nsoft medium hard wooden\n\nSound characteristics\n\nDull, thunderous, booming, deep, heavy, powerful, mellow, velvety, substantial, resonant, round, rumbling, dead, dry, hollow.\n\nDue to its great dynamic range the timpani part must be precisely planned and regulated and carefully balanced with its partner instruments. This exactitude must be reflected in the notation. Although when played piano and mezzoforte timpani allow other instruments to the fore, it is very easy for them to drown them out in forte and fortissimo passages.\n\nBasically the timpani sound is composed of two elements, the attack and the resonance. The resonance of a mf tone lasts about 4-5 seconds on the large drum and 3-4 seconds on the small one.\n\nThe timbre is determined by three factors: what the mallets are made of, where the head is struck and how hard the head is struck.\n\nHow the mallets influence the sound\n\nA mallet with a small head stimulates the higher harmonics (which are inharmonic on timpani): the sound is brighter and more incisive. Wood drumsticks produce the same effect.\n\nA mallet with a broad head stimulates the deeper harmonics: the pitch appears more definite (the first six partials are relatively harmonic), and the timbre becomes darker.\n\nIn funeral music muffled mallets are used.\n\nThe sound produced from different parts of the vellum\n\nIdeally the vellum should be struck at a point a hand-width from the rim. This guarantees that the pitch remains clearly defined even in low tunings in which the pitch otherwise tends to lose clarity.\n\nIn general, the number of higher (inharmonic) partials decreases toward the middle the vellum, while striking the head on the rim stimulates them. The closer to the middle the vellum is struck the less definite the pitch becomes. If struck in the middle, the timpani sound like a drum.\n\nSound combinations\n\nPlayed in unison and in unison with additional octave doubling with the bass instruments of the other instrument groups (bassoon, bass clarinet, cello, double-bass, bass trombone and bass tuba) the timpani produce a fairly homogeneous blend. A blend between the timpani and the rest of the orchestra is created.\n\nIf the timpani double an octave on their own (above or below, without any other instrument) their sound becomes more individual.\n\nTimpani + brass instruments\n\nTimpani + trumpets\n\nTimpani and trumpets form a pairing rooted in history; the significance of their sound and symbolism lies in the tonal development of magnificence: the timpani form a powerful base upon which stirring trumpet fanfares resound. There is no tonal blend between the two instruments, their sounds complement each other to marvelous effect. In pieces from the Classical period the timpani's tonic-dominant foundation is doubled by the trumpets one and two octaves higher - often in climaxes - so that a solid pillar of sound over three octaves results.\n\nTimpani + horns\n\nThe horn - the orchestral instrument that blends with all the instrument groups in the orchestra better than any other instrument - plays the typical cadences in pieces from the Classical period along with the timpani and the trumpets. The horns play the notes of the tonic and dominant triads in parallel thirds and sixths - about an octave higher than the timpani, while the timpani play the root notes which are usually doubled in two octaves by the trumpets.\n\nThe horns can also double the timpani in unison, in which case the first horns play in unison with the timpani, while the second horns play an octave higher. This results in an excellent blend.\n\nIf the horns play an octave above the timpani without playing in unison the higher voice is the principal voice and the lower voice (timpani) reinforces its sound.\n\nTimpani + trombones\n\nOften play in unison. Timpani rolls played piano which are doubled by long trombone notes played in unison are very effective.\n\nTimpani + tuba\n\nSome parts of the tuba's timbre are absorbed by the sound of the timpani. The tuba often plays an octave below the timpani. The effect of this is dark and powerful.\n\nTimpani + woodwinds\n\nAll the sound combinations with the woodwinds develop best in piano passages.\n\nTimpani + flutes, oboes\n\nThe sounds of these instruments are very distinct from one another.\n\nTimpani + bass clarinet\n\nProduce a melancholy effect played in unison. Part of the bass clarinet's timbre is swallowed by the timpani.\n\nTimpani + bassoon, contrabassoon\n\nThe bassoon often plays in unison with the timpani, the contrabassoon an octave lower. The mellow overall sound that results is rich in overtones and develops best when played piano.\n\nTimpani + strings\n\nThe strings' tremolo chords, played over a foundation of timpani rolls, are tremendously dramatic and one of this combination's most thrilling effects. String tremolos coupled with timpani rolls are well suited for dynamic shifts - crescendo and decrescendo.\n\nThe timpani roll together with a bowed tremolo played fortissimo provides a vibrant mass of sound in tutti passages.\n\nTimpani + cello\n\nOften play in unison. Both single strokes and tremolos together with the cellos are a common sound combination. The necessary resonance is provided by the double-basses an octave lower.\n\nTimpani + double-bass\n\nThe double-basses complement the timpani an octave below them; the timpani are the principal voice. Usually the cello also plays in unison with the timpani at the same time. The double-basses' pizzicato an octave below gives the timpani additional resonance.\n\nTimpani + harp\n\nPlayed pianissimo or piano and in unison these instruments produce a good effect. Timpani, harps and pizzicato strings lend each other additional resonance.\n\nRepertoire (selection)\n\nSolo timpani\n\nElliott Carter Recitative and Improvisation (1966)\n\n\n\nChamber and ensemble music\n\nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k : Sonata for 2 pianos and percussion (1938)\n\n:\n\nConcertos for timpani and orchestra\n\nFrancis Poulenc Concerto for organ, strings, and timpani (1939)\n\nWerner Th\u00e4richen Concerto for timpani and orchestra (1954)\n\n\n\nOrchestral timpani"}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timpani", "page_content": "Timpani (sometimes called kettle drums) are drums that are made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper shaped by craftsmen, which after being tuned, have a skin-like material stretched over the top. This material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin, but modern drums use a synthetic material. This top section is known as the \"drumhead\". Timpani is an Italian word. It is also a plural of the word timpano. However timpano is rarely used in informal English. More often, a timpano is referred to as a drum, a timpani, or simply a timp. Someone who plays a timpani is called a \"timpanist\".\n\nDifference from other drums [ change | change source ]\n\nTimpani are different from other drums because they are tuned to certain musical notes. A timpanist will often describe the drum as being \"in voice\" (or out of voice, as the case may be) when it is correctly tuned. To play it, it is hit with a special drumstick or \"timpani mallet\". Other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note, and are not tuned. A player normally sits with a group of two, three or four timpani around him, which is why the name timpani is in the plural.\n\nBrief history [ change | change source ]\n\nTimpani were originally used in official bands. They can still be seen in the bands of the modern official as in the Household Cavalry of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, in which the \"kettle drums\" (as they are called) are carried by large drumhorses. (See picture below) In the 1700s timpani became popular in orchestral music, and can be heard in the music of Handel, Beethoven and other 19th century composers wrote music that needed the timpani. Nowadays all large orchestras have timpani, and some bands that play popular music use them as well.\n\nDifferent ways timpani can be made [ change | change source ]\n\nA basic timpano timpani.\n\nThe drumhead [ change | change source ]\n\nA timpani drumhead, also called a timpani head, can be made out of two different things. Some are made out of animal skin, like calfskin or goatskin. Other ones can be made out of thick plastic. Because plastic heads are hard to break and do not cost as much as animal skin heads, they are used more often than animal skin heads. However, a lot of professional players prefer skin heads because they think that skin heads make a better sound when they are hit. The drumhead is stretched over the bowl of the timpani and held on by screws for tuning the timpani.\n\nA chain timpani.\n\nTuning the timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nThe screws that hold and tune the drumhead are called \"tension rods\". To tune the timpani, the \"tension rods\" can all be tightened or loosened. The timpani makes a higher sound if the tension rods are made tighter, and a lower sound if they are loosened. There are usually around seven tension rods on the timpani.[1]\n\nMachine timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nTuning a timpani by turning every tension rod by itself can be very hard, so some timpani makers invented different ways to change the drum's pitch more quickly.[2]\n\nChain timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nIn a chain timpani, the tension rods are all attached to a chain. This chain is hooked up to a lever, and when a player moves the lever back and forth, it tightens and loosens all the screws at the same time to change the pitch of the drum.[1]\n\nratchet clutch system. A pedal on a pedal timpani with asystem.\n\nPedal timpani [ change | change source ]\n\nA pedal timpani is a timpani that uses a pedal to change its pitch. It is the kind of timpani that is used the most today. A player can push on the pedal to make the timpani play higher notes, or let the pedal come back up to play lower notes.[1] There are three different kinds of pedal timpani:\n\nIn a ratchet clutch system a player must pull back a lever called a clutch to release the pedal. Once the pedal is in the spot where the player wants it, they must push the clutch forward with their foot again to lock it in place.\n\nsystem a player must pull back a lever called a to release the pedal. Once the pedal is in the spot where the player wants it, they must push the clutch forward with their foot again to lock it in place. A balanced action system uses a spring that is attached to the pedal, which keeps the pedal in one spot until it is moved by a player. Since the pedal is not held in one spot by a clutch in a balanced action system, some people call it a floating pedal because it looks like the pedal is not held on by anything and is floating.\n\nuses a spring that is attached to the pedal, which keeps the pedal in one spot until it is moved by a player. Since the pedal is not held in one spot by a clutch in a balanced action system, some people call it a because it looks like the pedal is not held on by anything and is floating. In a friction clutch system, the pedal is held in one spot by a clutch, and the clutch is attached to a pole. When a player releases the clutch, the pole moves up and down as the pedal is pushed up and down.\n\nTimpani mallets [ change | change source ]\n\nA set of timpani mallets.\n\nTimpani are played with a special kind of drumstick called timpani mallets. A player uses two mallets at a time when they play the drum. The two parts of the mallet are called the shaft and the head. The head is the part of the mallet that is shaped like a circle, and is the part that hits the timpani, and the shaft is the wooden part of the mallet that is held by a timpanist. A timpani mallet's head can be made out of many things, but is usually made out of a wood sphere that is covered with felt or a thin cloth. The shaft of the mallet is usually made out of wood, like hickory, cherry, or bamboo, but can also be made out of metal, like aluminum. Some timpani mallets do not have a felt head, and just have a wooden one. These mallets are sometimes used in classical and baroque music.[3][4]\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, some mallets had shafts made out of whale bones and heads made out of sponges.[5]\n\nWith a pedal timpani, a player can produce different sound effects using the pedals. Performing glissando on timpani demands switching the pedals. Glissando is generated by pressing the pedal during the vertebra. Furthermore it is possible to play glissando at any volume level up or down. For example, Alexander Rahbari, an outstanding Iranian-Austrian composer used glissando effect produced by switching timpani pedals in the opening of his piece, Persian Mysticism Around G, where the player moves from Bb up to C and then rolling down to G(see the timpani part on right below).[6]\n\nRelated pages [ change | change source ]\n\nOther websites [ change | change source ]"}, {"url": "https://wtt.pauken.org/chapter-1/frequency-pitch-and-tone-colour", "page_content": "Complex tones, or composite waveforms (harmonic and non-harmonic), consist of many sine waves of different frequency added together. These individual sine waves are called frequencies components. What are consider to be musical sounds generally don\u2019t have just one or two frequency components. Sounds that have only a few frequency components are not at all interesting or pleasing to listen to. They have no musical colour or timbre. Conversely, sounds that have too many frequency components, like the sound of a strong windstorm with rain, may be interesting and even pleasant to listen to but, these sounds don\u2019t have a particular pitch so they usually aren\u2019t considered musical \u201cnotes.\u201d\n\nWhen someone sings a note or plays a note on an instrument, a very particular set of frequencies is heard. Visualize each note that is sung or that is played on an instrument as a smooth mixture of many different pitches as shown above. These different pitches are called overtones or partials and are preferably harmonic as described above, but they can be either harmonic or non-harmonic. The human auditory system generally blends them together so well that you do not hear them as separate notes at all. Instead, the overtones or partials give the note its color or timbre. Notes that have many non-harmonic overtones are said to create inharmonicity.\n\nIn music, inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of the overtones of a fundamental differ from whole-number (integer) multiples of the fundamental\u2019s frequency. These inharmonic (non-harmonic) overtones are often distinguished from harmonic overtones (whole-number multiples) by calling them partials, though partial may also be used to refer to both. Whether we hear a sound as pitched or unpitched depends partly on the overtones of that sound. The more inharmonic a sound is, the less definite it becomes in pitch. Many percussion instruments such as cymbals, tam-tams, and drums create complex composite waveforms that are inharmonic sounds but yet they add a peculiar or colorful amount of inharmonicity or harmonic distortion to music, which is found to be palatable to the ear. Conversely, most modern professional-quality wind, brass and string instruments are designed to limit inharmonicity as much as possible in order to bring harmonicity to music. In the hands of a master, timpani can bridge the gap and provide both.\n\nIf an oboe plays a middle C (C4 261.63 Hz) and then a clarinet plays the same note at the same loudness as the oboe, it is still easy to tell the two notes apart, because an oboe sounds different from a clarinet. This difference in the sound of the two instruments is the colour, or timbre, of the notes, which is based on each instrument\u2019s own unique harmonic recipe. A note\u2019s harmonic recipe is its number of overtones or partials (harmonic and non-harmonic) and their amplitude proportion relative to the fundamental. Along with their individual attack characteristics, it is these overtones (harmonic and non-harmonic) that give instruments their tone colour and without them, we could not tell one instrument from another.\n\n\n\nThe chart below graphs the first sixteen harmonic partials (with amplitude proportions) of a clarinet and oboe playing same pitch or frequency. The clarinet projects a strong fundamental and mostly odd harmonics while the oboe projects a strong fourth, fifth and sixth partial and a relatively weak or non-existent fundamental.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://merelymusic.com/timpani-ranges/", "page_content": "If you have ever gone to a professional orchestra concert, then you have most likely seen and heard the instruments called the \u201ctimpani.\u201d Also known as \u201ckettle drums,\u201d timpani are also widely taught along with other band and orchestra instruments in music classes during middle school and high school.\n\nTimpani Sizes and Configurations\n\nTimpani come in different sizes. The general standard for timpani sizes and usage are a 4-drum configuration in graduated sizes as follows: 32\u201d, 29\u201d, 26\u201d, and 23\u201d. There are times when a fifth drum is needed. When that happens, there is the option of adding either a 20\u201d or 21\u201d drum. Which size gets added is generally a preferential decision made by the percussionist.\n\nThis decision is made slightly easier because the 21\u201d timpano is not very common in the US and is typically only used by professional orchestras that already own one. Choosing a 4-timpani configuration or a 5-timpani configuration depends on what the music calls for.\n\nThere are even smaller timpano that can appear for use in professional orchestras, but they are rare because they must be custom-made. They can be found in smaller sizes such as 14\u201d or 15\u201d.\n\nThe Middle Drums (29\u201d and 26\u201d)\n\nFor a long time, students in band or orchestra classes learned to play the timpani with only two drums, the 29\u201d and the 23\u201d drums. One drum would be tuned to the tonic note (first note of the key signature of the piece being played) and the other drum would be tuned to the dominant note (the fifth note of the key signature).\n\nBoth drums are heavy with the 29\u201d timpano weighing approximately 20kg, and the 26\u201d timpano weighing approximately 19kg.\n\nWhile both the 29\u201d and the 23\u201d timpani produce a lovely mid-range tone, problems arose when students were proficient enough to move on to more difficult repertoire but did not have the range needed to perform the repertoire with only these two timpani.\n\nThe solution was to add more timpani. This was done in the late 18th century. The standard configuration for timpani was increased to four drums. Adding more timpani was also beneficial because it expanded the range of repertoire for all timpanist, not just students.\n\nThe Large and Small Drums (32\u201d and 23\u201d)\n\nThe largest and smallest of the standard timpani sizes were the ones added the 4-timpani configuration to give timpanists a larger range of notes. The 32\u201d timpano is the largest that is commonly used.\n\nThis drum weighs in at 21kg and produces a very deep sound that can be played in a range of ways from soft and gently, to loud and bombastic. The smaller 23\u201d timpano has a weight of 18kg and produces a higher tone that is more versatile than the drums with lower tones.\n\nWhat Are the Ranges of the Various Timpani?\n\nThe range of any given timpano can vary depending on the maker, the drumhead, and even the model. Keeping that in mind, one timpano can have a range between the interval of a sixth up to one octave. The chart below shows the tone range for most standard timpani. This link will take you to a short video where you can hear examples of the different ranges of each timpano.\n\nIt is important to note that even though the range of the individual timpano can be wide, the tone and quality of sound produced in each drum remain mostly within the range of a perfect fifth. This next chart shows both the standard range of each drum in whole notes and the range for the best sound quality shown in quarter notes.\n\nTimpani Drumheads\n\nThe tightly stretched surface at the top of the drum is called the \u201ctimpani head\u201d or more frequently the \u201cdrumhead.\u201d Traditionally, drumheads were made from animal hides such as calfskin or goatskin. However, these animal hide drumheads are harder to care for and to maintain. They can also be very affected by temperature and humidity changes.\n\nModern timpani drumheads are created from different plastics and synthetic materials. These drumheads are much easier to care for, can last longer, and in most cases, they are easier to install.\n\nNo matter what type of drumhead is used, it needs to be protected when not in use. Scratches and nicks in the drumhead will affect the sound of the timpano. It is advisable to change drumheads of any type at least every two years.\n\nWhat Is the Collar?\n\nAnother important fact to know is that the specific range of either one timpano or a set of timpani can also depend on something called the \u201ccollar.\u201d Timpani either have an extended collar, or a non-extended collar. These terms refer to the actual head of the drum and how much larger the head is than the diameter of the drum.\n\nA timpano with an extended collar will have a drumhead that is 2\u201d larger than the diameter of the drum. A timpano with a non-extended collar will have a drumhead that is only 1\u201d larger than the diameter of the drum. The size of the drumhead can alter the pitches that the timpano will produce. The chart below shows the different tuning ranges between the two types of collars.\n\nExtended Collar Timpani Range\n\nNon-Extended Collar Timpani Range\n\nTuning the Timpani\n\nTimpani are considered pitched percussion instruments that are part of the membranophone family. This means that each timpano is tuned to produce notes that have a specific pitch. A membranophone is any type of instrument that produces sound through a stretched and vibrating membrane.\n\nAs a timpanist, knowing how to correctly tune the timpani is very important. The timpani produce the lowest sounding tones in an ensemble such as an orchestra. Those low notes build the foundation for all the other sounds to build on top of. Because of this, it is imperative that the timpani be perfectly tuned.\n\nTimpani are tuned by either loosening or tightening the drumhead. In modern instruments, this is done by using a pedal that is located at the base of the instrument. When the pedal is pressed down, the drumhead is tightened. This causes the pitch of the timpani to be raised. When the pedal is let up, the drumhead is loosened. This lowers the pitch.\n\nOn most modern timpani, there is a mechanical gauge that shows the tension of the drumhead. While this is helpful and theoretically supposed to indicate the note the timpano is tuned to, there are many things that can alter the tuning and pitch of each drum.\n\nThe three most common culprits are environmental factors, and temperature changes, and movement of the instrument. Changes like these often alter the tension of the drumheads.\n\nThere is a great deal of music that calls for the timpani to have \u201cfixed notes\u201d which are set before the performance and are not changed. However, there is also a great amount of music \u2013 much of it more modern \u2013 that requires the timpanist to change the tuning of each drum during performances. This is one of the reasons that beginning timpanists must learn to tune and practice tuning from the beginning.\n\nChanging the Sound of the Timpani\n\nThe timpani are incredibly versatile instruments and there are many ways to change the sounds that they produce. This is most often accomplished with different expressive techniques such as persistent rhythms, drum rolls, various types of expressive stresses, crescendos, and decrescendos.\n\nThere are also a variety of ways to change the sound of the timpani by placing a hand or finger on the drumhead, creating a glissando effect by using the tuning pedal or placing other objects on the drumhead that will cause different types of vibrations when the drumhead is struck.\n\nIt is also possible to alter the sound of the timpani in many ways just by changing the type and size of mallets that are used to strike the timpani. There are two main types of mallets. Both types have a metal, synthetic, or hardwood handle (or shaft) with a core on the end made of cork, felt, or sometimes wood.\n\nThe ball stick mallet then has layers of soft material such as felt covering the core. The layers are sewn on to the core in a bag or purse shape that covers the core without leaving any seams. This allows the mallet to produce a softer tone.\n\nThe cartwheel mallet is covered with layers of harder felt or other types of a harder material. These layers are sewn onto the core in strips that do create seams.\n\nThis, along with the harder material creates a harder mallet that will produce a very different type of sound than a ball stick mallet. The range of soft to hard mallets and everything in between is quite vast. This link goes to a short video that shows the differences between some types of mallets."}, {"url": "https://wtt.pauken.org/chapter-3/the-bowl", "page_content": "The function of the bowl in the acoustical performance of timpani has been a subject of contention and a matter of intense debate among scientists and musicians for many years (Rayliegh 1879; Richardson 1929; Kirby 1930; Wood 1962; Taylor 1964; Benade 1976; Rossing et al. 1982), and both musicians and scientists have advanced plausible theories without any real scientific justification (Wood 1962; Taylor 1964).42 The misinformation and misconceptions are still being promulgated by many performers and educators in texts, lexicons and method books today (Taylor 1964; Peters 1993; Leonard 2000; Beck 2013).43 44 45 46\n\nErroneous information about bowl shape and the\n\npath of the sound-wave by English timpanist Henry W. Taylor 43\n\nThere still remains a general belief among many timpanists that the shape of the bowl directs the path of the sound waves affecting the tonal characteristics of the drum. The shape of the bowl contributes to the harmonicity and color of the pitch only with respect to how the geometry of the bowl determines the volume of air the bowl can contain. Numerous scientific studies conducted by Thomas D. Rossing et al., as well as Helmut Fleischer, Hugo Fastl and associates have proven that the actual shape of a timpano bowl is quite unimportant in determining its intrinsic sound. As long as the volume of air enclosed inside of the bowl is kept in the correct range for the diameter and mass of the head, cambered, hemispheric or parabolic shaped bowls, which have the same volume, will have the same effect with respect to how the drum produces its pitch. The correct volume of air for the diameter and tension/mass of the head helps to suppress the inharmonic fundamental (and its associated modes of vibration) allowing the more harmonic (pitch producing) modes to be heard. The volume of air enclosed in the bowl also acts as a restoring force trying to return the head to a stationary position. This enclosed volume of air has resonances of its own that can interact with modes of the vibrating membrane that have similar shapes. The size and shape of the bowl simply determine its volume. This volume of air and the motion of its associate resonant air modes help to fine tune the upper partials.\n\nAnother popular misconception about timpani is that the bowls serve as sound chambers or acoustic air cavity resonating chambers (Helmholtz resonator) like the body of a guitar or violin or a marimba resonator, which resonate or amplify the sound. They do not. Since the volume of air enclosed with in the bowl remains the same over the entire range of the drum, any true acoustic resonance would be limited to only a small range of the instrument; in fact, the frequencies of the various modes of enclosed air are much higher than that of the actual principal tone of the vibrating membrane so any acoustic resonance would affect the higher (less audible) partials only (Rossing).\n\nThe bowl is however, a very important system modifier. The primary function of a timpano bowl is to act as a baffled radiator, separating the top of the head from the bottom of the head so that the radiated energy from the top and bottom surfaces cannot interact and cancel each other. The presence of the bowl turns the drum into a monopole source. Low frequencies from a monopole source radiate well in all directions. The radiation of the low frequency sound energy gives the impression that the bowl is amplifying or resonating the sound, hence the popular misconception that the bowl is resonating the sound of the vibrating head.\n\n\n\nModal radiation pattern mode 2,1 with a baffle 39\n\nIt is true that mechanical resonances from the bowl and frame exist, but they have been shown to not enhance the pitch to any significant degree (Fleischer & Fastl). If they do, it is completely serendipitous. In fact, these unintended hyper-resonances have been shown, more often than not, to actually detract from the sustain of the preferred modes. Be that as it may, one cannot deny the timpanist the pleasure of indulging in the beauty of sound produced by the various and sundry vibrations of his or her own instruments, no matter what they hear vibrating. It all adds to the mystique of the instrument.\n\nThe following chapters investigate popular beliefs and misconceptions about timpani bowls.\n\n<<Previous \u2013 Next>>"}, {"url": "https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-musicappreciationtheory/chapter/percussion/", "page_content": "Introduction\n\nA percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater (including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles); struck, scraped or rubbed by hand; or struck against another similar instrument. The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments, following the human voice.\n\nThe percussion section of an orchestra most commonly contains instruments such as timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle and tambourine. However, the section can also contain non-percussive instruments, such as whistles and sirens, or a blown conch shell. On the other hand, keyboard instruments, such as the celesta, are not normally part of the percussion section, but keyboard percussion instruments such as the glockenspiel and xylophone (which do not have piano keyboards) are included.\n\nPercussion instruments are most commonly divided into two categories: pitched percussion instruments, which produce notes with an identifiable pitch, and unpitched percussion instruments, which produce notes or sounds without an identifiable pitch.\n\nPercussion is commonly referred to as \u201cthe backbone\u201d or \u201cthe heartbeat\u201d of a musical ensemble, often working in close collaboration with bass instruments, when present. In jazz and other popular music ensembles, the pianist, bassist, drummer and sometimes the guitarist are referred to as the rhythm section. Most classical pieces written for full orchestra since the time of Haydn and Mozart are orchestrated to place emphasis on the strings, woodwinds, and brass. However, often at least one pair of timpani is included, though they rarely play continuously. Rather, they serve to provide additional accents when needed. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, other percussion instruments (like the triangle or cymbals) have been used, again generally sparingly. The use of percussion instruments became more frequent in the twentieth-century classical music.\n\nTimpani\n\nTimpani, or kettledrums, are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the eighteenth century. Today, they are used in many types of musical ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras, and even in some rock.\n\nThe basic timpani drum consists of a drumhead stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass and sometimes aluminum. In the Sachs\u2013Hornbostel classification, the timpani are thus considered membranophones. The drumhead is affixed to a hoop (also called a fleshhoop), which in turn is held onto the bowl by a counterhoop,which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called tension rods placed regularly around the circumference. The head\u2019s tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.\n\nThe shape of the bowl contributes to the quality of the drum. For example, hemispheric bowls produce brighter tones while parabolic bowls produce darker tones. Another factor that affects the timbre of the drum is the quality of the bowl\u2019s surface. Copper bowls may have a smooth, machined surface or a rough surface with many small dents hammered into it.\n\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from about 84 centimeters (33 inches) in diameter down to piccoli timpani of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or less. A 33-inch drum can produce the C below the bass clef, and specialty piccoli timpani can play up into the treble clef. In Darius Milhaud\u2019s 1923 ballet score La cr\u00e9ation du monde, the timpanist must play the F sharp at the bottom of the treble clef. Each individual drum typically has a range of a perfect fifth.\n\nListen: Timpani Please listen to the timpani\u2019s role in Carmina Burana, Part 1, as played by the Raleigh Symphony Orchestra.\n\nBass Drum\n\nBass drums are percussion instruments which vary in size and are used in several musical genres. Three major types of bass drums are as follows:\n\nThe type usually seen or heard in orchestral, ensemble or concert band music is the orchestral, or concert bass drum (in Italian: gran cassa, gran tamburo). It is the largest drum of the orchestra.\n\nThe kick drum, struck with a beater attached to a pedal, usually seen on drum kits.\n\nThe pitched bass drum, generally used in marching bands and drum corps. This is tuned to a specific pitch and is usually played in a set of three to six drums.\n\nA bass drum is typically cylindrical with the diameter much greater than the height. There is normally a struck head at both ends of the cylinder. The heads may be made of calf skin or plastic. There is normally a means of adjusting the tension either by threaded taps or by strings. Bass drums are built in a variety of sizes, but size has little to do with the volume produced by the drum. The size chosen being based on convenience and aesthetics.\n\nListen: Bass Drum In the following video, Kristen Shiner McGuire gives an introduction to the concert bass drum.\n\nSnare Drum\n\nThe snare drum or side drum is a ubiquitous percussion instrument known for its cylindrical shape and powerful, staccato sound. Snare drums are often used in orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, parades, drum lines, drum corps, and more. The snare is also one of the central pieces in a trap set, a collection of percussion instruments designed to be played by a seated drummer, which is used in many popular genres of music. Snare drums are typically played with drum sticks, although there are other options for a completely different sound, such as the brush.\n\nThe snare drum originated from the Tabor drum, which was originally used to accompany the flute. It has evolved into more modern versions including the kit snare, marching snare, and the piccolo snare. Each type presents a different dimension and style of percussion. The snare drum that someone might see in a concert is typically used with a backbeat style to create rhythm. In marching bands it can do the same technique but it is mostly used for a front beat.\n\nIn comparison with the marching snare, the kit snare is typically smaller in length between the two heads, while the piccolo is the smallest of the three. The snare drum is known for its loud crack when a person strikes it with a drum stick or mallet. The depth of the sound varies from snare to snare because of the different techniques and construction qualities of the drum. Some of these qualities include tightness of the head, dimensions, and brand.\n\nThe snare drum is constructed of two heads\u2014both typically made of plastic\u2014along with a rattle of metal wires on the bottom head called the snares. The wires can also be placed on the top, just like on the Tarol Snare. The top head is typically called the batter head because that is where the drummer strikes it, while the bottom head is called the snare head because that is where the snares are located. Tension of the drum heads is held constant through the tension rods. The ability to tighten them provides an opportunity to differ the sound of the hit. The strainer is a lever that releases and tightens the snare. If the strainer is relaxed, the sound of the snare is more like that of a tom because the snares are not present. The rim is the metal ring around the batter head, which can be used for a variety of things, although it is notably used to sound a piercing rimshot with the drumstick.\n\nListen: Snare Drum The following video gives an overview of playing the snare drum.\n\nCymbals\n\nCymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note. Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals.\n\nThe anatomy of the cymbal plays a large part in the sound it creates. A hole is drilled in the center of the cymbal and it is used to either mount the cymbal on a stand or straps (for hand playing). The bell, dome, or cup is the raised section immediately surrounding the hole. The bell produces a higher \u201cpinging\u201d pitch than the rest of the cymbal. The bow is the rest of the surface surrounding the bell. The bow is sometimes described in two areas: the ride and crash area. The ride area is the thicker section closer to the bell while the crash area is the thinner tapering section near the edge. The edge or rim is the immediate circumference of the cymbal.\n\nCymbals are measured by their diameter often in inches or centimeters. The size of the cymbal affects its sound, larger cymbals usually being louder and having longer sustain. The weight describes how thick the cymbal is. Cymbal weights are important to the sound they produce and how they play. Heavier cymbals have a louder volume, more cut, and better stick articulation (when using drum sticks). Thin cymbals have a fuller sound, lower pitch, and faster response.\n\nThe profile of the cymbal is the vertical distance of the bow from the bottom of the bell to the cymbal edge (higher profile cymbals are more bowl shaped). The profile affects the pitch of the cymbal: higher profile cymbals have higher pitch."}, {"url": "https://hub.yamaha.com/drums/percussion/anatomy-of-timpani/", "page_content": "Timpani (sometimes known as \u201ckettle drums\u201d) are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras and even by some rock bands. They consist of a membrane (a head) stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper, and they\u2019re played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a mallet. Modern timpani can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players using a movable foot pedal.\n\nHere\u2019s an annotated illustration of a typical timpano (\u201ctimpani\u201d is plural for a collection of timpano), followed by a description of each part, in alphabetical order:\n\nAuxiliary Brake.

The weight of the air is referred to as air density. This weight (air density) decreases as you go up within the atmosphere. When gravity acts on the air, the air exerts a force upon the earth called pressure. Air pressure varies according to temperature. Cold air is more dense than warm air, i.e., it weighs more. As a result, it tends to sink. Warm air, on the other hand, is less dense. Therefore, it weighs less and tends to rise. Meteorologists say that warm air is buoyant. 13\n\nUnlike a vibrating string, which requires a carefully designed coupled surface to propagate its sound, a vibrating timpano heads strongly couples to the surrounding atmosphere, which in turn propagates the sound. Since air does have weight, air density plays an integral role in affecting how a timpano head vibrates. Compared to a vibrating string, a timpano head is considerably larger in size and the surrounding air mass (both inside and outside of the drum) interacts with the vibrating modes substantially. This phenomenon is called air loading and is the main factor responsible for establishing the near harmonic relationship among the preferred modes.\n\nAir loading is the effect the weight of the surrounding mass of air has on the motion of the timpano head. It lowers the natural frequencies of vibrations from those of an ideal circular vibrating membrane. This effect is strongest for the lower modes especially mode (1,1), (2,1) and plays a significant role in adjusting the inharmonic partials, making them sound more harmonic. Since air density is not a constant, factors that affect air density (barometric pressure, temperature and humidity) also affect how a timpano head vibrates. The most noticeable effects are slight fluctuations in pitch and changes in the color of the sound when air density changes.\n\nEven subtle changes in air temperature, barometric pressure and humidity (factors which determine air density) can affect the actual pitch. It is a well documented fact that humidity affects timpani with natural skin heads. It is also purported that Mylar heads are virtually impervious to the moisture content of the air, but the irony is that since plastic heads were never alive like natural skin heads were, they consequently don\u2019t breathe like natural skins do. Mylar has a very low heat exchange coefficient, which contributes to a slower exchange of air density (temperature mostly) between the inside and the outside of the bowl, which is critical when differing air masses need to be equalized. The vent-hole in the bottom of the bowl is there to help with the balancing of the internal and external air masses. Playing the drum forces the internal air to escape through the hole thereby replacing it with external air from the room.\n\nIt can be detrimental to the harmonicity of the spectra to attempt to clear or temper timpani after the drums have been moved from one location to another where differing conditions in the air exist, e.g. a dry air-conditioned room to a warm/hot humid outdoor venue or a cold storage room to a warm stage. The best thing to do in this type of situation is to just let the drums sit for forty-five minutes to an hour and acclimate to the new environment. Playing on the drums won\u2019t hurt them, in fact it will actually help equalize the air mass in the bowl with the outer air, but it will play tricks with your ears. To help expel the internal air from the bowl, press down directly on the center of the head or strike the center of the drum loudly a few times. This excites the drum\u2019s actual fundamental and the other concentric modes of vibration, which will force an exchange of air faster than if you strike the drum in the normal area. It is always beneficial to move the timpani first when moving percussion equipment so that the timpani can acclimate to the new environment.\n\nIf a drum is sounding good and has a long sustained principal tone with clear near harmonic overtones present at each tuning lug, the head does not need clearing. In general, it is best to temper or fine-tune the heads after they have been played on, e.g. after a rehearsal, rather than before, giving the drums time to adjust to the environment. In situations where the player is unfamiliar with the instruments, it is recommended that the drums be in position two hours before the service so that the player can arrive early and check the drums over and make any necessary adjustments. Requests for early arrival of timpani are standard in the business. There should be no excuses as to why the drums sound bad if prep work is done ahead of time and the instruments are of reasonable quality.\n\nPages: 1 2 3"}], "Clay timpani is often used to provide a subtle background to a musical passage.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/timpani", "page_content": "timpani, (Italian: \u201cdrums\u201d) also spelled tympani, orchestral kettledrums. The name has been applied to large kettledrums since at least the 17th century. The permanent orchestral use of timpani dates from the mid-17th century, early examples being in Matthew Locke\u2019s Psyche (1673) and Jean-Baptiste Lully\u2019s opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e (1675). At first they were mainly confined to expressions of rejoicing or to supporting the brass in loud passages. Two instruments, one tuned to the tonic and the other to the dominant (first and fifth notes of the scale), were normal in 17th- and 18th-century scores. Later, more instruments were used with a variety of tunings. In the 19th century the timpani were used in more varied and expressive ways, a development stimulated in large part by the innovations of Ludwig van Beethoven. The French composer Hector Berlioz, who required 16 kettledrums in his Grand Messe des morts (1837; Requiem), even urged composers to specify which type of hard or soft sticks they wished used.\n\nIn modern timpani the bowl-shaped shell is usually of copper or brass. The membrane, of calfskin or synthetic material, is secured by a metal hoop. Its tension is varied by hand screws fixed to the shell and acting on the hoop, or, more often, by one of several 19th- and 20th-century devices: pedal or hand mechanisms that control the tension by rods connected to the hoop. A hole is pierced at the bottom of the shell to avoid air concussion splitting the head in loud passages. The tone varies according to the texture of the head of the stick and the area of the membrane struck. Occasionally, composers specify using the fingers to set the membrane in vibration.\n\nBritannica Quiz Musical Instruments\n\nThe orchestral kettledrum has a practical compass of five full tones. The compass of a pair of timpani is normally an octave from F below middle C downward; for an orchestral set of three, the tuning ranges are generally c\u2013g, G\u2013d, and E\u266d\u2013B\u266d (g = the G below middle C; E\u266d = the second E\u266d below). Such composers as Igor Stravinsky and Gustav Mahler have extended this range. The expressive resources of the timpani include reiteration of persistent rhythms, dramatic crescendos, sudden stresses, and atmospheric rolls. Special effects include damped or muffled notes, striking a note with two sticks, pedal glissando (sliding pitch) on a roll, and muting by placing a cloth on the drumhead."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98650-6_1", "page_content": "In a contemporaneous symphony orchestra, the family of percussion instruments is composed of the following instruments: the timpani, the snare drum, the bass drum the cymbals, the triangle, the tambourine and the mallet percussion instruments\u2014the xylophone, the glockenspiel, the vibraphone, the marimba, the crotales, the bell plates, the tubular bells, the gong, tam tam, etc. and many other new instruments as aluphone, sixes, etc. These instruments are grouped in sections which are defined by the musicians as: the timpani, the other tuned percussion instruments and the auxiliary percussion instruments.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to describe the properties of materials used for making percussion instruments for classical music played by a symphony orchestra in which the instruments could be played as a soloist instrument or could be a group or several groups of instruments, as they are included into a musical work. A chapter is devoted to the bells.\n\nPercussion instruments have a long history, as long as the history of humanity and have been firstly involved in religious ceremonies and military activities and secondly in the musical life of societies, as described in numerous reference books (Blades 1975; Peinkofer and Tannigel 1976; Montagu 2002; Beck 2013; Liblin 2014; Hartenberger 2016). Musical percussion instruments in primitive human societies had first of all a rhythmic role. The early instruments were percussion idiophones, like the rattles made by natural objects\u2014hooves, shells or seeds laced together and shaken by dancing. Other instruments from the palaeolithic era were the stampers, the scrapers and the clappers sounded by concussion. The drums as musical instruments were made from a hollowed log or a clay vessel covered with a skin. Drums have been strongly connected with primitive human societies. Archeologic studies noted reasonable evidence for drums existing in 3000 BC, as represented on monuments in Egypt, Assyria, India and Persia. The drums were associated with royalty. The drummer was a privileged person who observed the tradition of the community. Another percussion musical instrument present in human society from its early age was the xylophone. The xylophone made of wood is the simples melodic instrument which was widespread in Asia and Africa. The xylophonists used a playing technique comparable to those of the drummers. Bronze adapted xylophones existed in Far Eastern countries for about thousand years. Cymbals made of metallic discs were important in Chinese music, Indian music and Turkish music. Other percussion musical instruments worth mentioning are small bells, jingles, gongs and instruments made of narrow metallic tongues. In Africa these instruments played a prominent part in religious and secular music. Ancient Greek music was made using lyres, pipes and trumpets. The drums were used for specific military ceremonies. The percussion musical instruments promoted by Greek poetry and music were castanets, clappers, cymbals and the sistra. The double headed drum was associated with the god Dionysus and was played by women. The Bowl drum, covered with a skin can be seen on Greek vases from the IVth century BC. Marble statues existing in prestigious museums of the world attest to the way of playing percussion instruments (Fig. 1.1). Note the consistency with which the crotales were represented over centuries by various artists from Antiquity to the Renaissance. Romans used similar percussion instruments to those used by the Greeks, inventing nothing new. Cymbals of Roman civilisation excavated from the ruins of Pompei can be seen in the National Museum of Naples.\n\nFig. 1.1 Percussion instruments in artworks of Antiquity and in Quattrocento Italian Renaissance. a Romanised goddess Isis holding sistrum, statue from the time of Emperor Hadrian 117\u2013138 AD (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Marble_statue_of_Isis%2C_the_goddess_holds_a_situla_and_sistrum%2C_ritual_implements_used_in_her_worship%2C_from_117_until_138_AD%2C_found_at_Hadrian%27s_Villa_%28Pantanello%29%2C_Palazzo_Nuovo%2C_Capitoline_Museums_%2812945630725%29.jpg/532px-thumbnail.jpg, accessed 24 May 2021). b Satyr playing a foot clapper and small bells.

During his time the Edict of Milan was proclaimed in 313 A.D. which tolerated Christianity in the Roman Empire. For religious music and ceremonies only the trumpet and the psaltery were used. The cymbals and the drums have been excluded from religious music because of their \u201cdiabolic pomposity\u201d. The drums \u201creintegrated\u201d their place in the family of musical instruments only during the Early Baroque era. The Middle Ages in Europe were a period of little activity in instrumental musical. From the Renaissance era there exist numerous art works depicting musical instruments. Percussion instruments were introduced to Baroque musical scores to add expressiveness to the new musical genus of opera and oratorio. Later, the Romantic Period vigorously promoted \u201cthe musical percussion instruments in the scores for the orchestras for lyric operas and symphonies\u201d.\n\nThe concise Oxford dictionary defines the term orchestra, usually as \u201ca large group of instrumentalists, combining strings, woodwinds, brass and percussion instruments\u201d (Allen 1990). For example, percussion instruments for classical music of the contemporaneous Vienna symphony orchestra are classified into five groups: group 1\u2014the timpani, group 2\u2014the drums, group 3\u2014the mallets instruments, group 4\u2014the group of cymbals and other \u201cmetals\u201d, group 5\u2014the group of bells. This classification for percussion instruments is adopted by numerous symphony orchestras over the world and also by orchestras for opera or ballet performances (www.vsl.co.at/instrumentology/Percussions). Compared with the other orchestra\u2019s instrumental groups, percussion instruments have a very big variety of sizes and shapes generating a big variety of timbres. A general view of contemporaneous percussion instruments is given in Fig. 1.2.\n\nHistorically speaking some percussion instruments were first included in opera orchestras after about 1600, and much later in symphony orchestras. However, these instruments were in use in the Western music tradition for about five centuries. First of all it is worth mentioning that at the beginning timpani were \u201caccepted\u201d in orchestras only very reluctantly. Other percussion instruments were included only sporadically in orchestral scores for their ability to offer sound effects. Often percussion instruments were dismissed from orchestras scores because of their inability to produce a definite pitch. The structure and design of many of those percussion instruments changed relatively little over those 500 years.\n\nA chronological list of some musical compositions and the corresponding percussion instruments for the period 1680\u20131937 (data from Bug 2003) is given in Appendix 1.1.\n\nHowever, the \u201cdestiny\u201d of percussion instruments in symphony orchestras changed from the second half of the XIXth century. While initial acceptance of percussion instruments into orchestral compositions was slow, changes and developments that have taken place after about 1960 were spectacular and motivated by the research of composers for new timbres. The second half of the XXth century was called \u201cthe period of renaissance in percussion instruments\u201d (Peters 1975).\n\nKeller (2013) examined numerous musical scores cited in Appendix 1.2 covering the broad spectrum of percussion developments in the orchestral field during the second half of the XXth century and the beginning of the XXIst century. \u201cThe 1960s marked the beginning of an era of increased experimentalism in percussion composition and also marked the beginning of an era of time when serious studies of percussion and timpani began to appear in great number. Not only have a large number of instruments been explored, exploited, and accepted, but composers have awakened to the possibilities inherent in such a wide selection of sound\u201d. It is worth referring to Read (1979) who noted \u201cFrom a modest nucleus of two timpani, plus the occasionally used bass drum, cymbals, and triangle (mostly in compositions for the theatre), to a grouping of some fifteen or twenty assorted wood, metal, and membranous instruments (requiring from three to eight players), the percussion has evolved into an orchestra within an orchestra. This expansion, which began in the early nineteenth century (with Berlioz, Meyerbeer, and others), reached its zenith by the era of late Romanticism at the turn of the century. Today, in the late twentieth century, the concept of the \u201cpercussion orchestra\u201d is an essential aspect of Neoromantic, exotic, and avant-garde orchestral expression\u201d.\n\nIn the analysis presented by Keller (2013) based on 87 compositions (Appendix 1.2) written between 1960 and 2009 the frequency with which percussion instruments were employed in these scores was studied. For instance, the glockenspiel was cited in 65 compositions, the vibraphone and the chimes were cited each in 56 compositions, the xylophone and marimba were cited each in 48 compositions, crotales were cited in 42 compositions and bell plates were cited only in 6 compositions. We can see that the glockenspiel was the most cited instrument. Chronologically, if we look for the proportion of the compositions including percussion instruments per annum, we have: 28% of musical works analysed during the 1960s, 9% during the 1970s, 27% during the1980s, 21% during the 1990s and about 15% during 2000\u20132009. Evidently, there was an increasing interest by composers in percussion instruments during the decades of the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nA chronological listing of some musical works for orchestral percussion section and percussion solo instruments for a period of about 70 years, between 1949\u20132018 is given in Appendix 1.3.\n\n1.1 Description of Percussion Instruments\n\nIn what follows we will describe succinctly the groups of percussion instruments depicted in the figures of the next following pages (Figs. 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7). The need to support the visual aspect of percussion instruments with these images may facilitate our efforts for a better understanding of the relationships between the players, the instruments and the materials used for their construction and the ergonomics .\n\nFig. 1.7 Percussion instruments made of wood, exclusively, struck by hands or with an object. a Woodblocks. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4JQD0cy87I/maxresdefault.jpg. b Castanets. https://www.daviddarling.info/images_music/castanets.jpg. c Cleves. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Playingclaves.jpg Full size image\n\nGroup 1\u2014the timpani also known as kettle drums, are made of large hemispheric or parabolic bowls of cooper, aluminium or fiberglass, covered with a head hawing a membrane made of calfskin, goat skin or mylar (a polyester film made from stretched polyethylene terephthalate) and stretched over the top of the bowl. The diameter of the membrane can be up to 82 cm and can produce the note C 2 (the C below the bass clef\u2014F 3 ). The membrane is lapped by a rim. Modern timpani have a foot pedal for tuning the instrument. The percussionist strikes the membrane with mallets to produce the sound of the required note. Timpani are pitched instruments and have a range of perfect fifth or seven semitones.\n\nGroup 2\u2014the drums, including the snare drum, the bass drum, the field drum and the tambourine.\n\nThe snare drum is a typical unpitched instrument and consists of a shell and two heads with two membranes. The upper or the top drumhead, is struck by the player. The resonance head is on the underside of the drum and is tensioned at a slightly lower tension than the top drumhead. The sound can be changed slightly by tightening the drum head. The shell can be made of plywood moulded into a cylinder, metallic sheets, acrylic materials, or fiberglass. A typical orchestral snare drum might be 14\u2033 (36 cm) in diameter and 6\u2033 (15 cm) in depth. The snare drum is almost always double-headed, with rattles (called snares) of gut, wire (metal wire or synthetics) stretched across one head, rarely across both heads.\n\nThe bass drum is typically a cylindrical large percussion instrument currently of indefinite pitch, or sometime, it can produce a note of low definite pitch. The bass drum is about 100 cm in diameter and 50 cm in width. The bass drum has two membranes made of goatskin of cowskin or mylar, which cover both sides of a cylindrical shell. The bass drum should be mounted on a stand because of its very big size. The player strikes either side with a felt-covered mallet.\n\nThe tambourine is made of a circular frame of wood or plastic, with several pairs of small metallic jingles and a drumhead. The tambourine is held in the hand and played by tapping or hitting the drumhead or by shaking the jingles.\n\nGroup 3\u2014the mallets instruments group composed of xylophone, vibraphone, marimba, glockenspiel struck by mallets. In this group is included also the celesta; which is a keyboard instrument made of metallic bars struck by hammers\n\nThe xylophone is made of wooden bars (rosewood, padauk) or various synthetic materials (fiberglass or fiberglass\u2014reinforced plastic) fixed on a metallic or wooden frame, struck by mallets. Each bar is tuned to a specific pitch of the musical scale\u2014chromatic for orchestral use. Concert xylophones typically span 3 \u00bd or 4 octaves and can have resonators below the bars to sustain the sound. The heads of the mallets are made of very hard rubber or acrylic or, for softer effects yarn mallets are used. Wooden-headed mallets made from rosewood, ebony, birch, or other hard woods may be used for harder effects.\n\nThe marimba is made of a set of wooden bars and resonators suspended underneath the bars to amplify the sound. Marimba is a new instrument introduced in orchestras in the second half of the XXth century. The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like the keys of a piano. The groups of accidentals (black keys) rise vertically, overlapping the natural bars. The bars are struck with yarn or rubber mallets. Marimba bars are typically made of either wood (rosewood, padauk, mahogany) or synthetic material. The resonators are tubes made of aluminium that hang below each bar. The marimba is played with two or four mallets (two in each hand). Sometimes six mallets can be used (three in each hand) or even eight mallets (four in each hand). The characteristic sound of a marimba is related to the following factors: the construction of the bars, the tuning of the bars, the use of resonators, and the selection of mallets and playing areas of the bars (Merrill 1996).\n\nThe vibraphone is made of aluminium bars, similar to a xylophone or marimba. The keys are struck by the player with mallets, while standing up. The keys are of graduated width, lower and wider bars for lower notes and narrow bars for higher notes.\n\nThe celesta is a struck instrument operated by a keyboard. In general, it is similar to an upright piano with four or five octaves. The keys are connected to the hammers that strike a set of metallic plates suspended over resonators made of wood. The celesta spans four of five octaves and has a pedal that sustains or dampens the sound. The timbre of a celesta is very subtle and delicate.\n\nThe glockenspiel, in music scores designated by the Italian term \u201ccampanelli\u201d, is made of a set of metallic tuned plates, and works in a similar way to the xylophone. The glockenspiel is a small instrument, but is higher in pitch than a xylophone.\n\nGroup 4\u2014the group of cymbals and other \u201cmetals\u201d, which include cymbals, suspended cymbals, gong, tam-tam and triangle.\n\nOrchestral Cymbals are mostly used in pairs and are made of thin circular metallic plates. Cymbals are played in pairs by striking them against each other. The loudness of the cymbals is determined by their size and weight. When played softly, the cymbals are slid against each other. A single cymbal, hanged by a strap, is played with a mallet or a drum stick. A single cymbal vibrates freely. The sound of cymbals played in pairs is very different from the sound of a single cymbal.\n\nThe gong is a suspended brass disc-shaped percussion instrument made of bronze and is played by striking the disc with a soft large mallet. Gongs are made in a big variety of sizes from smaller gongs producing a high sound to a low deep reverberating sound (>2 m diameter) produced by larger gongs. The gongs for opera performance are from 18 to 30 cm in diameter. Several gongs can be tuned.\n\nThe tam-tam is in fact a suspended gong, made of a circular plate in bronze, which is slightly concave, ranging in size from 18 to 203 cm in diameter. The rim of about 1 cm is perpendicular to the disk surface, forming a shallow cylinder.\n\nThe triangle is made of a metallic bar bent into a triangular shape, with one corner left open, allowing generation of overtones. It is struck with a metallic beater, giving a ringing tone. The triangle is suspended by a loop or a wire at the top vertex allowing it to vibrate freely.\n\nGroup 5\u2014the group of bells composed of tubular bells and bell plates.\n\nTubular bells called also chimes are metallic tubes of 30\u201338 mm diameter and of various lengths to produce sounds ranging from C 4 to F 5. They are played by striking the top edge of the tube with a hammer. A sustain pedal is attached to the frame supporting the bells to allow sound attenuation of the ringing bells.\n\nA bell plate sound is very similar to a tubular bell. A bell plate can be made in different sizes, of aluminium sheet or bronze sheet, of 100 \u00d7 74 cm weighing about 6 kg or, 28 \u00d7 25 cm weighing about 1 kg. Bell plates comprising 29 plates, cover 4 octaves in the form of a C major scale. The bell plates are suspended from a circular frame and sometimes can be fitted with resonators to enhance the sounds of low partials.\n\nFollowing the \u201cvon Hornbostel-Sachs\u201d system of musical instruments classification, the percussion instruments of a symphonic orchestra are classified as: membranophones (timpani, drums and tambourine), idiophones (xylophone, marimba, celesta, chimes or tubular bells, cymbals, gongs, triangle), aerophones (whistles, sirens). (von Hornbostel and Sachs 1961). This classification also includes the chordophones (piano, harpsichord, harp). Chordophones are not a subject for this book. The materials for the construction of chordophone instruments have been discussed in \u201cHandbook of materials for string musical instruments\u201d Bucur (2016).\n\n1.2 The Frequency Range of Percussion Instruments\n\nThe frequency range of percussion instruments of a symphony orchestra is given in Fig. 1.8. The lowest frequency is C2 (65 Hz) produced by the timpani and bell plates while the highest frequency C8 (4186 Hz) comes from the xylophone, glockenspiel and celesta. Celesta is the instrument with the largest frequency range from C3 (130 Hz) to C8 (4186 Hz). Appendix 1.4 gives the names and frequencies of musical notes of percussion instruments.\n\nFig. 1.8 Frequency range of percussion instruments (data from Vienna Symphonic Library. https://www.vsl.co.at, accessed 25 November 2019) Full size image\n\nAppendix 1.4 gives the corresponding MIDI\u2014Musical Instrument Digital Interface\u2014numbers and frequencies and the corresponding name of musical notes\n\n1.3 The Layout Plan of Percussion Instruments in a Symphony Orchestra\n\nThe layout plan for a symphony orchestra playing classical music is shown in Fig. 1.9. Percussion instruments are at the rear and in the upper row of the orchestra. Figure 1.10 shows the percussion instruments among other instruments in symphony orchestra on a seating plane. The way in which percussion instruments are associated with string and wind instruments in the orchestra has varied over the centuries and has been influenced, among other factors, by the evolution of musical taste and by the technological advances in the manufacturing of these instruments. Some of percussion instruments are very heavy i.e. timpani can have 80 kg.\n\nFig. 1.9 Layout of London Symphony Orchestra\u2014for Mahler 6th Symphony, with a general view of the percussion instruments and instrumentalists\u2014the upper row (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2kD8EqXcAI7L8G.jpg, accessed 15 November 2019) Full size image\n\nFig. 1.10 Percussion instruments among other instruments in symphony orchestra illustrated on the seating plane (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/9f/96/d39f963e5814c1baad0c2901ebca2231.png, accessed 23 November 2019) Full size image\n\nInstrumentalists grouped in orchestras have existed in Europe from the fifteenth century. The oldest German orchestra is the orchestra of the Statstheater Kassel, founded in 1502 (Werner-Jensen 2015). One of the earliest existing documents, mentioning the structure of an orchestra is in the score of the opera Orpheus by Claudio Monteverdi, published in 1607 in Venice, in Italy (Whenham 2001) In this score (Fig. 1.11). The following instruments are mentioned in Italian: due (2) gravicembalo, due (2) contrabass de viola, due (2) viole da brazzo, una (1) arpa dopia, due (2) violini picolline alla francese, due (2) chitaroni, due (2) organo di legno, tre (3) viole da gamba, quatri (4) trombone, un (1) regalo, due (2) chitaroni, un (1) clavecino con tre trombe seconde.\n\nFig. 1.11 Orchestras in Europe between 1600 and 1877. a Score of the opera \u201cOrfeo\u201d by Claudio Monteverdi published in Venice in 1607 the cover of the score. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Frontispiece_of_L%27Orfeo.jpg. b List of characters and instruments for the score of \u201cOrfeo\u201d. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Orfeo_libretto_instruments_characters.jpg. c Number of musicians in an orchestra between 1610 and 1877, based on 415 European orchestras calculated on the basis of ensemble members lists.

As mentioned by Reuter (2002, 2017) one can say that the number of orchestras increased drastically during the XIXth century as did the number of instrumentalists playing in an orchestra because of the increasing of the number of parts in orchestral scores. In the early scores for Baroque orchestra only two timpani were mentioned. Early romantic orchestras required eight percussion instruments. For late romantic orchestras the number of percussion instruments increased considerably. Contemporaneous orchestras require twenty percussion instruments or much more (Table 1.1).\n\nTable 1.1 Evolution of the number of percussion instruments in orchestra (data from Raynor 1978; Sptizer and Zaslaw 2004) Full size table\n\nAppendix 1.3 gives a chronological listing of some musical compositions and the corresponding number of percussion instruments for the period 1680\u20131937 (data from Bug 2003).\n\n1.4 About the Musical Works Including Percussion Instruments\n\nWe have seen that the history of the development of the orchestral percussion section was a subject of interest to many scholars, and was related to the growing significance of percussion and rhythm in Western music since the XVIth century, when timpani were incorporated into chamber ensembles (Hartenberger 2016). The scores for timpani began to be written in the XVIIth century and were introduced to the court orchestras and opera ensembles, as for example in the opera Ester (1680) by the German composer Nicolaus Adam Strungk (1640\u20131700). This score also introduced the bass drum and cymbals (Bug 2003). During the eighteenth century, for example Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714\u20131787) in several operas introduced the bass drum, the cymbals and the triangle (Bug 2003). These instruments were also included in the scores of Mozart\u2019s operas. During the XVIIIth century technological advances allowed changing the pith of the timpani by faster tensioning of the membrane with a pedal. Major technological advances for the design of timpani were possible in XIXth century with the rotating timpani, the suspended timpani and the foot activated tuning system, providing a superior tone quality. The composer Joseph Haydn (1732\u20131809) was the first to write a solo passage for timpani in the \u201cMilitary\u201d Symphony No. 100, and in Symphony No. 103, \u201cDrum Roll\u201d. Ludwig van Beethoven with a more sophisticated symphonic writing for solo timpani, presented a new challenge for timpanists in the violin concerto and in Symphonies No. 7, and No. 9.\n\nThe playing ability of timpani for symphony orchestras in the second half of the XIXth century was exploited by the French composer Hector Berlioz in the \u201cSymphonie Fantastique\u201d written in 1830. The percussion section in this work is very important and is composed of 4 timpani played by four players, cymbals, snare drum, bass drum and bells in C and G. The timpanists have to play challenging rhythms and make several tuning changes. Another symphonic work written by Berlioz in which the score for timpani is remarkable is the Requiem, or\u2014Grande Messe des morts\u2014written in 1837 and revised in 1852 and 1867, for 16 timpani (6 pairs, 4 single), 2 bass drums, 10 pairs of cymbals and 4 tam-tam (Holoman 1989). This work is one of the pinnacles of symphonic music ever written.\n\nDuring the XIXth century, the invention of the \u201cDresden\u201d foot pedal system for timpani attached at the side of the instrument and operated by the timpanist\u2019s ankle motion, allowed for minute pitch adjustments. In this way, composers have seen limitless possibilities for timpani in symphonic or opera scores and the use of three timpani became usual as seen in works by Schumann (1810\u20131856) in Symphony No. 1 (Perrey 2007), or Verdi (1813\u20131901) in the Othello opera composed in 1887 (Balthazar 2004), or Richard Strauss (1864\u20131949) in the opera \u201cDer Rosenkavalier\u201d composed in 1911 (Youmans 2010). Portraits of these composers are depicted in Fig. 1.12.\n\nFig. 1.12 Portraits of the composers promoting timpani in symphony orchestra of XVIIIth and XIXth century. a Joseph Hayden, Portrait by Thomas Hardy. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Haydn_portrait_by_Thomas_Hardy_%28small%29.jpg. b Ludwig van Beethoven. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Beethovensmall.jpg. c Hector Berlioz, painting by Emile Signol at Villa Medici in Rome. http://www.hberlioz.com/Photos/Berlioz1.jpg. d Robert Schuma. https://www.conservapedia.com/images/f/f7/Schumann.jpg. e Giuseppe Verdi, painting by Bice Lombardini. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giuseppe_Verdi,_portrait_by_Bice_Lombardini.jpg. f Richard Strauss painting (1918) by Max Lieberman. https://reproarte.com/images/stories/virtuemart/product/liebermann_max/0036-0175_bildnis_des_komponisten_richard_strauss.jpg Full size image\n\nAt the beginning of the XXst century Stravinsky (1882\u20131971) wrote three remarkable ballet works: The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911), and The Rite of Spring (1913). The score for the Rite of Spring does call for two timpani, two orchestral bass drums, two clash cymbals, a tam tam, a tambourine, a triangle, two crotales and two washboards, As noted by Ford (2011), Stravinsky liberated the rhythm from its subordinate position due to a radical rethinking of musical syntax in this score. It is the rhythm rather than the harmony that propels the music with percussion instruments.\n\nContemporary percussion music was born around 1930 in North America and Europe with the introduction of percussion instruments used as solo instruments by several audacious composers such as Roland, Varese, Cage, Beyer, Cowell, Harrison. The landmark in the percussion repertoire is the work called \u201cIonisation\u201d composed by Varese between 1929 and 1931. It is for 30 musicians and uses following percussion instruments: snare drum, temple block, gong, siren, guiro, tambourine, triangle and bells. This work was composed exclusively for percussion instruments.\n\nDuring the same period the American, Australian born composer Percy Grainger (1882\u20131961) included in his orchestral works up to 10 percussionists including the marimba as mallet instruments. Another Australian composer, Peggy Glanville-Hicks (1912\u20131990) was fascinated by the sonorities of percussion instruments, as in the composition with celeste and other instruments Three Gymnopedies, for oboe, celeste, harp, string (Claire Edwardes (July 2020)). https://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/ish/percussion-music.\n\nThe increasing number of compositions for percussion instruments in the 1930s and 1940s requiring highly professional performers required the development of professional percussion ensembles which emerged only after the 1950s. Composers such as Stockhausen, Riedl, Bussotti, Tenney, Feldman, Xenakis, Drouet, and Gualda contributed to the foundation of \u201cthe solo percussion canon\u201d (Devenish 2015) (Fig. 1.13).\n\nFig. 1.13 Portraits of composers promoting percussion instruments in the second half of the XXth century and the begging of the XXIst century. a Igor Stravinsky. https://images.forwardcdn.com/image/1300x/center/top/images/cropped/gettyimages-2635145-1491513193.jpg. b Olivier Messiaen. https://cdn.radiofrance.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2018/05/39345885-8fb1-4827-8e26-f19469935e96/200x200_gettyimages-803855486.jpg. c Luciano Berio. https://direct.rhapsody.com/imageserver/images/Art.38725/356x237.jpg. d Pierre Boulez. http://5against4.com/images/composers/pierreboulez.jpg. e Philip Glass. https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/philip-glass-smile-billboard-1548.jpg. f Jennifer Higdon. http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Jennifer+Higdon+okY729b5XNCm.jpg Full size image\n\nThe first ensemble established as a highly professional group of classical percussion musicians was Les Percussions de Strasbourg. The ensemble was composed of six percussionists and was founded in 1962 by Jean Batigne under the inspiration of the conductor Pierre Boulez who stimulated the formation of this ensemble from 1959 (https://www.percussionsdestrasbourg.com/en/).\n\nAs mentioned in the official site (https://www.percussionsdestrasbourg.com/en/les-percussions-de-strasbourg-2/presentation/) The first concert was given by \u201cLes Percussions de Strasbourg\u201d at the ORTF in Paris, on January 17th, 1962, in the presence of French composer Serge Nigg (1924\u20132008). Very quickly, the ensemble inspired the creation of a new repertoire by composers such as Messiaen, Stockhausen, Serocki, Kabelac, Ohana, Xenakis, M\u00e2che or Dufourt. As Pierre Boulez says later: \u00abA repertoire was necessary for the Groupe, but the Groupe has made the repertoire necessary\u00bb. \u201cNo matter how you look at it, the catalogue of the Percussions de Strasbourg, dedicatee of more than 350 works, is quite simply unique\u201d. \u201cThrough their many travels and a strong collusion with the composers, they actively contribute to the sound research and the invention of new instruments, such as the sixxen designed by Xenakis\u201d.\n\nSeveral other ensembles have been created around the world. Examples are the New Jersey Percussion Ensemble in the U.S. in 1968, and in Canada the Nexus ensemble in 1971.\n\nAs mentioned by Devenish (2017) five percussion ensembles originated in Australia between 1970 and 2000, including the Australian Percussion Ensemble, Synergy Percussion, Adelaide Percussions and the Nova Ensemble. The ensemble Offspring has become one of Australia\u2019s most significant commissioners and exponents of new music. These ensembles had large repertoire lists supported by enthusiastic Australian sponsors (https://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/ish/percussion-music). Musical classical compositions for percussion instruments were commissioned for the composers Peter Sculthorpe (1929\u20132014) and Barry Conyngham (born in 1944). Ross Edwards (born 1943) is known for the following works: (Yarrageh, Nocturne for Percussion and Orchestra (1989); Prelude and Dragonfly Dance, for percussion quartet (1991); Djanaba, for guitar and marimba, also arr. for two guitars (2002), More Marimba Dances (2004); Frog and Star Cycle, Double Concerto for Saxophone and Percussion (2015). Nigel Westlake (born 1958) wrote \u201cFabian Theory\u201d which requires a digital delay in performance. After 1990 the Australian percussion scene was very active with performers and composers, as shown in Appendix 1.5 and it is worth mentioning the interest of composers in mallet instruments, which are pitched instruments. Among the unpitched instruments the snare drum is cited several times.\n\nThe innovative current trend in the field of percussion and electronics, in digital sound and in new technologies in contemporary music, is manifested in percussion instrument performance. The fascination with live electronic music for giving a \u201cspatial impression of the sound\u201d was evident in pieces written by Stockhausen, and among others in \u201cMikrophonie I\u201d, composed in 1964 for only one percussion instrument, the tam tam and six players to excite the instrument with different mallets and objects, to pick up the vibrations using microphones, and two control filters and a potentiometer.\n\nAn important centre for the development of computer-based live-electronic music in France is IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique) in Paris, where composers, acousticians and specialists in modern technologies work together for the development of computer systems for musical applications. In Canada, Schulich School of Music at McGill University Montreal promoted research in this field. de Oliveira Rocha (2008), in his Ph.D. thesis discussed musical works for percussion and computer-based live electronic music and commented on aspects of performance related to the technology. The performer uses a MIDI\u2014(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) pedal which gives the correspondence between the musical notes and the corresponding frequencies.\n\nAs the world undergoes unprecedent technological innovations, so also must music styles. The result is a stimulative and provocative challenge in which percussion instruments are of growing significance. The \u201celectronic musician\u201d is a new type of musician who is specialised in creating music for acoustic instruments with interactive electronics or for computer networks. In Australia, Music for One Percussionist, commissions new works from Australian composers each year. It is worth mentioning the monograph CD music for percussion and electronics by Louise Devenish. \u201cEach work presented explores a different metal percussion instrument: vibraphone and stereo tracks, tam-tam and subwoofer, glockenspiel and tape and bossed gongs and live processing\u201d (https://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/reviews/music-for-percussion-and-electronics-louise-devenish/, accessed 24 May 2021). This challenging approach offers an authentic experience that musicians and the listeners never had before.\n\nAnother development in classic percussion instruments is the creation of new acoustic instruments like: auluphone, sixxen invented by the composer Yannis Xenakis (Fig. 1.14), Spica, Gaiabells, Bassdesmophone\u2014and all other types of \u201cLunasons\u201d invented by the contemporary timpanist Domenico Melchiorre (https://www.lunason.com/english/).\n\nFig. 1.14 Percussions de Strasbourg, contemporaneous rehearsing of Pleiades, by I. Xenakis on the Sixxens (https://www.percussionsdestrasbourg.com//wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pleiades_Re%CC%81pe%CC%81tition-1085x545.jpg, accessed 28 May 2021) Full size image\n\n1.5 Summary\n\nSince the second half of the XXth century the repertoire of classical percussionists and percussion ensembles has been very small because they were a \u201cnew medium\u201d in orchestral musical life. During the Early Medieval Ages, the drums were used for military purposes. Cymbals and triangles were known at the time. However, they were never considered members of even the crudest orchestra. In the late Middle Ages, the tympani was used to accompany trumpets. Early snare drums had a gut snare stretched across the lower head. The instrument was used strictly as a delicate rhythm instrument. Tambourines were played by minstrels. In the Baroque and Rococo periods, composers recognised the timpani as a musical instrument The tympani were used in pairs; one was tuned to the tonic of the scale, the other to the dominant. The construction of the snare drum was improved by replacing the wooden shell with a metallic shell which gave a clearer sound. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the use of the tympani in the orchestra became more and more common. Tympanis underwent some significant structural changes which facilitated tuning by adding cranks and pedals to simplify their tuning. The romantic era promoted the use of percussion instruments. Since then, the following instruments have been added to the orchestral percussion section: tenor drum, gong drum, cymbals, modern xylophone, marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, and the celesta. At the beginning of the XXth century these numerous instruments had no musical repertoire for soloists. In 1931, Edgar Varese composed \u201cIonisation\u201d\u2014the first compositions for percussion ensemble alone. In the early 1960s, the percussion ensemble had come into a new era for solo instruments. Composers gave the percussion ensemble prominence. During the two first decades of the XXIst century we have seen numerous orchestral percussion ensembles flourishing across the world for which a repertoire was demanded and therefore created. New acoustic percussion instruments have been invented for classic percussion ensembles."}, {"url": "https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/facts-about-the-timpani/", "page_content": "By Robert Jackson\n\nTimpani are those large semi-spherical drums that look like big shiny bowls or upside-down tea-kettles\u2014which is why they\u2019re also called kettledrums.\n\nA classical percussion section would never be complete without timpani. They\u2019re important both in classical orchestras and musical ensembles, including concert, marching, and even rock and roll bands.\n\nThe sound of timpani can be energetic and thunderous, as well as smooth and velvety, which is why they\u2019re considered extremely versatile.\n\nTo help acquaint you with this fascinating percussive instrument, here are 20 interesting facts about the timpani.\n\n1. The Timpani is a Pitched Percussion Instrument\n\nModern pedal timpani can be instantly tuned through a movable foot pedal to adjust the tension of the head as well as the pitch.\n\nAlthough convenient, that could still pose a challenge during a concert, since it\u2019ll require the timpanist to have a perfect ear to keep the instrument in key with the rest of the ensemble.\n\nTuning a chain timpani, which is much less common nowadays, is even more difficult since they don\u2019t have pedals.\n\nInstead, they have a roller chain and a crank.\n\n2. The Timpani Were Initially Military Drums\n\nArabian Naqqara\n\nTimpani started as military drums.\n\nTheir use dates back to the 13th century when they were introduced to Europe by crusaders who brought similar but much smaller Arabian Naqqara.\n\nBefore timpani came to be a staple instrument in the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century, they were used in military ceremonies throughout Europe until the 16th century.\n\nThey were even used during the American Civil war where they were played by musicians on horseback.\n\nIn the late 19th century, modern machine timpani were developed for easier adjustment of drumhead tension.\n\n3. The Timpani Has a Wide Range of Sounds\n\nTimpani produce a wide dynamic range of sounds.\n\nTheir various sounds could best be described as dull, thunderous, rumbling, booming, deep, heavy, powerful, round, mellow, velvety, substantial, resonant, dry, or hollow.\n\nThe timbre of the timpani is affected by what the mallets are made of, where the head is struck, and how hard it\u2019s struck.\n\nThe purest tone is produced from the middle of a timpani drum.\n\n4. Timpani Belong to the Percussion Family\n\nThe percussion family is the largest in the orchestra, and timpani are a central part of it because they support rhythm, add melody and color, and enhance harmony.\n\nThe timpani, along with the xylophone and piano, are percussion instruments that are tuned and can sound different notes.\n\nThe bass drums, cymbals, and castanets are examples of untuned percussion instruments with no definite pitch.\n\n5. Timpani Have a Wide Pitch Range\n\nEach timpano (the singular or timpani) has a tonal range of about an interval of a sixth, with the pitch of the lower note dependant on its size.\n\nIn a four-timpani set, the range of pitch of the four drums can therefore span around 3 octaves!\n\n6. Timpani Are Traditionally Made of Copper\n\nTimpani sets today come in a host of materials, including fiber-reinforced plastic and aluminum.\n\nHowever, the traditional copper remains the best material for the bowl since it keeps the timpani in tune more effectively, and resists temperature changes.\n\nCopper also has properties that allow it to easily stretch and shape, and allows sound to resonate deeply.\n\n7. Animal Skins are Preferred for Timpani Heads\n\nTypically, timpani heads used to cover the bowl are made of calfskin or goatskin.\n\nAlthough costly, professional timpanists prefer these skins for the warmer quality of sound they produce.\n\nHeads are also often made of plastic, which is more durable, more affordable, and less affected by temperature and humidity than animal skin.\n\n8. There Are Two Styles of Timpani Placement\n\nIn German-speaking countries, including Germany and Austria, large timpani are usually placed at the right side of the timpanist with smaller timpani to the left, increasing the pitch from right to left.\n\nInternationally, especially in Japan, the direction of the timpani is reversed so that the pitch increases from left to right, similar to a piano keyboard.\n\n9. Timpanists Are Very Well Paid\n\nTimpanists are some of the highest-earning musicians in the music industry.\n\nTheir role is central in an orchestra, and there are few of them due to the difficulty of the instrument.\n\nOf course, the more skilled and experienced a timpanist is, the higher their earning potential, especially in performing arts companies or professional symphonies.\n\nIn the US, it\u2019s reported that the median salary for a timpanist is just under $50,000 a year with some paid well over $100k a year too!\n\n10. Timpani are Very Expensive Instruments\n\nBuying a quality set of timpani could cost you. Prices vary depending on factors like brand, size, and material.\n\nA timpani set can take up to two years to build and could cost an average of $12,000-$17,000.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be careful while moving them around to avoid costly damages.\n\n11. Timpani Are Heavy\n\nTimpani are among the largest and heaviest musical instruments.\n\nA single timpani drum can weigh up to 140 lbs\u2026\n\nMultiply that by 4 or 5 for a whole set, and you\u2019ve got a challenge on your hands.\n\nTransporting these drums can be difficult and it\u2019ll give you a good workout.\n\n12. There Are Many Different Styles of Timpani\n\nTimpani come in various shapes and sizes.\n\nThere\u2019s a cambered type with a flat bottom like a pot, and a parabolic type that\u2019s nearly hemispherical.\n\nGenerally, the smaller the drums, the higher the pitches.\n\nThe timbre is also decided by where the drum head is stricken.\n\n13. Different Timpani Mallets Give Different Sounds\n\nThere are different categories of mallets used for striking the timpani, including hard, medium-hard, soft, flannel, and wood.\n\nEach kind is used according to the sheet music to express different sounds.\n\nThey come in various sizes, weights, coverings, and lengths of handles.\n\nThe mallet tip is often made out of felt, flannel, or cork, with a bamboo or wood handle.\n\nFelt ball mallets result in a soft attack, while wood balls produce a sharp attack and greater volume.\n\nMany professional musicians prefer to make their own mallets to customize them according to their needs.\n\n14. There Are Different Grips For The Timpani Mallet\n\nTwo common grips for the timpani mallet are the German grip and the French grip.\n\nIn the German grip, the palm is almost parallel with the drum head with the thumb on the side of the mallet.\n\nIn the French grip, the palm is almost perpendicular with the drum head and the thumb is on top of the mallet.\n\nThe American grip is a combination of both.\n\n15. Timpani Go Into All Kinds of Contemporary Music\n\nMusic created by timpani has a lengthy repertoire; it has invaded many rock and roll bands, as well as pop music.\n\nFrom the Beach Boys, Queen, The Beatles, and Emerson, to Led Zeppelin, timpani have taken pride of place in the 60s-70s pop-rock music.\n\nThey\u2019re also featured in electronic music!\n\nSounds created by the timpani are versatile, and stand out in any music style or genre.\n\n16. Playing the Timpani Can Be Tricky But Fun\n\nPlaying the timpani might seem easy\u2014the rhythms are simple, and you often play only a couple of notes\u2014but in reality, there\u2019s so much technique involved.\n\nYou need a very strong musical ear to successfully tune and play your timpani.\n\nYou also need to know how to maintain your drums and mallets to ensure a longer lifespan for them.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, playing the timpani is so much fun.\n\n17. Playing the Timpani Requires Sensitivity Over Strength\n\nIt\u2019s often thought that playing a large musical instrument like the timpani requires a lot of physical strength, but that\u2019s not true.\n\nIn fact, a large volume of sound can be given through the drum reverberations, using only a little amount of force.\n\nAll you need is to create vibration as naturally as you can.\n\nIt actually takes a lot of sensitivity to create soft sounds and maintain a steady tempo.\n\n18. The Largest Timpani in the World is in Bali\n\nThe largest timpani in the world is in Bali.\n\nAt 73 inches in tall and 63 inches in diameter, the Moon of Pejeng is an ancient kettledrum that is thought to date back to 300 BC.\n\nIt has a story attached to it too, with a Balinese legend claiming that this drum was one of the wheels of a chariot on which they pulled the moon through sky until it fell to earth.\n\nWrap-Up\n\nAs you can see, a timpanist\u2019s job isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nWhile playing the timpani isn\u2019t easy at first, it sure is fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nWe hope the 20 facts we\u2019ve shared in this post have inspired you to delve deeper into the world of percussive instruments and enjoy some fascinating timpani solos and ensembles."}, {"url": "https://www.academickids.com/encyclopedia/index.php/Timpani", "page_content": "From Academic Kids\n\nMissing image\n\nUSAFE_Band_timpanist.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate:Spoken Wikipedia Timpani, or kettledrums, are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl commonly made of copper. They are played by striking the head with a special drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Unlike most drums, they produce a definite pitch when struck. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra in the 17th century. Today, they are used in many types of musical ensembles including concert, marching, and even rock bands.\n\nTimpani is an Italian plural, the singular of which is timpano. This is rarely used in informal English speech, however, as a timpano is typically referred to as simply a drum or a timpani. An alternative spelling, tympani, is often encountered in English texts. It is derived from the Latin word tympanum, from which the Italian word descends. A musician who plays the timpani is known as a timpanist. Template:Listen\n\nThe instrument\n\nThe basic timpano\n\nThe basic timpano consists of a drumhead stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass. The drumhead is connected to a hoop, which is then attached to the bowl via a number of tuning screws called tension rods placed regularly along the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.\n\nThe shape of the bowl contributes to the tone quality of the drum. For example, hemispheric bowls produce brighter tones while parabolic bowls produce darker tones. Another factor that affects the timbre of the drum is the quality of the bowl's surface. Copper bowls may have a smooth, machined surface or rough surface with many small dents hammered into it.\n\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from around 84 centimeters (33 inches) in diameter down to piccolo timpani of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or less. A 33-inch drum can produce the C below the bass clef, and speciality piccolo timpani can play up into the treble clef. In Darius Milhaud's ballet La cr\u00e9\u00a1\u00b4ion du monde, the timpanist must play the F sharp at the bottom of the treble clef!\n\nEach individual drum typically has a range of a perfect fifth to an octave.\n\nMachine timpani\n\nChanging the pitch of a timpano by turning each tension rod individually is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Timpani equipped with such a system are called machine timpani.\n\nMissing image\n\nDresden_pedal.jpg This pedal is on a Dresden timpano. The timpanist must disengage the clutch \u2013 seen here on the left of the pedal \u2013 to change the pitch of the drum.\n\nPedal timpani\n\nBy far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allow the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via a spider-like system of metal rods.\n\nThere are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:\n\nThe ratchet-clutch system uses a ratchet and clutch to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, he must reengage the clutch.\n\nsystem uses a ratchet and clutch to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, he must reengage the clutch. In the balanced action system, a spring is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The balanced action system is sometimes called a floating pedal since there is no clutch holding the pedal in place.\n\nsystem, a spring is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The balanced action system is sometimes called a since there is no clutch holding the pedal in place. The friction clutch, post and clutch, or Berlin system uses a clutch that moves along a post. When the player disengages the clutch, he frees it from the post allowing the pedal to move without restraint.\n\nAny pedal drums that are tuned using the spider system can be called Dresden timpani, though the term is most often used for drums whose design is similar to the original pedal timpani built in Dresden (see below). These drums may also be called Ringer-style timpani after G\u00fcnther Ringer, who revived the original Dresden design. Dresden timpani typically have a fine-tuning handle using to make small adjustments to the head's tension.\n\nThe drums most professional timpanists use are Dresden timpani, commonly with a ratchet-clutch or friction clutch pedal. Most school bands and orchestras below the university level use cheaper, more durable timpani. The mechanical parts of these timpani are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl of the drum. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for gigs and outdoor performances because of their durability.\n\nMissing image\n\nChain_timpani.jpg On chain timpani, a chain links the tension rods so a master handle can be used to turn them all at once.\n\nChain timpani\n\nOn chain timpani, the tension rods are connected by a chain much like the one found on a bicycle. All the screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a player is forced to place a drum behind other items so that he cannot reach it with his foot. Professional players may also use exceptionally large or small chain drums for special low or high notes.\n\nOther tuning mechanisms\n\nA rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch of the head to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on rototoms.\n\nEarly 20th century German travel timpani are tuned with a handle that connects to the base, which raises and lowers the bowl, adjusting the tension against the stationary head.\n\nTimpani heads\n\nLike most drumheads, timpani heads can be found made from two materials: animal skin (typically calfskin) and plastic (typically Mylar). Plastic heads are durable, weather resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than calfskin heads. However, many professional players prefer natural skin heads because they feel that skin heads produce a warmer, better quality timbre.\n\nTimpani sticks\n\nMissing image\n\nTimpani_sticks.jpg Timpanists use a variety of timpani sticks since each stick produces a different timbre\n\nTimpani are typically struck with a special type of drumstick fittingly called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from wood \u2013 usually hickory, cherry, birch, or maple \u2013 or bamboo, but may also be made from aluminum or graphite. The head of the stick can be constructed from a number of different materials, though felt wrapped around a wood core is the most common. Other core materials include felt and cork, and other wrap materials include leather. Sticks can also have exposed wood heads. These are used as a special effect and in authentic performances of Baroque music.\n\nAlthough it is not commonly written in the music, timpanists will change sticks \u2013 often many times within the same piece \u2013 to suit the nature of the music. Thus, most own a great number of timpani sticks. The weight of the stick, the size of the head, the materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and the method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.\n\nTimpani in the modern ensemble\n\nMissing image\n\nStandard_timpani_setup.jpg A standard set of timpani consists of four drums.\n\nA set of timpani\n\nA standard set of timpani consists of four drums: roughly 80 cm (32 in), 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) in diameter. The range of this set is roughly the D below the bass clef to the top-line bass clef A. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, Igor Stravinsky writes for the B below middle C in The Rite of Spring, and Leonard Bernstein requires the timpanist to execute both a top-line bass clef A flat and the B flat above it on the same drum in the Overture to Candide. Adding a 51 cm (20 in) piccolo timpano to the standard set of four extends the range to middle C. Beyond this extended set of five, any added drums are nonstandard. Many professional orchestras and timpanists own multiple sets of timpani consisting of both pedal and chain drums allowing them to execute music that cannot be performed correctly using a standard set of four or five drums.\n\nMany schools and ensembles that cannot afford to purchase equipment regularly only have a set of three timpani. This was the standard set until the second half of the 20th century. It consists of 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) drums. Its range extends down only to the F below bass clef.\n\nThe drums are setup in an arc or horseshoe around the performer. Traditionally, North American timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right, and German and Austrian players set them up the opposite way. Over time, that distinction has blurred: German and European players have adopted the North American layout and vice versa.\n\nTimpanists\n\nMissing image\n\nBalanced_action_timpani.jpg Balanced action timpani are used in outdoor performances because of their durability.\n\nThroughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when a timpanist is appointed to a position in a professional orchestra or concert band, he is not required to play any other percussion instruments. In his book Anatomy of the Orchestra, Norman Del Mar writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\"\n\nMost pieces of music call for one timpanist playing one set of timpani. However, occasionally composers seeking a thicker texture or a greater palette of pitches ask for multiple players to perform on one or many sets of timpani. Gustav Mahler writes for two timpanists in Symphonies 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Gustav Holst uses two timpanists to achieve the range of notes needed to echo the main theme in \"Jupiter\" from The Planets suite. Two timpanists is relatively common in late Romantic and 20th century works for large orchestras, but the early Romantic composer Hector Berlioz took multiple timpanists to the extreme in his Requiem, which calls for eight pair of timpani played by ten timpanists! Template:Listen\n\nTimpani concertos\n\nAlthough it is not common, there have been concertos written for timpani. The 18th century composer Johann Fischer wrote a symphony for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. In the year 2000, American composer Philip Glass wrote his Concerto Fantasy for two timpanists and orchestra, which has its two soloists playing a total of nine or more timpani.\n\nPerformance techniques\n\nStriking the drum\n\nFor general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately 4 inches in from the edge. Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani.\n\nA timpani roll is executed simply by rapidly striking the drum, alternating between left and right sticks. Timpanists do not use multiple-stroke rolls like those played on the snare drum.\n\nThe tone quality of the drum can be altered without switching sticks or fiddling with the tuning of the drum. For example, by playing closer to the edge of the head, the sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by beating the drum with the heads of the sticks as close together as possible. When playing rolls, the sticks are placed farther apart to cause as much of the head as possible to vibrate. There are many more variations in technique a timpanist uses during the course of playing to produce subtle timbral differences.\n\nOccasionally, composers will ask the timpanist to strike the drum at specific spots. [[B\u00e9\u00ac\u00a1 Bart\u00f3\u00ab\u009d\u009d writes a passage \"to be played at the edge of the head\" in his Violin Concerto.\n\nTuning\n\nPrior to playing the instruments, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot on the head is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpano will produce a beautiful, in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch of the drum will rise or fall after the initial impact, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels.\n\nMissing image\n\nTimpani_tuning_gauges.jpg Tuning gauges visually indicate the position of the pedal so the performer can determine the drum's pitch without listening to it.\n\nIn performance, tuning is typically accomplished with a method called interval tuning. Timpanists who are not blessed with absolute pitch obtain a reference pitch from a tuning fork, pitch pipe, or even a note played by another instrument in the course of the performance, then use musical intervals to arrive at the desired note. For example, to tune the timpani to G and C, a timpanist may sound an A with a tuning fork, then sing (or think) a minor third above that A to tune the C, and then sing a perfect fourth below the C to tune the G. Timpanists are required to have a very well developed sense of relative pitch.\n\nSome timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the drum's pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges can be useful. However, every time the drum is moved, the overall pitch of the head changes, thus the pitches must be re-marked on the gauges before every performance. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves blind tuning changes, or tuning changes that do not allow the player to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Many good timpanists prefer to tune by ear and will rely on gauges only if absolutely necessary.\n\nTimpanists are commonly required to tune in the middle of a piece of music, thus all timpanists must develop techniques to tune undetectably and accurately in the midst of other music.\n\nOccasionally, players use the pedals to retune a drum while playing it. Portamento effects can be achieved by changing the pitch of the drum while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a glissando, though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low notes to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani, both playing glissandos at the same time, in his Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\"). Template:Listen\n\nPedaling refers to changing the pitch of the drum with the pedal; it is an alternate term for tuning. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where the performer must change the pitch of a drum in the midst of playing \u2013 for example, playing two consecutive notes of different pitches on the same drum. In Samuel Barber's Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance, the timpanist must play A\u266f\u2013B\u2013C\u266f\u2013D in consecutive sixteenth notes. There is no way to place this passage across a common set of four drums, thus the timpanist must use the pedal to change the notes while playing. Template:Listen\n\nMuffling\n\nMuffling or dampening is an implicit part of playing timpani. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early drums did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often just wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without worrying about the sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score of the piece to determine the actual length the note should sound.\n\nThe typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration of the drumhead without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.\n\nMuffling is often referred to as muting, which can also refer to playing the drums with mutes on them (see below).\n\nSpecial effects\n\nIt is typical for only one timpano to be struck at a time. Occasionally, composers will ask for two notes to be struck at once. This is called a double stop . Ludwig van Beethoven uses this effect in the slow movement of his Ninth Symphony.\n\n. Ludwig van Beethoven uses this effect in the slow movement of his Ninth Symphony. Although timpanists only have two hands, it is possible to play more than two timpani at once. One way to do this is by holding two sticks in one hand much like a marimbist. Another is by adding the hands of more timpanists. Hector Berlioz achieves fully voiced chords on timpani in his Requiem (\"Grande messe des morts\") by employing eight timpanists, each playing a pair of timpani.\n\nWhen the timpani are struck directly in the center of the head, the drums have a sound that is almost completely devoid of tone. George Gershwin uses this effect in An American in Paris .\n\n. Often, when one drum is struck, another will vibrate quietly. In orchestral playing, timpanists must actively avoid this effect, but many composers have exploited this effect in solo pieces, such as Elliot Carter's Eight Pieces for four timpani.\n\nSometimes composers will specify that timpani be played con sordino ( with mute ) or coperti ( covered ), both of which indicate that mutes should be placed on the head. Timpani mutes are typically small, rectangular pieces of felt or leather. The degree the head is dampened can be altered by placing the mute at different spots on the head. Barber specifies that the timpani be played con sordino in a section of Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance . Mutes are also often used to dampen the sympathetic vibrations generated by external factors such as the sound produced by other instruments.\n\n( ) or ( ), both of which indicate that mutes should be placed on the head.

Barber specifies that the timpani be played in a section of . Mutes are also often used to dampen the sympathetic vibrations generated by external factors such as the sound produced by other instruments. Composers will sometimes specify that the timpani should be struck with implements other than timpani sticks. It is common in timpani etudes and solos for performers to play with their hands or fingers. Leonard Bernstein calls for maracas on timpani in both the \"Jeremiah\" Symphony and Symphonic Dances from West Side Story . Edward Elgar attempts to use the timpani to imitate the engine of an ocean liner in his \"Enigma\" Variations by requesting the timpanist play with snare drum sticks. However, snare drum sticks tend to produce too loud a sound, and since this work's premiere, the passage in question has been performed by striking the timpani with the edges of coins.\n\n.

However, snare drum sticks tend to produce too loud a sound, and since this work's premiere, the passage in question has been performed by striking the timpani with the edges of coins. Another technique used primarily in solo work is striking the copper bowls of the timpani. Timpanists tend to be reluctant to use this effect at loud dynamic levels or with hard sticks, since copper can be dented easily.\n\nOccasionally a composer will ask for an upside-down cymbal to be placed upon the drumhead and then struck, usually rolled while executing a glissando on the drum.\n\nHistory\n\nMissing image\n\nEarly_timpani_and_trumpet.jpg In the 15th century , timpani were used with trumpets as ceremonial instruments in the cavalry\n\nPre-orchestral history\n\nTimpani were brought to 13th century Europe by Crusaders and Saracens. These drums, which were small (around 20\u201322 cm or 8\u20138\u00bd in in diameter) and mounted to the player's belt, were used primarily for military ceremonies. This form of timpani remained in use until the 16th century.\n\nIn 1457, a Hungarian legation sent by King Ladislaus V carried larger timpani mounted on horseback to the court of King Charles VII in France. This variety of timpani had been used in the Middle East since the 12th century. These drums evolved together with trumpets to be the primary instruments of the cavalry. This practice continues to this day in sections of the British Army, and timpani continued to be paired with trumpets when they entered the classical orchestra.\n\nOver the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop that was tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch.\n\nTimpani in the orchestra\n\nThe composer Jean-Baptiste Lully was the first to use timpani in the classical orchestra in his 1675 opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e. Other 17th century composers soon followed suit. In music of this time, timpani are almost always tuned to the tonic and dominant notes of the piece \u2013 a perfect fourth apart. Interestingly, timpani are often treated as transposing instruments in the music of this period: the notes were written as C and G with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score.\n\nMissing image\n\nCity_trumpeteers.jpg Although by the early 19th century , timpani were most commonly found in orchestras, ceremonial trumpet and timpani ensembles still existed.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven revolutionized timpani music in the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice. For example, his Violin Concerto opens with five unaccompanied timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony pitches the timpani against the orchestra in a sort of call and response.\n\nThe next major innovator was Hector Berlioz. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used \u2013 felt-covered, wooden, etc. In several of his works, including Symphonie fantastique, he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they wanted to be sure of a true note. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.\n\nDespite these problems, composers eagerly exploited the opportunities the new mechanism had to offer. By 1915, Carl Nielsen was demanding glissandos on timpani in his Fourth Symphony \u2013 impossible on the old hand-tuned drums. However, it took B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k to more fully realize the flexibility the new mechanism had to offer. Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.\n\nFrom 1960, plastic heads have been available. These are much more reliable than the traditional vellum or calfskin heads since they do not vary much with temperature and humidity. Plastic skins also give a greater range of pitches since they will take higher tensions. However, detractors say that the tone they produce is less rounded and certainly less authentic when playing period music. In recent years, manufacturers have started producing heads made from traditional materials for use on modern pedal timpani in an attempt to recapture an authentic sound.\n\nTimpani outside the orchestra\n\nLater, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Marching timpani were heavy and awkward to play, as the drumhead was almost at the player's chest. Often, during intricate passages, all the timpani players would put their drums on the ground, and they would be played more like conventional timpani. In the early 1980s, Drum Corps International, a drum corps governing body, allowed timpani and other percussion instruments to be grounded. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the marching band's front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage.\n\nAs rock and roll bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. In 1964, Ringo Starr played timpani on the song \"Every Little Thing\" from The Beatles album Beatles for Sale. Beginning in 1969, John Bonham employed timpani both in the studio and onstage with the release of the debut Led Zeppelin album Led Zeppelin 1. Early in the next decade, progressive rock bands began utilizing all sorts of percussion instruments, including timpani. Mike Oldfield's 1973 album Tubular Bells featured timpani along with other percussion instruments that were traditionally part of the orchestra.\n\nJazz musicians also experimented with timpani. In 1964, Elvin Jones incorporated timpani into his drum kit on John Coltrane's four-part composition A Love Supreme.\n\nAs of 2005, Jonathan Haas is one of the few timpanists who is solely a soloist \u2013 he does not hold a regular seat with an ensemble. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. In fact, he released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing.\n\nRelated topics\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"}, {"url": "https://en.audiolexic.org/wiki/Timpani", "page_content": "From AudioLexic\n\nTimpani are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum, they consist of a skin called a head stretched over a large bowl commonly made of copper. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Unlike most drums, they produce a definite pitch when struck. Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra in the 17th century. Today, they are used in many types of musical ensembles including concert, marching, and even rock bands.\n\nTimpani is an Italian plural, the singular of which is timpano. However, this is rarely used in informal English speech as a timpano is typically referred to as a drum, a timpani, or simply a timp. Alternative spellings with y in place of either or both is \u2013 tympani, tympany, or timpany \u2013 are occasionally encountered in older English texts. This substitution is taken from the Latin word tympanum, from which the Italian word descends. A musician who plays the timpani is known as a timpanist. While the word timpani has been widely adopted in the English language, some English speakers choose to use the native word kettledrums. The German word for timpani is Pauken, and the French is timbales.\n\nedit] The instrument\n\nedit] The basic timpano\n\nThe basic timpano consists of a drumhead stretched across the opening of a bowl typically made of copper or, in less expensive models, fiberglass and sometimes aluminum. (By one system of classification, it is thus considered a membranophone.) The drumhead is affixed to a hoop (also called a fleshhoop), which in turn is held onto the bowl by a counterhoop, which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called tension rods placed regularly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Most timpani have six to eight tension rods.\n\nThe shape of the bowl contributes to the tone quality of the drum. For example, hemispheric bowls produce brighter tones while parabolic bowls produce darker tones. Another factor that affects the timbre of the drum is the quality of the bowl's surface. Copper bowls may have a smooth, machined surface or a rough surface with many small dents hammered into it.\n\nTimpani come in a variety of sizes from about 84 centimeters (33 inches) in diameter down to piccolo timpani of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or less. A 33-inch drum can produce the C below the bass clef, and speciality piccolo timpani can play up into the treble clef. In Darius Milhaud's 1923 ballet score La cr\u00e9ation du monde, the timpanist must play the F sharp at the bottom of the treble clef.\n\nEach individual drum typically has a range of a perfect fifth to an octave.\n\nedit] Machine timpani\n\nChanging the pitch of a timpano by turning each tension rod individually is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be called machine timpani, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a single handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nedit] Pedal timpani\n\nBy far the most common type of timpani used today are pedal timpani, which allow the tension of the head to be adjusted using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via a spider-like system of metal rods.\n\nThere are three types of pedal mechanisms in common use today:\n\nThe ratchet-clutch system uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch.\n\nsystem uses a ratchet and pawl to hold the pedal in place. The timpanist must first disengage the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. In the balanced action system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a floating pedal since there is no clutch holding it in place.\n\nsystem, a spring or hydraulic cylinder is used to balance the tension on the timpani head so that the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch. The pedal on a balanced action drum is sometimes called a since there is no clutch holding it in place. The friction clutch or post and clutch system uses a clutch that moves along a post. Disengaging the clutch frees it from the post, allowing the pedal to move without restraint.\n\nAny pedal drums that are tuned using the spider system can be called Dresden timpani, though the term is most often used for drums whose design is similar to the original pedal timpani built in Dresden (see below). Strictly speaking, a Dresden drum has a pedal that is attached at the player's side. The timpanist can move this pedal with ankle motion. A Berlin-style pedal is attached by means of a long arm to the opposite side of the drum, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch.\n\nThe drums most professional timpanists use are Dresden timpani, commonly with a ratchet-clutch or friction clutch pedal. Most school bands and orchestras below the university level use cheaper, more durable timpani. The mechanical parts of these timpani are almost completely contained within the frame and bowl of the drum. They may use any of the pedal mechanisms, though the balanced action system is by far the most common, followed by the friction clutch system. Many professionals also use these drums for gigs and outdoor performances because of their durability.\n\nedit] Chain timpani\n\nOn chain timpani, the tension rods are connected by a roller chain much like the one found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a player is forced to place a drum behind other items so that he cannot reach it with his foot. Professional players may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.\n\nedit] Other tuning mechanisms\n\nA rare tuning mechanism allows the pitch of the head to be changed by rotating the drum itself. A similar system is used on rototoms. Jenco, a company better known for mallet percussion, made timpani tuned in this fashion.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Hans Schnellar, then timpanist of the Vienna Philhamonic, developed a tuning mechanism in which the bowl is moved via a handle that connects to the base, and the head remains stationary. These drums are referred to as Viennese timpani (Wiener Pauken) or Schnellar timpani. Adams Musical Instruments developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.\n\nedit] Timpani heads\n\nLike most drumheads, timpani heads can be found made from two materials: animal skin (typically calfskin or goatskin) and plastic (typically PET film). Plastic heads are durable, weather resistant, and relatively inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than natural skin heads. However, many professional players prefer skin heads because they feel the heads produce a warmer, better quality timbre.\n\nedit] Timpani sticks\n\nTimpani are typically struck with a special type of drumstick fittingly called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from wood \u2013 usually hickory, cherry, birch, persimmon, or maple \u2013 or bamboo, but may also be made from aluminum or graphite. The head of the stick can be constructed from a number of different materials, though felt wrapped around a wood core is the most common. Other core materials include felt and cork, and other wrap materials include leather. Sticks can also have exposed wood heads. These are used as a special effect and in authentic performances of Baroque music.\n\nAlthough it is not commonly written in the music, timpanists will change sticks \u2013 often many times within the same piece \u2013 to suit the nature of the music. However, choice of stick during performance is entirely subjective and depends on the timpanist's own preference, and occasionally, the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of timpani sticks. The weight of the stick, the size of the head, the materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and the method used to wrap the head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.\n\nIn the early 20th century and before, sticks were often made with whalebone shafts, wood cores, and sponge wraps. Composers of that era often specified sponge-headed sticks. Modern timpanists execute such passages with standard felt mallets.\n\nedit] Timpani in the modern ensemble\n\nedit] A set of timpani\n\nA standard set of timpani consists of four drums: roughly 80 cm (32 in), 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) in diameter. The range of this set is roughly the D below the bass clef to the top-line bass clef A. A great majority of the orchestral repertoire can be played using these four drums. However, Leonard Bernstein requires the timpanist to execute both a top-line bass clef A flat and the B flat above it on the same drum in the Overture to Candide. Adding a 51 cm (20 in) 'piccolo timpano' to the standard set of four extends the range upwards by a few semitones. This is the instrument which Stravinsky specifies for the production of the B below middle C in The Rite of Spring -- and from which Ravel even expects a high D in L'Enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges. Walter Piston points out that \"these small drums, even if available, certainly lack the characteristic resonance and sonority of timpani\".\n\nBeyond this extended set of five, any added drums are nonstandard. Many professional orchestras and timpanists own multiple sets of timpani consisting of both pedal and chain drums allowing them to execute music that cannot be performed correctly using a standard set of four or five drums.\n\nMany schools and ensembles that cannot afford to purchase equipment regularly only have a set of three timpani. This was the standard set until the second half of the 20th century. It consists of 75 cm (29 in), 66 cm (26 in), and 61 cm (23 in) drums. Its range extends down only to the F below bass clef.\n\nThe drums are set up in an arc or horseshoe around the performer. Traditionally, North American timpanists set their drums up with the lowest drum on the left and the highest on the right, and German and Austrian players set them up the opposite way. Over time, that distinction has blurred: German and European players have adopted the North American layout and vice versa.\n\nedit] Timpanists\n\nThroughout their education, timpanists are trained as percussionists, and they learn to play all instruments of the percussion family along with timpani. However, when a timpanist is appointed to a position in a professional orchestra or concert band, he is not required to play any other percussion instruments. In his book Anatomy of the Orchestra, Norman Del Mar writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\"\n\nMost pieces of music call for one timpanist playing one set of timpani. However, occasionally composers seeking a thicker texture or a greater palette of pitches ask for multiple players to perform on one or many sets of timpani. Gustav Mahler writes for two timpanists in six of his symphonies. Gustav Holst uses two timpanists to achieve the range of notes needed to echo the main theme in \"Jupiter\" from The Planets suite. Using two timpanists is relatively common in late Romantic and 20th century works for large orchestras, although the early Romantic composer Hector Berlioz took multiple timpanists to the extreme in his 1837 Requiem, which calls for eight pairs of timpani played by ten timpanists.\n\nedit] Timpani concertos\n\nAlthough such compositions are not common, a few concertos have been written for timpani. The 18th century composer Johann Fischer wrote a symphony for eight timpani and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. In 1983, William Kraft, a well regarded American percussionist and composer, composed his Concerto for Timpani and Orchestra, which won second prize in the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards. In the year 2000, American composer Philip Glass wrote his Concerto Fantasy for two timpanists and orchestra, which has its two soloists each playing seven timpani.\n\nedit] Performance techniques\n\nedit] Striking the drum\n\nFor general playing, a timpanist will beat the head approximately 4 inches in from the edge. Beating at this spot produces the round, resonant sound commonly associated with timpani.\n\nA timpani roll is executed simply by rapidly striking the drum, alternating between left and right sticks. In general, timpanists do not use multiple stroke rolls like those played on the snare drum.\n\nThe tone quality of the drum can be altered without switching sticks or adjusting the tuning of the drum. For example, by playing closer to the edge of the head, the sound becomes thinner. A more staccato sound can be produced by beating the drum with the heads of the sticks as close together as possible. When playing rolls, the sticks may be placed farther apart to cause as much of the head as possible to vibrate. There are many more variations in technique a timpanist uses during the course of playing to produce subtle timbral differences.\n\nOccasionally, composers will ask the timpanist to strike the drum at specific spots. B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k writes a passage \"to be played at the edge of the head\" in his Violin Concerto.\n\nedit] Tuning\n\nPrior to playing the instruments, the timpanist must clear the heads by equalizing the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot on the head is tuned to exactly the same pitch. When the head is clear, the timpano will produce a beautiful, in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch of the drum will rise or fall after the initial impact, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels.\n\n\n\nIn performance, tuning is typically accomplished with a method called interval tuning. Timpanists who are not blessed with absolute pitch obtain a reference pitch from a tuning fork, pitch pipe, or even a note played by another instrument in the course of the performance, then use musical intervals to arrive at the desired note. For example, to tune the timpani to G and C, a timpanist may sound an A with a tuning fork, then sing (or think) a minor third above that A to tune the C, and then sing a perfect fourth below the C to tune the G. Timpanists are required to have a very well developed sense of relative pitch.\n\nSome timpani are equipped with tuning gauges, which provide a visual indication of the drum's pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, in which case the gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges can be useful. However, every time the drum is moved, the overall pitch of the head changes, thus the pitches must be re-marked on the gauges before every performance. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the player to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Many good timpanists prefer to tune by ear and will rely on gauges only if absolutely necessary.\n\nTimpanists are commonly required to tune in the middle of a piece of music; thus, all timpanists must develop techniques to tune undetectably and accurately in the midst of other music.\n\nOccasionally, players use the pedals to retune a drum while playing it. Portamento effects can be achieved by changing the pitch of the drum while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a glissando, though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low notes to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani glissando was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani, both playing glissandi at the same time, in his Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\").\n\n\n\nPedaling refers to changing the pitch of the drum with the pedal; it is an alternate term for tuning. In general, timpanists reserve this term for passages where the performer must change the pitch of a drum in the midst of playing \u2013 for example, playing two consecutive notes of different pitches on the same drum. In Samuel Barber's Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance, the timpanist must play A\u266f\u2013B\u2013C\u266f\u2013D in consecutive sixteenth notes. There is no way to place this passage across a common set of four drums, thus the timpanist must use the pedal to change the notes while playing. Nocturne, by Benjamin Britten, contains a longer chromatic passage using the same technique.\n\nedit] Muffling\n\nMuffling or damping is an implicit part of playing timpani. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early drums did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often just wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without worrying about the sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score of the piece to determine the actual length the note should sound.\n\nThe typical method of muffling is to place the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration of the drumhead without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.\n\nMuffling is often referred to as muting, which can also refer to playing the drums with mutes on them (see below).\n\nedit] Extended techniques\n\nedit] History\n\nedit] Pre-orchestral history\n\nArabic nakers, the direct ancestors of timpani, were brought to 13th century Europe by Crusaders and Saracens. These drums, which were small (with a diameter of about 20\u201322 cm or 8\u20138\u00bd in) and mounted to the player's belt, were used primarily for military ceremonies. This form of timpani remained in use until the 16th century.\n\nIn 1457, a Hungarian legation sent by King Ladislaus V carried larger timpani mounted on horseback to the court of King Charles VII in France. This variety of timpani had been used in the Middle East since the 12th century. These drums evolved together with trumpets to be the primary instruments of the cavalry. This practice continues to this day in sections of the British Army, and timpani continued to be paired with trumpets when they entered the classical orchestra.\n\nOver the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop that was tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch.\n\nedit] Timpani in the orchestra\n\nJean-Baptiste Lully is the first known composer to score for timpani, which he included in the orchestra for his 1675 opera Th\u00e9s\u00e9e. Other 17th century composers soon followed suit. In music of this time, timpani are almost always tuned with the tonic note of the piece on the high drum and the dominant on the low drum \u2013 a perfect fourth apart. Interestingly, timpani are often treated as transposing instruments in the music of this period: the notes were written as C and G with the actual pitches indicated at the top of the score (for example, Timpani in A\u2013D).\n\nLater in the Baroque era, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a secular cantata titled \"T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!\", which translates roughly to \"Sound off, ye timpani! Sound, trumpets!\" Naturally, the timpani are placed at the forefront: the piece starts with a timpani solo and the chorus and timpani trade the melody back and forth. Bach used this material later in Christmas Oratorio (Jauchzet, frohlocket!).\n\n\n\nLudwig van Beethoven revolutionized timpani music in the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use as in \"T\u00f6net, ihr Pauken!\". For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with five timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) pitches the timpani against the orchestra in a sort of call and response.\n\nThe next major innovator was Hector Berlioz. He was the first composer to indicate the exact sticks that should be used \u2013 felt-covered, wooden, etc. In several of his works, including Symphonie fantastique (1830), he demanded the use of several timpanists at once.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, there was a sequence of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered the tension in the head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they wanted to be sure of a true note. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason.

Many of his timpani parts require such a range of notes that it would be unthinkable to attempt them without pedal drums.\n\nedit] Timpani outside the orchestra\n\nLater, timpani were adopted into other classical music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Marching timpani were heavy and awkward to play, as the drumhead was almost at the player's chest. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and they would be played more like conventional timpani, but with a single player per drum. In the early 1980s, Drum Corps International (DCI), a drum corps governing body, allowed timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded. This was the beginning of the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs rock and roll bands started seeking to diversify their sound, timpani found their way into the studio. Starting in the 1960s, drummers for high profile rock acts like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, and Queen incorporated timpani into their music. Butch Trucks of The Allman Brothers Band usually uses a timpani set during live concerts; the timpani are especially featured in the opening of the song \"Mountain Jam.\"\n\nJazz musicians also experimented with timpani. Sun Ra used it occasionally in his Arkestra (played, for example, by percussionist Jim Herndon on the songs \"Reflection in Blue\" and \"El Viktor,\" both recorded in 1957). In 1964, Elvin Jones incorporated timpani into his drum kit on John Coltrane's four-part composition A Love Supreme.\n\nJonathan Haas is one of the few timpanists who markets himself as a soloist. Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for performing music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. In fact, he released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing.\n\nIn RIO/Avant-prog music, Moe! Staiano plays timpani for the band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum. The timpani sounds support very well the eerie and loud atmosphere of their avant-gardist music.\n\nedit] References\n\nedit] External links"}, {"url": "https://promusicvault.com/percussion-instruments/", "page_content": "Did you know that percussion instruments are thought to be the world\u2019s oldest form of manmade instrument?\n\nThis category of musical instruments (alongside the other four families of strings, woodwinds, brass, and the human voice) is also the largest, and could very well be considered the most diverse.\n\nThis guide to percussion instruments will do the following:\n\nProvide a broad overview of percussion history\n\nCover how percussion instruments work\n\nExplain the two main types of percussion instruments\n\nGive an instrument-by-instrument rundown\n\nLook at which percussion instruments tend to feature in orchestras\n\nProvide a Complete Percussion Instrument List from around the world\n\nBy the time we\u2019re done, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a newfound\u2014or deepened\u2014appreciation for these infectious instruments.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow Percussion Instruments Work & Produce Sound\n\nPercussion instruments are played by individuals referred to as percussionists.\n\nThese musicians produce sound by striking or scraping the instrument with a beater (e.g. a drumstick, or even one\u2019s hands).\n\nTypes Of Percussion Instruments\n\nThere are two main types of percussion instruments: membranophone and idiophone.\n\nMembranophone\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to remember what kind of percussion instrument \u201cmembranophones\u201d are\u2014just think of \u201cmembrane,\u201d or the thin layer that\u2019s stretched tightly over a frame.\n\nFor example, the snare drum and tom drums of a typical drum kit are membranophones.\n\nIdiophone\n\nIdiophones, on the other hand, produce sound when hit by the percussionist, due to the resulting vibrations of the entire instrument\u2014think, for example, of the cymbals of a drum kit.\n\nTuned & Untuned Percussion Instruments\n\nAlso referred to as pitched and unpitched percussion, tuned/pitched percussion can play melodies and has an adjustable pitch, whereas untuned/unpitched percussion cannot.\n\nUnpitched percussion instruments, such as snare drums, are used for their rhythmic purposes rather than tonal purposes.\n\nPitched percussion instruments, on the other hand, can provide both rhythmic intrigue as well as melodic lines.\n\nBoth pitched and unpitched percussion instruments can be either membranophones or idiophones.\n\nMost Popular Percussion Instruments\n\nThere is an incredible diversity of percussion instruments, and dozens of individual instruments in both the membranophone family and the idiophone family.\n\nFor this guide, we\u2019ll focus mainly on the better-known varieties, starting with membranophones, and then switching over to idiophones.\n\nBongos\n\nBongos are small, handheld percussion instruments that are commonly associated with Latin American music.

The drum is usually played by a single person, but can also be played in a group with multiple steel drum players. The steel drum is also portable and can be played in various settings, making it a popular choice for street performances, festivals, and concerts.\n\nFun fact: The steel drum was originally created as a replacement for traditional percussion instruments that were banned by British colonizers.

Percussion instruments usually play in the fourth section (last section) of the orchestra.\n\nA Brief History Of Percussion Instruments\n\nAt some point, one of our early ancestors hit one thing against another and appreciated the sound and/or rhythm that was produced.\n\nThis practice is so ancient and universal that drums are found in nearly every culture in the world, and have likely existed since well before 6,000 B.C.E.\n\nWe know this thanks to Mesopotamian culture, which was depicted in the Epic of Gilgamesh, featuring the following lines: \u201cCome then Enkidu, to ramparted Uruk\u2026 Where every day is set for celebration, where harps and drums are played.\u201d\n\nIn addition to their use in celebrations (think parades) and armies, percussion instruments have long served significant roles in religious practice and are particularly known for their use in sacred ceremonies.\n\nFull Percussion Instrument List:\n\nHere are some of the many percussion instruments commonly played in the Western world and elsewhere:\n\nBangzi\n\nBass drum\n\nBeatbox\n\nBell\n\nBongo\n\nBonsho\n\nBougarabou\n\nCaj\u00f3n\n\nCastanets\n\nCastanets\n\nCelesta\n\nChenda\n\nChimes\n\nChimes\n\nClapper\n\nClaves\n\nClavichord\n\nConga\n\nCowbell\n\nCymbals\n\nDadaiko\n\nDamru\n\nDavul\n\nDhad\n\nDhak\n\nDhimay\n\nDhol\n\nDholak\n\nDholi\n\nDholki\n\nDimadi\n\nDjembe\n\nDollu\n\nDora\n\nDrum\n\nDuggi\n\nEgg shaker\n\nEl bombo leguero\n\nGaku daiko\n\nGhat singhari\n\nGhumot\n\nGlockenspiel\n\nGong\n\nG\u00fciro\n\nGummeta\n\nHandbell\n\nHi-hat\n\nHyoshigi\n\nIdakka\n\nJew\u2019s harp\n\nKagura suzu\n\nKakko\n\nKane (atarigane)\n\nKanjira\n\nKhol\n\nKosika\n\nMadal\n\nMaracas\n\nMaram\n\nMardala\n\nMarimba\n\nMizhavu\n\nMokugyo\n\nMridangam\n\nMusical saw\n\nMuyu\n\nNaal\n\nNagara\n\nNgoma drums\n\nPaiban\n\nPakhavaj\n\nPambai\n\nPandeiro\n\nPatayani thappu\n\nPiano\n\nPung cholom\n\nRainstick\n\nRattle\n\nSand blocks\n\nSannotsuzumi\n\nSasara\n\nShakubyoshi\n\nShouko\n\nSleigh bells\n\nSnare drum\n\nSpoon\n\nStomp box\n\nTable\n\nTaiko\n\nTaiko of Okinawa\n\nTamate\n\nTambourine\n\nThavil\n\nThimila\n\nThumb piano\n\nTimbales\n\nTimpani\n\nTriangle\n\nTsuzumi\n\nTubular bells\n\nTumbak\n\nTurntable\n\nUchiwa daiko\n\nUdukai\n\nUdukku\n\nUrumi\n\nVibraphone\n\nWashboard\n\nWater drums\n\nWind chime\n\nWood block\n\nXylophone\n\nYotsudake\n\nYu\n\nZhu\n\nConclusion | Wrapping Up\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder why percussion is likely the oldest instrument, and continues to exercise such global appeal. We are, after all, deeply attuned to rhythm, and love moving our bodies to it. Percussion helps provide this, but not ONLY this!\n\nAs we have covered, percussion refers to a broad assortment of instruments, including pitched percussion (like the xylophone), which can play melodies.\n\nThis makes them more like the controversial piano\u2014Is it percussion? Or a stringed instrument? Or both?\u2014in that they can provide rhythm and melody.\n\nNo matter which percussion instrument you pick up, you\u2019re likely to have a fun time playing it. True mastery of these instruments, however, tends to take a lifetime.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are percussion instruments?

These include instruments that generate sound by causing a membrane or a solid object to vibrate. These musical instruments are crucial because they give a piece of music its rhythm and texture. In today\u2019s article, we\u2019ll talk about percussion instruments in a symphonic or orchestral context.\n\nUnpitched and pitched percussion are the two primary divisions within the percussion family. The snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, and tambourine are unpitched percussion instruments that make sounds without a distinct pitch. These percussion instruments can be played on their own or in a group with other percussion instruments to produce rhythm or a beat.\n\nContrarily, pitched percussion instruments emit a specific pitch or note when played. These include the xylophone, marimba, vibraphone, timpani, and glockenspiel.\n\nPiano\n\nDespite the keyboard\u2019s layout, the piano is regarded as a percussion instrument. A string inside the piano is struck by a hammer when a key is depressed, causing the string to vibrate and produce sound.\n\nThe piano is regarded as a percussion instrument because of the percussive sound made when the hammer strikes the string. Together with other percussion instruments like drums, cymbals, and xylophones, the piano is typically part of the percussion department in an orchestra or other ensemble.\n\nThe piano, however, is frequently seen as a separate entity given its unique function in the music\u2019s overall tone. Its capacity for melody, harmony, and rhythm makes it uniquely different than percussion instruments despite being included here.\n\nSnare Drum\n\nThe snare drum is a crucial percussion instrument in an orchestra and enhances the ensemble\u2019s overall sound by adding depth and color. A skin or synthetic head is wrapped over the top and bottom of the cylindrical snare drum, which can be constructed of wood or metal. Although brushes or mallets can also be used, drumsticks are most commonly employed to play the instrument.\n\nThe player usually stands or sits behind the snare drum, which is fixed on a stand. The drum produces a clear, sharp sound that sets the piece\u2019s rhythm. In addition, the snare drum is commonly used to accentuate key musical moments in an orchestral composition. It may be used to highlight a musical phrase\u2019s conclusion or mark a melodic climax.\n\nThe snare drum also produces rich textures. The drummer can use buzz rolls, press rolls, and other drum rudiments to create a variety of timbres.\n\nFor instance, to produce a loud, sharp sound, the player may utilize a rimshot, in which the stick strikes both the head and the rim of the drum. The snare wires, which are spread across the bottom of the drum, can also be used by the player to produce a buzzing, rattling sound.\n\nConcert Bass Drum\n\nProviding a strong and booming bottom sound is the concert bass drum, a sizable percussion instrument. A skin or synthetic head is stretched over the top of the concert bass drum, commonly composed of wood or metal. The drum is played by striking a padded mallet against the drum\u2019s head to produce a rich, resonant sound.\n\nThe concert bass drum is often supported by a stand or frame, with the musician positioned in front of it. The drummer frequently controls the volume and length of the sound by using a towel for dampening.\n\nThe concert bass drum frequently serves as a solid rhythmic base for the music in an orchestral composition. Particularly in slower, more epic works, the deep, resonant sound of the drum can contribute to a sense of grandeur and majesty in the music.\n\nDramatic musical effects are frequently produced by the concert bass drum as well. To develop tension and expectation before a musical climax, the performer can, for instance, employ a soft mallet to produce a deep, rumbling sound.\n\nTimpani\n\nThe timpani is a set of pitched drums that produces a deep, resonant sound. The timpani consists of two or more kettle drums with heads made of synthetic or animal skin. Timpani are often made from copper or fiberglass. Using a set of mallets and a variety of playing styles, the drummer creates a wide range of sounds and textures while sitting behind the drums.\n\nThe timpani are usually used to emphasize the ends of phrases or musical sections and produce continuous beats or rhythms in the song. The drummer may modify the drum\u2019s pitch and produce a variety of sounds by adjusting the tension of the drumhead tuning pedals on each drum.\n\nThe timpani is utilized to produce a range of distinct sounds and textures in addition to its rhythmic function. To create a smooth, prolonged sound, the player can employ various playing methods, such as rolling the drumsticks across the drum head. The timpani can also be played staccato, which creates a harsh, percussion-like sound that emphasizes key musical passages.\n\nA well-known composition incorporating timpani is Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cAlso sprach Zarathustra,\u201d which uses them to produce a bombastic, victorious sound in the opening fanfare.\n\nCymbals\n\nTwo different types of percussion instruments, suspended and crash cymbals, are utilized to create a wide range of sounds and textures.\n\nThe suspended cymbal is a metal plate mounted on a stand. A shimmering, prolonged sound is produced when the player strikes the cymbal with a stick(s) or mallet(s). This sound can be used to create a variety of various sounds. Suspended cymbals are frequently employed in orchestral music to emphasize specific musical passages, to build tension or anticipation, or both.\n\nMikeh0303 at English Wikipedia, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nCrash cymbals are unpitched percussion instruments made up of two circular metal plates held on a stand. The player uses the leather grips to hold the cymbals before crashing the two together, creating a harsh, explosive sound to emphasize musical climaxes and downbeats. Crash cymbals are frequently utilized in orchestral pieces to indicate the start or finish of a musical passage or to highlight a dramatic moment.\n\nBoth suspended cymbals and crash cymbals are powerful percussion instruments in an orchestra because they offer a variety of sounds and textures that can be employed to improve the ensemble\u2019s overall sound. However, to properly utilize the potential of these instruments, the players must possess a keen sense of timing and rhythm and the capacity to create various unique sounds and dynamics.\n\nTriangle\n\nThe triangle is a little metal percussion instrument used in orchestras that makes a brilliant, metallic sound. The triangle is made of a steel rod bent into a triangle but has one corner left unfilled. The triangle is held in place by a loop at one corner, and the musician beats the triangle with a metal beater, typically steel or brass.\n\nInstead of being a melodic or rhythmic instrument, the triangle is frequently utilized in symphonic music as an accent or punctuation. In addition, the triangle sound is used to accentuate specific musical passages and give the ensemble\u2019s overall sound a hint of glitter or sheen.\n\nThe musician must be able to manipulate the instrument\u2019s dynamics, producing quiet, delicate, loud, and forceful accents as needed by the music.\n\nTambourine\n\nThe tambourine is a percussion instrument with an edge of metal jingles and a circular hardwood or plastic frame. The tambourine is held in one hand while being shaken or struck with the other to create a rhythmic sound.\n\nThe adaptable tambourine can be utilized in orchestral music to give texture and rhythm. It frequently performs alongside other percussion instruments like the snare drum, bass drum, and cymbals, as well as orchestral instruments like strings and woodwinds.\n\nThe tambourine is frequently employed to emphasize the beat or rhythm of the music, bringing a vibrant, percussive aspect to the ensemble\u2019s overall sound.\n\nMaracas\n\nThe maracas are a pair of tiny, hand-held shakers used as percussion instruments. Usually made of wood or plastic, the shakers contain beads or seeds that rattle when shaken, giving out a rattling sound.\n\nOrchestral music frequently uses maracas to add a lively, rhythmic accent. Along with other percussion instruments like the congas, bongos, and timbales and other instruments from the orchestra, like brass and woodwinds, they are frequently used in percussion ensembles.\n\nA quick, percussive sound is produced when the maracas are typically shaken vigorously in sync with the song, bringing excitement and energy to the ensemble\u2019s overall sound.\n\nGong\n\nThe gong is a sizable percussion instrument with a flat, round metal plate that, when struck, emits a rich, resonant sound. The gong usually hangs from a frame or platform, and the sound is produced by hitting it with a mallet or cushioned hammer.\n\nIn symphonic music, the gong is frequently utilized to produce dramatic or ceremonial effects. It can be played in various ways, such as striking the gong repeatedly to create a rolling, booming sound or striking it once with great force.\n\nThe gong is frequently employed in orchestral pieces to signal the start or finish of a musical passage or to emphasize a certain musical point. In addition, the gong\u2019s sound is frequently employed in music to enhance grandeur or majesty, build suspense or anticipation, or all of the above.\n\nCastanets\n\nThe percussion instrument known as a castanet comprises two tiny, hand-held wooden shells or discs connected by a thread or cord. Castanets are struck together by the musician while holding one in each hand to create a rhythmic clicking or clacking sound.\n\nOrchestral music frequently uses castanets to add a lively, percussion-heavy flavor. They often appear alongside other percussion instruments, including tambourines, snare drums, and cymbals, as well as other orchestral instruments like guitars, mandolins, and flamenco dancers.\n\nCastanets are typically played by slapping them together in rhythm with the song while holding them between the thumb and finger of each hand. By changing the force and pace of their hand movements, the player can alter the speed and volume of the clicking or clacking sound.\n\nChimes (Tubular Bells)\n\nChimes, often referred to as tubular bells, are a type of percussion instrument made up of several metal tubes suspended from a frame or stand and have varied lengths. The tubes, usually constructed of brass or bronze, are placed on a chromatic scale, with the longest creating the lowest note and the shortest producing the highest note.\n\nA padded or hard mallet is often used to strike the tubes of the chimes, creating a loud, resonant sound that can last for a very long time. By employing various playing tactics, such as striking the tubes at multiple points or applying varying amounts of force, the player can produce a range of distinct sounds and textures.\n\nThe chimes are frequently utilized in orchestral compositions to give depth and character to the ensemble\u2019s overall sound by producing a shimmering, ethereal tone.\n\nXylophone\n\nA percussion instrument called a xylophone is made up of several wooden bars arranged in a chromatic scale, much like the keys of a piano. To create a clear, crisp sound, mallets are used to strike the bars.\n\nOrchestral music frequently uses the xylophone to add a melodic element. It is commonly used to play quick, complex passages or to give the other instruments in the ensemble a different texture.\n\nWhen playing the xylophone, the musician typically employs two mallets and strikes the bars with varying degrees of force to produce a variety of dynamics and articulations. Also, the player can create various sounds and textures by using multiple areas of the mallets.\n\nMarimba\n\nLike the xylophone in sound, the marimba is a percussion instrument with larger hardwood bars that produce a deeper and richer tone. The marimba comprises a series of wooden bars placed in a chromatic scale and pounded with mallets to make a sound.\n\nThe marimba frequently works with other percussion instruments like the snare drum, bass drum, and cymbals and other orchestral instruments like strings and woodwinds to add a melodic aspect to orchestral music.\n\nThe marimba player typically uses two or four mallets to play the instrument, enabling them to produce intricate and complicated rhythms and melodies. The player can also generate a variety of sounds and textures by using different portions of the mallets and dampening or rolling the bars to achieve various effects.\n\nVibraphone\n\nSimilar to the xylophone and marimba in sound, the vibraphone (or vibes) is a percussion instrument with metal bars and a distinctive, resonant sound produced by motor-driven rotating disks. The vibraphone is a musical instrument that makes sound by striking a set of metal bars arranged in a chromatic scale with mallets.\n\nUsually, vibraphonists use two or four mallets. The Burton grip is typically employed when four mallets are involved.\n\nGlockenspiel\n\nA series of small, tuned metal bars make up the glockenspiel, a percussion instrument hammered with mallets to produce a bright, ringing sound. The glockenspiel is frequently combined with other percussion instruments like the snare drum, bass drum, and cymbals to provide a shimmering, melodic aspect to orchestral music.\n\nflamurai, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nNotable works with the glockenspiel include Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker,\u201d which employs it to provide a mystical, glittering sound in the \u201cDance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.\u201d\n\nCelesta\n\nThe celesta is a percussion instrument made up of a keyboard and many metal plates hammered with hammers to make a sound. Although the celesta resembles a piano in appearance, it has a considerably softer, more delicate tone.\n\nThe celesta often produces a shimmering, ethereal tone that gives symphonic music depth and texture. It\u2019s frequently employed to provide the music with a whiff of nostalgia or sorrow or to evoke a feeling of magic or fantasy.\n\nTo create a quiet, bell-like sound, the celesta player often plays the keyboard with both hands while employing a mild touch. The tempo and intensity of the player\u2019s playing can be changed to produce a wide range of distinct sounds and textures."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/musical-instrument", "page_content": "Archaeology has revealed musical instruments such as pipes and whistles in the Paleolithic Period and clay drums and shell trumpets in the Neolithic Period. Ancient cultures of Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean, India, East Asia, and the Americas all possessed diverse and well-developed assortments of musical instruments, indicating that a long previous development must have existed.\n\nmusical instrument, any device for producing a musical sound. The principal types of such instruments, classified by the method of producing sound, are percussion, stringed, keyboard, wind, and electronic.\n\nMusical instruments are almost universal components of human culture: archaeology has revealed pipes and whistles in the Paleolithic Period and clay drums and shell trumpets in the Neolithic Period. It has been firmly established that the ancient city cultures of Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean, India, East Asia, and the Americas all possessed diverse and well-developed assortments of musical instruments, indicating that a long previous development must have existed. As to the origin of musical instruments, however, there can be only conjecture. Some scholars have speculated that the first instruments were derived from such utilitarian objects as cooking pots (drums) and hunting bows (musical bows); others have argued that instruments of music might well have preceded pots and bows; while in the myths of cultures throughout the world the origin of music has frequently been attributed to the gods, especially in areas where music seems to have been regarded as an essential component of the ritual believed necessary for spiritual survival.\n\nWhatever their origin, the further development of the enormously varied instruments of the world has been dependent on the interplay of four factors: available material, technological skills, mythic and symbolic preoccupations, and patterns of trade and migration. Thus, residents of Arctic regions use bone, skin, and stone to construct instruments; residents of the tropics have wood, bamboo, and reed available; while societies with access to metals and the requisite technology are able to utilize these malleable materials in a variety of ways. Myth and symbolism play an equally important role. Herding societies, for example, which may depend on a particular species of animal not only economically but also spiritually, often develop instruments that look or sound like the animal or prefer instruments made of bone and hide rather than stone and wood, even when all the materials are available. Finally, patterns of human trade and migration have for many centuries swept musicians and their instruments across seas and continents, resulting in constant flux, change, and cross-fertilization and adaptation.\n\nThe sound produced by an instrument can be affected by many factors, including the material from which the instrument is made, its size and shape, and the way that it is played. For example, a stringed instrument may be struck, plucked, or bowed, each method producing a distinctive sound. A wooden instrument struck by a beater sounds markedly different from a metal instrument, even if the two instruments are otherwise identical. On the other hand, a flute made of metal does not produce a substantially different sound from one made of wood, for in this case the vibrations are in the column of air in the instrument. The characteristic timbre of wind instruments depends on other factors, notably the length and shape of the tube. The length of the tube not only determines the pitch but also affects the timbre: the piccolo, being half the size of the flute, has a shriller sound. The shape of the tube determines the presence or absence of the \u201cupper partials\u201d (harmonic or nonharmonic overtones), which give colour to the single note. (For more on the science of sound, see acoustics.)\n\nBritannica Quiz Another Musical Instruments Quiz\n\nThis article discusses the evolution of musical instruments, their structure and methods of sound production, and the purposes for which they have been used. Although it focuses on the families of instruments that have been prominent in Western art music, it also includes coverage of non-Western and folk instruments."}, {"url": "http://tegrity.columbiabasin.edu/classes/MUS115RP/Dynamics_Lesson_12/Dynamics_Lesson_12_print.html", "page_content": "Music Dynamics\n\nIs the music loud or soft?\n\nAmplitude and Dynamics\n\nMusic without dynamic contrast is merely noise, something to be endured as background, not sought out as a destination activity.\n\nJohn Atkinson, Editor of Stereophile\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between so-called \"classical\" music (the subject matter of this MUS&105 class) and popular music is the degree of dynamic contrast between loud and soft musical sounds. Have you ever been to a rock/rap/country music concert where the music gets loud, louder, and LOUD? To the point WHERE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DYNAMIC LIGHT AND SHADE NO AURAL PUNCTUATION TO GIVE CONTRAST NO LIGHT AND SHADE TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM A RELENTLESS ASSAULT ON LISTENERS' SENSES WHICH SCREAMS AT THEM IN THE SONIC EQUIVALENT OF UPPER-CASE LETTERS SO THAT IN THE END YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TURN IT DOWN OR EVEN OFF IN OTHER WORDS TO LEAVE THE CONCERT. One of the great joys of listening to music -- either live or via a quality stereo system or headphones -- is hearing the subtle shades in dynamics in a piece. However, the elements of dynamics is often one of the most overlooked of all the elements, including melody, harmony, rhythm, etc.\n\nAmplitude\n\nThe frequency of sound, otherwise called \"pitch\" is explained in another web page lesson. In addition to a sound's frequency, which corresponds to the distance between wave peaks, a sound can be measured by its wavelengths, which corresponds to a wave's \"height\" or \"intensity\" rather than its length. This is the amplitude of the wave, and it determines the loudness of the sound, and the greater the amplitude (or height) in the waves, the greater the intensity or loudness of a sound (Freeman 88-89). At least one guitar amplifier goes up to eleven.\n\nScientists and acoustic engineers measure the intensity (volume) of sound in decibels. Musicians, however, use a more prosaic and descriptive means to determine a sound's amplitude: dynamics.\n\nDynamics\n\nDynamics in music refers to the relative degrees loudness and softness of sounds indicated in a musical score. The interpretation of each dynamic marking in a piece of music depends on the following:\n\ncomparison with other dynamics in that piece\n\ntypical dynamic range for that instrument or ensemble\n\nabilities of the performer(s)\n\ntraditions of the musical genre being performed\n\nacoustics of the performance space\n\nSource: I.M. Freeman. 1987. Physics Made Simple. New York: Double Day.\n\nDynamics Markings\n\nThe first composers to indicate dynamics markings in their scores were Italian, so the markings they used were Italian words or their abbreviations. The term piano (p) is used to indicate softness and forte (f) to indicate loudness. Each of these is augmented if the letter symbolizing it is doubled or tripled (pp - pianissimo means \"very soft\"; ppp - pianississimo means \"very, very soft\"). Each is also lessened if proceeded by mezzo (m) (mf means mezzo forte, \"somewhat loud\"). A fixed dynamic marking is one that indicates a single, unchanging level of volume until another dynamic marking appears to alter the first. Fixed dynamics range from two polarities of loud and soft, as indicated in the following dynamics chart. The dynamics terms are in Italian, which correspond to matching abbreviations. Instructions: Click the arrows to select the correct items that match the term(s) at the top. Then click the bottom right arrow to go to the next set. Click the checkmark (available on the last set) to submit all your answers.\n\nForte refers not to the decibel level (as measured by a scientist) but to the perception of loudness, which varies among different people and instruments. A violinist's intended forte may strike someone's ear as a fortissimo (ff), but it would still produce less intensity of sound than a trumpet's forte (f). What do you get when you cross Angry Birds with a volume slider?\n\nMemorize the Dynamics Markings\n\nYes, you must memorize the music dynamics terms. Complete these activities before moving on to the next webpage.\n\nGraded Dynamics\n\nWhile fixed dynamics in music impart sudden and immediate shifts in volume, graded dynamics impart a sense of music getting progressively louder or softer over time. When a composer writes a forte into a part, followed by a piano, the intent is for the music to be loud, and then suddenly soft. If the composer wants the change from one dynamic level to another to be gradual, different terms and markings are added to the musical score. A crescendo (pronounced \"cresh-EN-doe\") means \"gradually get louder\"; a decrescendo or diminuendo means \"gradually get softer.\" Crescendo and diminuendo are written out or abbreviated as cresc. or dim. A good example that illustrates graded dynamics is an orchestral work from the early twentieth century called Bol\u00e9ro, which was composed by the French composer Maurice Ravel (1875-1937). From the beginning of the work, which starts out pianissimo (pp), to the ending cadence, which is fortissimo (ff), the entire length of Bol\u00e9ro is one long, very gradual crescendo.\n\nRavel's Bol\u00e9ro Rhythm\n\nA bolero is a dance of Spanish and African origin. The steps are danced quickly, either as a solo or as a duet dance. The accompanying music is in triple meter, with a basic rhythmic pattern (ostinato) repeated continuously.\n\nThis rhythm, played on snare drums or castanets, starts the dance. Then a melody, usually played on a flute, sounds over the ostinato rhythm. Ravel's Bolero has only one melody, which is repeated throughout the entire piece, with all of the instruments of the orchestra having a turn playing the melody -- except for the instruments playing the ostinato rhythm. The theme from Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro was used in the film 10, which featured Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. View the entire video and listen for the long and gradual crescendo from the beginning of the piece to the end.\n\nBol\u00e9ro (1928) by Maurice Ravel\n\nGraded Dynamics Examples\n\nIn musical scores, crescendo and diminuendo are most often marked as hairpins, but the terms can be written out or abbreviated as cresc. or dim. The length of a hairpin corresponds to the length of the increase or decrease in volume. At the right end of the hairpin, there is a new dynamics marking indicating how loud the music should be relative to the left end. Play the music excerpts below and follow the hairpins to hear examples of graded dynamics.\n\n\"Forest Hunt\" from The Moldau by Bedrich Smetana \"Search for Spock\" from Star Trek III \"Mars, Bringer of War\" from The Planets by Gustav Holst 2nd mvt. from Surprise Symphony No. 94 by Franz Joseph Haydn \"The Castle\" from The Moldau by Bedrich Smetana \"Farandole\" from L'Arl\u00e9sienne Suite No. 2 by Georges Bizet \"Breakthrough\" from Soundtrack to Enterprise TV Series \"Peasant Wedding\" from The Moldau by Bedrich Smetana Prelude to Act III from Lohengrin by Richard Wagner\n\nGraded Dynamics in The Firebird\n\nBach on the wrong notes.\n\nSergei Prokofiev on Stravinsky's music\n\nOriginally from Russia, Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) is one of the greatest composers of the early twentieth century, whose diverse music includes piano works, ballets, symphonies, chamber pieces, choral music, and opera. His earliest \"hit\" was an orchestral composition for a ballet based on a Russian folk tale, L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird), which he later adapted into a symphonic suite. In 1910, Sergei Diaghilev, the founder of the Russian Ballet (also called \"Ballet Russe\"), commissioned Stravinsky to write the score for The Firebird. In the music, Stravinsky incorporates simple melodies and rhythms from Russian folk songs and dances, but he greatly enhances their power by using a wide range of graded dynamics and orchestral tone colors, from light-shimmering strings to powerful brass sections. Play each of the graded-dynamics segments from the Firebird finale (called \"Return to Life of the Petrified Knights, General Rejoicing\"); you can also follow the listening outline of this music on page 8 in Kamien's textbook.\n\nFirebird theme played as a legato melody by a French horn, accompanied by quiet high tremolo notes in the violins.

The tempo accelerates, with trombones and French horns playing the Firebird theme two times faster in detached notes punctuated by timpani at the end of each melodic phrase. Strings fill out the harmony with loud, continuous tremolos. Brasses repeat Firebird theme fragments several times, with the tempo slowing down slightly leading to . . . Full brass section plays Firebird theme in very loud accented notes, supported by the strings, woodwinds, and timpani. Phrases of Firebird melody are repeated as the tempo gradually decelerates, leading to . . . High tremolos in the strings; triangles with full brass section play a broad ascending and descending phrase from the Firebird theme, then another sudden break of silence, leading to . . . Full orchestra crescendo on the tonic (home) chord, with powerful timpani building to a final timpani and cymbal \"CRASH\" marking the closing cadence.\n\nComplete Firebird Graded Dynamics\n\nTerraced Dynamics\n\nThe dynamics of the music in the Baroque era (1650-1720) were more or less fixed, with the level of volume remaining constant from the beginning to end of a section or movement. Changes in dynamic levels moved up or down like steps on a terrace rather than in smooth, gradual crescendos and decrescendos. This terrace-step approach (without gradual crescendo or diminuendo) was typical of the alternation of tutti and solo instruments in a concerto grosso. Terraced dynamics are demonstrated in Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 1 in F major, performed by Karl Richter and the M\u00fcnchener Bach Orchester. In this video example, you can hear abrupt changes in dynamics between the solo instruments playing mezzo piano (medium soft) and the full orchestra playing forte (loud). ERROR NOTICE: in the video captions, the term \"fortissimo\" (very loud) should read \"forte\" (loud), although in some sections with the full orchestra, the dynamics \"fortissimo\" is correct.\n\nBrandenburg Concerto No. 1 in F Major by J.S. Bach\n\nSource: M. Thiemel: \"Dynamics.\" Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy.\n\nDynamics and Keyboard Instruments\n\nTerraced dynamics were also the result of limitations in the ability of Baroque keyboard instruments to play in graded dynamics, particular the clavichord and harpsichord. Unlike the modern piano, which can produce a broad spectrum of dynamic levels, from pianissimo to fortissimo and everything in between, the clavichord and harpsichord produce only very quiet tones or sounds of limited dynamic levels. The development from terraced dynamics to graded dynamics in classical music loosely follows the technological development of keyboard instruments, starting with the clavichord up to the modern piano. As indicated below the dynamic range markings, the dates the instruments were widely used by composers and performers are approximate; earlier keyboard instruments were still played in later periods.\n\nDevelopment of Dynamic Ranges of Keyboard Instruments\n\nFrom the Clavichord to the Modern Piano\n\n1. Clavichord\n\nThe sound of the clavichord is very soft and is often disappointing at first hearing. However, after becoming accustomed to the small tone and special touch required to make the instrument sound its best, the performer is usually won over by the extraordinary sensitivity and responsiveness of the instrument.\n\nWilli Apel, Harvard Dictionary of Music\n\nA clavichord is a small keyboard instrument popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It consists of a small shallow box without legs or stands. Behind the keyboard, the strings are attached to hitch-pins at the left side of the box, then stretch across the back ends of the keys and over the bridge to the tuning pins on the right side of the box. There are usually two strings for each key, each string being a fine wire. The sound of the clavichord are made by small brass squares, called \"tangents,\" which move up to strike the strings. The The clavichord is capable of playing a range of graded dynamics, but the degrees of loudness and softness are too subtle for anyone but the performer to hear. The loudness of the tone depends on the force the player applies to the key. The loudest possible sound (medium soft) is made by depressing the key quickly, but even at its loudest the clavichord is too quiet to be a concert instrument. It's limited power makes its a solo instrument for use in small rooms or quiet surroundings.\n\nFantasia by Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625)\n\nSource: J Gillespie. 1972. Five Centuries of Keyboard Music. New York: Dover Publications.\n\n2. Harpsichord\n\nThe harpsichord is that family of keyboard instruments which are plucked, not struck, by the key mechanism. It has served as the major string keyboard instrument for substantially longer than its descendant the piano, and still at the end of the millennium is much in use, both in early music performance and in various new applications.\n\nReid Byers, A Harpsichord Primer\n\nA harpsichord is a Baroque keyboard instrument that resembles a small grand piano but without a cast iron frame. A harpsichord uses mechanical action to pluck a string. Each key operates a wooden rod, or \"jack\" on which is mounted a plectrum made of bird quill or plastic. As the key is depressed, the jack rises and the plectrum plucks the string. To create differences in tone color and dynamic level, harpsichord builders added another keyboard (or manual) above the original set of keys.\n\nHarpsichords with two keyboards (double-manual) could play different sets of strings, one set that could produce medium loud tones and another set that could produce soft tones. Knobs or levers on the front of the harpsichord allowed the player to shift from one set of strings (called a \"choir\") to another, to dampen the strings, or to couple the strings together -- that is, to make two tones an octave apart sound with one key depressed. There was no way to produce a crescendo or diminuendo, but by using the different keyboard registers, the harpsichordist could create contrasts between loud and soft music, often making echo effects. Apart from this effect, the player has no control over the level of sound, as the string is always plucked rather than hit by a hammer or lever.\n\nSonata in G Major, K. 338 by Dominico Scarlatti\n\nSource: E.L. Kottick. 1987. The Harpsichord Owner's Guide. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press.\n\n3. Pianoforte\n\nThe essential feature of the pianoforte, the feature inscribed in its name, is its dynamic range, soft-loud or loud-soft, pianoforte or fortepiano.\n\nMichael Chanan, Musica Practica\n\nIt wasn't until the Classical period of music (1750-1820) that graded dynamics in music were written in the music and realized by the performers, largely from the efforts of an Italian harpsichord maker named Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731). In 1709 Cristofori devised a pressure-sensitive hammer mechanism, which superseded the harpsichord's plucking mechanism, allowing his new invention to strike the strings with hammers instead of plucking them with quills. He called his invention a gravicembalo col piano e forte (harpsichord with [graduated] soft and loud). The name of Cristofori's instrument eventually became abbreviated to pianoforte (\"soft-loud\") also called a fortepiano in reference to its ability to play a wider range of graded dynamics compared to the harpsichord or clavichord. The instrument today called the \"piano\" was originally called the \"pianoforte.\" When the piano key is depressed, the hammer strikes the string and immediately falls back to its resting place, allowing the string to vibrate and sound until the key is released, activating a damper to silence the string. The first Baroque composers to write music were Dominico Scarlatti (1685-1757) and Lodovico Giustini (1685-1743) who both wrote many sonatas for the pianoforte.\n\nSonata in A Major, K. 209 by Dominico Scarlatti\n\nSource: J Gillespie. 1972. Five Centuries of Keyboard Music. New York: Dover Publications.\n\n4. Modern Piano\n\nAfter Cristofori's invention of the hammer action, which enabled the performer to play a range of graded dynamics, the pianoforte continued to improve it dynamic range and power. The modern piano has strings of steel and copper attached to a cast iron frame that allows for longer strings and greater string tension compared to that of the harpsichord pianoforte, which had only a wooden frame. The longer strings in the bass and the high-tensioned short strings in the treble greatly expanded the the octave range as well as the dynamic range, from pianissimo to fortissimo and beyond. Modern pianos have 88 keys (just over seven octaves) and come in two types: uprights and grands. Most upright pianos are 42 to 50 inches high, while grand pianos range from 4 feet to 9 feet, or longer. The typical concert grand piano is 9 feet in length and has enough power to be heard above a full orchestra and project sound to the furthest seat in a concert hall. The Columbia Basic College Foundation recently purchased a Steinway D concert grand, which will be the instrument used for piano recitals in the P-building theatre. Most people don't realize that a tier 1 concert grand may cost as much as a median priced home in Kennewick.\n\nComparisons of Keyboard Dynamics\n\nRoll your mouse cursor over the keyboard icons to play sample keyboard pieces and compare the dynamic ranges of the clavichord, harpsichord, and fortepiano to a modern Steinway D.
