With its cleverly constructed narrative, sharp dialogue, and exploration of deception and human psychology, the film stands as a gripping entry in the genre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story follows Margaret Ford, played by Lindsay Crouse, a successful psychiatrist who becomes embroiled in the world of con artists after meeting a charismatic and manipulative gambler, Mike, portrayed by Joe Mantegna. As Margaret becomes more entangled in a web of lies and deceit, she finds herself questioning her own beliefs and morality, leading to a thrilling and unexpected climax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the film's standout aspects is its tightly woven and intelligently crafted screenplay, written by David Mamet. The dialogue is sharp, filled with twists and turns, and layered with subtext, keeping the audience guessing and engaged throughout. Mamet's exploration of the art of deception and the power dynamics between the characters adds depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Crouse delivers a compelling performance as Margaret Ford, capturing her character's transformation from a confident and rational professional to a vulnerable and conflicted woman. Joe Mantegna exudes charisma and charm as the enigmatic Mike, bringing a sense of danger and intrigue to the screen. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, adding an extra layer of tension to their interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Mamet's direction keeps the pace brisk and the tension high, maintaining a sense of unease and uncertainty. The film's atmospheric cinematography and minimalist production design contribute to its noirish tone, creating a visually striking backdrop for the narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse of Games explores themes of identity, trust, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. It delves into the psychology of manipulation and the seductive power of lies, inviting viewers to question their own perceptions of truth. The film's twists and turns keep the audience engaged, and its thought-provoking themes provide ample material for reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile House of Games may not rely on traditional action or visual spectacle, its strength lies in its intricate storytelling and examination of human behavior. It demands the viewer's attention and rewards those who appreciate a well-crafted psychological thriller that challenges conventional narrative expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, House of Games is a mind-bending psychological thriller that captivates audiences with its intricately woven plot, sharp dialogue, and compelling performances. Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna deliver standout performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. David Mamet's direction and screenplay create a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, while the film's exploration of deception and psychology adds layers of intrigue. For fans of psychological thrillers that emphasize intelligent storytelling and character-driven narratives, House of Games is a must-watch."}, {"url": "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/house-of-games-1987", "page_content": "Crouse walks through lonely night streets to the neon signs of the House of Games, a bar where she thinks she can find the gambler who has terrorized her client. She wants to talk him out of enforcing the debt.\n\nThe gambler (Joe Mantegna) has never heard anything like this before. But he offers her a deal: If she will help him fleece a high-roller Texan in a big-stakes poker game, he will tear up the marker. She does so. She also becomes fascinated by the backroom reality of these gamblers who have reduced life to a knowledge of the odds. She comes back the next day, looking for Mantegna. She tells him she wants to learn more about gamblers and con men, about the kind of man that he is. By the end of this movie, does she ever.\n\n\"House of Games\" was written and directed by David Mamet, the playwright (\"Glengarry Glen Ross\") and screenwriter (\"The Untouchables\"), and it is his directorial debut. Originally it was intended as a big-budget movie with an established director and major stars, but Mamet took the reins himself, cast his wife in the lead and old acting friends in the other important roles, and shot it on the rainy streets of Seattle. Usually the screenwriter is insane to think he can direct a movie. Not this time. \"House of Games\" never steps wrong from beginning to end, and it is one of this year's best films.\n\nThe plotting is diabolical and impeccable, and I will not spoil the delight of its unfolding by mentioning the crucial details. What I can mention are the performances, the dialogue and the setting. When Crouse enters the House of Games, she enters a world occupied by characters who have known each other so long and so well, in so many different ways, that everything they say is a kind of shorthand. At first we don't fully realize that, and there is a strange savor to the words they use.\n\nThey speak, of course, in Mamet's distinctive dialogue style, an almost musical rhythm of stopping, backing up, starting again, repeating, emphasizing, all of the time with the hint of deeper meanings below the surfaces of the words. The leading actors, Chicagoans Mantegna and Mike Nussbaum, have appeared in countless performances of Mamet plays over the years, and they know his dialogue the way other actors grow into Beckett or Shakespeare. They speak it as it is meant to be spoken, with a sort of aggressive, almost insulting directness."}, {"url": "https://tubitv.com/movies/305822/house-of-games", "page_content": "We're Sorry.\n\nTubi is the largest free movie and TV streaming service in the US.

The wacky incongruity works when debuting director Mamet has tongue in cheek. But all too often he's rechewing film noir, Hitchcock twists and MacGuffins, as well as the Freudian mumbo-jumbo already masticated tasteless by so many cine-kids. He's also showcasing a bloodless performance by actress Lindsay Crouse, his wife. She's Margaret Ford, a psychiatrist and best-selling author caught up in the underworld of professional trickery. \"House\" is multi-level scam: At the top level -- the B.S. world of '80s yups and Manhattanites -- Dr. Ford is fooling the world with her pop-shrink bestseller \"Driven: Obsessions and Compulsions in Everyday Life.\" And down in the metaphorical scam basement, a group of con artists (time-warped from Prohibition-era Chicago) plies its trade. Apparently, they have all seen \"The Sting.\" The fascinated Dr. Ford goes slumming -- ostensibly to help a patient friend out, then write a book about the tricks of this trade. But she's more than interested in chief con man Mike (Joe Mantegna) and learning, as he puts it, in \"things about yourself that you'd rather not know.\" The film takes on more authority with Mantegna's appearance as the dark, smoothie prince of deception. His five-o'clock-stubbled Mike pushes Crouse into the realm of human response, but when she's on her own, she has the glacial facial quality of a Liv Ullman, without the vulnerability. It's hard to tell whether she's misdirected or tired. The limited fun comes in the abundance of one-liners, only some of them intentional. \"Let's talk turkey,\" says Crouse when she, a well-dressed professional, confronts Mike in his dark and seedy bar. \"You came back like a dog to its own vomit,\" snaps Mike at Dr. Ford. Later, after being shot at, he says: \"Thank you sir, may I have another?\" You may not want another."}]}
