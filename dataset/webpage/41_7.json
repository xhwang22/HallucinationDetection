You will\n\nactually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs\n\nshould somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is\n\nnow the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair.\n\nPeople freak out. (horrified) \"There was a hair, in the egg salad!\"\n\n[Jerry's Apartment]\n\nGeorge sits on the couch with a newspaper, Jerry stands.\n\nGEORGE: Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You\n\nthink they do the flamenco?\n\nJERRY: I would think.\n\nGEORGE: So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for\n\nDinner and a flamenco?\n\nJERRY: (scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.\n\nGEORGE: Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.\n\nJERRY: Yeah? Would you do it?\n\nGEORGE: Yes, I think I would.\n\nJERRY: Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the\n\ndance of a very proud people.\n\nThe phone rings. Jerry answers.\n\nJERRY: Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright,\n\nokay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.\n\nHe hangs up the phone.\n\nJERRY: I have to go over to my grandmother's.\n\nGEORGE: What for?\n\nJERRY: I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.\n\nGEORGE: So, what, no lunch?\n\nJERRY: No, we have time.\n\nGEORGE: Oh. How's she doing?\n\nGeorge rises, and he and Jerry collect their jackets and make their way\n\nto the door.\n\nJERRY: Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has\n\nDifficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.\n\nGEORGE: Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups.\n\nThey\n\nshould make it in a tube.\n\nJERRY: Like toothpaste?\n\nGEORGE: Ya-hah.\n\nJerry and George leave.\n\n[Street]\n\nJerry and George stroll along, continuing their conversation.\n\nJERRY: There's a squeeze ketchup.\n\nGEORGE: I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.\n\nJERRY: Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason\n\nthat they make squeeze ketchup?\n\nGEORGE: Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.\n\nJERRY: I really don't see the difference.\n\nGEORGE: Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.\n\nJERRY: It's subtle.\n\nGEORGE: Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?\n\nJERRY: (looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.\n\nGEORGE: What?\n\nThey stop walking.\n\nJERRY: Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.\n\nGEORGE: Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?\n\nJERRY: Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.\n\nGEORGE: Really?\n\nJERRY: Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did\n\nit once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because\n\nof it.\n\nJerry smiles and waves to Elaine, who is approaching with Wendy. Elaine\n\nWaves back.\n\nELAINE: (from a distance) Hey.\n\nGEORGE: You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.\n\nJERRY: Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.\n\nGEORGE: (surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for\n\nanything.\n\nJERRY: No, I told you I admire your hearing.\n\nGeorge waves away the compliment.\n\nJERRY: No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.\n\nJerry and George walk and meet Elaine and Wendy. Wendy greets Jerry\n\nwith a kiss on the cheek, which he's not happy about. Wendy is attractive, but has\n\na real old-fashioned fifties-style hairdo.\n\nGEORGE/JERRY/ELAINE/WENDY: Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)\n\nELAINE: (to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.\n\nWendy and George shake hands.\n\nGEORGE: You're uh, physical therapist, right?\n\nWENDY: Yes.\n\nGEORGE: You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his\n\nsleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?\n\nWendy takes a brief glance at George's proffered limb. Elaine isn't\n\nhappy that George is bothering Wendy.\n\nELAINE: (warning) George.\n\nWENDY: Have you tried heat and ice on it?\n\nGEORGE: (reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.\n\nWENDY: Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for\n\nyou a little.\n\nGEORGE: (happy) Oh! Okay.\n\nWENDY: Let me give you my card.\n\nWendy fishes in her bag and hands a card to George.\n\nGEORGE: Oh, thank you.\n\nWENDY: Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye\n\nElaine.\n\nELAINE: Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.\n\nWENDY: Bye Jerry.\n\nWendy walks away down the street.\n\nJERRY: Bye.\n\nELAINE: (slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?\n\nGEORGE: What?\n\nELAINE: (pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.\n\n[Monk's]\n\nGeorge, Jerry and Elaine enter.\n\nGEORGE: I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.\n\nELAINE: She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal\n\nwith that outside of the office.\n\nGEORGE: Why not?\n\nThe trio sit down in a booth.\n\nELAINE: Because, it is what she does.\n\nGEORGE: I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting\n\nexcited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius\n\nUnless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money\n\nare involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!\n\nELAINE: George, you got a little something, right here.\n\nElaine indicates underneath George's nostrils.\n\nGEORGE: (wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so\n\nimportant...\n\nJERRY: (adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my\n\nlast kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.\n\nELAINE: Why?\n\nJERRY: Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I\n\ndon't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but\n\none step at a time.\n\nGEORGE: (regarding the menu) What're you getting?\n\nJERRY: (to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?\n\nELAINE: Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.\n\nJERRY: She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You\n\nShould say something to her.\n\nELAINE: Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.\n\nJERRY: Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like\n\nthat.\n\nELAINE: Yeah. Hah.\n\nGEORGE: Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.\n\nELAINE: No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.\n\nJERRY: What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come\n\nout with it.\n\nELAINE: (sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's\n\nright. I'll bring her over to meet...\n\nKramer enters.\n\nELAINE: (to Kramer) ...Kramer.\n\nKramer strolls over to the table.\n\nKRAMER: Hello, boys and girls.\n\nJERRY: Speak of the devil.\n\nKramer sits at the table. Elaine starts to peruse her menu, as Kramer\n\nspeaks to Jerry.\n\nKRAMER: Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.\n\nJERRY: What for?\n\nKRAMER: Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby\n\nof our building.\n\nJERRY: Why?\n\nKRAMER: So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna\n\nbe a lot friendlier.\n\nJERRY: (reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the\n\nlobby.\n\nKRAMER: Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say \"Hey,\n\nCarl!\" and he\n\nsays \"Hey, Jerry!\" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.\n\nJERRY: (still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with\n\neveryone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.\n\nKRAMER: (to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do\n\nyou wear so much eye makeup?\n\nELAINE: (to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just\n\nfine.\n\n[Nana's Apartment]\n\nLeo is in the living room, speaking with Nana, who's in another room.\n\nLEO: Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic\n\nSqueeze containers?\n\nThere is a knock at the door. Leo opens it, to reveal Jerry.\n\nLEO: (traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!\n\nJERRY: Hello, uncle Leo!\n\nLEO: What're you doing here?\n\nJERRY: Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.\n\nLEO: Yeah, me too.\n\nNana enters with a bottle of ketchup.\n\nNANA: Hello Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Hi Nana.\n\nThere's a brief pause, as Leo waits for something.\n\nLEO: Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?\n\nJERRY: Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.\n\nNANA: Ha, well, here's the bottle.\n\nNana holds out the ketchup.\n\nLEO: (grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.\n\nJERRY: (also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.\n\nJerry and Leo begin to struggle for possession of the ketchup.\n\nLEO: Give it to me.\n\nJERRY: Will you stop it.\n\nLEO: Jerry, will you give me the bottle?\n\nJERRY: Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!\n\nNANA: You should let Buddy open it.\n\nLEO: Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.\n\nLeo hands the ketchup back to Nana.\n\nNANA: Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?\n\nLEO: What fifty dollars?\n\nNANA: Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he\n\ngave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister.\n\nNana walks away out of the room again.\n\nLEO: Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.\n\nJerry is staring at Leo, with an expression of suspicion.\n\nLEO: (laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your\n\nmother fifty dollars.\n\nLeo continues to force out laughter, and Jerry continues his look of\n\nmistrust.\n\n[Lobby, Jerry's Building]\n\nElaine and Jerry wait by the elevator. Jerry is speaking to the\n\nbuilding super.\n\nJERRY: I'm just not getting any hot water.\n\nJULIO: Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your\n\nshower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Thanks, Julio.\n\nJULIO: Awright.\n\nJulio walks away as the elevator arrives. Jerry and Elaine step aboard.\n\n[Jerry's Apartment]\n\nKramer is rooting through a drawer, searching for something. The door\n\nopens and Jerry and Elaine enter.\n\nJERRY: Huh?\n\nKRAMER: (surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!\n\nJERRY: What's going on here?\n\nKRAMER: (evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.\n\nJERRY: (suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?\n\nKRAMER: Oh, I, I need a pen.\n\nJERRY: What for?\n\nKRAMER: Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough\n\nfor you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.\n\nJERRY: (accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?\n\nKRAMER: You got that straight.\n\nJERRY: I told you, forget it.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't\n\nhave the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if\n\nyou know their name!\n\nJERRY: You're robbing me.\n\nKRAMER: Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate\n\nin my program.\n\nKramer heads out the door, but Elaine intercepts him.\n\nELAINE: Wha... W.. Are you going home?\n\nKRAMER: Yeah.\n\nELAINE: Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?\n\nKRAMER: Why?\n\nELAINE: No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.\n\nKramer smiles at this. He exits, but turns to flash the smile at Elaine\n\nas he crosses the hall to his apartment. After Kramer goes into his place,\n\nElaine shuts the door of Jerry's apartment.\n\nJERRY: (removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?\n\nELAINE: Yeah, she'll be here any second.\n\nJERRY: Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer\n\nSays something. You sure you wanna go through with this?\n\nELAINE: Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her\n\nhair.\n\nThe phone rings, and Jerry picks up. Elaine removes her coat.\n\nJERRY: Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to\n\nhelp her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you\n\nremember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the\n\ntrack? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and\n\nhe was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana\n\ndoesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I\n\nthink you should. Okay, bye.\n\n[The Seinfeld's Place, Florida]\n\nMorty and Helen in the kitchen. Morty has a pencil and pad and a pocket\n\ncalculator out, doing some work.\n\nMORTY: Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to\n\nOver fifty-three years?\n\nHELEN: Oh, Morty, please.\n\nMORTY: Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And\n\nthat's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three\n\nyears, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...\n\nHELEN: Morty, will you stop it!\n\nMORTY: (determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!\n\n[Jerry's Apartment]\n\nJerry by the kitchen. The buzzer sounds, and Jerry answers.\n\nJERRY: Yeah?\n\nWENDY (O.C.): Wendy.\n\nJERRY: Come on up.\n\nElaine enters from the bathroom.\n\nELAINE: Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?\n\nJERRY: No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first\n\nopportunity to not kiss her hello.\n\nELAINE: What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's\n\nface?\n\nJERRY: It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in,\n\nyou know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part\n\nof the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.\n\nELAINE: How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?\n\nJERRY: Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.\n\nThere's a knock at the door.\n\nELAINE: (indicating) That's her. That's her.\n\nJerry holds up his hands, indicating he wants a few seconds to prepare.\n\nHe goes to the refrigerator, and indicates Elaine should let Wendy inside.\n\nElaine opens the door and Wendy enters.\n\nELAINE/WENDY: Hi/Hey.\n\nJerry has the door of the fridge open, and his head is inside the\n\nappliance.\n\nJERRY: (muffled) Hi Wendy.\n\nWENDY: Oh, hi Jerry.\n\nWendy wanders over to the fridge.\n\nJERRY: (muffled) Would you like something to drink?\n\nWENDY: Sure.\n\nJerry holds out his arm, with a bottle in his hand.\n\nJERRY: (muffled) There you go.\n\nWENDY: (taking the bottle) Ah.\n\nJerry starts to withdraw his head from the fridge, and Wendy is poised\n\nfor the kiss hello. But, just as he turns to face her, he opens the freezer\n\ncompartment and the door blocks her approach. Wendy walks away to the couch.\n\nJERRY: Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.\n\nJerry peers around the edge of the door, to see if the coast is clear.\n\nFinding\n\nthat it is, he closes the various doors of the fridge.\n\nJERRY: So, how's everything going?\n\nWENDY: Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other\n\nday, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.\n\nJERRY: Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.\n\nThere is a clunk in the hallway, as of Kramer's door opening.\n\nELAINE: Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.\n\nJerry's door opens and Kramer enters. He's holding a polaroid camera.\n\nKRAMER: Hey! Jerry!\n\nJerry turns at the call of his name, and Kramer fires off a quick shot.\n\nJERRY: C'mon, that's not fair!\n\nKRAMER: I told you I was gonna get it.\n\nJERRY: No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.\n\nKRAMER: (holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.\n\nJERRY: (throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do\n\nI care?\n\nELAINE: Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, hello.\n\nWENDY: (holds out her hand) Hi.\n\nKRAMER: (shaking hands) Yeah.\n\nKramer does looks at Wendy, and something intrigues him. He turns away,\n\nThen back again, unable to take his eyes off her hair.\n\nKRAMER: (points) You know, I really like that hairdo.\n\nJerry and Elaine both look surprised and let-down by Kramer.\n\nWENDY: (flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be\n\ntime for a change.\n\nELAINE: (hopeful) Oh, you were?\n\nWENDY: Well, I...\n\nKRAMER: (interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no.\n\nNobody wears it like that.\n\nELAINE: Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...\n\nKRAMER: No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.\n\nWENDY: Oh, well.\n\nKramer raises his camera to take a picture of Wendy and her hair.\n\nWENDY: (laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.\n\nKramer presses the button and nothing happens. He turns the camera up,\n\nto look at the front of it and it chooses to fire at that moment, dazzling\n\nKramer with the flash.\n\n[Wendy's Car]\n\nWendy drives, Elaine in the passenger seat.\n\nWENDY: So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.\n\nELAINE: Oh, Kramer.\n\nWENDY: Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?\n\nELAINE: You wanna go out with him?\n\nWENDY: Well, why not?\n\nELAINE: Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...\n\nWENDY: What, is there anything wrong with him?\n\nElaine stares off for several seconds, with a faraway look in her eyes.\n\nWENDY: Elaine?\n\nELAINE: I'm just thinking about the question.\n\n[ProFitness Physical Therapy Center]\n\nGeorge is at the counter with his cheque book. He's moving his wrist and\n\nLower arm, clearly much more comfortable.\n\nGEORGE: You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows\n\nher stuff. (he writes out a cheque)\n\nRECEPTIONIST: (perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow.\n\nGEORGE: (tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There\n\nyou go.\n\nGeorge heads for the door. The receptionist looks at George's cheque\n\nand finds it's not up to scratch.\n\nRECEPTIONIST: Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty.\n\nGEORGE: What for?\n\nRECEPTIONIST: Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is\n\n\"twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations\".\n\nGEORGE: (agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my\n\nmother to, to the chiropodist.\n\nWendy enters, carrying a file. She overhears.\n\nWENDY: What's the problem?\n\nGEORGE: (harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's\n\nappointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.\n\nWENDY: Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.\n\nWendy walks out, into another room.\n\nGEORGE: (after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy!\n\n(to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy!\n\nGeorge heads for the door.\n\nRECEPTIONIST: So. Will you be here tomorrow?\n\nGEORGE: Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!\n\nGeorge leaves, slamming the door behind him.\n\n[Lobby, Jerry's Building]\n\nKramer has covered one wall of the lobby with photographs of the\n\ntenants. They're all labeled with the appropriate name in magic marker. Kramer\n\nis just completing Jerry's name underneath the Polaroid he took earlier. Jerry\n\nand Elaine enter from the street.\n\nKRAMER: Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?\n\nElaine seems generally positive, Jerry's not so enamoured, especially\n\nby his own picture.\n\nJERRY: Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...\n\nThe Polaroid has caught Jerry with his mouth hanging open and his eyes\n\nwide. It's not flattering in the slightest.\n\nJERRY: ...You can't put that picture up.\n\nKRAMER: Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to\n\nget to\n\nknow one another.\n\nThe elevator opens and a guy (Steve) steps out. He points to Kramer.\n\nSTEVE: Hey Cosmo.\n\nKRAMER: Hey...\n\nKramer turns to the wall of pictures, searches around for the face and\n\nthen\n\npoints back. Steve makes his way to the door as Kramer speaks.\n\nKRAMER: ...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?\n\nELAINE: Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.\n\nKRAMER: (interested) Well, how do you do?\n\nA woman (Mary) has entered from the street. She stands behind Jerry and\n\nLooks through Kramer's gallery of tenants.\n\nMARY: Hello, (finds the right photo) Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.\n\nMARY: You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk\n\nto each other.\n\nKRAMER: (keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?\n\nJERRY: (not really) Yeah.\n\nMARY: Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?\n\nJERRY: Oh, sure, yeah.\n\nMARY: Thank you.\n\nMary leans across and gives Jerry a quick kiss on the cheek, then makes\n\nher way toward the door. Elaine is giggling gleefully at Jerry's discomfiture.\n\nJERRY: Oh, no!\n\n[Jerry's Apartment]\n\nJerry and Elaine enter. Jerry mad, and Elaine still giggling.\n\nJERRY: You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!\n\nELAINE: (laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...\n\nJERRY: What is so funny?\n\nELAINE: Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)\n\nThe phone rings and Jerry picks up.\n\nJERRY: Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He\n\ncouldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.\n\nJerry hangs up the phone, and turns to Elaine.\n\nJERRY: (aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!\n\nELAINE: Why?\n\nJERRY: (suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.\n\n[Lobby, Jerry's Building]\n\nJerry is collecting his mail from his mailbox. A woman (Joan) enters\n\nAnd immediately goes for the kiss hello. She's friendly and overfamiliar.\n\nJOAN: Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah.\n\nJERRY: (not as eager) Hi Joan.\n\nJOAN: How you doing?\n\nJerry backs away toward the elevator.\n\nJERRY: Pretty good.\n\nJOAN: Just pretty good? Not great?\n\nJERRY: Okay, great.\n\nJOAN: Are you happy?\n\nJERRY: Oh, I'm delighted.\n\nJOAN: Okay. Have a nice day.\n\nJERRY: You too.\n\nThe elevator comes down, the door opens and another woman (Louise)\n\nemerges, with a big friendly smile for Jerry.\n\nLOUISE: Hi Jerry.\n\nLouise also kisses the less than happy looking Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Hi, Louise.\n\nLouise walks on and the unhappy Jerry enters the elevator.\n\n[Jerry's Apartment]\n\nJerry has just arrived with his mail. The door opens and Kramer darts\n\ninto the room.\n\nKRAMER: Hey.\n\nJERRY: Ah, well. Thank you very much!\n\nKRAMER: For what?\n\nJERRY: (agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like\n\nRichard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long,\n\nboring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!\n\nKRAMER: You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of\n\nloneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.\n\nJERRY: Family?\n\nKRAMER: Yeah.\n\nJERRY: You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle\n\nPay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in\n\nnineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut\n\nher up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be\n\ncalled. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what\n\nthe consequences are.\n\nAs Jerry reaches the end of his emphatic declaration, Kramer takes\n\nJerry's head in his hands, leans in and plants a big kiss right on Jerry's lips.\n\nHalfway through the kiss, the door opens and George half-enters. Kramer\n\nreleases Jerry, who stands bug-eyed with shock. George stands silently in the doorway,\n\nhe looks from Jerry to Kramer, with a thoughtful expression. Biting his lips,\n\nGeorge slowly backs out of the door and closes it behind him.\n\n[ProFitness Physical Therapy Centre]\n\nGeorge enters, and the receptionist spots him.\n\nRECEPTIONIST: Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch\n\nwith you. Wendy can't make her appointment.\n\nGEORGE: What d'you mean?\n\nRECEPTIONIST: She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left\n\nA message on your machine. You didn't get it?\n\nGEORGE: When did you leave the message?\n\nRECEPTIONIST: Few hours ago.\n\nGEORGE: (pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice\n\nfor a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.\n\nRECEPTIONIST: Look, Mister Costanza...\n\nGEORGE: Will that be cash, or cheque?\n\nGeorge gives an exaggerated wink.\n\n[Wendy's Car]\n\nWendy driving into New York at night with Elaine as passenger. Elaine\n\nis wearing much of her ski gear - woolly hat, with goggles on top of her head, and\n\nthere are ski poles on the back seat.\n\nWENDY: I am really glad I took the day off.\n\nELAINE: Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.\n\nWENDY: Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.\n\nELAINE: Ugh, the hell with 'em.\n\nWendy and Elaine share a laugh. Wendy then starts to pull the car over\n\nto the side of the road.\n\nELAINE: What're you stopping here for?\n\nWENDY: I'm dropping you off.\n\nELAINE: (pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.\n\nWENDY: Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the\n\nWay around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one\n\nway...\n\nELAINE: Yeah, but it's only three blocks.\n\nWENDY: Right. It's only three blocks.\n\nELAINE: (unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...\n\n[Street]\n\nElaine struggles along the sidewalk at night with her ski gear in her\n\narms. She's not finding it easy fighting with the uncomfortable bulk of skis,\n\npoles, boots, etc.. Eventually she drops the boots and, rather than pick them\n\nup, simply kicks them along in front of her.\n\n[Street]\n\nJerry and Elaine walk together.\n\nELAINE: She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a\n\nsudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?\n\nJERRY: Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.\n\nELAINE: I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as\n\nif I was hitch-hiking and she says \"Well, this is as far as I can take you.\"\n\nJERRY: I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car\n\nWith someone with a hairdo like that.\n\nELAINE: I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I\n\npinched a nerve in my shoulder.\n\nJERRY: You should have her work on it for you.\n\nELAINE: Yeah, alright, I gotta go.\n\n[Lobby, Jerry's Building]\n\nJerry enters his building. Mary spots him from across the lobby and\n\ncloses for a kiss hello.\n\nMAR: Hi Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Hi Mary.\n\nJerry backs away from the kiss with so much effort that he's up against\n\nThe mailboxes.\n\nJERRY: Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry.\n\nIt's nothing personal....\n\nMary looks upset by Jerry's outburst.\n\nJERRY: ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThe door to the street opens and Louise enters, also friendly and\n\naiming for the kiss hello.\n\nLOU: Hi Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Hi Louise...\n\nJerry backs sharply away from Louise as she leans in for the kiss.\n\nJERRY: ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss\n\nHello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it.\n\nIt's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm\n\nsorry.\n\nJerry backs into the elevator.\n\nJERRY: (as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n[Jerry's Apartment/The Seinfeld's Place, Florida]\n\nJerry answers the phone.\n\nJERRY: Hello.\n\nHELEN (V.O): Jerry?\n\nJERRY: Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?\n\nIn Florida, Helen is on the phone and Morty is still working out\n\nfigures with a pad and a calculator.\n\nHELEN: Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.\n\nMORTY: No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll\n\nslip up.\n\nHELEN: Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.\n\nJERRY: Okay, I will.\n\nMORTY: D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund\n\nFor fifty-three years...\n\n[Hall Outside Jerry's Apartment]\n\nJerry and Kramer emerge from their apartments.\n\nKRAMER: What's up?\n\nJERRY: (locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing\n\nhome.\n\nKRAMER: Oh.\n\nThey walk together down the hall.\n\n[Lobby, Jerry's Building]\n\nThe elevator doors open and Jerry and Kramer come out. Something on the\n\nWall opposite catches Jerry's eye.\n\nJERRY: Hey, Kramer, look at this.\n\nJerry points and walks over to Kramer's gallery, Kramer following.\n\nJERRY: Look at my picture!\n\nThe photograph has been crudely vandalised with a magic marker.\n\n'Grade-A Dork' has been written on the forehead, whiskers, spots, horns and a wormlike\n\ntongue added and teeth blacked out.\n\nJERRY: I've been defaced!\n\nKRAMER: Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.\n\nBehind Kramer a guy (Jack) has entered the building. Jack walks up\n\nbehind Kramer and slaps him on the shoulder in a friendly fashion.\n\nJACK: Hey. Hi Cosmo.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?\n\nJERRY: Hi Jack.\n\nJack gives Jerry an unfriendly look and walks to the elevator without\n\nreplying. Julio comes out of the elevator, and Jerry walks over to ask him\n\nsomething.\n\nJERRY: Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today,\n\nYou think?\n\nJULIO: Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to\n\npeople, huh?\n\nJERRY: (defensive) No no, that's not true!\n\nJULIO: (accusing) Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld,\n\nmaybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each\n\nother.\n\nJulio stalks away. Jerry swings to give Kramer a look.\n\n[Knollridge Nursing Home]\n\nJerry is talking with a nurse on the porch.\n\nNURSE: Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.\n\nJERRY: You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here,\n\nBecause he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.\n\nNURSE: Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to\n\nlive next door to her.\n\nJERRY: Buddy?\n\nNURSE: Yes, that's his name. He's right over there.\n\nThe nurse indicates an elderly guy with a white moustache, wearing a\n\ncap and reading a newspaper on a bench outside.\n\n[ProFitness Physical Therapy Centre, a typical doctor's office with magazines, reception chairs, light walls. Please note, you can see nothing Beyond The Office Door, or into the actual examination room]\n\nGeorge is talking with Wendy at the counter.\n\nWENDY: (smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some\n\npersonal\n\nbusiness that day.\n\nGEORGE: (irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine.\n\nIs that it? You're a delicate genius!\n\nBehind George, Elaine has slipped in the door.\n\nWENDY: A delicate genius?\n\nGeorge spots Elaine.\n\nGEORGE: Elaine?\n\nELAINE: (surprised) George!\n\nGeorge stalks past Elaine and exits.\n\nGEORGE: (leaving) Hah. Good luck.\n\nWENDY: What's going on?\n\nELAINE: (feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when\n\nYou dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles\n\nand everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm.\n\nDo you think you could give me some treatment?\n\nWENDY: Oh sure. You have insurance, right?\n\nELAINE: (shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?\n\nBehind Elaine, George is standing in the open door\n\nGEORGE: Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the\n\ncounter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a\n\nmountain?\n\nWENDY: How did you hear that?\n\nGEORGE: I hear everything.\n\nWENDY: I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere,\n\nhmm?\n\nELAINE: Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah. Let's go.\n\nElaine and George, united, head for the door. AS they get there, Elaine\n\nturns to deliver her parting shot.\n\nELAINE: (pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about\n\nthat hair.\n\nWENDY: Why, what's wrong with my hair?\n\nELAINE: Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to\n\nreceptionist) Uh, tell her.\n\nRECEPTIONIST: She's right.\n\n[Nursing Home]\n\nJerry and Buddy sit on the bench, reminiscing.\n\nJERRY: So you were with him that day at the track?\n\nBUDDY: Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.\n\nJERRY: Leo?\n\nBUDDY: Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used\n\nto steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?\n\nJERRY: Is that so?\n\nBUDDY: And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a\n\nHundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I\n\ntell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!\n\nJERRY: Well, that's very interesting.\n\nJust then, uncle Leo strolls up the path to the nursing home. Jerry\n\nspots his arrival.\n\nJERRY: (standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours.\n\n(indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and\n\nGrandpa at the track.\n\nLeo's caught out, and looks worried.\n\nLEO: (defensive) One second...\n\nJERRY: (with a triumphant point) You're busted!\n\n[Lobby, Jerry's Building]\n\nJerry enters from the street. Steve is in the lobby, collecting his\n\nmail. Jerry decides to be friendly.\n\nJERRY: Hey, Steve. How you doing?\n\nSteve turns to Jerry, gives him a disdainful look, and turns away\n\nagain. Another guy (Jeff) approaches from within the building. Jerry tries the\n\nfriendly approach again.\n\nJERRY: Hey, Jeff. What's happening?\n\nJeff completely blanks Jerry and goes to get his mail. Jerry spots Mary\n\nover by Kramer's gallery wall, and walks across to her.\n\nJERRY: Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.\n\nMary moves to avoid Jerry.\n\nJERRY: Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!\n\nMARY: (contemptuous) Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and\n\njust get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody!\n\nJerry looks downcast. Mary walks over to the mailboxes, where she\n\ngreets Jeff and Steve.\n\nJEFF: Hi Mary.\n\nMARY: Hi Jeff. How are you?\n\nMary and Jeff kiss hello.\n\nMARY: Hi Pete. How you doing?\n\nMary and Pete kiss hello.\n\nPETE: Hey, let's go get some coffee.\n\nJEFF: Great idea.\n\nMARY: Oh, that'd be great.\n\nThe three of them exit together chatting happily, watched by a rueful\n\nJerry. Jerry looks at his photo on the wall and adjusts it so it's straight.\n\nThen Jerry notices the elevator is about to go up, so he asks a favour of the\n\noccupant as\n\nhe crosses the lobby.\n\nJERRY: Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...\n\nBut Paul makes no move to hold the door, which shuts in Jerry's face.\n\n[Hall Outside Kramer's Apartment]\n\nJerry, wearing a bathrobe and with a towel round his neck, knocks at\n\nKramer's door. Kramer takes a quick peek through the peephole, then opens the\n\ndoor.\n\nKRAMER: Hi.\n\nJERRY: Hey. Could I use your shower?\n\nKRAMER: What, again? You took one this morning.\n\nJERRY: (pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.\n\nKRAMER: I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment)\n\nLittle problem.\n\nKRAMER: (leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?\n\nKRAMER: No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's\n\nterrible. No,\n\nwe're done.\n\nA happy looking guy pushes his way past Kramer and out of the\n\napartment.\n\nGUY: I'll go get some more beer.\n\nKRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of\n\nthose blue corn chips.\n\nAn attractive redheaded woman comes along the hallway. Kramer greets\n\nHer approach.\n\nKRAMER: Hey.\n\nSTEFANIE: Hi Cosmo.\n\nKRAMER: Hi.\n\nSTEFANIE: (kisses Kramer hello) Mmmwah.\n\nKRAMER: Ooh, I like that.\n\nJERRY: (impressed) Who's that?\n\nKRAMER: Stefanie. 2-G.\n\nJERRY: Oh man.

Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: \"Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch.\" According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two!

The Casting Director, a woman, is sitting across from them on a couch. Jerry is in the back, standing and looking through the window. There's a box of raisins on the coffee table.)\n\nSTU: (to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.\n\nGEORGE: (to Jay) What do you think it is?\n\nJAY: It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: O.K. guys, are we ready to start?\n\nJERRY: Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.\n\n(George sits down next to Stu and Jay, and grabs a magazine and the box of raisins. Jerry walks over to Goerge and sits next to him.)\n\nSTU: Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.\n\nJAY: He must be worried about the fall schedule.\n\nSTU: Ah, it's a real bear.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?\n\nSTU: Yeah. Right.\n\n(the casting director enters with an actor)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)\n\nMARK: Hey how you doing?\n\nJERRY: (thinking) They've gotta be kidding.\n\nGEORGE: (thinking) This guy's perfect.\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.\n\nMARK: Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: No. Why?\n\nMARK: Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: \"Vandelay Industries\".\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: I'm Vandelay Industries?\n\nMARK: Right.\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: What is that?\n\nMARK: You're in latex.\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: What do I do with latex?\n\nMARK: I don't know, you manufacture it.\n\n(scene cuts)\n\n(the casting director enters with another actor)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses)\n\nALL: Hi Michael. How you doing?\n\nJERRY: Everything all right?\n\nMICHAEL: I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: Any questions?\n\nMICHAEL: Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?\n\nGEORGE: No, not a loser!\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?\n\nMICHAEL: A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: So?\n\nMICHAEL: Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: He was what?\n\nMICHAEL: He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: That's a massage.\n\nMICHAEL: I think it moved.\n\n(scene cuts)\n\n(the casting director enters with a beautiful actress)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: This is Melissa Shannon.\n\nMELISSA: Hi.\n\nALL: Hi. How you doing.\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: Melissa is reading for Elaine.\n\nMELISSA: It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.\n\nJERRY: No you didn't. He knows he's bald.\n\nMELISSA: So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)\n\nJERRY: (getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.\n\nMELISSA: Oh, great.\n\n(the casting director leaves the chair to Jerry. Jerry sits in front of Melissa and slides the chair very close to her)\n\nJERRY: Alright, want to start?\n\nMELISSA: Yeah.\n\nJERRY: O.K.\n\nMELISSA: Ahem. What was that look?\n\nJERRY: What look?\n\nMELISSA: That look you just gave me?\n\nJERRY: I gave a look?\n\nMELISSA: Yes.\n\nGEORGE: Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: Let's see some more Kramers.\n\n(We see many short scenes with a wide variety of fat, tall, or small actors opening the door like Kramer does. Finally enters Tom Pepper, the guy that will get the role of Kramer)\n\nALL: Hi. How you doing?\n\nTOM: (to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?\n\nJERRY: (smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.\n\n(scene cuts)\n\n(Tom and the casting director are into a scene)\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: What is this about?\n\nTOM: (standing) Levels.\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: Levels?\n\nTOM: Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt.\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?\n\nTOM: Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)\n\nGEORGE: Very nice\n\nJERRY: Very good\n\nGEORGE: Very nice Tom, that was terrific.\n\nTOM: May I? (pointing the box of raisins)\n\nGEORGE: Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)\n\nJERRY: (to George) It was a wonderful reading.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah. Really.\n\nTOM: Well, bye.\n\nGEORGE: Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)\n\nSTU: Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.\n\nJERRY: Yeah, I liked him.\n\nGEORGE: What happened to the raisins?\n\nJAY: Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!\n\nGEORGE: Did he just steal the raisins?\n\nSTU: You think he stole them?\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: (enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.\n\nJERRY: (to Kramer) What are you doing here?\n\nCASTING DIRECTOR: You two know each other?\n\nSTU: Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.\n\nKRAMER: That's true.\n\n(Jerry and George look at each other. They're gonna let Kramer have a shot at it. Kramer unfold the script and smile at Jerry and George, very confident.)\n\nKRAMER: (acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?\n\nSTU: I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.\n\nKRAMER: Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)\n\n(We see Kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall, and opening the bathroom's door. Someone in there says: \"Sorry buddy, full house.\" We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant: \"Sorry, customers only\" ...running into a movie theater: \"Hey you need a ticket!\" ...running through the park...)\n\n(scene ends)\n\n[setting: Monk's]\n\n(Jerry and Elaine at a booth)\n\nELAINE: So who's playing Elaine?\n\nJERRY: Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.\n\nELAINE: Really?\n\nJERRY: Yes.\n\nELAINE: Who is it?\n\nJERRY: She's an eskimo, actually.\n\nELAINE: Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)\n\nJERRY: She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.\n\nELAINE: Listen, was Russell at the casting?\n\nJERRY: No, he didn't show up.\n\nELAINE: You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?\n\nJERRY: No. No you're not.\n\nELAINE: Why do I keep setting you up?\n\nJERRY: I don't know.\n\nELAINE: (to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.\n\nJERRY: Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?\n\nELAINE: Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.\n\nJERRY: Beside that. Look at the waitresses.\n\nELAINE: Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)\n\nJERRY: What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?\n\nELAINE: Ah...\n\nJERRY: I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?\n\nELAINE: Yes, I would say.\n\nJERRY: What's going on here. How is that possible?\n\nELAINE: Do you think it's a coincidence?\n\nJERRY: No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.\n\n(the waitress finally came with the coffee)\n\nELAINE: (to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?\n\nWAITRESS: He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)\n\nELAINE: You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?\n\nJERRY: Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.\n\n(scene ends)\n\n[setting: doctor's clinic]\n\nGEORGE: You see, It's right here. It's all white...\n\nDOCTOR: Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.\n\nGEORGE: You've never seen this before?\n\nDOCTOR: I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)\n\nGEORGE: (dramatically) A what?\n\nDOCTOR: A biopsy.\n\nGEORGE: A biopsy?\n\nDOCTOR: Yeah.\n\nGEORGE: Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?\n\nDOCTOR: Well I don't know what it is.\n\n(scene ends)\n\n[setting: Jerry's]\n\nGEORGE: A biopsy!\n\nJERRY: What did he say?\n\nGEORGE: He said he didn't know what it was.\n\nJERRY: Alright. So?\n\nGEORGE: When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a \"get outta here\". That's what I wanted to hear: \"Cancer? Get outta here?\"\n\nJERRY: Well, maybe he doesn't have a \"get outta here\" kind of personality.\n\nGEORGE: How could you be a doctor and not say \"get outta here\"? It should be part of the training at medical school: \"Cancer? Get outta here!\" \"Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?\" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)\n\nJERRY: Can't you at least die with a little dignity?\n\nGEORGE: No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?\n\n(Kramer enters)\n\nJERRY: Hey. What happened to you yesterday?\n\nKRAMER: I got mugged.\n\nGEORGE: You got mugged?\n\nJERRY: Mugged?\n\nKRAMER: Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.\n\nJERRY: Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?\n\nKRAMER: It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...\n\n(door buzzer)\n\nJERRY: Yeah?\n\nELAINE: It's me.\n\nJERRY: Come on up.\n\nKRAMER: But now I have a big problem, buddy.\n\nJERRY: What is it?\n\nKRAMER: Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.\n\nJERRY: You didn't go?\n\nKRAMER: No. And now I can't get it back.\n\n(George gives back the sandwich to Jerry and goes to the bathroom)\n\nJERRY: The % thing to do is just not think about it.\n\nKRAMER: How could you not think about it?\n\n(Elaine enters)\n\nELAINE: Hey.\n\nKRAMER: (mumbles and leaves)\n\nELAINE: What's the matter with him?\n\nJERRY: He's a little backed up.\n\nELAINE: Oh...\n\n(George gets back from the bathroom and takes back the sandwich from Jerry's hand and sit on the couch.)\n\nGEORGE: Elaine.\n\nELAINE: So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.\n\nJERRY: Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)\n\n(Elaine goes into Jerry' bedroom)\n\nGEORGE: (to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.\n\nELAINE: So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.\n\nGEORGE: Apply for a job? What for?\n\nELAINE: Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirt, untucked)\n\nGEORGE: It's a coincidence.\n\nJERRY: This is what you gonna wear?\n\nELAINE: Yeah.\n\nJERRY: You're not gonna get the job.\n\nELAINE: Exactly.\n\n(phone rings, Jerry gets up and answers, Elaine sits on the couch's arm next to George and takes a bite of his sandwich)\n\nJERRY: (to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)\n\nELAINE: Who was it?\n\nJERRY: TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.\n\nELAINE: What about the dogs?\n\nJERRY: They're having sex in the hotel room.\n\n(scene ends)\n\n[setting: Peter McManus cafe, same table as earlier]\n\n(Jerry and TV Elaine: Sandi Robbins)\n\nSANDI: So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.\n\nJERRY: Yes.\n\nSANDI: And she's really your ex-girlfriend?\n\nJERRY: Uh, Huh, yeah.\n\nSANDI: I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.\n\nJERRY: Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.\n\nSANDI: How would she eat a hamburger?\n\nJERRY: With her hands.\n\nSANDI: What about pasta?\n\nJERRY: Also with her hands.\n\nSANDI: Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.\n\nJERRY: Everything?\n\nSANDI: Everything.\n\nJERRY: All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.\n\nSANDI: That's good. What's her favorite movie?\n\nJERRY: Shaft.\n\nSANDI: You got to get me a picture. What about sex?\n\nJERRY: She likes talking during sex.\n\nSANDI: Oh... dirty talking?\n\nJERRY: No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)\n\nSANDI: Elaine.\n\nJERRY: What?\n\nSANDI: Call me Elaine.\n\nJERRY: All right. Elaine.\n\nSANDI: How does Elaine kiss?\n\nJERRY: Well--\n\nSANDI: Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry)\n\nJERRY: Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--\n\nSANDI: Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral)\n\nJERRY: I think you got it.\n\n(scene ends)\n\n[setting: Monk's]\n\n(Kramer and Tom at a the booth behind the cashier)\n\nKRAMER: I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.\n\nTOM: I'll have a hamburger. That's it.\n\nKRAMER: Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.\n\nTOM: This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.\n\nKRAMER: You gotta play him like me.

Would you like a table.\n\nELAINE: No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.\n\nMr. VISAKI: (looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before.\n\nELAINE: Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.\n\nMr. VISAKI: I don't think I need anyone else right now.\n\nELAINE: You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'.

What did I do?\n\n(scene ends)\n\n[setting: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office]\n\nELAINE: Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.\n\nFRED: Who's Russ Meyer?\n\nELAINE: Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.\n\nFRED: Anyway, go on.\n\nELAINE: Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.\n\nFRED: (to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.\n\nPAUL: (to Elaine) Hi.\n\nELAINE: Hi.\n\nFRED: Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.\n\nPAUL: (to Elaine) Really?\n\n(Part 1 ends)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-and-larry-david-had-a-secret-to-writing-seinfeld-before-their-very-first-episode.html/", "page_content": "Seinfeld turned Jerry Seinfeld from a popular standup comedian to a TV star. The classic sitcom about nothing still plays in syndication. Seinfeld himself recalled the process he and co-creator Larry David went through to write the very first script, when the show was called The Seinfeld Chronicles.\n\nL-R: Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jerry Seinfeld | Andrew Eccles/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nSeinfeld was a guest on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast on June 8. In the discussion between the two comedians, writers and actors, Seinfeld revealed how he developed the secret to writing Seinfeld long before he ever got the show.\n\nJerry Seinfeld learned from the mistakes of other comedians\n\nSeinfeld rose to prominence at comedy clubs like Catch a Rising Star in the \u201970s. His goal was to be on The Tonight Show and he would become a regular. He saw fellow comics do well in the club with 35 minutes but then bomb on TV doing only six.\n\nJerry Seinfeld | Mary DeCicco/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe goes on, does well, goes on again, not as good,\u201d Seinfeld told Maron. \u201cGoes on a third time, struggles, never see him again. I noticed that as a young man. I went, \u2018Ohhhh. Now I see how this works. What you think you have is not what you really have when they put you under that light in that context under those constraints.\u2019 So I realized I have to have a way of growing. I need a better system than that. So I set about creating that for myself.\u201d\n\nJerry Seinfeld practiced writing comedy the way George Burns did\n\nA friend gave Seinfeld George Burns\u2019 book Living It Up, or They Still Love Me In Altoona. Seinfeld decided to practice the method for comedy writing Burns described.\n\nL-R: Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jerry Seinfeld | Maria McCarty/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI read that he sat and worked every day for at least two hours on jokes, which I had never heard of or done,\u201d Seinfeld said. \u201cEverybody was just doing it on stage and I think to this day most people do. They just catch hold of an idea, they take it on stage and that works for a lot of people. It wasn\u2019t enough for me. I wanted to go dig deeper down the hole and I wanted to take my time doing it and then take it on stage and then go back and explore.\u201d\n\nThat became Seinfeld\u2019s process. He wrote most of his classic sets you see that way.\n\n\u201cIt was the back and forth stage and the pad, the stage and the pad,\u201d Seinfeld said. \u201cThen I found I was coming up with a lot of stuff. Then I started progressing and going past people. I thought oh, this is my way.\u201d\n\nHe was still writing for \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\n\nSeinfeld\u2019s standup would eventually translate into Seinfeld. First, he just didn\u2019t want to lose his spot in the Tonight Show rotation.\n\nL-R: Jason Alexander and Jerry Seinfeld | NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI thought if I\u2019m going to get on The Tonight Show three times a year and crush every one of them, this has got to be a bit of a serious endeavor,\u201d Seinfeld said. \u201cBecause I loved it so much, all I wanted was I didn\u2019t want to get kicked out. I\u2019d seen so many people get kicked out. You go on, you do a couple shots and they don\u2019t want you anymore. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those casualties.\u201d\n\nJerry Seinfeld and Larry David used the same process to create \u2018Seinfeld\u2019\n\nBy the time Seinfeld and David hooked up to write The Seinfeld Chronicles, they both know how to put jokes on a page.\n\nL-R: Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld | Chris Haston/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images\n\n\u201cIf you go from that moment to when Larry David and I got the TV series and you roll a blank sheet of paper into a typewriter, I was not intimidated by the because I\u2019d been looking at blank sheets of paper for years at that time,\u201d Seinfeld said. \u201cI knew how to write. When Jerry and George sit down together at the coffee shop, Larry and I, neither one of us were intimidated by that.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/10777840.Ken_Fite", "page_content": "Showing 18 distinct works.\n\nsort by popularity original publication year title average rating number of pages\n\nRemember to Remember: Improve Your Recall, Memorize Anything, and Never Forget a Name\n\nThe 4-Minute Morning: Wake Up Early, Accelerate Your Learning, and Discover Your Hidden Passion\n\nThe Poverty of Attention: How to Improve Concentration and Stay Focused\n\n* Note: these are all the books on Goodreads for this author.
