Germer is one of the few lucky physicists to have his name attached to a classic experiment. We have the Millikan oil-drop experiment that first determined the charge on the electron (1910), and the Michelson-Morley experiment (1887), which disproved the existence of an ether. And then there is the Davisson-Germer experiment of 1927.\n\nFirst paragraph of \u201cThe scattering of electrons by a single crystal of nickel,\u201d by Clinton Davison and Lester Germer, in Nature, vol. 119, 1927 (Linda Hall Library)\n\nIn 1924, the French physicist Louis de Brogle had proposed that particles have a wave function associated with them, and he even predicted the wavelength of such waves for various particles. This seemed absurd at first \u2013 how could a particle behave like a wave and still be a particle? \u2013 but no one said nature is predictable, just that she is open to experimental inquiry. So Germer and his senior partner, Clinton Davisson, bounced a beam of electrons off the atoms in a nickel crystal. If you do that with light waves, you get a diffraction pattern, essentially a pattern of alternating light and dark zones. Germer and Davisson found that the same thing happens with electrons \u2013 they produce a diffraction pattern, and on measuring the length of the waves that would produce such a pattern, they got very nearly the wavelength that De Broglie had predicted for the electron. Albert Einstein had shown in 1905 that waves can behave like particles, and now Davisson and Germer were demonstrating that particles can and do behave like waves.\n\nDiagram of the instrumental set-up for the Davisson-Germer experiment of 1927. The electron gun is at left, the nickel target at right, and the detector at top (byjus.com)\n\nA diagram of the simple experimental set-up can be seen in our third image. Electrons are emitted with a known energy from an electron gun (which Davisson and Germer are holding in the portrait photograph), the electrons are reflected off the nickel crystal, and a detector that can slide along a circular scale detects the energy of the reflected electrons for different angles of reflection. At certain angles they detected few electrons, indicating that the electrons reflected from adjacent atoms were interfering. They published their initial results in a letter to the editor of Nature in 1927 (second image), which included a graph of electron intensity for the complete range of angles. You can clearly see the variation in intensity, caused by electron wave interference (fourth image).\n\nA graph of varying electron intensity with changes in the angle of the detector, part of the Davisson-Germer article in Nature, vol. 119, 1927 (Linda Hall Library)\n\nDe Broglie received a Nobel Prize in 1929 for his prediction, and Davisson shared a Nobel prize in 1937 for the confirming experiment, but he did not share it with Germer, who was a junior assistant, and assistants are seldom rewarded with Nobel prizes unless the partners are clearly equal. But Germer did get his name attached to the now-famous experiment, which does not happen often. Germer became an ardent rock climber in his last quarter-century, and he never fell or had an accident until this day in 1971, when he was climbing a scarp and dropped dead of a heart attack. Whether this is a disappointing way for a rock climber to go out, I cannot say.\n\nA plaque commemorating the site of the original Davisson-Germer experiment at Bell Labs, commissioned by the American Physical Society (Wikimedia commons)\n\nThe site of the Davisson-Germer experiment at Bell Labs has been commemorated by the American Physical Society with a plaque (fifth image).\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam B.

Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research. He died after a fall while climbing near Gardiner, New York."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/lester_halbert.germer/1105923", "page_content": "Lester Halbert Germer\n\nphysicist\n\nOctober 10, 1896 (age 74) Chicago, Cook County, United States of America\n\nWith Clinton Davisson, he proved the wave-particle duality of matter in the Davisson\u2013Germer experiment, which was important to the development of the electron microscope.

There are stories of Swiss watchmakers burying newly made parts in snow, and it is well known that companies would \u201cage\u201d castings by putting them outside during the winter.\n\nEngine maker Pierce-Arrow, having definite advantage in the technology by being in Buffalo, New York, where it is known to get quite cold, used this cold treatment aging method for their engine blocks. Indy car builders have told us their fathers would age castings in a similar manner before using them to make racecar engines. In a similar manner, racer Jim Birks, found engines which sat in junk yards through several winters made superior race engines compared to brand new engine blocks. That is what caused him to look into the use of cold for making metals last longer. He found the existing research on the subject, which led him to help start Controlled Thermal Processing.\n\nWe\u2019ve traced the history of cryogenics as far back as the 1930s, when the Junkers Company in Germany used it on for military airplane components. According to ex-Junkers engineer Adolph Luerker, who immigrated to the US after the war, it was a vital part of the engineering that went into their reliable Jumo 1,000 HP V-12 aircraft engine. When he ended up in California working for McCulloch Chain Saw Company in the mid 1950s, he suggested they use the process on chain saw blade links. They started cryogenically treating their chainsaw blades but kept it a secret so other manufacturers could not make better blades.\n\nThe United States enters the history of cryogenics at the Watertown Arsenal in Watertown, Massachusetts, during World War II under the guidance of Clarence Zener, who would go on to develop the Zener diode among other advances in solid-state physics. The method was straightforward. Steel cutting tools were immersed in liquid nitrogen for a brief period of time, then removed from the liquid, allowed to warm up, and placed into service in the arsenal\u2019s production lines. Occasionally tools would crack or chip as a result of the thermal shock associated with the rapid rate of cooling. Some tools also became brittle because of the newly formed, un-tempered martensite and chipped in service. Of the tools that survived this crude quenching, many exhibited dramatically enhanced service life.\n\nSimilar processes have been claimed across several industries from the 1940s onward. This \u201cthrow and go\u201d approach to cryogenics relied on hoping for the best, with understandably mixed results. You don\u2019t begin to see the stirrings of actual scientific refinement until a magazine article from the July 1957 edition of Tooling and Production Magazine. Cryogenics began to garner attention.\n\nIndustry Pioneers\n\nAs interest grew in cryogenics, several people emerged as driving forces in cryogenics research in the early 1970\u2019s. The most notable and persistent was Dr. Randall Barron of Louisiana Technical University, who wrote multiple research papers about the subject, as did some of his students. These papers are widely cited in the cryogenics industry even today.\n\nAnother early pioneer in the industry is Dr. Hugh E. Trucks, a design specialist at General Dynamics Corporation and later a private consultant. He wrote several articles on the subject, notably one for the Die Casting Engineer edition of September/October 1988. Dr Trucks was also affiliated with Cryogenics International, of Scottsdale Arizona.\n\nA third pioneer is Ed Busch, who founded Cryo-Tech, Inc., who has been preaching the industrial use of cryogenics for over 30 years. He found the process hard to sell to industries that had never heard of it. He was also an important force in making the process available to industry. Cryo-Tech was eventually bought out by 300 Below, an industry competitor who we had processed parts for during their early days.\n\nThe Development Of True Cryogenics\n\nSeveral things had to come together to make any invention work well. When speaking of the history of cryogenics, four key elements were necessary:\n\nA way to create and sustain extremely cold temperatures needed to be discovered. A process had to be established to control the temperature of the cold chamber in a reproducible manner. There had to be a realization that beneficial changes could occur even at very cold temperatures. The change had to be tested. This involved having a means of testing and being able to eliminate the possibility of other random changes in the process.\n\nCreating Cold\n\nIt is obvious that the process could not exist even on an experimental basis until it was possible to achieve temperatures that were considerably colder than the Earth\u2019s climate allowed. A good history of cold can be seen on the PBS series Nova.\n\nSome documentation shows that artificial refrigeration occurred at the University of Glasgow in 1748. William Cullen\u2019s work relied on the vapor-compression refrigeration process explained by Michael Faraday. It was not until 1845 that refrigeration units became available, driven by the need for a cure for malaria. Doctor John Gorrie felt that malaria was the result of bad air, and if he could condition the air, malaria would not occur. While he was incorrect about malaria, he did advance the art of cooling by designing an apparatus to produce ice.\n\nThe discovery by Louis-Paul Cailletet in 1877 that gasses could be cooled by sudden expansion and the discovery by Marc-Auguste Pictet of the cascade cooling method led to Sir James Dewar\u2019s research, which then led to the discovery that air could be liquefied and stored in the eponymous Dewar flasks. While different processes were investigated until the late 19th century, Carl von Linde\u2019s invention of a continuous process of liquefying gases in large quantities formed a basis for today\u2019s refrigeration technology. The almost simultaneous invention of air liquefaction processes in Britain, Germany, France and the United States around 1895 led to the production of liquid gasses in quantity.\n\nThe science of refrigeration had to develop before the process could go ahead. It was not until the mid 1930\u2019s that refrigeration got to the point where economical quantities of liquid oxygen could be made. For a long time, the liquid nitrogen, which was a byproduct of the liquid oxygen production, was simply vented to the atmosphere.\n\nGaining Control\n\nThe second innovation needed for the history of cryogenics to progress was the invention of a mechanism and process that would allow the controlled cooling of a part in a repeatable manner. It is not enough to simply reduce temperatures. They must be held in the desired range before being warmed back up in a slow, controlled process. This tended to be expensive and cumbersome before microprocessor controls became available.\n\nIt was the invention of the microprocessor controlled temperature control unit really made it possible to get precise, repeatable results in cryogenic processing. By combining electronic control with advancements in insulation, the ability to explore the potential of cryogenics was in reach.\n\n\n\nA Cognitive Leap\n\nOne condition you see throughout the history of cryogenics that hindered progress was that, intuitively, one would not think of materials changing due to cold. After all, you heat treat metals, with the emphasis on heat. Archeological evidence shows that humans have been using heat on metals for over 7500 years. Extreme cold has only been available for roughly 100 years. It is ingrained in our culture that you use heat to change metals not cold, yet even the most basic texts on metallurgy describe the temperature dependence of heat fails to fix defects in the crystal structure of metals.\n\nThe common belief is that cold tends to inhibit chemical reactions, not promote them. While that may be true in some cases, with ferrous metals, we know at colder temperatures you can get austenite to change to martensite crystals. That\u2019s why it is not unusual for companies to \u201cseason\u201d castings for about a year or so before machining them by leaving them outside over the winter. The theory at the time was that the change was more associated with time than temperature, and most likely the original reason for putting them outside was because there was no room to keep them in the production space.\n\nIf you are resistant to the idea that cold can make things happen, consider this: Super conductivity is created by cold; it is undeniable that something changes at near Absolute Zero temperatures which cause metals and ceramics to behave differently.\n\nPutting It To The Test\n\nIn order to make people think in terms of cold temperatures improving things, the changes had to be detectable. Even into the 1940\u2019s measurements were not precise enough to indicate the changes we now know were caused by cryogenics. Processes were not controlled well enough to be able to say with certainty the change was a direct result of the cold. A cutting tool may have lasted twice as long, but that was easily attributed to the effects of how it was ground or the variance in cutting geometry. Given that there could be large differences between the process used from one piece and another, the benefits given by the process could always be attributed to the production differences.\n\nOnce Doctor W. Edwards Deming taught us to control our processes closely, we began to be able to detect other things that could drastically change the production process. This is a common roadblock to advancement even today. Even after testing, some people have problems making the adjustment to the concept of cold as a force of change.\n\nLearning Through Experience\n\nIt is important to realize that throughout much of the history of cryogenics, this process has been largely empirically developed. Large corporations and government bodies, often the largest funding sources for scientific exploration, have been slow to study the how of cryogenics. Even Dr. Barron\u2019s published works go largely to the results of the process rather than how the process works. As Dr. Levine of Applied Cryogenics, Inc. in an article written in August 1998, says, \u201cWe just were not knowledgeable enough to realize that it couldn\u2019t possibly work, so we worked with it and found that it did work.\u201d The process is in need of research to optimize its results.\n\nCryogenics Today\n\nASM International, the professional society of metallurgists and materials scientists, started a committee on the deep cryogenic process in the late 1990\u2019s. This committee was founded when members started to complain about the outlandish claims made by some of the early companies that formed to promote the process. Claims such as, \u201cNo one has ever blown up a cryogenically treated engine,\u201d and, \u201ccryogenic treatment increases the strength of steel by ten times,\u201d did a lot of harm to the truth that surrounds the cryogenic process. The committee also wanted to create a database of research and articles about cryogenics, and promoted sessions at ASM conferences that featured cryogenic processing.\n\n\n\nAbout the same time that ASM got into the act the Cryogenic Society of America stepped up to the plate. They have been a great help in publicizing the process in their house magazine Cold Facts, in directing companies towards responsible cryogenic processors, and in debunking outlandish claims. The Cryogenic Society of America worked with members of the ASM committee and created the database of articles and research papers regarding Deep Cryogenic Treatment. It is available to the general public at www.cryogenictreatmentdatabase.org.\n\nBoth CSA and ASM have been very important factors in restoring the public confidence in this wonderful process.\n\nContact CTP Today\n\nWe look forward to the advancements we\u2019ll see in the field of cryogenics and are proud to be a guiding force in the further development of cryogenic science and its commercial applications. If you\u2019re ready to make your company part of the history of cryogenics, contact our cryogenic specialists today.\n\nNote:\n\nControlled Thermal Processing is proud to work with researchers from such institutions as Illinois Institute of Technology, the US Army, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Honeywell, and others.

Credit: AIP Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again. On 3 October, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences will name the winners of the 111th Nobel Prize in Physics. Speculation abounds: Will it be the architects of LIGO? The pioneers of chaos theory? Perhaps the discoverers of exoplanets? What\u2019s certain is that the new laureates, whoever they may be, will join one of the most exclusive clubs in science. Champagne corks will be popped. News stories will be written.\n\nYet there will also be dozens of nominees for the prize who will be rebuffed by the Nobel committee. They, too, will join an elite club. Among the list of Nobel also-rans are Henri Poincar\u00e9, Edwin Hubble, Lise Meitner, and many other physicists who left lasting marks on the field.\n\nWe\u2019ll probably never know for sure why some physicists win Nobel glory and others come up short; the Nobel committee is notoriously secretive about their deliberations. But decades of data on the Nobel Prize\u2019s nominees reveal that not all snubs are created equal. It turns out that Nobel also-rans tend to fall into two groups: scientists who contributed to a Nobel-worthy breakthrough only to be overshadowed by collaborators and competitors, and undisputed giants in their field who simply set out after the wrong problem.\n\nIn the chart above, the circles represent physicists who were nominated between 1901 and 1965 but never won a Nobel. (Nomination data are released to the public only after 50 years.) The larger the circle, the more nominations an individual received. A single nomination may include up to three names\u2014usually of scientists who have made related discoveries\u2014and it\u2019s not unusual for just one or two of those candidates to be awarded the Nobel. The vertical axis shows how many times each person shared a nomination with an eventual laureate; the horizontal axis indicates the number of times the person was nominated either alone or exclusively with fellow Nobel snubs. Blue indicates that a majority of nominations were shared with laureates; red, a minority.\n\nBy and large, the physicists clustered along the vertical axis are the ones who were overshadowed, in the committee\u2019s eyes, by coworkers and competitors. That group includes the likes of Walter Gerlach, who with 1943 Nobel laureate Otto Stern discovered the quantization of spin angular momentum, and Seth Neddermeyer, who helped uncover the positron but saw the Nobel go to Carl Anderson.\n\nBut probably no one better exemplifies this group of also-rans than Bell Labs physicist Lester Germer. A codiscoverer of electron diffraction, Germer garnered 26 nominations throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, each one shared with collaborator Clint Davisson. But his Nobel chances were thwarted in 1937 when Davisson shared the prize with competitor George Thomson, who had nearly concurrently discovered the phenomenon.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for a deserving researcher to be squeezed out of Nobel contention when competing groups lay claim to the same discovery. But even so, the committee\u2019s decision to exclude Germer was a curious one. The year he won, Thomson received just four Nobel nominations, and each of those nominations included both Germer and Davisson. What\u2019s more, all four nominations explicitly listed Germer and Davisson as their first choice, with the second choice being to split the prize evenly among the three. In addition, Germer and Davisson were named in four additional nominations that excluded Thomson entirely. Somehow, the committee members settled on a final pairing that seems to have been no one\u2019s preference but their own.\n\nAs for the nominees clustered along the horizontal axis, their preeminence in a scientific pursuit was unquestioned; at issue was the legitimacy of the pursuit itself. In effect, their sin was that they stood apart from the intellectual in-crowd.\n\nThe polymath Poincar\u00e9 falls into this group. So do George Hale and Augusto Righi. But the archetype may well be the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who reshaped our understanding of the cosmos by establishing the rotation of the Milky Way and discovering its galactic halo. These days, he\u2019s probably best known for his namesake cloud, a vast shell of icy planetesimals orbiting at the edge of the solar system.\n\nOort was nominated 24 times during the 1950s and 1960s, only once alongside an eventual laureate. (Astronomer Otto Struve of the University of California, Berkeley, once put forth Emilio Segr\u00e8 as his first choice and Oort as his second, but never meant for the two men to share the prize.) The fact that most of Oort\u2019s support came from fellow Dutchmen may have put him at a disadvantage. Statistically, the tiny country didn\u2019t carry much sway with the Nobel committee: Only 1 in 16 Dutch nominations through 1965 produced a laureate (see chart below), compared with more than 1 in 10 nominations from Americans and nearly 1 in 6 from Great Britain.\n\nProbably the bigger factor, however, was that the Nobel committee didn\u2019t see astronomy as a Nobel-worthy discipline. Hale and Edwin Hubble are thought to have missed out on the prize for the same reason. The committee eventually came around, awarding the 1974 prize to British radio astronomers Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish; the committee has since doled out several more Nobels to astronomers.\n\nOf all the physicists who\u2019ve been spurned by the Nobel committee over the years (or at least through 1965), one defies categorization. Arnold Sommerfeld, named on a record 84 nominations, shared ballots with the likes of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Niels Bohr, and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie. But the quantum theorist was also the sole nominee on 26 nominations and a joint nominee on 25 others that included no future laureates.\n\nAs lore has it, the knock against Sommerfeld was that he had no single, great achievement that the committee could point to, even though his collective body of work stacked up to those of contemporaries who won the prize. Though Sommerfeld himself never won, the branches of his academic tree are weighted with Nobel gold: Four of his graduate students, and at least two of his students\u2019 students, went on to become laureates.\n\nThe road to the Nobel Prize is paved with the careers of people like Sommerfeld, Oort, and Germer\u2014gifted physicists who, subject to the whims and quirks of the prize committee, narrowly missed out on their discipline\u2019s crowning achievement. So come Nobel Day, once everyone has toasted the newly minted laureates, let\u2019s hope they\u2019ll also raise a glass to the overlooked and left out: the Nobel also-rans.\n\nEditor\u2019s note, 22 September 2017: This story, which originally ran on 29 September 2016, has been updated and included as part of a series on the physicists nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics."}, {"url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-0-7503-2678-0/chapter/bk978-0-7503-2678-0ch15", "page_content": "The Davisson\u2013Germer experiment demonstrated the wave nature of the electron, confirming the earlier hypothesis of Louis de Broglie [ 1 ]. By putting wave\u2013particle duality on a firm experimental footing, it represented a major step forward in the development of quantum mechanics. In 1927, at the Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill, NJ), Clinton J Davisson and Lester H Germer fired electrons at reduced speed against a target of crystalline nickel, which could be rotated to observe the angular dependence of the scattered electrons. Their electron detector was mounted on an arc so that it could be rotated to observe electrons at different angles. It was a great surprise to them to find that at certain angles there was a peak in the intensity of the scattered electron beam. This peak indicated wave behaviour for the electrons, and could be interpreted by the Bragg law to give values for the lattice spacing in the nickel crystal. This experiment, similarly to Arthur H Compton's which highlighted the particle behaviour of light, confirmed de Broglie's hypothesis of the wave nature of electrons and completed the hypothesis of wave\u2013particle duality.\n\nIn this section the history of the experiment of Davisson and Germer, which was based on de Broglie's hypothesis of wave\u2013particle duality, will be briefly introduced. This section aims to put the experiment in context and explain its fundamental importance for quantum physics. Due to space constraints, only a sketch of this complex and fascinating story will be provided. The best sources of further information are [2\u20135].\n\nThe Davisson\u2013Germer experiment (1927) was the first measurement of the wavelengths of electrons. Davisson, who worked at the Bell Research Laboratories, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1937 together with George P Thomson from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, who also found experimental indications of electron diffraction independently [6].\n\nDavisson (1881\u20131958) and Germer (1896\u20131971) investigated the reflection of electron beams on the surface of nickel crystals. When the beam strikes the crystal, the nickel atoms in the crystal scatter the electrons in all directions. Their detector measured the intensity of the scattered electrons with respect to the incident electron beam. Their normal polycrystalline samples exhibited a very smooth angular distribution of scattered electrons. In early 1925, one of their samples was inadvertently recrystallized in a laboratory accident that changed its structure into a nearly mono-crystalline form. As a result, the angular distribution manifested sharp peaks at certain angles. As Davisson and Germer soon found out, other mono-crystalline samples also exhibited such anomalous patterns, which differed with the chemical constitution, the angle of incidence and the orientation of the sample. Only in late 1926 they did understand what was going on, when Davisson attended a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford. There Born spoke about de Broglie's matter-waves and Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics. Their later measurements completely confirmed the quantum mechanical predictions for electron wavelength \u03bb as a function of momentum p: . However, their initial experiments (unlike Thomson's) were conducted in the context of industrial materials research on filaments for vacuum tubes, not under any specific theoretical guidance.\n\nThe phenomenon of electron diffraction is quite general and can be explained by the wave nature of atomic particles. The planes of atoms in the crystal (Bragg planes) are regularly spaced and can produce a constructive interference pattern, if the so-called Bragg condition ( , where d is the spacing of atomic planes and D is the spacing of the atoms in the crystal) is satisfied (for more details see the next section).\n\nIn their experiment, Davisson and Germer found that the intensity reached a maximum at (for an initial kinetic energy of the electrons of 54 eV, normal incidence as indicated and \u03c6 as the scattering angle). From a philosophical point of view this experiment reveals a striking feature. It demonstrates the existence of de Broglie waves. Yet we can speak of causation, not in a deterministic but in a probabilistic sense. There is clearly, on the observational level, a conditional dependence of the intensity of the reflected beam on the set of antecedent conditions. These antecedent conditions are also conditionally prior to their respective effects. There is of course no local causal mechanism, as the causal situation covers a stream of particles. There is only a certain likelihood that one particular particle in these experiments will be scattered in a particular direction.\n\nHowever, sufficiently much is known about the scattering of atomic particles to establish a causal dependence between the antecedent and consequent conditions. In the Davisson\u2013Germer experiment the wavelength of the electron beam, scattered at 50\u00b0, is 0.165 nm. This is the effect to which specific antecedent conditions correspond\u2014the electron beam has an initial kinetic energy of 54 eV, the lattice spacing of the nickel atoms is known, from which the spacing of the Bragg planes can be calculated, and the condition for constructive interference is also known. There is quite a general dependence of the interference effects on the regular spacing of the atom planes in the crystal. This is used regularly in the study of atomic properties and is completely analogous to the use of x-ray diffraction by Max von Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich in 1912. Under certain conditions, particles such as electrons thus exhibit wave-like characteristics such as electromagnetic radiation [7]."}], "Lester Germer was the first to liquefy helium in the United States.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lester_Germer", "page_content": "Lester Halbert Germer (October 10, 1896 \u2013 October 3, 1971) was an American physicist.[1] With Clinton Davisson, he proved the wave-particle duality of matter in the Davisson\u2013Germer experiment, which was important to the development of the electron microscope.

Chandler became interested at once. Recalling the event several years after the end of the war (December 19, 1923), Chandler wrote:\n\nIt was one day in June of 1917 that you and Dr. Burrell called at my office, presumably because I was at that time in charge of the Balloon Division of the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. You told me of helium being one of the constituents of natural gas in the central part of the United States, adding remarks about its characteristics that would make it superior to hydrogen for military balloons provided suitable extraction processes could be developed. I was then asked whether the Signal Corps desired helium sufficiently to encourage development of the extraction processes by allotment of funds for the purpose. My personal opinion was that it should be done, even though the cost would be considerably more than hydrogen, for the reason that anything that would give us an advantage over an enemy in time of war ought not to be overlooked simply on account of greater cost. This matter involved new policy and would surely require a greater expenditure of funds than amounts subject to my approval, therefore, I agreed to confer promptly with the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, which was done within a few hours. General Squier [Major General George Owen Squier, 1865-1934] was much interested in the proposal and instructed me to present the matter to the Aircraft Production Board at its next meeting a day or two later; that board was responsible for decisions regarding aircraft policy affecting both the Army and Navy. The questions asked by members of the board indicated a favorable interest and I was directed to secure approximate estimates from the Bureau of Mines of the funds required for developing a practicable extraction process.Footnote 24\n\nInterest in helium continued to expand as Chandler informed G.O. Carter of the Navy\u2019s Bureau of Steam Engineering who immediately became interested on behalf of the Navy. Both Carter and Chandler agreed to move forward with a helium program as quickly as possible. Enthusiasm for helium would also reach the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would later say, \u201cwith the fire risk eliminated the rigid airship or Zeppelin will hence be one of the most powerful weapons known.\u201dFootnote 25\n\nImmediately as a result of these communications with Moore, Burrell, Chandler, and Carter, a recommendation was made by Frederick Cottrell to contact Fred H. Norton of the Jeffries-Norton Corporation to begin discussions on the processing of helium. Norton, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and a very well respected engineer of international reputation, was called to Washington on June 4, 1917 to discuss an experimental process where helium could be extracted from natural gas, which had never before been achieved in the United States. Cottrell, who was introduced to the Norton process by the Bureau of Mines director, Van H. Manning in 1916, was of the opinion that Norton might be the engineer who could tackle this issue with relative low cost. Norton had developed the drawings for a \u201cnew process for air separation that embodied some novel and striking features\u201dFootnote 26 to produce oxygen inexpensively for use in blast furnaces, of which the Bureau of Mines had an interest. The oxygen, in Norton\u2019s process, was extracted using low-temperatures like other air separation units, but his design was supposed to achieve the results with reduced compression costs, which was the primary cost of extraction.\n\nNorton estimated that it would cost $28,000 to build a plant that could process 5,000 cubic feet of helium per day (because this plant was experimental in nature, only very small volumes of gas were required to test the process). The request for $28,000 was granted and soon Norton was making designs to build the first experimental helium plant and negotiating a contract with the Lone Star Gas Company to withdrawal a small portion of the Petrolia gas from the pipeline in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nIn the meantime, conferences were held in Washington D.C. in July 1917, to hold open discussions on all matters pertaining to the production of helium but also addressing many scientific questions concerning helium permeability through balloon fabric, solubility of helium in liquid methane and nitrogen, and combustibility studies on mixtures of helium and hydrogen (it was learned that a 10 % component of hydrogen in helium would not ignite). More importantly, a relationship between the United States and Great Britain was recommended in order to aid the allied forces resulting in the dispatch of Captain R.B. Owens of the U.S. Army\u2019s Signal Corp to the United Kingdom to discuss cooperation between the two countries. All attendees of these conferences were in agreement to move forward on all fronts.\n\nNot willing to risk the future of the entire United States industry on the experiment of one processing company, R.B. Moore recommended that two other well-established companies in air separation be considered as well. Moore had recommended to Frederick Cottrell that both Linde Air Products CompanyFootnote 27 and the Air Reduction Company,Footnote 28 two well respected air separation companies, be given a chance to compete for processing rights, to which he readily agreed.Footnote 29 By late July 1917, a recommendation was made by the joint Army and Navy Airship Boards for an increased appropriation of $100,000 (to be split evenly between Army and Navy) to be divvied between these two companies and one other that withdrew shortly afterwards.Footnote 30 It was also recommended at this time that helium operations be consolidated and run by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, with George Burrell leading operations. Dr. Hamilton Cady and his assistant, Dr. Clifford Seibel, would become the Bureau of Mines\u2019 consulting chemists in charge of the majority of helium analytical and research work.\n\nAs negotiations were proceeding with the well known Linde Air Products Company and the Air Reduction Company, representatives from the Jeffries-Norton Company had already negotiated a verbal contract with the Lone Star Gas Company for processing rights and had chosen a location for their experimental helium processing plant in Fort Worth. The Norton representatives were quickly moving forward until all momentum would come to a screeching halt in October 1917 when G.O. Carter prohibited any Navy funds to be diverted to the Jeffries-Norton Company. G.O. Carter, the Navy representative in Washington, was also a former Linde Air Products employee who had some knowledge in low-temperature processing. The Norton process, according to Carter, was an unsound technology that was not deserving of any Navy appropriation. The Army would ultimately side with Carter and leave Norton out of any Army appropriation as well.Footnote 31\n\nLess than one week before the Norton process was excluded from any funds, the British Admiralty had informed the United States of their helium requirements for the war. The amount requested was enormous, 100 million cubic feet at once and 1 million cubic feet per week thereafter.Footnote 32 The British believed this amount was entirely feasible primarily because of their belief in the Norton process. Through the convincing of Captain R.B. Owens on his mission to the United Kingdom after the helium conferences, he assured the British authorities that the Norton process would prove to be theoretically sound, thus assuring the allies a low-cost method of helium extraction. Now that the Norton process was excluded from any Army or Navy appropriation, this left the British Admiralty and the U.S. Bureau of Mines somewhat embarrassed because of their unwavering belief in the Norton process.\n\nDespite the stalling of the Norton fiasco, progress by the Bureau of Mines remained swift and an increased appropriation of $500,000Footnote 33 (a portion of which was supposed to be allocated to the Norton process) was approved for the two remaining processing companies. Both the Linde Air Products and Air Reduction contracts were signed in November 1917 and construction on both facilities began immediately. During construction and as a precautionary war measure, both plants became known as \u201cargon\u201d plants for added secrecy.\n\nLuckily for the Jeffries-Norton Company, they would get a new life in January 1918 when, as a result of their process being re-investigated by the National Research Council, were again deemed worthy of a chance to compete. On Jan 14, 1918, the National Research Council stated, \u201c\u2026the committee is unanimously of the opinion that the Norton process\u2026 is scientifically sound, that it should accomplish the desired result, and that every part of it seems to have been conceived in the light of a clear understanding of the problem and of the means which good engineering would suggest as conducive to economy\u2026\u201dFootnote 34 During the time it took to have the Norton process re-instated, the original plant site negotiated by Norton was assigned to both Linde Air Products and Air Reduction Company. Having no plant site at the end of the pipeline in Fort Worth, Norton decided to install his plant at the Petrolia field.\n\nThe three experimental helium plants were placed under the control of R.B. Moore in June, 1918. A brief description of these plants are as follows:\n\n1. The Linde Air Products plant (Argon Plant No. 1) in Fort Worth, which had a capacity of 5,000 cubic feet of gas per day, was completed in March 1918 at a cost of $245,000. This plant utilized the Joule-Thomson effect, which is brought about by the rapid expansion of compressed gas through a small orifice (which is why an aerosol can becomes cold during spraying). As the incoming gas is compressed to 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi) and subsequently cooled by water, carbon dioxide, and previously processed liquid gases, it is then expanded and thus cooled as it returns to normal pressure. This process is then repeated several times until the gases fall below their boiling points. The main drawback to this process was the enormous gas compression requirements which necessitated large amounts of energy, thus increasing processing costs. Although this plant was the most expensive to operate, the plant was able to produce 70 % pure helium initially, then 92 % purity after reprocessing.Footnote 35 2. The Air Reduction plant (Argon Plant No. 2), with nearly identical capacity as the Linde began operations on May 1, 1918 and cost $135,000 to manufacture. Air Reduction used a \u201cClaude\u201d cycle (a process designed by Georges Claude of L\u2019Air Liquide) which also utilized the Joule-Thomson effect. This system had much less compression requirements resulting in lower operating costs. The main difference between the this plant and the Linde was the use of an expansion \u201cengine\u201d that utilized the expanded gas to enhance further cooling effects, thus lowering compression requirements. Despite lower operating costs, the Air Products plant was only able to produce a maximum of 70 % helium purity. In order to achieve higher purity helium to send overseas, this 70 % helium gas stream was reprocessed in the Linde Plant where 92 % purity could be attained.Footnote 36 3. Construction on the Norton plant (Argon Plant No. 3) didn\u2019t begin until early April 1918 and was not completed until October 1, 1918. Manufacturing costs were just over $148,000 with a capacity of 30,000 cubic feet per day.Footnote 37 This process, which was the most heavily touted due to perceived low operating costs, was designed to operate with very low compression requirements. This process utilized three expansion engines instead of one, that that of the Claude process. It was believed that the use of three expansion engines that would negate heavy compression requirements would be much more efficient. Despite repeated failures over the course of just under three years, the Norton process continued to draw support from Bureau officials. By April 3, 1919, the Norton process was only able to produce 20 % helium and was finally sold as scrap two months later. The Norton process would ultimately cost more than the Linde and Air Reduction plants combined.\n\nBy June 1918 it was clear that Linde Air Products had the superior process and by August it was determined by the Army and Navy that a large, full-scale production plant was going to be required to meet the escalating demand for helium. In addition to new plant requirements, it was also deemed necessary to find new helium-bearing gas fields because the mature Petrolia field was rapidly declining. The Bureau of Mines then began an exhaustive search for helium reserves beginning in June under the leadership of Gaillard Sherburne Rogers (1889\u20131919) of the United States Geological Survey.\n\nThe work carried out by G. Sherburne Rogers was to initially identify, as quickly as possible, new helium reserves to aid the war effort. Natural gas wells from across the country were analyzed only for their helium content (and no other gas) due to the rush on the war. Throughout this initial research, the maximum helium content discovered was that of Petrolia field in Clay County, Texas. In Rogers\u2019 extensive publication, he would write:\n\nAs the Survey\u2019s (U.S. Geological Survey) investigation was made strictly for military purposes it was necessarily directed toward locating an adequate supply of helium-bearing gas as speedily as possible, and practically no attention was given to the broader scientific problems involved in the origin or ultimate source of the helium. Considerable research will evidently be necessary before this problem can be successfully attacked, and in view of the probable development of commercial aircraft during the coming decade, and the probability that the cost of extracting helium from natural gas will be reduced sufficiently to permit its use in commercial balloons, it has been deemed desirable to present immediately a brief description of the chief sources of helium in the United States. At the same time the writer (Rogers) has endeavored to describe the broader geologic relations of the helium-bearing gas, to discuss various theories of its origin, and to review the reported occurrences of helium in minerals and in other gases, in the hope that such a value to others who may later attempt to solve it.Footnote 38\n\nRogers\u2019 publication would become the primary resource of helium resources for the government in the years after its release. An extremely proficient geologist, Rogers delicately analyzed the geology of particular areas in order to hypothesize helium\u2019s probable origin. Although Rogers\u2019 work had been underway since the start of the experimental plants, it would not be released until 1920. It was also Rogers that predicted that the Petrolia field was never going to last at the rate in which it was currently being produced, thus alerting Government officials to negotiate with Lone Star Gas Company to reduce its production rate.\n\nOperations on both experimental plants (Linde Air Products and Air Reduction) would continue throughout the duration of the First World War and by July of 1918 it was well established that large-scale helium processing was going to be a reality. Fair quantities of gas had been produced by both experimental plants. Two small shipments of helium for experimental use were sent to France and Britain early in the year and just prior to the signing of the November 1918 armistice ending the war, a much larger shipment of 145,000 cubic feetFootnote 39 of 92 % helium, shipped in 750 cylinders, was shipped to the New Orleans docks destined for France. The armistice was signed before this helium ever had a chance to aid the war effort and was shipped back to Fort Worth where it would be stored and later used to fill the first U.S. helium-filled dirigible, the Navy\u2019s C-7.\n\nLinde Air Products was awarded the contract for the first full-scale production plant in the United States on October 22, 1918 which was designed to produce 30,000 cubic feet of helium per day from the Petrolia field. Negotiations had already been under way to lease the Petrolia gas from the Lone Star Gas Company and construction of a new pipeline from the gas field to the new Linde facility was quickly under construction in Fort Worth. The armistice ending the First World War would be signed on November 11, 1918, just twenty days after the contract with Linde was signed.\n\nAlthough the war was now over and there was no longer a need for large volumes of helium gas, the Aircraft Board of the U.S. Army made a review of the helium situation and determined that continuing the helium program was in the country\u2019s best interest. Four different scenarios were submitted of which \u201cPlan C\u201d, with amendments, was adopted. The original \u201cPlan C\u201d which was submitted on December 8, 1918 was as follows:\n\nOperation of plant no. 3 (Norton) for three months $36,000 Construction of production plant no. 1 (Linde) $1,700,000 Operation of production plant no. 1 for 8 Months, producing 7.2 mmcf helium $750,000 Pipeline construction $1,800,000 Petrolia gas lease $1,500,000 Total expenditures $5,786,000 Salvage $500,000 Net cost $5,286,000 Helium production (cubic ft.) 7,200,000\n\nAlthough the Norton process had been in operation since October, it had still not been able to produce any helium of significant quality. Regardless, Bureau of Mines engineers firmly believed that helium processing costs could be reduced substantially, and adamantly lobbied for Norton\u2019s continued attempts. In addition to this Norton lifeline, it was later recommended by Dr. Van H. Manning (1861\u20131932), Director of the Bureau of Mines, to continue operations of all three experimental plants so that possible cost-reduction refinements could be explored.\n\nTwo days after Christmas 1918, the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus DanielsFootnote 40 (1862\u20131948), wrote to Van Manning of the Bureau of Mines expressing his intent to discontinue all Government helium experimental work except for the Norton process (apparently the notion of producing ultra-inexpensive helium was too tempting, even for upper Government officials). Daniels plan was adopted and both experimental plants were ordered to be shut down on January 23, 1919. Manning persuaded Daniels to keep the Air Reduction Plant in operation a bit longer, at the company\u2019s expense, to test a potential improvement. Despite this extension the Air Reduction plant was never able to make any sort of meaningful improvements and was finally released on April 1, 1919 to the Bureau of Yards and Docks (Navy). Parts of this plant would be used in the first Bureau of Mines purification plant in Langley Field, Virginia.Footnote 41"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/lester.germer/3760428", "page_content": "Lester Germer\n\nphysicist scientist\n\nJanuary 10, 1896 (age 74) Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nUpon graduation in 1917 Germer obtained a position at the Western Electric Company in New York City, the engineering and research arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research.

Germer is one of the few lucky physicists to have his name attached to a classic experiment. We have the Millikan oil-drop experiment that first determined the charge on the electron (1910), and the Michelson-Morley experiment (1887), which disproved the existence of an ether.

This seemed absurd at first \u2013 how could a particle behave like a wave and still be a particle? \u2013 but no one said nature is predictable, just that she is open to experimental inquiry. So Germer and his senior partner, Clinton Davisson, bounced a beam of electrons off the atoms in a nickel crystal. If you do that with light waves, you get a diffraction pattern, essentially a pattern of alternating light and dark zones. Germer and Davisson found that the same thing happens with electrons \u2013 they produce a diffraction pattern, and on measuring the length of the waves that would produce such a pattern, they got very nearly the wavelength that De Broglie had predicted for the electron. Albert Einstein had shown in 1905 that waves can behave like particles, and now Davisson and Germer were demonstrating that particles can and do behave like waves.\n\nDiagram of the instrumental set-up for the Davisson-Germer experiment of 1927.

Electrons are emitted with a known energy from an electron gun (which Davisson and Germer are holding in the portrait photograph), the electrons are reflected off the nickel crystal, and a detector that can slide along a circular scale detects the energy of the reflected electrons for different angles of reflection. At certain angles they detected few electrons, indicating that the electrons reflected from adjacent atoms were interfering. They published their initial results in a letter to the editor of Nature in 1927 (second image), which included a graph of electron intensity for the complete range of angles. You can clearly see the variation in intensity, caused by electron wave interference (fourth image).\n\nA graph of varying electron intensity with changes in the angle of the detector, part of the Davisson-Germer article in Nature, vol. 119, 1927 (Linda Hall Library)\n\nDe Broglie received a Nobel Prize in 1929 for his prediction, and Davisson shared a Nobel prize in 1937 for the confirming experiment, but he did not share it with Germer, who was a junior assistant, and assistants are seldom rewarded with Nobel prizes unless the partners are clearly equal. But Germer did get his name attached to the now-famous experiment, which does not happen often.

Some of the most groundbreaking work in turning gases into liquids and solids was done in the late 19th century by a Scottish chemist and physicist named Sir James Dewar.The youngest of six boys, Dewar was born in 1842 in Kincardine, Scotland. Orphaned at 15, he nonetheless managed to acquire an education, first attending Dollar Academy, and then studying at the University of Edinburgh, finding a mentor in the chemist (Lord) Lyon Playfair.He was keenly interested in physics and chemistry, describing several different formulas for benzene by 1867, as well as publishing papers on such varied topics as electro-photometry, the sun\u2019s temperature, and the chemistry of the electric arc. By 1875, he had become a professor of natural experimental philosophy at the University of Cambridge, and was elected to the Royal Institution two years later. In 1878, he began a series of studies on the spectroscopy of gases, including their behavior when cooled to very low temperatures.This was a burgeoning area of research at the time. By 1845, legendary physicist Michael Faraday had successfully liquefied most known gases, except for six, which became known as the permanent gases: oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and nitric oxide. Just two years after Dewar joined the Cambridge faculty, two French chemists, Louis Cailletet and Raoul Pictet, managed to create (independent of each other) oxygen and nitrogen in liquid form by cooling them to just 80 degrees above absolute zero.Dewar devoted one of his Friday evening lectures at the Royal Institution to this topic, even demonstrating the apparatus Cailletet had used to liquefy the gases. He dreamed of building on that work to liquefy some of the remaining permanent gases. It took more than six years, but ultimately Dewar prevailed in his quest to liquefy air on June 5, 1885.By 1891, Dewar could produce liquid oxygen in large quantities, and also showed that it and liquid ozone were strongly attracted by a magnet. But his desire to investigate the liquefaction of gases at extremely low temperatures further were hampered by the lack of a means to keep the gases cold enough long enough to study them. The liquefied gases absorbed heat from the ambient air too quickly and evaporated back into a gaseous phase. He tried boxes filled with powdered cork or hay, including one of his wife\u2019s own hat boxes.He also studied the electrical properties of supercooled gases from 1892 to 1895 with Ambrose Fleming. His discovery that cooled charcoal could help create high vacuums, in large part because charcoal was so effective at absorbing gases, particularly at very low temperatures, resulted in a better vacuum.Dewar came up with the idea of using one glass vessel inside another, the double walls separated by a thin vacuum layer. This kept the liquids cold for longer periods of time and helped revolutionize low-temperature research. Fellow scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes called it a \u201cmagnificent invention, which may be called the most important appliance for operating at extremely low temperatures.\u201dThis was the technological breakthrough Dewar needed to continue his work. He gave a series of six Christmas Lectures in December 1893, concluding on January 8, 1894, in which he liquefied some of the air in the lecture hall for the audience. He showed it could remain in liquid form for a good while if properly enclosed in a \u201cDewar flask.\u201d Two weeks later, he successfully produced solid air at the January 19 meeting of the Royal Institution.Alas, Dewar neglected to patent his invention, so he did not reap the immense financial benefits when two German glassblowers formed Thermos GmbH and marketed a hugely successful commercial product\u2013a thermal insulated beverage container suitable for storing both hot and cold liquids\u2013based on his design, which they then patented. Dewar lost a court case to reclaim his invention rights.But his scientific research prospered. Dewar successfully liquefied hydrogen gas in 1898, using a large regenerative cooling machine he built at the Royal Institution. And he kept improving his methods, ultimately succeeding in lowering temperatures to just 13 degrees above absolute zero, a point at which every gas except for helium liquefies.Dewar very much wanted to make that last achievement, but on his first attempt to liquefy helium, he failed. Helium was scarce at the time, and it seems his helium source was contaminated with neon gas, which freezes at a higher temperature. His experimental apparatus became clogged with ice.The honor of being the first to liquefy helium eventually fell to Onnes in 1908, relying on the methods Dewar pioneered. Onnes sent a telegram to Dewar on March 5, 1908, announcing the achievement: \u201cConverted helium into solid. Last evaporating parts showed considerable vapor pressures as if liquid state is jumped over.\u201d Dewar was gracious in his reply: \u201cCongratulations! Glad my anticipation of the possibility of the achievement by known methods confirmed. My helium work arrested by ill health but hope to continue later on.\u201dOnnes received the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. Dewar did not, although he was nominated several times. But he did garner many other awards and honors in his lifetime, including many prestigious medals from scientific societies. He was knighted in 1904.While serving on a government committee on explosives in the late 1880s, Dewar and a colleague, Frederick Abel, developed cordite, a smokeless gunpowder.The outbreak of World War I interrupted Dewar\u2019s research program into the properties of elements at low temperatures, and he lost several key staffers as a result. Dewar never rebuilt his program, even after the war ended, devoting his attention primarily to studying surface tension in soap bubbles, and to measuring infrared radiation in the atmosphere with a thermoscope of his own design.Dewar remained active as a scientist until the very end, refusing to retire from his position with the Royal Institution. He died in London on March 27, 1923. But his work in low-temperature gases, and particularly his invention of the Dewar flask, proved seminal to the field of cryogenics.\n\nThis Month in Physics History\n\nAPS News Archives\n\nHistoric Sites Initiative\n\nLocations and details of historic physics events"}, {"url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/918495", "page_content": "Technical Report Barclay, John ; Oseen-Send, Kathryn ; Ferguson, Luke ; ...\n\nindicates certain designs have promise to increase thermodynamic efficiency from a FOM of ~0.35 toward ~0.5 to ~0.6. The technical approach was the use of solid magnetic working refrigerants cycled in and out of high magnetic fields to build an efficient active regenerative magnetic refrigeration module providing cooling power for AMRL. A single-stage reciprocating AMRR with a design temperature span from ~290 K to ~120 K was built and tested with dual magnetic regenerators moving in and out of the conductively-cooled superconducting magnet subsystem. The heat transfer fluid (helium) was coupled to the process stream (refrigeration/liquefaction load) via high performance heat exchangers. In order to maximize AMRR efficiency a helium bypass loop with adjustable flow was incorporated in the design because the thermal mass of magnetic refrigerants is higher in low magnetic field than in high magnetic field. Heracles/Prometheus designed experiments to measure AMRR performance under a variety of different operational parameters such as cycle frequency, magnetic field strength, heat transfer fluid flow rate, amount of bypass flow of the heat transfer fluid while measuring work input, temperature span, cooling capability as a function of cold temperature as a function of the amount of bypass flow of the heat transfer fluid. The operational AMRR prototype can be used to answer key questions such as the best recipe for multiple layers of different magnetic refrigerants in one or more integrated regenerators with varying amounts of bypass flow of the heat transfer fluid. Layered regenerators are necessary to span the AMRR range from 290 K to 120K. Our AMRR performance simulation model predicts that ~10-15 % of bypass flow should significantly improve the thermodynamic performance. Initial results obtained with regenerators made of gadolinium spheres were very encouraging; a temperature span of ~ 50 K (between 295K and 245 K) across both regenerators was achieved with zero bypass flow of the heat transfer fluid and with the magnetic field strength of ~4 T.\n\nThis final report for the DOE Project entitled Active Magnetic Regenerative Liquefier (AMRL) funded under Grant DE-FG36-08GO18064 to Heracles Energy Corporation d.b.a. Prometheus Energy (Heracles/Prometheus) describes an active magnetic regenerative refrigerator (AMRR) prototype designed and built during the period from July 2008 through May 2011. The primary goal of this project was to make significant technical advances toward highly efficient liquefaction of hydrogen. Conventional hydrogen liquefiers at any scale have a maximum FOM of ~0.35 due primarily to the intrinsic difficulty of rapid, efficient compression of either hydrogen or helium working gases.
