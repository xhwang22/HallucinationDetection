Elvis scandalized adults and thrilled teens.\n\nIn 1960, he was only 4 years old when on May 1st, an American CIA U-2 spy plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the Soviet Union. Powers ejected and survived but was captured. The U.S. claimed that the U-2 was a \"weather plane\" but Powers was convicted in the Soviet Union of espionage. He was released in 1962 after 1 year, 9 months and 10 days in prison.\n\nIn 1967, Michael was merely 11 years old when on October 2nd, Thurgood Marshall was sworn in as the first black US Supreme Court justice. Marshall was the great-grandson of a slave and graduated first in his class at Howard University Law School. His nomination to the Supreme Court was approved by the Senate, 69 to 11.\n\nIn 1977, in the year of Michael Naylor's passing, on May 25th, Star Wars premiered in theaters.

No peaceful settlement has ever been agreed upon.\n\nIn 1966, Nan was merely 13 years old when on September 8th, the first Star Trek episode, \"The Man Trap,\" was broadcast on NBC.

Nixon's tax returns came under investigation. Nixon offered the recently discovered Oval Office tapes be heard by one person and summarized - his offer was rejected by the Special Prosecutor. Nixon ordered the Attorney General, then the assistant Attorney General, to fire the Special Prosecutor. Both refused and were fired. The Solicitor General became the acting Attorney General and fired the Special Prosecutor (the Saturday Night Massacre). Nixon releases some of the tapes, under extreme pressure because of the firings.\n\nIn 1986, at the age of 33 years old, Nan was alive when on January 28th, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch.

And stayed for a further 16.\n\nConverted from a striker to a left winger, and then, by Robert Kelly, to a left back, Naylor also endured some \u2018tough love\u2019 at the time which, with the benefit of hindsight, he realises was crucial.\n\n\u201cI remember going into my first full year of the YTS at 16, Chris Turner, the manager at the time \u2013 he was really \u2018on me\u2019,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cIt was the same the second year, all over everything I did, everything I said, all the time in training, and I\u2019ll be honest, at the time I was thinking \u2018get off my back\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut now, looking back, I realise he was doing it because he saw something in me - he wanted to make sure I got the best out of myself.\u201d\n\nIt certainly worked.\n\nWolves then Club Secretary Richard Skirrow still recalls sitting next to boss Mark McGhee at a reserve match at Molineux when the 17-year-old Naylor was up against a Middlesbrough team including Paul Merson and Paul Gascoigne. The two were impressed, and McGhee acted quickly in securing Naylor\u2019s long-term future.\n\nIt proved the start of a week \u2013 25 years ago in October - which then included signing his first professional contract, passing his driving test and making his first team debut. In that order.\n\n\u201cSomething in my second year really clicked,\u201d says Naylor.\n\n\u201cI was scoring goals for the youth team and playing well for the reserves, having first played for them when I was 15.\n\n\u201cThere was a reserve game against Middlesbrough at Molineux, and I had one of those nights when it all fell together.\n\n\u201cI was hitting diagonals with my right peg \u2013 which is normally just for standing on \u2013 and had one of those amazing games that you have every now and again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember all that much from my career - but I remember that!\n\n\u201cComing off the pitch Paul Merson came up and said, \u2018what\u2019s your name kid?\u2019 and told me it was one of the best performances he had ever seen from a left back.\n\n\u201cThat left me on cloud nine and a bit starstruck to be honest.\n\n\u201cI came in next morning for a warmdown and was offered a pro contract \u2013 Middlesbrough must have had a nibble! \u2013 then I went on to pass my driving test and then got my first team debut away at Birmingham, live on Sky.\n\n\u201cWas I nervous? Oh my word, yes. It was my dream, the one thing I\u2019d been working for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had tunnel vision, nothing was ever going to stop me being a professional footballer, that was the mindset I had.\n\n\u201cAnd for the first ten minutes at St Andrew\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\n\u201cKeith Curle was shouting at me and I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game 1-0 and I was gutted with the result but from an individual point of view, it was such a positive end to an amazing week when everything just seemed to fall into place.\u201d\n\nFrom there, even of such tender years, Naylor \u2018nailed\u2019 down the left back slot for large parts of the years which followed, through the many ups and downs that spending any length of time as a Wolves player necessitates.\n\nExamples such as an impressive performance in the sensational FA Cup quarter final giant-killing at Leeds, being followed by being left on the bench for the semi-final against Arsenal typified the often-dramatic Molineux rollercoaster ride.\n\nOr more pertinently following up the collective disaster of the 2001/02 season when Wolves were overhauled in the promotion race by West Bromwich Albion, with the sensational response a year later and one of the best days in the clubs\u2019 history courtesy of play-off glory against Sheffield United at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nAll these though are experiences which Naylor can now utilise as part of his role as an agent, passing on that knowledge and expertise to those players under his guidance.\n\n\u201cWhen deciding to become an agent I had that benefit of already knowing what football is like from a player point of view but I needed to learn all about the off-field work that goes with it,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cI got to grips with that and now, with having that experience of playing at a decent level, I think it really helps.\n\n\u201cEspecially now, with over 5,000 registered agents all battling for players and to do deals, it\u2019s a big challenge.\n\nLee Naylor at Wolves in 2004\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one I really enjoy, that mix of being able to pass on advice which I learned about what to do and what not do, but also the other side of it which I have developed since working as an agent.\u201d\n\nOne of the highlights which Naylor can certainly pass on, alongside taking on some of football\u2019s true heavyweights whilst at Celtic, was that play-off final, which marks its 20th anniversary next May.\n\nFollowing the travails of the previous season, Wolves didn\u2019t find consistent form until the memorable FA Cup win against Newcastle in early January, from where Wolves only lost two of their next 23 league fixtures, including the trio in the play-offs.\n\nNaylor also chipped in with a couple of vital goals, putting Wolves in front enroute to a 4-2 win at Ipswich with a sublime volley, and then a late free kick securing a narrow 2-1 advantage in the first leg of the play off semi-final against Reading.\n\n\u201cI only ever seemed to score decent goals, when I did manage to score,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cThat Ipswich one was funny because we\u2019d been awful and, in the dressing room at half time, Dave Jones was digging us out, people were fighting, it was all going off!\n\n\u201cDave had a proper go at me as well, which I thought was harsh, but I went out with an attitude to try and prove him wrong and scored an absolute \u2018worldie\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen in the play-offs Reading had caused us problems and we knew it was going to be a tough game.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we had that free kick, I knew in my head what I wanted to do and it came off my foot so sweetly that I knew it was going in.\n\n\u201cThat gave us a crucial advantage for the second leg from where we managed to come through and reach the final.\n\n\u201cAnd the final \u2013 wow, what a day. Although I have to say it passed me by a little.\n\nGiving his expert opinion on commentary with Andy Thompson at Molineux\n\n\u201cIf you speak to psychologists, they will sometimes say that when you are so massively focused on something, like a big football match, it can end up passing you by.\n\n\u201cThat is what happened to me, and I don\u2019t seem to remember much, and it\u2019s only five or six years ago that I actually watched the whole game back for the first time.\n\n\u201cThat was when bits started coming back to me, the big man (Matt Murray) saving the penalty and being incredible that day, all those crucial moments.\n\n\u201cWe had such an unbelievable dressing room at that time, a really good mix of talent and experience and the likes of myself, Matty and Joleon (Lescott) who were still quite young.\n\n\u201cBuilding up to the game, and even coming into the stadium on the coach, I just had a feeling that nothing was going to stop us that day \u2013 I was convinced we were going to win.\n\n\u201cEven with the disappointments the fans had experienced previously in the play-offs, I think they felt that optimism too, and that was in my head right from the start.\n\n\u201cWhen we first went out to walk on the pitch ages before kick-off, our fans were already in there, making so much noise, and there were hardly any from Sheffield United.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the few things that I have always remembered from that day, just thinking, \u2018this is us, no one is beating us today\u2019, and that was how it played out.\n\n\u201cThe way we started the game, they just couldn\u2019t live with us, and going in 3-0 up at half time, there aren\u2019t many teams who can come back from that.\u201d\n\nSheffield United certainly couldn\u2019t, leaving Naylor at the heart of the intense celebrations that heralded the end of a frustratingly painful 19-year absence from the top division and a first ever taste of life in the Premier League.\n\nThat was perhaps more of a sobering experience, although, even in relegation, there were more experiences to cling onto with Naylor a league ever-present in his early twenties.\n\nIt was an unforgiving arena he always planned and hoped to return to, along with trying to build on England Under-21 honours earned in a team including the likes of John Terry, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe, to the progression of a senior Three Lions call-up.\n\nMoving to Celtic at a time when Wolves were undergoing their early transformation under Mick McCarthy was a step up in itself, and a fantastic challenge, but one from which at some stage Naylor had aimed to return back to the English topflight.\n\n\u201cIn my early twenties I had felt like something clicked again and I moved up another level,\u201d Naylor remembers.\n\n\u201cI was going through games just not wanting them to finish and couldn\u2019t wait for the next one to come around.\n\n\u201cI remember winning the Player of the Year award (in 2000/01) and was flying, just loving playing football.\n\n\u201cIt got to the stage at Wolves that things were changing and I wasn\u2019t too sure where the club was going to go.\n\n\u201cI had been there for 17 years or so and still had the dream of going back to the Premier League and of playing for England.\n\n\u201cWas that going to happen for me playing at Wolves? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cCeltic are an absolutely huge football club and going there was an exciting challenge in itself but I also thought it might eventually lead on to coming back to the Premier League, and possibly playing for England.\n\n\u201cI had an amazing first season which ended up in being recognised as one of the Players of the Year in Scotland, the award eventually going to (Shunsuke) Nakamura, who thoroughly deserved it.\n\n\u201cI think the England scouts came to watch me once at Inverness \u2013 we never did well at Inverness \u2013 and we lost the game and I\u2019m not sure they ever came back.\n\n\u201cI did o-k in the second season as well and ended up staying there for four years and it got to a stage where I turned 30 and knew that the Premier League dream was not going to return.\u201d\n\nThere was perhaps one final chance to reach the top tier after being reunited with manager Jones at Cardiff, but the Bluebirds couldn\u2019t press on from a blistering launch to the 2010/11 season and finished up \u2013 as so often in that era - losing in the play-offs.\n\nAt one point, there was actually a chance of a second stint with Wolves, Naylor returning to train at the club during Dean Saunders\u2019 tenure, but he didn\u2019t quite have the immediate level of fitness to hit the ground running in a way that was required at the time.\n\nHe would later make 13 appearances for Accrington Stanley, unpaid, as a favour for their boss and his friend James Beattie, before rounding things off with several outings for Derby County.\n\nIn total he made 529 career appearances \u2013 333 of them at Wolves \u2013 and scored 14 goals, of which nine came whilst at Molineux.\n\nAfter hanging up the boots he admitted there were a couple of years of relative inactivity whilst deciding on his next step.\n\n\u201cI played a lot of golf,\u201d he laughs.\n\nNaylor, now 42, had several property interests, which he has maintained, and did complete his UEFA \u2018B\u2019 license but ultimately leant towards becoming an agent rather than a coach for an increased sense of job security.\n\nHe is also a regular pundit alongside Mikey Burrows and fellow former full back Andy Thompson on Wolves TV \u2013 \u201cpassing on my expert advice\u201d \u2013 and, as befitting his new industry, is always a keen watcher of football whether it is in heading to Molineux or watching the World Cup on television.\n\nAnd that is where, when watching defenders trying to cope with a perhaps slightly ageing Messi and Ronaldo, Naylor can reflect on the fact that he came up against both when they were properly in their prime.\n\nAlthough it was always a very different challenge facing those two in comparison to mere mortal opponents!\n\n\u201cMessi and Ronaldo are very different because it\u2019s not like they are out-and-out wingers who you end up marking all game,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThey come over to your side to do a bit, and then they\u2019re off somewhere else, and that\u2019s another reason why they are so tough to play against.\n\n\u201cThe way they play, their skill, the goals they score, their footballing brains in how they link up with others, they are obviously the elite.\n\n\u201cAnd at the same time, they are unbelievable athletes as well, which is why they are still going strong and still making an impact after so many years.\u201d\n\nSo, the age-old question which continues to permeate football and divide opinion across the globe: \u2018Who is the best?\u2019\n\nNaylor laughs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one which is always goes off in my WhatsApp chats \u2013 who is the best out of Messi and Ronaldo.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many fights and laughs around that question, but it\u2019s all good fun.\n\n\u201cWhat do I think? I don\u2019t think I can actually say. They are quite different players who have both had incredible careers so I wouldn\u2019t want to separate the two.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://happyhappybirthday.net/en/age/lee-naylor-person_eusxxx", "page_content": "Lee Naylor\n\nEnglish footballer (born 1980) \u2013 Lee Naylor was born in Walsall (town in West Midlands, England) on March 19th, 1980 and is 43 years old today.\n\nAge How old is Lee Naylor? 43 Lee Naylor is 43 years old.\n\nBiographical data\n\nLee Naylor\n\nBirthday When was Lee Naylor born?

Naylor helped Wolves earn promotion to the Premier League in 2003 under Dave Jones with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Sheffield United in the play-off final. The left-back made the most appearances in the top-flight within that squad, with 37 starts before making a further 38 outings back in the Championship the following season. Wolves missed out on the play-offs by eight points in 2006 and Naylor said his goodbyes to the club in August that year when Scottish champions Celtic paid \u00a3600,000 for his services.\n\nEngland under-21s (2000-2001)\n\nWhile he was at Wolves, Naylor was called up to the England Under-21 squad by former Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United boss Howard Wilkinson. After being an unused substitute in June 2000 against Germany, Naylor started a 3-1 defeat to Greece in a UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying outing. Within that England squad was John Terry, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole and Jermaine Defore. Naylor played the full 90 minutes in Greece, with Terry and Luke Young receiving straight red cards in injury time.\n\nCeltic (2006-2010)\n\nJoining striker Kenny Miller in joining the Celts from Wolves, Naylor became the club\u2019s first-choice left-back and grabbed an assist for Maciej Zurawski in the 2-1 victory over Hibernian. In his first experience in Europe, Naylor played every minute of Celtic\u2019s journey to the last 16 after they beat Manchester United, Benfica and FC Copenhagen in the group stage before losing 1-0 on aggregate to Italian giants AC Milan. Naylor was nominated for the SPFA Player of the Year award in 2007 before scoring his first goal in March 2008 against Hibs. One of his most memorable moments in green and white came in 2010 when he scored the opening goal with a brilliant free-kick against Old Firm rivals Rangers before assisting Marc-Antoine Fortune for the winner.\n\nCardiff City (2010-2012)\n\nFollowing his release from Celtic, Naylor returned to England with Championship side Cardiff City, who were managed by Naylor\u2019s former manager Dave Jones. However, despite only missing one of the opening 29 league games, alongside the loan arrival of Jlloyd Samuel from Bolton Wanderers, Naylor fell down the pecking order and only played a further 56 minutes before the Bluebirds were knocked out of the play-offs by Reading. Malky Mackay arrived at the club in the summer of 2011, but Naylor continued to be back-up behind Andrew Taylor and only made two league appearances before was released upon the end of his contract.\n\nAccrington Stanley (2013-2014)\n\nAfter his release from Cardiff, Naylor failed to find a club throughout the 2012/13 season, but eventually signed for James Beattie\u2019s Accrington Stanley in September 2013 on a short team deal. He started eight of his first nine games for Stanley that season, grabbing three assists as the side struggled in League Two. However, only three months after arriving at the club, Naylor\u2019s contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nDerby County (2014-2015)\n\nAnother short-term deal followed for the full-back as he jumped up two divisions to join Championship promotion chasers Derby County during the subsequent campaign to provide competition to Craig Forsyth. He made his debut on 25th March 2014 against Ipswich Town but eventually saw the Rams suffer play-off heartbreak at Wembley as Bobby Zamora\u2019s goal promoted Queens Park Rangers. In his final season as a player, Naylor\u2019s only appearance came in a FA Cup third-round tie with Southport, with the Rams winning courtesy of a Chris Martin penalty."}, {"url": "https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2022/12/08/wolves-bloxwich-boy-lee-naylor-who-went-on-to-face-the-very-best/", "page_content": "Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Celtic's Lee Naylor battle for the ball..\n\nAnd the answer has nothing to do with the World Cup, where that first two mentioned have matched into the quarter finals with Argentina and Portugal respectively.\n\nFor our purposes, the only acceptable response is that Lee Naylor played against all of them.\n\nOr should that be flipped.\n\nThey all played against Lee Naylor.\n\nNot bad for a boy from Bloxwich!\n\nHe lined up against Ronaldo whilst at Wolves, but the remaining roll of honour came whilst representing Celtic in the Champions League.\n\nIncluding one epic night at Parkhead back in 2008 when the Hoops were on the wrong end of a five-goal thriller against a Barcelona team boasting Messi, Henry and Ronaldinho as their front three.

In that order.\n\n\u201cSomething in my second year really clicked,\u201d says Naylor.\n\n\u201cI was scoring goals for the youth team and playing well for the reserves, having first played for them when I was 15.\n\n\u201cThere was a reserve game against Middlesbrough at Molineux, and I had one of those nights when it all fell together.\n\n\u201cI was hitting diagonals with my right peg \u2013 which is normally just for standing on \u2013 and had one of those amazing games that you have every now and again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember all that much from my career - but I remember that!\n\n\u201cComing off the pitch Paul Merson came up and said, \u2018what\u2019s your name kid?\u2019 and told me it was one of the best performances he had ever seen from a left back.\n\n\u201cThat left me on cloud nine and a bit starstruck to be honest.\n\n\u201cI came in next morning for a warmdown and was offered a pro contract \u2013 Middlesbrough must have had a nibble! \u2013 then I went on to pass my driving test and then got my first team debut away at Birmingham, live on Sky.\n\n\u201cWas I nervous? Oh my word, yes. It was my dream, the one thing I\u2019d been working for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had tunnel vision, nothing was ever going to stop me being a professional footballer, that was the mindset I had.\n\n\u201cAnd for the first ten minutes at St Andrew\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\n\u201cKeith Curle was shouting at me and I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game 1-0 and I was gutted with the result but from an individual point of view, it was such a positive end to an amazing week when everything just seemed to fall into place.\u201d\n\nFrom there, even of such tender years, Naylor \u2018nailed\u2019 down the left back slot for large parts of the years which followed, through the many ups and downs that spending any length of time as a Wolves player necessitates.\n\nExamples such as an impressive performance in the sensational FA Cup quarter final giant-killing at Leeds, being followed by being left on the bench for the semi-final against Arsenal typified the often-dramatic Molineux rollercoaster ride.\n\nOr more pertinently following up the collective disaster of the 2001/02 season when Wolves were overhauled in the promotion race by West Bromwich Albion, with the sensational response a year later and one of the best days in the clubs\u2019 history courtesy of play-off glory against Sheffield United at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nAll these though are experiences which Naylor can now utilise as part of his role as an agent, passing on that knowledge and expertise to those players under his guidance.\n\n\u201cWhen deciding to become an agent I had that benefit of already knowing what football is like from a player point of view but I needed to learn all about the off-field work that goes with it,\u201d Naylor explains.\n\n\u201cI got to grips with that and now, with having that experience of playing at a decent level, I think it really helps.\n\n\u201cEspecially now, with over 5,000 registered agents all battling for players and to do deals, it\u2019s a big challenge.\n\nLee Naylor at Wolves in 2004\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s one I really enjoy, that mix of being able to pass on advice which I learned about what to do and what not do, but also the other side of it which I have developed since working as an agent.\u201d\n\nOne of the highlights which Naylor can certainly pass on, alongside taking on some of football\u2019s true heavyweights whilst at Celtic, was that play-off final, which marks its 20th anniversary next May.\n\nFollowing the travails of the previous season, Wolves didn\u2019t find consistent form until the memorable FA Cup win against Newcastle in early January, from where Wolves only lost two of their next 23 league fixtures, including the trio in the play-offs.\n\nNaylor also chipped in with a couple of vital goals, putting Wolves in front enroute to a 4-2 win at Ipswich with a sublime volley, and then a late free kick securing a narrow 2-1 advantage in the first leg of the play off semi-final against Reading.\n\n\u201cI only ever seemed to score decent goals, when I did manage to score,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cThat Ipswich one was funny because we\u2019d been awful and, in the dressing room at half time, Dave Jones was digging us out, people were fighting, it was all going off!\n\n\u201cDave had a proper go at me as well, which I thought was harsh, but I went out with an attitude to try and prove him wrong and scored an absolute \u2018worldie\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen in the play-offs Reading had caused us problems and we knew it was going to be a tough game.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we had that free kick, I knew in my head what I wanted to do and it came off my foot so sweetly that I knew it was going in.\n\n\u201cThat gave us a crucial advantage for the second leg from where we managed to come through and reach the final.\n\n\u201cAnd the final \u2013 wow, what a day. Although I have to say it passed me by a little.\n\nGiving his expert opinion on commentary with Andy Thompson at Molineux\n\n\u201cIf you speak to psychologists, they will sometimes say that when you are so massively focused on something, like a big football match, it can end up passing you by.\n\n\u201cThat is what happened to me, and I don\u2019t seem to remember much, and it\u2019s only five or six years ago that I actually watched the whole game back for the first time.\n\n\u201cThat was when bits started coming back to me, the big man (Matt Murray) saving the penalty and being incredible that day, all those crucial moments.\n\n\u201cWe had such an unbelievable dressing room at that time, a really good mix of talent and experience and the likes of myself, Matty and Joleon (Lescott) who were still quite young.\n\n\u201cBuilding up to the game, and even coming into the stadium on the coach, I just had a feeling that nothing was going to stop us that day \u2013 I was convinced we were going to win.\n\n\u201cEven with the disappointments the fans had experienced previously in the play-offs, I think they felt that optimism too, and that was in my head right from the start.\n\n\u201cWhen we first went out to walk on the pitch ages before kick-off, our fans were already in there, making so much noise, and there were hardly any from Sheffield United.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the few things that I have always remembered from that day, just thinking, \u2018this is us, no one is beating us today\u2019, and that was how it played out.\n\n\u201cThe way we started the game, they just couldn\u2019t live with us, and going in 3-0 up at half time, there aren\u2019t many teams who can come back from that.\u201d\n\nSheffield United certainly couldn\u2019t, leaving Naylor at the heart of the intense celebrations that heralded the end of a frustratingly painful 19-year absence from the top division and a first ever taste of life in the Premier League.\n\nThat was perhaps more of a sobering experience, although, even in relegation, there were more experiences to cling onto with Naylor a league ever-present in his early twenties.\n\nIt was an unforgiving arena he always planned and hoped to return to, along with trying to build on England Under-21 honours earned in a team including the likes of John Terry, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe, to the progression of a senior Three Lions call-up.\n\nMoving to Celtic at a time when Wolves were undergoing their early transformation under Mick McCarthy was a step up in itself, and a fantastic challenge, but one from which at some stage Naylor had aimed to return back to the English topflight.\n\n\u201cIn my early twenties I had felt like something clicked again and I moved up another level,\u201d Naylor remembers.\n\n\u201cI was going through games just not wanting them to finish and couldn\u2019t wait for the next one to come around.\n\n\u201cI remember winning the Player of the Year award (in 2000/01) and was flying, just loving playing football.\n\n\u201cIt got to the stage at Wolves that things were changing and I wasn\u2019t too sure where the club was going to go.\n\n\u201cI had been there for 17 years or so and still had the dream of going back to the Premier League and of playing for England.\n\n\u201cWas that going to happen for me playing at Wolves? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cCeltic are an absolutely huge football club and going there was an exciting challenge in itself but I also thought it might eventually lead on to coming back to the Premier League, and possibly playing for England.\n\n\u201cI had an amazing first season which ended up in being recognised as one of the Players of the Year in Scotland, the award eventually going to (Shunsuke) Nakamura, who thoroughly deserved it.\n\n\u201cI think the England scouts came to watch me once at Inverness \u2013 we never did well at Inverness \u2013 and we lost the game and I\u2019m not sure they ever came back.\n\n\u201cI did o-k in the second season as well and ended up staying there for four years and it got to a stage where I turned 30 and knew that the Premier League dream was not going to return.\u201d\n\nThere was perhaps one final chance to reach the top tier after being reunited with manager Jones at Cardiff, but the Bluebirds couldn\u2019t press on from a blistering launch to the 2010/11 season and finished up \u2013 as so often in that era - losing in the play-offs.\n\nAt one point, there was actually a chance of a second stint with Wolves, Naylor returning to train at the club during Dean Saunders\u2019 tenure, but he didn\u2019t quite have the immediate level of fitness to hit the ground running in a way that was required at the time.\n\nHe would later make 13 appearances for Accrington Stanley, unpaid, as a favour for their boss and his friend James Beattie, before rounding things off with several outings for Derby County.\n\nIn total he made 529 career appearances \u2013 333 of them at Wolves \u2013 and scored 14 goals, of which nine came whilst at Molineux.\n\nAfter hanging up the boots he admitted there were a couple of years of relative inactivity whilst deciding on his next step.\n\n\u201cI played a lot of golf,\u201d he laughs.\n\nNaylor, now 42, had several property interests, which he has maintained, and did complete his UEFA \u2018B\u2019 license but ultimately leant towards becoming an agent rather than a coach for an increased sense of job security.\n\nHe is also a regular pundit alongside Mikey Burrows and fellow former full back Andy Thompson on Wolves TV \u2013 \u201cpassing on my expert advice\u201d \u2013 and, as befitting his new industry, is always a keen watcher of football whether it is in heading to Molineux or watching the World Cup on television.\n\nAnd that is where, when watching defenders trying to cope with a perhaps slightly ageing Messi and Ronaldo, Naylor can reflect on the fact that he came up against both when they were properly in their prime.\n\nAlthough it was always a very different challenge facing those two in comparison to mere mortal opponents!\n\n\u201cMessi and Ronaldo are very different because it\u2019s not like they are out-and-out wingers who you end up marking all game,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThey come over to your side to do a bit, and then they\u2019re off somewhere else, and that\u2019s another reason why they are so tough to play against.\n\n\u201cThe way they play, their skill, the goals they score, their footballing brains in how they link up with others, they are obviously the elite.\n\n\u201cAnd at the same time, they are unbelievable athletes as well, which is why they are still going strong and still making an impact after so many years.\u201d\n\nSo, the age-old question which continues to permeate football and divide opinion across the globe: \u2018Who is the best?\u2019\n\nNaylor laughs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one which is always goes off in my WhatsApp chats \u2013 who is the best out of Messi and Ronaldo.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many fights and laughs around that question, but it\u2019s all good fun.\n\n\u201cWhat do I think? I don\u2019t think I can actually say. They are quite different players who have both had incredible careers so I wouldn\u2019t want to separate the two.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/academy/20190417-lee-naylor-academy-graduate/", "page_content": "The former England under-21 international spent his teenage years knocking in the goals for Wolves as a striker before he was converted into a pacey left-back. Here Lee reflects on his time as a young player at Molineux.\n\nThanks for your time Lee. Firstly, how did you become part of the Wolves Academy?\n\nI came as a schoolboy at the age of 10. I stayed until I was about 12 or 13 but I didn\u2019t enjoy it, so I left. I felt the system back then was too regimented, it wasn\u2019t what I was used to, I just enjoyed going out onto a field and playing football. When I started, we were hardly playing football, it was all about the coaching and I found it boring. I just wanted to play football and score goals, because I was a striker back in the day. I went back to my Sunday League team, before coming back to Wolves a year later, and from there I got selected for a YTS (Youth Training Scheme) and eventually started playing left-back at the age of 15.\n\nWhy did you make the change from striker to left-back?\n\nI used to bang the goals in when I was a striker, I was scoring goals every week, but it was the coaches at Wolves who tried me at different positions on the left because I had a left foot. I had never seen myself as a left-back, but Rob Kelly decided to put me back there and saw something in me that I didn\u2019t see. It was weird to me at first, but I gave it my best and ended up being given the YTS, which at the time was such a massive thing to me. I knew I was a good footballer and I had a decent left foot, but I didn\u2019t expect it at all. I came in to the office on day with my mum and when they told me I was being given a YTS and I was just overjoyed, I was overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nWhat are some of your favourite memories from your time as a young player at Wolves?\n\nI remember Chris Turner, who was my coach at the time, used to get on at me over everything and I hated it. But obviously, now I\u2019m older I can see that everything he said to me was for a reason, to make me a better player because he could see the potential in me. I remember doing well throughout my first season as a YTS, I played in some good reserve games, but come my second year, something just clicked in me. I was going through games and found them so easy, getting five or six goals by October as a wing-back. I played a reserve game out at Molineux against Middlesbrough and it was the best game I\u2019ve ever had. It was frightening. I was ducking inside, spraying passes with my right leg \u2013 I never used my right before in my life, and I played a 70-yard pass, putting the other winger through on goal. I was taking on senior pros in that game and Paul Merson was playing. When we came off the pitch he asked me what my name was and told me it was one of the best performances he\u2019d ever seen. The next day I was offered a professional contract.\n\nYou made your professional debut in a derby game against Birmingham City, how were you feeling before that match?\n\nI was more excited than nervous. I just got told I was travelling with the team after being in and around the reserves for quite a while. I had a mad week before that game. I had played youth team football, passed my driving test, had my best game ever for the reserves mid-week and then got chucked into the Wolves-Blues derby \u2013 live on Sky \u2013 at the weekend. All that happened in the one week and I was just on cloud nine. But I had no idea I was going to be playing in that match as I wasn\u2019t even training with the first-team. When we were having the team talk half an hour before kick-off, Mark McGhee calls out my name and tells me I\u2019m playing. My name wasn\u2019t even in the programme. It was a brilliant day, I couldn\u2019t even hear myself think for the first 15 minutes of the game because it was so loud. Playing in front of that sort of crowd at 17 was amazing.\n\nFinally, how did you find being part of an Academy group which consisted of some of the best players the club has produced?\n\nIf not the best in a player like Robbie [Keane]. Rob and I started with our YTS at the same time and we used to be brought in to training together by my mum because he lived out close to us in Wednesfield. We had a good crop. I think it was the first time the club had gone over to Ireland and scouted there because we had a lot of Irish boys in Seamus Crowe, Keith Andrews, Rob, Alan Dixon and it was a brilliant time. You were in and around the first team, carrying out your duties such as cleaning boots, and it prepared you well to go on and become a professional.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Wolves versus West Ham United matchday programme, which is available around Molineux on matchdays for just \u00a33.50, and also featured content with Adama Traore, Will Norris and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake.

It was however a transfer which was not originally met with universal approval from the Bhoys support.\n\nNaylor had spent all his career at Wolves and following soon after the dismal failure of Mo Camera, a free transfer from Burnley, the Celtic support were not pleased at the club looking once more towards the English Championship in their bid to solve the problematic left-back position.\n\nFor his part, Naylor was delighted to have secured a move to Parkhead, and his enthusiasm and obvious joy at joining Celtic was evident in his early interviews as well as his performances on the pitch. Indeed within weeks of arriving, Naylor had won over most of the Celtic support with his energetic and tenacious play.\n\nAn over-lapping full back, Naylor was an asset in both attack and defence. Eager to get forward and get a cross into the box, Naylor also ensured he didn\u2019t neglect his primary role and worked hard in curtailing opposition attacks. Although his performances dipped by the end of that season he had done enough to be nominated as a candidate for the SPFA Player of the Year Award 2006/07.\n\nCracks had however began to appear in his play and as the new season began, Naylor appeared to be a different player from the one that impressed during his first six months at the club. His distribution was dire, good opportunities were squandered by over-hit crosses and misplaced passes. Defensively he was often caught out of position and looked uncomfortable when players ran at him with the ball\n\nLess than a year after giving hope that Celtic\u2019s search for a quality left-back could be over, it appeared that Naylor, like many before him, was not the answer. He did however retain a regular starting spot \u2013 scoring his first goal in a vital win over Hibs (s cracker of a goal he scored v Hibs was to everyone\u2019s surprise but more than deserving of all the plaudits that came his way after it) \u2013 as Celtic dramatically battled back to claim the 2007/08 championship and their third title in a row.\n\nSeason 2008/09 saw Celtic surrender their grip on the league title and once more Naylor\u2019s performances were frequently criticised by the support. A seemingly likeable character off the pitch, Naylor, despite his obvious failings on the park, he never gave anything less than his all in the Hoops but the fact remained that the left-back slot remained a significant weakness within the Celtic team.\n\nThe arrival in July 2009 of the highly rated Danny Fox from Coventry \u2013 ironically another Championship team \u2013 appeared to spell the end of Naylor\u2019s days as the first choice left-back at Parkhead. Naylor made a number of cameo appearances filling in for Fox when the ex-Sky Blues man was injured.\n\nWhen Danny Fox surprisingly exited Parkhead prematurely in the January transfer window, Bhoys boss Tony Mowbrary underlined his reluctance to use Naylor by bringing in Dutch internationalist Edson Braafheid on loan from Bayern Munich. The Dutchman disappointed, and following the departure of Mowbray the interim Celtic manager Neil Lennon recalled Naylor to the starting line-up. Patience from Naylor had paid off.\n\nTo Lee Naylor\u2019s credit he came good, and to the surprise of most he played a strong part and put the Dutch internationalist in the shade (where notably Braafheid later played in the World Cup final at the end of the season). Admittedly no stunning performances, but he still managed to hit the jackpot and grab a goal against Rangers in the final league derby match in May 2010. Something that he will prize. It may have been a deflection from his free-kick but it was still one more goal than Danny Fox scored this season from free-kicks (and Danny Fox was meant to be a free-kick specialist). Naylor had caught the eye of sections of the support and all were happy for him.\n\nHowever, with a new manager to come, the squad had to be refreshed and Lee Naylor had been in and out for the last couple of seasons. He was released on a free in June 2010, and despite the criticisms from sections of the support, he will be fondly remembered by the majority for his time and effort.
