By then Joe\u2019s fans already included guitar icons Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to many records,\u201d Clapton said, \u201cbut I listen to his.\u201d Page talked of Joe\u2019s \u201ctremendous feel\u201d for the guitar, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve loved his style since the early James Gang.\u201d\n\nOf course, that was even before Joe joined the Eagles and made indelible contributions to the great American pop culture canon on such songs as \u201cHotel California\u201d and \u201cLife in the Fast Lane,\u201d and, more recently, became an honorary member of the Foo Fighters.\n\nJoe Fidler Walsh was born in Wichita, Kansas, on November 20, 1947. His mother was an avid piano player who brought music into the family\u2019s humble home before Joe was old enough to discover rock 'n\u2019 roll on the radio. When Joe was still young, he and his family moved to Ohio, Chicago, New York City, and then Montclair, New Jersey. In 1965, Joe landed back in Ohio where he attended Kent State University. His professional music career began then, in coffee shops and bars.\n\nThough Joe had played guitar in a high school cover band and a popular Kent bar band while in college, he really came into his own in 1968, when he joined the Cleveland-based James Gang. One night in May, 1968, on the way to Detroit for a show at the Grande Ballroom opening for Cream, half the band quit. Needing the money to pay for gas to get home, the James Gang took the stage as a trio, and Joe was forced to learn on the fly how to carry rhythm and lead duties while now singing lead simultaneously. It proved a revelation. Permanently reconfigured as a trio, the James Gang quickly developed a huge following in the Midwest and landed a record deal, leading to a 1969 debut album, \"Yer\u2019 Album,\" that became an FM radio staple and drew the ears of guitar aficionados like Pete Townshend \u2014 who personally invited Joe and the James Gang to join the Who on tour. Townshend regarded Joe as \u201ca fluid and intelligent player\u201d with few peers.\n\nSoon the American public caught up in a big way, as the James Gang scored hits with singles like \u201cFunk #49\u201d and \u201cWalk Away\u201d and gold certifications for the albums \"James Gang Rides Again\" (1970) and \"Thirds\" (1971) before Joe\u2019s departure following the landmark 1971 live album, \"Live in Concert,\" recorded at New York City\u2019s Carnegie Hall, where the James Gang was the first rock band ever to play.\n\nDespite the band\u2019s upward trajectory, Joe found himself at a creative crossroads: The music he was hearing in his head no longer fit the trio format. He impulsively walked away from a band with consecutive gold albums and moved from Cleveland to a former mining village high in the Colorado Rockies to pursue an as-yet-undefined sound with a new set of collaborators. In typical Joe Walsh style, he found out about a new studio being built nearby and arranged to record there for next to nothing in exchange for working out the kinks in the untested room. The album became the much-loved self-titled 1972 debut by Joe\u2019s next band, Barnstorm, and the studio became the legendary Caribou Ranch, soon to be home to hit recordings by Elton John, Chicago, and Earth Wind & Fire, among many others.\n\nBarnstorm\u2019s second album, 1973\u2019s \"The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get,\" yielded the biggest hit of Joe\u2019s career to that point, with \u201cRocky Mountain Way\u201d eclipsing his James Gang output. Once again, however, despite another band on the rise, Joe was gradually getting restless.\n\nHe found a new sense of home \u2014 and a new manager, Irving Azoff \u2014 in the musical melting pot of Los Angeles, where Joe formed bonds with Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Jackson Brown, Dan Fogelberg and J. D. Souther, among others. The 1974 solo album, \"So What,\" emerged from this period, and both that album and the live solo album that followed, \"You Can\u2019t Argue with a Sick Mind,\" hit the charts, making Joe a bona fide solo sensation.\n\nEven so, when the Eagles asked Joe to join, he jumped at the chance. He and the members of the band had already been jamming and writing together as part of the magically fertile LA scene, and now he was able to bring his rock edge to the vocal harmonies he loved so much in the Eagles. The result was lightning in a bottle, and the new lineup of the Eagles defined an entire era with \"Hotel California.\" The album took the already-successful band to dazzling new heights: \"Hotel California\" went on to sell over 50 million copies and the title track won the band a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Joe\u2019s presence also transformed the band as a concert experience, adding his harder-edged solo songs to the live repertoire.\n\nAs the recording of the Eagles\u2019 follow-up album dragged on, Joe recorded and released a solo album, 1978\u2019s \"But Seriously Folks\u2026,\" which spawned his signature send-up of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle, \u201cLife\u2019s Been Good.\u201d During the same period he recorded \u201cIn the City\u201d for the soundtrack of the film \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d That track was also re-recorded for the Eagles album that finally emerged in late 1979, \"The Long Run. \"\n\nDespite the success of \"The Long Run,\" which included three top 10 hits and won the band another Grammy, the extremes of being the biggest band in the land took its toll: Eagles ground to a halt in 1980 and eventually confirmed they had split up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Joe recorded another solo album, 1981\u2019s \"There Goes the Neighborhood,\" featuring perennial fan favorite \u201cLife of Illusion.\u201d Even as Joe spent the next decade battling increased problems with drugs and alcohol, one thing remained constant: his desire to make and perform music. \"You Bought It \u2013 You Name It\" came out in 1983; \"The Confessor\" in 1985; \"Got Any Gum?\" in 1987; \"Ordinary Average Guy\" in 1991; and \"Songs for a Dying Planet\" in 1992. Those years also saw him join Ringo Starr\u2019s inaugural All-Starr Band alongside members of both the Band and the E Street Band, among others; he also toured extensively with Australian supergroup the Party Boys. In addition, Joe played on records by everyone from the Beach Boys, Bob Seger, and Steve Winwood to Michael McDonald, Warren Zevon and Lionel Richie, and produced a New Zealand band called the Herbs.\n\nIn 1994, Hell Freezes Over, and Joe teamed up again with Don, Glenn and Timothy to reform the Eagles. Pent-up demand for the band led to 10 years of record-breaking tours. And when in 2007 they recorded a new studio album, \"Long Road Out of Eden,\" it reached a staggering six-time platinum status long after the industry had pronounced the album form dead.\n\nIn 1998, Joe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame together with the band.\n\nThe reformation of the Eagles coincided with a new musical beginning for Joe, who was now clean and sober since 1995, leading to one of the most fertile periods of his career. In addition to all the activity with the Eagles, Joe embarked on a James Gang reunion (originally at the behest of then-President Bill Clinton). In 2001, Walsh received an Honorary Doctorate from Kent State University.\n\nIn 2012, Walsh released his 10th solo album and first release in 20 years, \"Analog Man.\" The record featured 10 new songs and was co-produced with Jeff Lynne. Critically acclaimed, it also resonated with fans and concert audiences, and Joe found himself in high demand as a collaborator, producer and guest musician. Among the highlights: he played alongside Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen in the closing jam at the 2012 Grammy Awards show and that same year the Berklee College of Music gave each of the Eagles Honorary Doctor of Music degrees; he took part in the 2014 CBS TV special commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Beatles' first appearance on U.S. television; and he appeared on the Foo Fighters 2014 \"Sonic Highways\" album and the corresponding TV episode documenting its creation.\n\nIn 2014, Walsh played select solo shows as well as with the Eagles on The History of the Eagles World Tour, named after their two-part, Emmy award-winning documentary, and the tour continued through July 2015. In fall 2015, Joe launched his solo \"Walsh Toor 2015.\" On Oct. 4, 2015, Joe performed at the UNITE to Face Addiction rally in Washington, D.C., which he viewed as an honor since he had been sober himself since 1995. Joe headlined the show alongside friends including Steven Tyler, Sheryl Crow and Jason Isbell.\n\nThe year 2016 saw Walsh back out on the road, with a summer co-headline arena tour with Bad Company, as well as solo Walsh Toor dates. In August 2016, \"Citizen Soldier\" was released - a documentary about an Oklahoma National Guard brigade deployed to Afghanistan - to which Joe proudly wrote original music, always eager to contribute to helping vets and bring awareness to their cause. On Sept. 28 Walsh performed with Vince Gill, James Taylor, Chris Stapleton and Kacey Musgraves for All For The Hall. October saw Walsh as grand marshal for the NASCAR \u201cCitizen Soldier 400\u201d race at Dover Downs. On Dec. 4, Walsh became a Kennedy Center Honor recipient as a member of the Eagles, which was presented by Ringo Starr. Closing out the year, Walsh was honored for his solo career by the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, which on Dec. 8 gave Walsh \u201cThe Founders Award,\u201d presented by Ringo Starr and Paul Allen. The event included a tribute concert celebrating Walsh\u2019s musical legacy by Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins, Paul Rodgers, Todd Rundgren, Robert Randolph and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.\n\nIn 2017, Walsh launched VetsAid, his 501c3 nonprofit organization, with the first annual concert event on Sept. 20 at the EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia. A Gold Star family member himself, Walsh always has supported veterans issues and his goal was to raise funds to directly support a variety of veterans service organizations that provide complete holistic care for veterans and their families - physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. The first show featured full set performances from Joe and his friends Keith Urban, Zac Brown Band and Gary Clark Jr. VetsAid 2018 sold out the Tacoma Dome, with a crowd of 17,500 (over twice the audience from the first year, 7,500) and this time Joe was joined by friends Haim, Chris Stapleton, James Taylor and Don Henley and a special guest, Ringo Starr. VetsAid has paid out over $1,155,000 in grants and the third annual VetsAid has just been announced and will take place in Houston, Texas, at the Toyota Center on Nov. 10, 2019.\n\nThe year of 2017 also saw Walsh play a six-show residency series at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, continuing to tour throughout the year as a solo artist and then returning to the House of Blues in November 2017 for additional dates. That summer Walsh reunited with fellow Eagles member Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit, accompanied by Deacon Frey and Vince Gill, for the triumphant Classic West and Classic East concert events. This led to additional stadium and arena breaking shows around the world throughout 2018.\n\nIn October 2018, Facing Addiction with NCADD honored Joe and Marjorie Walsh at its annual gala for their enduring and inspiring service and support of addicts and alcoholics in recovery. Their brother & sister in law, Ringo and Barbara Starkey, presented their award.\n\nThe year 2019 saw the Eagles continuing to play to capacity crowds and garner rave reviews. Of their June 2019 Wembley performance critics wrote: \"Eagles are not just the best selling American band, they are simply the best.\" (Daily Mail) \"Eagles take flight at triumphant show\" (Metro) and \"soaring return\" (Guardian). It is safe to say these Eagles aren't landing or stopping anytime soon."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/joe-walsh-my-life-in-15-songs-66390/", "page_content": "I start the riot in the final scene of The Blues Brothers. [Ed. Note: Walsh plays a prison inmate who begins dancing on a table while the band plays \"Jailhouse Rock.\"] The part of the movie they were filming in L.A., there were hours between set changes. And John [Belushi] would call me up and say, \"I can't sit here. I have nothing to do. Can you come over and hang out?\" So I did. I hung out in the trailer with Danny [Aykroyd] and Belushi and they decided they had a scene for me in the movie. So that's how that happened.\n\nBy that time, John and I had been friends for a while. I met Belushi on the road in Chicago. He came to an Eagles concert. He showed up in my room and didn't leave for two days. He wanted to show me how cool Chicago was, and he took me out to the finest restaurant. There's a whole story with that with how they wouldn't let us in because of the way we were dressed. So we went and spray painted our jeans black and went back. Then we did about $28,000 worth of damage to my hotel room.\n\nWhen the Eagles stopped in 1980 \u2026 I kept going. I didn't really want to admit it had ended, so I just kept the same mentality and lifestyle. And the way I wound up was that the only thing that mattered to me was not running out of cocaine. And also vodka. Vodka, cocaine and Camel Light cigarettes. Those three things.\n\nGradually, I stopped writing music and I stopped taking care of myself. I burned bridges. I was not dependable. I didn't make any sense a lot of the time. Musicians didn't really care to work with me anymore. I had an \"I don't care about anything\" attitude. My day \u2013 and it was really hard work \u2013 was spent trying to find a dealer who would front me some cocaine when I still owed him for the last batch. And if I was awake, I was drinking. I was just empty. I was godless and I took it about as far as a I could go. And I'd seen buddies go away. Keith Moon took it all the way. Belushi, he had gotten sober. And I helped him do it. He said, \"Look, I gotta quit. Do you know a sober companion?\" I said, \"Yeah, I know somebody. But you're gonna hate me for getting him for you and you're gonna hate him. But he'll get you clean.\" And John was doing great. Then he fell off the wagon, and on and on."}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-walsh-got-any-gum/", "page_content": "The late '80s were a challenging period for classic rockers: Could they remain relevant and maintain their levels of success, born of moments six or eight or 10 years before, when they were topping the charts and regularly packing arenas? Many were staring down their 40s, if not meekly entering them, crossing a threshold that at one time was impossible to fathom. Rock was a young person's game, a music of rebellion and reaction to those of a certain, older set.\n\nJoe Walsh was among this aging rock-star demographic, turning 40 in 1987. He dealt with his age and the expectations of a rock audience by both indulging in a debilitating drinking habit, while embracing then-current keyboard-heavy sounds on the solo album he released that year, Got Any Gum?\n\nThe bulk of the project was recorded at Memphis' renowned Ardent Studios, where producer Terry Manning preferred to work. Walsh liked Studio A in the facility, according to studio manager Jody Stephens, who initially rose to fame as Big Star's drummer. The room \"has huge baffles so that you can really damp things down to where it's almost a '70s studio,\" Stephens later told Goldmine. Others who have made albums there include the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Robert Cray.\n\nDrummer Chad Cromwell, a session musician and would go on to play with everyone from Neil Young and Mark Knopfler to Michael Bolton and Jessica Simpson, remembers how he got asked to play on Got Any Gum? It all started, in typical fashion, during a messy gig with Walsh.\n\n\"I met Joe at a recording studio in Memphis where I worked a lot and did a lot of sessions,\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"When Joe came into town, he just came over and there was some sort of party going on. I was introduced to Joe. That was one of the strangest things because we just stayed up all night, acting like idiots, as everyone would do in the mid-'80s.\"\n\nWalsh asked Cromwell to accompany him to Dallas, where they would rehearse for a week with bassist Rick Rosas before playing a radio station-sponsored festival concert in Los Angeles. Cromwell agreed, but the week went by and no rehearsals happened. \"We get on a plane [at the end of the week] and fly to L.A.,\" Cromwell recalled. \"We get off the plane and literally get in a car and drive out to [the venue]. There are 20,000 people at this venue and I am shitting myself since I still haven't rehearsed with Joe and Rick.\n\n\"I remember walking onstage,\" he added, \"going, 'Okay! I'm probably going to be put on a plane home after this is over with, but fuck it. If he doesn't want to rehearse, I'm just going with it, with him. I'll see what happens.'\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'In My Car'\n\nA few missteps aside, the gig went well, and Cromwell became Walsh's first-call drummer when he went back to Memphis to record Got Any Gum? at Ardent. Cromwell was intrigued by working with Manning, who had provided the drum programming and synthesizer work on Eliminator \u2013 the 1983 LP that brought the rough-edged ZZ Top a whole new sound, and a big hit record.\n\n\"Terry was pretty big on whatever the latest, coolest piece of gear would be at the time,\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"There was a company called AMS \u2013 they made a gated reverb box and then a delay box that probably is most well known as the drum sound on 'In the Air Tonight' by Phil Collins. Same gear, same box.\n\n\"If you listen to Got Any Gum?, you're going to hear the same thing,\" Cromwell added. \"I remember thinking at the time, 'This is the most incredible drum sound I've ever heard in my life.' I wasn't really thinking about how dated that would sound 10 years later.\"\n\nThe drum work wasn't the only quintessentially '80s sound on Got Any Gum? as the preponderance of synthesizers and compression led to an overall thin audio quality. That was, of course, somewhat typical for the era \u2013 but not for Walsh. For perhaps the first time, it sounded like his guitar was fighting to be heard over the patches and plastic. Got Any Gum? was about as far as one could imagine Walsh getting from the sound he'd all but patented since the first James Gang record decades earlier.\n\nWalsh saw it differently. \"What I'm really trying to do is get back to that young, aggressive feeling,\" he told the Sun-Sentinel while on a supporting tour. \"I'm full circle from being young and curious in the James Gang, going through development as an artist in the Eagles. I want to get back to what it was.\"\n\nOpinions are split on whether Walsh's curiosity actually resulted in a good record. There are certainly some intriguing songs to pick through, dated production and all.\n\n\"In My Car\" was co-written with Ringo Starr and originally appeared on Starr's 1983 album Old Wave, with Walsh co-producing and playing lead guitar. The big keyboard sound on Walsh's cover sounds like it should be on a soundtrack to an '80s high-school movie \u2013 though the keyboards are underpinned by an acoustic guitar, and Walsh plays a tasty solo in the middle of the song.\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'The Radio Song'\n\nOne of the few tracks on Got Any Gum? that got any traction was \"The Radio Song,\" which was a minor hit at rock radio, hitting No. 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It's a pretty simple song about the pleasures of listening to music, with a chorus that's a winner, and some insistent guitar work that cuts through the atmospheric synthesizers, however briefly.\n\nComing in late on the record is \"Memory Lane,\" a touching ballad cut from a similar fabric as \"Pretty Maids All in a Row,\" Walsh's contribution to the Eagles' Hotel California. It's a heavy sentiment, on the power of looking back, and how memories can pull us out into \"faraway places and long ago names.\"\n\n\"Fun\" is perhaps the cut that sounds most like classic Joe Walsh from Got Any Gum? It's got a guitar sound right out of \"Rocky Mountain Way\" and \"Funk #49,\" with cannon-shot drums and an unfettered Walsh vocal. All the hard-rock noise is given purpose as he implores the listener to have a good time \u2013 while also noting how good a time Walsh is also having. How this didn't crack rock radio like \"The Radio Song\" did is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, few people embraced Got Any Gum? Released on Oct. 29, 1987, the LP was a critical dud. (The Los Angeles Times, in a typical comment, described it as a \"monumental flop.\"). Got Any Gum? was a commercial disappointment as well, topping out at No. 113 on the Billboard album chart.\n\nWalsh was still a sizable live draw, but his physical condition was becoming a concern. Supporting the record at the end of 1987 and into 1988, Walsh began to show the effects of his issues with alcohol. Carter Alan, a writer and longtime disc jockey in the New England area, saw it firsthand when he served as emcee at a Walsh show in New Hampshire.\n\n\"What was tragic,\" Alan said in his book Decibel Diaries: A Story of Rock in 50 Concerts, \"was the extent to which Joe Walsh's drinking had crippled his ability to play. I almost cried as he fumbled the solo to 'Life in the Fast Lane,' unable to replicate or even approach the mastery of his original studio performance. While Walsh's fingers responded clumsily, as if operated by an inept puppeteer hidden in the rafters above, several extended episodes of slurry rhetoric at the microphone replaced much of the music.\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'Fun'\n\nWalsh's promotional appearances on television shows like Late Night with David Letterman and The Arsenio Hall Show were shambolic, with sloppy performances followed by uncomfortable interview segments between the hosts and a visibly impaired Walsh.\n\nOn Hall's show, Walsh accused the host (a fellow Cleveland native) of stealing his hubcaps, before degenerating even further into a drunken announcement of his candidacy for president. He'd also done so in 1980, to great comic effect, but repeating the joke while slurring his words on national television in 1987 was not so funny.\n\nIt took the 1994 Eagles reunion to get Walsh to rehab \u2013 and he says he's remained sober to this day. Chad Cromwell remembers the circumstances that led Walsh to get help. Cromwell was having dinner with a friend in a restaurant in Hollywood when Walsh, fresh from a meeting with his Eagles bandmates, showed up and approached their table.\n\n\"He looked straight at us and said, 'They won't let me in the band if I don't go to rehab. I gotta go to rehab,'\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"He was just a wreck. It was heartbreaking. He was in such bad shape. The next morning, he went to rehab. He has been sober ever since.\"\n\nWalsh's fortitude is the likeliest reason he has remained sober, but Cromwell also credits others for compelling him to get in that condition. \"The Eagles definitely saved his life,\" Cromwell added. \"No question about it.\"\n\nCombining sobriety and the life of a working musician was no easy task, Walsh admitted in a 2012 talk with Interview. \"It wasn't like you flick a switch, and you're sober,\" he said. \"It takes a while. You have to learn how to do everything all over again. You can measure how long that takes in terms of years.\n\n\"What I didn't know at the time was how to write music and do rock 'n' roll and live rock 'n' roll and record sober,\" Walsh added. \"I didn't try to do that at first.

As The Eagles\u2019 lead guitarist, Joe has inspired millions of guitar players worldwide, including Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, and Pete Townshend (all of whom are legends in their own right). Walsh is a classic Rock N\u2019 Roll guitarist, regarded as one of the genre\u2019s most distinguishing artists.\n\nHis rhythm playing has a jagged and syncopated brilliance with no competition. He\u2019s responsible for inventing a large portion of the \u201870s rock sounds that we know and love today.\n\nWhat Guitar Does Joe Walsh Play?\n\nJoe Walsh primarily plays Gibson Les Paul and Fender Stratocaster model guitars. He credits their all-time classical sound and easy dynamics as the main reason he loves these models. Joe also has signature models issued to his name with other manufacturers including Carvin, Duesenberg, and PRS.\n\nSee the full list of Joe Walsh guitars and gear below.\n\n1958 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop\n\nFinish Goldtop Years Used 1970 to Present\n\nWhile the story behind Walsh acquiring this stapled six-string might be unknown, some theories point out that Joe bought it just after selling his original 59 Les Paul to Pete Townshend. Joe\u2019s Goldtop LP made some appearances with The Eagles, however, it was a rare sight given Don Fedler\u2019s go-to EDS sound, which left little room for the humbucking sound of Walsh\u2019s Les Paul. Nevertheless, this guitar finally got a proper taste of the limelight in the mid-80s when Joe went solo.\n\nJoe\u2019s Goldtop Gibson Les Paul is from the 1950s, known as Gibson\u2019s Golden Era, particularly 1957-1959. This is one of the final Les Pauls built before Gibson switched from gold to sunburst finish. It boasts a mahogany body and a neck with a maple top. These contribute to the weight and tone of the instrument. It has a Tune-O-Matic bridge that is easily adjustable and Kluson deluxe tuners, which add to the premium feel of this Goldtop Les Paul. A buttery smooth rosewood fretboard with Gibson\u2019s trademark trapezium inlays is also included.\n\nThe two PAF humbucker pickups in this guitar are legends in their own right, capable of producing a wide range of tones that have won hearts for decades. Joe has stated that the sound and design of this guitar are among the best, making this guitar one of his all-time favorite guitars. He regularly uses it to inspire creativity when writing new songs.\n\nHe also owns several versions of the Goldtop Lespaul, including the one with a Bigsby tremolo bridge with a removed pickguard that he used in his 1995 concert performance of \u2018Life\u2019s Been Good,\u2019 as well as the \u201958 reissue version received as a gift from his wife.\n\nFender Stratocaster Elite\n\nFinish Cream White Years Used 1983 to 2012\n\nJoe has often credited this particular enhanced Stratocaster for his eclectic fused solo sound. Some claim that Walsh got his guitars during the last leg of The Eagles first line-up in 1980, but it wasn\u2019t until 1983 that this Elite Fender Strat made an official appearance on stage with Joe, nevertheless, it\u2019s been a mainstay on his rig ever since then.\n\nThe Fender Elite Stratocaster is an attempt to incorporate active electronics into an improved Stratocaster design. While the Elite shares many features with a standard Stratocaster, it has a different tremolo bridge, called the \u2018Freeflyte\u2019 and individual push-pickup selections.\n\nThis guitar model has an alder body, a maple neck, and a maple fingerboard with 21 jumbo frets, which suits Joe\u2019s preferences. The \u2018Freeflyte\u2019 tremolo mechanism is an upgrade from the earlier versions of the Strats and allows Joe to be more creative with his whammy.\n\nOther features include three unique Alnico 2 single-coil pickups covered in gold and an internal dummy coil for hum cancellation, which was unusual and ahead of its time. The pickups include the standard three push-button pickup selection controls and a master volume knob, TBX equalizer, and MDX booster.\n\nThese extras can make this Fender Elite Strat sound like a humbucker, making it far more versatile and distinct from its competitors. The Elite series is unquestionably a flagship example of Fender\u2019s innovative capabilities, and Joe is one of the fortunate owners of this beauty.\n\nFender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster\n\nFinish Black Years Used 1988 to Present\n\nThis Fender Signature Eric Clapton Stratocaster is essentially a reissue of a vintage 1957 Stratocaster. It has an alder body and a soft V-shaped rosewood neck from the \u201854 reissue that replaced the original maple neck because Joe prefers the tonal qualities of rosewood over maple.\n\nThree Fender Vintage Noiseless pickups, powered by an active MDX mid-boost circuit with 25 dB of gain and TBX tone controls, are fitted on this guitar. These allow Joe to replicate Eric Clapton\u2019s tone precisely.\n\nJoe has frequently been seen with this instrument during his tours with the Eagles. One of the most memorable appearances of this guitar was at the \u2018Strat Pack\u2019 concert at Wembley in 2004, which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster.\n\nRickenbacker 230 GF\n\nFinish Jet Black Years Used 1992 to Unspecified\n\nGlenn Frey, a renowned solo recording artist and co-founder of the famed \u201cEagles,\u201d collaborated with Rickenbacker to produce the Rickenbacker 230 GF, his signature guitar.\n\nHe gave Joe one of these guitars as soon as he got his hands on them. Glenn\u2019s goal of returning to simplicity in a period of ever-increasing complexity inspired the design of the 230 GF. It boasts remarkable clarity, practicality, and longevity while renouncing austerity and ostentation.\n\nIt incorporates the shape of Rickenbacker\u2019s future Series 200/2000 solid-body guitars and refines it with additional contours for comfort. Solid maple makes up the body, neck, and fretboard, all finished in a high-gloss jet black lacquer. This finish gives the instrument a more majestic appearance.\n\nThe Rickenbacker 230 GF also has two high-output humbucking pickups that have been carefully voiced to give a broad spectrum of tones, from warm to loud. These guitars\u2019 sounds are refined by a pickup-selector, single volume knob, and other tone controls. Joe primarily employs this guitar for slide work. In the Netflix documentary \u2018History of the Eagles,\u2019 he can also be seen playing this guitar in his studio for the song \u201cHell Freezes Over\u201d.\n\n1977 Fender Telecaster Custom\n\nFinish Sunburst Years Used 1977 to Present\n\nThis 1977 Fender Telecaster Custom is a stunning vintage beauty with a slim, contoured maple neck and black dot inlays. The neck is silky smooth and feels like a dream. It has a lovely 3-tone sunburst finish that contributes to the vintage feel.\n\nThis instrument has two original Fender Wide Range humbuckers with embossed covers and completely dominates the stage. The pickups are controlled by a three-way pickup switch and dual volume and tone control knobs embellished with black \u2018witch hat\u2019 knobs.\n\nWith all of these premium qualities and the intense tone that this Fender Telecaster provides, it is no wonder that a pro-guitarist like Joe, who is also from that era, has one of these beauties. Joe displayed this guitar during a live concert in 1977, when he sang songs like \u2018Hotel California,\u2019 \u2018One of These Nights,\u2019 and \u2018Take it Easy.\u2019\n\n1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard\n\nFinish Cherry Sunburst Years Used 1959 to 1969\n\nJoe Walsh has cited this particular guitar as one of the most important ones of his career. It was the instrument that helped him find a certain balance and sonic chemistry between him and fellow Mesles bandmate Larry Lewis. Whenever Lewis would go for his preferred single-coil axes, Joe would find a perfectly suitable tone with this legendary 59 Les Paul. Its fair to note that this was Walsh\u2019s main choice during his time with The Mesles, although there\u2019s two singles that hold that era as a part of his career, this LP would also be an important part of the James Gang.\n\nLes Pauls from the \u201959s are considered the pinnacle of American electric guitar craftsmanship and are among the most collectible vintage guitars on the market. This flagship guitar is one of the best models of his generation. His \u201959s Gibson Les Paul has a stunning flamed maple top with a cherry sunburst finish that is only found on Les Pauls from this era.\n\nIt\u2019s also equipped with an original set of PAF humbuckers. These pickups have been used on almost every major rock album from the 1960s. Another benefit of this guitar is that it\u2019s one of the most adaptable you\u2019ll find in terms of appearance and sound. Joe often flaunted this rare beauty during his live performances.\n\nAnother guitar hero from Joe\u2019s time, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, managed to get his hands on this guitar. Page bought this guitar from Joe for $500 in 1969. This guitar was his first Les Paul, and it went on to become his famed \u201cnumber 1\u201d. Gibson Custom Shop meticulously inspected this rare original \u201959 Les Paul Standard, even down to the smallest details, and reproduced it with extraordinary precision in limited numbers.\n\nGretsch 6120\n\nFinish Western Orange Years Used 1957 to 1970\n\nThe Gretsch 6120 is one of the most prestigious axes Joe has ever had the pleasure of handling. It is a hollow-body electric guitar that first appeared in the mid-1950s. The 6120 was the first in a series of Chet Atkins-signed Gretsch guitars. It has a laminated 16\u2033 maple body with a bound ebony fretboard and the distinctive neoclassic fret inlays known as \u2018thumbnails.\u2019\n\nThis Gretsch guitar has one of the cleanest tones globally, thanks to a pair of Gretsch\u2019s own \u2018Filtertron\u2019 humbucking pickups controlled by a master volume knob, a tone switch, and a pickup selector. It also included a premium Bigsby tremolo tailpiece, which is another premium piece that contributes to the overall beauty of this guitar.\n\nJoe had this guitar in his arsenal until 1970 when he gave it as a gift to Pete Townshend of the famous band \u2018The Who,\u2019 who used it to record albums such as \u2018Who\u2019s Next\u2019 and \u2018Quadrophenia\u2019. Many legendary guitarists, including Stray Cats\u2019 Brian Setzer and The Cramps\u2019 Poison Ivy Rorschach, loved and adored this Chet Atkins signature Gretsch model.\n\nDuesenberg Joe Walsh Signature\n\nFinish Gold Burst Years Used 2015 to Present\n\nJoe Walsh collaborated with Duesenberg to design a guitar that incorporated both of his favorite tones, the classic rock crunch that Joe is famous for, and the single-coil era of the 60s. The Joe Walsh Alliance Series includes several tidbits about Joe\u2019s style and personality.\n\nBecause of Joe\u2019s interest in radio, the fretboard inlays spell out his name in morse code, and the Tibetan Knot between each pickup is a symbol that has special significance to him that he also sports as a tattoo.\n\nThis guitar\u2019s top is composed of laminated spruce, while the body and neck are maples. It houses a LittleToaster mini-humbucker and a SingleTwin Mini noiseless single coil which provides delicious tones that are open, responsive, and transparent.\n\nThese pickups are an odd couple in the Duesenberg roster. In addition to its distinctive semi-hollow sound, this design gives the guitar a thinner solid-body feel. This guitar features a unique radiator vibrato based on the original Duesenberg Diamond Deluxe Vibrato, which provides a buttery smooth action, dependable tuning stability, and extraordinary string-changing ease. The vibrato even has golden accents to suit Joe\u2019s taste.\n\nJoe is a passionate guitar nerd who enjoys tinkering with the hardware on his guitars. As a result, the hardware on this Joe Walsh signature is a combination of nickel and gold. Another exciting feature on this guitar is Joe\u2019s name spelled out in morse code on the fretboard. Overall this guitar is a result of beautiful craftsmanship and a great addition to Joe\u2019s arsenal.\n\nCarvin Custom Shop CT6M/CS6 California\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish Orange Burst/Deep Burst/Deep Black Burst Years Used 2004 to Present\n\nJoe first saw this instrument in an ad in the back of one of the magazines. He was familiar with Carvin from the 1960s and had already used Carvin amps before purchasing this guitar, which according to him, are delightful and reliable. So, when Joe\u2019s close friend Frank Zappa complimented Carvin and asked him to contact the guitar company, he opted to get a few Carvin custom models.\n\nThe Carvin CT6M has a 20mm flamed-maple top just like the Californian Cut CS6 sports a Deep Black and Brown Burst finish. It extends from the body\u2019s edge to the natural wood faux binding, giving it a genuinely premium appearance. These models feature a pair of Carvin Vintage Alnico humbuckers (C22B and C22N), along with a three-way pickup selector, a master volume knob. It also has a master tone control with a push/pull switch to separate the two pickups.\n\nIt boasts a dead-on straight neck with a flat U-profile and extremely low action. Joe also likes that the guitar\u2019s bridge is built into the body rather than atop screws. He even claims that no other guitar manufacturers, including Gibson, have agreed to do so before. The guitar\u2019s double-cut body design and the short neck heel are ideal for Joe\u2019s huge hands, allowing him easy access to even the highest fret.\n\nJoe has multiple custom guitar models from several guitar makers. Still, he admits that no other manufacturer allowed him to get as involved with the design process as he could with Carvin. He received a lot of say in all the different aspects of this custom CT6M.\n\nOn another note recent years have seen Joe replacing some of his traditional Les Pauls with his Carvin CS6 signatures. The reason behind being the fact that the sound coming form the guitar was designed under Walsh\u2019s specifications, meaning that in his book, this is the enhanced sound of Gibson\u2019s staple with his trademark on it. Furthermore, these models have made several appearances both live and on studio, ever since Joe first got his hands on them back in the early 2000s.\n\nFender Custom Shop Gold Sparkle Telecaster\n\nFinish Gold Sparkle Years Used Unspecified\n\nFender released a limited edition run of Joe\u2019s Gold Sparkle Custom Shop Telecasters in the mid-1990s. It has the \u201cLucite\u201d coating that Fender has used on their \u201cSparkle\u201d finishes over the years.\n\nThis modified Telecaster\u2019s specs are almost identical to those of a 1965 Telecaster. It boasts a solid alder body with a rosewood veneer fingerboard and a bolt-on maple neck.\n\nThe one-piece neck/fretboard and the renowned \u201cspaghetti\u201d symbol are included on this Gold Sparkle custom Tele. Then there are the well-known Kluson tuners too. The pickup on this guitar sounds cutting, twangy, and snarly, just like the standard mid-60s Tele bridge pickup. Joe has been seen using this guitar in a 1995 performance of \u201cThe Girl From Yesterday.\u201d\n\nDuesenberg Double Cat\n\nFinish Black/ Sunburst Years Used Unspecified\n\nThe Double Cat is another one of the Duesenberg guitars that Joe owns. It has a Cat Eye F-Soundhole and deep cutaways that give it a distinct personality. This guitar\u2019s body is built of solid alder with a flat maple top. The Double Cat\u2019s distinctive design of a robust but chambered alder body, a flat top, and a one-piece maple neck gives it the characteristic tone that performers like Joe admired.\n\nThe bridge is fitted with Duessenberg\u2019s traditionally wound GrandVintage humbucker, while the neck is equipped with the mouthwatering Domino P90 single-coil pickup. Both pickups have specific wiring in the middle position that separates certain low-end frequencies from the humbucker signal. Joe gets open, varied tones as a result of this. Perfect for crunchy blues.\n\nThe fretboard is also meticulously pleked (a special fret leveling technique) and finished by hand, resulting in exceptional playability and smoothness. The Duesenberg Diamond Deluxe Tremola featured in this guitar claims to be one of the best of its kind, with outstanding tuning stability. The Duesenberg Double Cat has all the makings of being one of Joe\u2019s favorite instruments, and he truly cherishes this particular model.\n\nGretsch Silver Sparkle Duo Jet\n\nFinish Silver Sparkle Years Used Unspecified\n\nWe already know that Joe is quite fond of Gretsch Guitars. This Gretsch Silver Sparkle Jet is another Gretsch family member in his collection. It\u2019s one of the guitars that\u2019s been responsible for some of rock\u2019s most iconic sounds.\n\nThis Gretsch Jet features a chambered mahogany body with a maple top that not only looks great but also offers a robust, controlled middle. It has a pair of High Sensitive \u2018FilterTron\u2019 pickups, which, unlike most humbuckers, provide Joe with a broad, balanced, and open tone with a single-coil bite that cuts through the mix.\n\nThanks to these pickups and the expressiveness of a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, Joe can be more creative with his playing style. Overall, this guitar sounds as wonderful as it looks, and it has a distinct vintage flavor. Joe has only been seen with this guitar a few times on stage, but it is something he enjoys flaunting.\n\nTimetable Showing Each Guitar Joe Walsh Has Played Throughout His Career\n\nJoe Walsh Amplifier Overview\n\nFender Blackface Champ\n\nYears Used: 1964 to 1970\n\nIn the \u201960s, Fender introduced the Blackface Champ, a 5-watt guitar combo amp.

According to one interview, Joe got tuition on numerous instruments as a child, but the guitar was the first instrument through which he could express himself. He also said that the guitar was the ideal vehicle for him in his childhood. It let Joe get the music out of his thoughts and into the ears of others. Joe\u2019s affinity with guitars solidified through the years, and he slowly became the legendary guitarist he is today.\n\nInspired by the Beatles\u2019 music and their success, he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bassist of the Madison-based band, the \u2018Nomads\u2019, and began his career as a rock musician. When Walsh joined the band \u2018The James Gang\u2019 in 1969, he quickly rose to the top of the ranks. His inventive rhythm playing and creative guitar riffs drew a lot of applause from the audience.

Millions of global fans will always remember his contributions to rock music."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/joe_walsh/notable_appearances", "page_content": "Notable Appearances\n\nWalsh has produced albums for artists such as Dan Fogelberg and Ringo Starr. He was a background musician (1st guitar solo) on Eagles bandmate Don Henley's 1982 hit \"Dirty Laundry\" (listed as such in the liner notes of I Can't Stand Still and Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits). Walsh played guitar throughout Who bassist John Entwistle's 1981 solo album Too Late The Hero. Walsh has also contributed to albums by: America, REO Speedwagon, Andy Gibb, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Steve Winwood, and on the Richard Marx hit \"Don't Mean Nothing\".\n\nOnscreen Walsh has appeared in: The Blues Brothers, RoboCop, Promised Land, The Drew Carey Show, Duckman, MADtv, Rock the Cradle and Zachariah.\n\nOn February 12, 2012, Walsh appeared on stage with Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Dave Grohl, and McCartney's band at the Staples Center in Los Angeles to close out the Grammy Awards show.\n\nWalsh was a regular guest deejay on the Los Angeles radio station, KLOS during the mid-1980s. They had a Saturday evening feature, with celebrity guest-hosts taking over the mic (Walsh was the guest host far more frequently than any other). He was also a frequent guest and guest-host of Detroit & Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl."}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-walsh-so-what/", "page_content": "Joe Walsh had already decided to make a more serious album when fate intervened. \"I know this album's going to be an important one for me, but it's not easy to just crank them out anymore,\" he told Rolling Stone, a couple of months before So What arrived on Dec. 14, 1974.\n\n\"I don't want the next album to sound like a bunch of outtakes from [1973's The] Smoker [You Drink, the Player You Get],\" he added. \"I want it to be the difference between [the Beatles'] Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. I've held back until that development was there, even though the record company's been screaming for it. I want it to be a big, big step \u2013 in thoughts, vocals, playing and maturity.\"\n\nThen Walsh was struck by an unspeakable tragedy, and his marriage fell apart. A darkness shot through the sessions, which had lasted from December 1973 into April 1974 \u2013 the same month that Walsh's wife, Stefany Rhodes, was smashed into while driving their daughter Emma to a playdate in their adopted hometown of Boulder, Colo.\n\nSomeone ran a stop sign at the corner of Ninth and Spruce, and the passenger-side impact spun the Walshes' green Porsche into a fence across the street. Emma, then just weeks away from turning 3, sustained massive head trauma. She was taken off life support later that night, and her corneas and kidneys were donated to others.\n\n\"The accident kind of did us in,\" Rhodes told the Daily Camera in 2010. \"We divorced shortly afterward.\"\n\nWalsh returned to the studio, trying to shape his feelings while barely fighting off deep despair. Even if he'd never admitted it, So What telegraphs his pain. There are titles like \"Falling Down\" and \"Help Me Through the Night,\" his moody synth-driven instrumental interpretation of \"The Pavane of the Sleeping Beauty\" from Ravel's Mother Goose Suite and, of course, the devastating album-closing tribute simply titled \"Song for Emma.\"\n\nBut Walsh was always brutally honest about the impact of his daughter's death, from his lingering anguish to his slide into alcoholism. \"To help with closure, I wrote this song for her,\" Walsh told Rolling Stone in 2016. \"And over the process of the next year, my wife and I, we just weren't strong enough to get through the grief and so we separated and eventually got divorced.\n\n\"But I met a girl in Los Angeles, and my song 'Help Me Through the Night' was to her about being there for me \u2013 because I was a wreck,\" Walsh added. \"But she was there so that I could grieve Emma.\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'Help Me Through the Night'\n\nA certain hardness defines the rest of So What, from the opening \"Welcome to the Club\" to his remake of \"Turn to Stone\" from 1972's Barnstorm. Walsh tries to lighten things up with the field-holler \"All Night Laundry Mat Blues,\" but it only lasts a moment. \"County Fair\" tries to round itself into a romp, but a sad reverie keeps elbowing in.\n\nEverything coalesces around the cover, which finds Walsh peering out in an empty-eyed stare. The album title itself was a shocking moment of nihilism from someone often thought of as rock's clown prince.\n\n\"I called it that because I had this 'so what' attitude,\" Walsh added. \"I was angry. I was really mad at God \u2013 and I felt that was a great reason to drink: 'Poor me. God took my daughter away.' And so I got an attitude, like, 'This is the worst thing that's ever happened. I don't care about anything' \u2013 just to justify that it was okay to get screwed up.\"\n\nA plaque was dedicated in memory of Emma on May 25, 1976 at her favorite playground in Boulder. It reads: \"This fountain is given in loving memory of Emma Walsh, April 29, 1971-April 1, 1974.\" Her mother told the Daily Camera that \"the fountain was all Joe's doing, really.\"\n\nWalsh says he still thinks of Emma often, and he's tried to leverage his sense of loss into something constructive. \"Having had that experience, sometimes I am in a position to be able to comfort people,\" Walsh told Interview in 2012. \"I'm in a position to put an arm around them and tell them they are not alone.\n\n\"I've talked to several parents whose sons were killed in Iraq or Afghanistan, and they know about my daughter,\" he added. \"Sometimes, they'll contact me to let me know their kids were killed in the war and that they were fans, or that my music really helped them deal with their grief. That's a good thing that came out of it.\"\n\nIt wasn't the only thing. So What became a gold-selling No. 11 hit, while also hinting at his next career move: Several members of the Eagles joined in the sessions, after recently hiring Walsh's producer, Bill Szymczyk. They'd also shared stages, and had the same manager in Irving Azoff.\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'Song For Emma'\n\nDon Henley ended up co-writing \"Falling Down,\" and singing on \"Time Out.\" Henley was also joined by bandmates Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner on backing vocals for \"Turn to Stone\" and \"Help Me Through the Night.\"\n\nSomething clicked. Within a year and a half, Walsh had replaced founding member Bernie Leadon in advance of the Eagles' biggest album ever. \"So, when Bernie decided that he just wasn't interested very much in continuing,\" Walsh told Guitar World in 2012, \"Don and Glenn thought I would plug in really well with where the Eagles were eventually going to go.\n\nWalsh admitted that \"at the time I was going, 'Aw fuck, it's time to do another solo album. Oh shit. Anybody got any ideas?' You know? So, it all just kind of came together, I joined the Eagles \u2013 and the result, of course, was Hotel California.\u201d\n\nIt took some time, but Walsh was finally able to put sudden turns of events like that in perspective, quoting a storyteller best known for PBS's The Power of Myth.\n\nJoseph Campbell said \"something profound,\" Walsh told students at his old high school in 2015. \"As you go through life, it appears to be a series of unrelated events colliding, smashing into each other, creating chaos and destroying your plan for what's going to happen. It's really hard to know what is going on on a daily basis. In retrospect when you look back on your life, it looks like a finely crafted novel.\"\n\nYears after her passing, Stevie Nicks' impromptu visit to the fountain honoring Emma Walsh inspired \"Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You,\" from 1985's Rock a Little.\n\nEagles Solo Albums Ranked Here's a look back at studio projects recorded away from the band.\n\nSix Little-Known Eagles 'Hotel California' Facts"}], "Joe Walsh joined Wigan in 2015.": [{"url": "https://www.grunge.com/439605/the-untold-truth-of-joe-walsh/", "page_content": "Notice the quotes above, and take note that we're not referring to the James Gang, which would come a few years later. Back in the mid-'60s, the Measles (we're guessing they chose the name because it rhymes with \"Beatles\") was a band of Kent State University students that featured Joe Walsh on vocals and guitar. After developing a reputation in the area as an up-and-coming bar band, they started working on original songs, including the Walsh-penned \"I Find I Think of You\" and \"And It's True,\" the latter of which was composed by bassist Bobby Sepulveda, according to Buckeye Beat.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is the fact that those two songs appeared on the Ohio Express' 1967 debut album \"Beg, Borrow and Steal,\" whose title track peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year, per Songfacts. The Ohio Express was not as much a traditional band as it was the name producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz used for the songs they released from various bands and musicians, the Measles included. In fact, the song \"Beg, Borrow and Steal\" was actually performed by a group called the Rare Breed, while Kasenetz and Katz had a totally different band go on tour as the Ohio Express and record at least some of the other songs on the album.\n\nThe Ohio Express' history is a confusing one, to be sure, but for a brief moment, that history included a future guitar legend and one of his first-ever compositions."}, {"url": "https://music.douban.com/musician/118893/", "page_content": "\u7b80\u4ecb \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\n\n\nJoe Walsh\n\n\u547d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6Walsh\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea6\u76f8\u5f97\u76ca\u5f70\u30021975\u5e74\u8fdb\u5165\u8001\u9e70\u4e50\u961f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e50\u961f\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u6d3b\u529b\u30021978\u5e74\u7684\u4e13\u8f91\u300aBut Seriously, Folks\u2026\u300b\u3001\u5355\u66f2\"Life's Been Good\"\u7535\u5f71\u300a\u90fd\u5e02\u725b\u90ce\u300b... 1947\u5e7411\u670820\u65e5\u51fa\u751f\u4e8e\u80af\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u30021969\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u6447\u6eda\u56e2James Gang\uff0c1975\u5e7412\u6708\u52a0\u5165\u8001\u9e70\u5408\u5531\u56e2\uff0c\u662f\u6700\u5148\u53d1\u884c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e13\u8f91\u4e0e\u62e5\u6709\u7545\u9500\u5355\u66f2\u7684\u56e2\u5458\u30021973\u5e74Bill Szymczyk\u5c31\u662f\u9760Walsh\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u624d\u63a5\u66ff\u539f\u5236\u4f5c\u4ebaGlyn Johns\u3002Walsh\u521a\u52a0\u5165\u65f6\uff0cSzymczyk\u8fd8\u66fe\u66ff\u4ed6\u62c5\u5fc3\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4eba\u6f14\u5531\u751f\u6daf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660eWalsh\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4e50\u56e2\u6ce8\u5165\u4e86\u6447\u6eda\u7684\u65b0\u751fJoe Walsh\u547d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6Walsh\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea6\u76f8\u5f97\u76ca\u5f70\u30021975\u5e74\u8fdb\u5165\u8001\u9e70\u4e50\u961f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e50\u961f\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u6d3b\u529b\u30021978\u5e74\u7684\u4e13\u8f91\u300aBut Seriously, Folks\u2026\u300b\u3001\u5355\u66f2\"Life's Been Good\"\u7535\u5f71\u300a\u90fd\u5e02\u725b\u90ce\u300b...

No, it\u2019s not as momentous a date as, say, the day he was born or the day he joined the Eagles, but it\u2019s a good enough excuse to offer you 5 things you might not know about Walsh.\n\n1. He dropped out of Kent State.\n\nWalsh majored in English and minored in music, but he confirmed in a 2012 interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune that the reason he dropped out wasn\u2019t academic, it was the fact that he was there when the infamous shootings took place on campus. \u201cAfter that, I didn\u2019t look at college the same,\u201d said Walsh. \u201c(Then) the James Gang started to gather momentum and I decided I\u2019d try pursuing music as a profession. Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don\u2019t need a degree that bad.\u201d\n\n2. He\u2019s got a daughter who\u2019s a pretty swell actress.\n\nLucy Walsh was praised by critics for her work in a Broadway production of William Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest. In addition, she\u2019s also popped up in a number of films and TV series, including Garry Marshall\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, and she most recently appeared in the new season of HBO\u2019s Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\n3. He\u2019s got a very good reason for being on so many of Ringo Starr\u2019s albums.\n\nGranted, the biggest reason Joe has turned up on so many of Ringo\u2019s albums is because they\u2019ve been friends for many years now, but it probably helps that he\u2019s married to Marjorie Bach, a.k.a. Barbara\u2019s sister, which means that Joe is also Ringo\u2019s brother-in-law.\n\n4. He likes riding the rails.\n\nWhile doing post-reunion recordings with the Eagles, Walsh \u2013 who lived in Encinitas at the time \u2013 regularly took the train to sessions. \u201cAfter a while, the Amtrak crew kind of got to know me and we would visit and stuff,\u201d he told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cI love the rails (and have) since I was a real little kid. I just have this thing for trains; I like to look out the window.\u201d\n\n5. He contributed guitar work to two of Andy Gibb\u2019s hit singles.\n\nWalsh is well known for being prolific in the studio, popping up where you least expect him, but it\u2019s somehow extra-surprising to learn that he can be heard playing on both \u201cI Just Want To Be Your Everything\u201d and \u201c(Love Is) Thicker Than Water,\u201d both of which appear on Gibb\u2019s FLOWING RIVERS album."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/joe-walsh-my-life-in-15-songs-66390/", "page_content": "I start the riot in the final scene of The Blues Brothers. [Ed. Note: Walsh plays a prison inmate who begins dancing on a table while the band plays \"Jailhouse Rock.\"] The part of the movie they were filming in L.A., there were hours between set changes. And John [Belushi] would call me up and say, \"I can't sit here. I have nothing to do. Can you come over and hang out?\" So I did. I hung out in the trailer with Danny [Aykroyd] and Belushi and they decided they had a scene for me in the movie. So that's how that happened.\n\nBy that time, John and I had been friends for a while. I met Belushi on the road in Chicago. He came to an Eagles concert. He showed up in my room and didn't leave for two days. He wanted to show me how cool Chicago was, and he took me out to the finest restaurant. There's a whole story with that with how they wouldn't let us in because of the way we were dressed. So we went and spray painted our jeans black and went back. Then we did about $28,000 worth of damage to my hotel room.\n\nWhen the Eagles stopped in 1980 \u2026 I kept going. I didn't really want to admit it had ended, so I just kept the same mentality and lifestyle. And the way I wound up was that the only thing that mattered to me was not running out of cocaine. And also vodka. Vodka, cocaine and Camel Light cigarettes. Those three things.\n\nGradually, I stopped writing music and I stopped taking care of myself. I burned bridges. I was not dependable. I didn't make any sense a lot of the time. Musicians didn't really care to work with me anymore. I had an \"I don't care about anything\" attitude. My day \u2013 and it was really hard work \u2013 was spent trying to find a dealer who would front me some cocaine when I still owed him for the last batch. And if I was awake, I was drinking. I was just empty. I was godless and I took it about as far as a I could go. And I'd seen buddies go away. Keith Moon took it all the way. Belushi, he had gotten sober. And I helped him do it. He said, \"Look, I gotta quit. Do you know a sober companion?\" I said, \"Yeah, I know somebody. But you're gonna hate me for getting him for you and you're gonna hate him. But he'll get you clean.\" And John was doing great.

But then again, he was also a well-established solo star.\n\nSomething clicked. Walsh helped restructure the Eagles, bringing a gritty rock edge to a group best known for laid-back, country-rock music. His first album with the Eagles, 1976's Hotel California, became one of the best-selling in history. There was something fortuitous about it all.\n\n\"When Bernie [Leadon] decided that he just wasn\u2019t interested very much in continuing, Don [Henley] and Glenn [Frey] thought I would plug in really well with where the Eagles were eventually going to go,\" Walsh later told Guitar World. \"And at the time, I was going, 'Aw fuck, it\u2019s time to do another solo album. Oh, shit. Anybody got any ideas?' You know? So, it all just kind of came together. I joined the Eagles \u2013 and the result, of course, was Hotel California.\"\n\nIn fact, as incompatible as the pairing may have seemed at first, Walsh didn't arrive out of the blue. He had actually shared a few concert bills with the Eagles, and they had the same manager in Irving Azoff. He'd previously gained some measure of fame as a founding member of the James Gang, a funky hard-rock trio that released three albums in a little more than a year and a half, highlighted by the radio favorite \"Funk #49.\" Walsh then launched a solo career and released four albums before he joined the Eagles.\n\nUnfortunately, even the quick success of a multi-platinum project like Hotel California couldn't steady the Eagles \u2013 and Walsh's appetite for destruction would prove difficult to quench, as well.\n\nThey'd take more than two years to complete a follow-up album before going on a long break in 1980, picking up the pieces in 1994 for reunion albums and tours. Along the way, Walsh kept a solo career going, releasing albums like Barnstorm, The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get and But Seriously, Folks. He also kept up a party aesthetic that eventually became a larger issue, especially after the Eagles were grounded in the '80s.\n\n\"When we stopped, I was sad and didn\u2019t know what to do,\" Walsh told the Daily Mail. \"So, I kept going. I became an alcoholic and dependent on drugs. I hit rock-bottom.\"\n\nThe Eagles' early '90s reunion \u2013 a blockbuster event winkingly titled the Hell Freezes Over tour \u2013 couldn't have arrived soon enough for the clean-and-sober Walsh. \"He looked so bad,\" bandmate Timothy B. Schmit remembered. \"I think the offer to rejoin the band saved him.\"\n\nWalsh then played a key role on the Eagles' long-awaited 2007 studio album, Long Road Out of Eden, their first since 1979's The Long Run. In 2012, he released Analog Man, his first solo album in two decades.\n\nThe Most Awesome Live Album From Every Rock Legend Some of these concert recordings sold millions of copies, while others received little fanfare.

A musical icon, Walsh is incredibly accomplished when it comes to his music and longevity in the music industry. During his tenure he\u2019s played a huge part in the success of the James Gang, the Eagles and is currently a member of Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band. As if this wasn\u2019t impressive enough, he also lays claim to being a successful solo artist. In short, when listening to Joe Walsh songs, you\u2019re sure to find surprises, variety and perception. To illustrate that fact, we\u2019ve collected and ranked 10 of his best performances right here.\n\n10. Waffle Stomp\n\nFans of the 1982 film, \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d, will surely recognize this song. The \u201cWaffle Stomp\u201d is a mix mash of a variety of musical stylings, from techno beats to snappy keyboard action, all interspersed with some energetic claps. This is a fun, jaunty tune that\u2019s accompanied by humorous lyrics, worthy of a \u201cMad Magazine\u201d song satire.\n\n9. Turn to Stone\n\n\u201cTurn to Stone\u201d shared Walsh\u2019s feelings about the Nixon administration and Vietnam War. The world was hot in those days, with the evening news showing footage of soldiers returning home in body bags, and streets bursting with protesters. According to Walsh, he was also at the Kent State shootings, which added to his disillusionment with what was happening during that time.\n\n8. Song for Emma\n\n\u201cSong for Emma\u201d is taken from a page of Walsh\u2019s own life. It relates the tragic story of how his daughter of four years, was taken from him due to a car accident. Walsh saw this song as a chance for closure. \u201cSong for Emma\u201d is featured on his album, which reflected his outlook on life during that time, \u201c\u2026I was angry. I was really made at God, and I felt that was a great reason to drink.\u201d\n\n7. All Night Long\n\nAnother one of Joe Walsh\u2019s compositions which found itself on a movie soundtrack is \u201cAll Night Long\u201d. The movie was Urban Cowboy, and starred John Travolta. The up tempo, \u201cAll Night Long\u2019 is a fun musical romp, the perfect party tune for dancing or mechanical bull riding. The song has a noticeable country sound, which helped it to chart on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 at #19, spending a total of 16 weeks on the Hot 100.\n\n6. Life in the Fast Lane\n\nComposed by Joe Walsh and Eagles band mates Glenn Frey and Don Henley, \u201cLife in the Fast Lane\u201d recounts the story of a couple who live life to the extreme, without concern for consequences. The song is an example of the comradery the men shared. It seems that one night, Walsh had his guitar and was warming up for a show. His band mates heard it, and exclaimed, \u201cWell, there\u2019s our Joe Walsh Eagles song!\u201d\n\n5. In the City\n\nThe Warriors is a film which came out in the 70\u2019s and starred Michael Beck. Though the film never became a hit when released, it did develop a cult following that\u2019s lasted throughout the years. Composed by Barry De Vorzon and Walsh, \u201cIn the City\u201d was included in the film\u2019s soundtrack, and became an instant classic. Later on, when the Eagles heard it, they decided to adapt the song, re-record it and place it on their album, The Long Run.\n\n4. Life\u2019s Been Good\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to get the gist of this song. \u201cLife\u2019s Been Good\u201d revolves around the partying life of your average, 1970\u2019s rock star. Some will call the song a satire, while others will call it the absolute truth, no satire about it. Which every way you lean, it\u2019s a fun song, one to sing along with. \u201cLife\u2019s Been Good\u201d was included on the soundtrack of the 1978 film, FM and also on his 1978 album, But Seriously, Folks\u2026\n\n3. Rocky Mountain Way\n\nWalsh shares writing credits with Rocke Grace, Kenny Passarelli and Joe Vitale for \u201cRocky Mountain Way\u201d. Composed in 1973, \u201cRocky Mountain Way\u201d was the song to put him on the map, so to speak. \u201cRocky Mountain Way\u201d was the product of Walsh\u2019s musings as he mowed his Boulder, Colorado lawn. However, things didn\u2019t turn out as planned, as he was so excited to receive inspiration for the song, his lawn mower went on its own, traveled to the neighbors yard and gobbled up her roses!\n\n2. Funk #49\n\nIf the song\u2019s title isn\u2019t familiar, there\u2019s a good chance that once you hear it, you\u2019ll recognize it. Totally unique, creative and powerful, \u201cFunk #49\u201d was composed by Walsh, Jim Fox, and Dale Peters back when Walsh was a member of \u201cThe James Gang\u201d band. You not only get funk and rock meshing together, but the smatterings of tribal vibes really give it a punch.\n\n1. Help Me Through the Night\n\n\u201cHelp Me Through the Night\u201d is from his album, So What?. A reflective, pensive piece, one can\u2019t help but feel the anguish of losing a child. A tender anthem to a mans well-kept, introspective nature. Back up vocals are provided by Glenn Frey, Randy Meisner and Don Henley of the Eagles. This was the first time these men played together on an album. Soon after, Walsh would join the Eagles as a permanent member.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhen you\u2019re dealing with an artist such as this, finding the best Joe Walsh songs can be quite a task. He\u2019s been everything from a composer, session musician, and performer in his career. His innate ability to sense the strengths of a song and play accordingly makes him a favorite with fellow musicians. Besides enjoying being a part of the James Gang and the Eagles, Walsh also joined the remarkable Ringo Starr in his band, Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band. Sadly Walsh passed away in 2023.\n\nYou can also read:"}, {"url": "https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/presidential-profiles-2020/joe-walsh-president-republican/", "page_content": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nUpdate, Feb. 7, 2020: Joe Walsh has ended his presidential campaign.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, now a conservative talk radio host, will challenge incumbent President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nWalsh, 57, narrowly defeated a three-term Democrat in the Tea Party wave election of 2010. He served a single term in Congress before losing his seat.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take four more years of Donald Trump. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President,\u201d Walsh tweeted the morning of Aug. 25. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, but bravery is never easy. But together, we can do it.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Walsh, known for inflammatory language, was a vocal backer of Trump\u2019s first presidential bid. \u201cOn November 8th, I\u2019m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. You in?\u201d he tweeted shortly before the election.\n\n\n\nWalsh subsequently turned into a persistent critic of the president and apologized for \u201cthe role I played in helping to put an unfit con man in the White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump boasts high approval ratings from Republicans and has been raising money for his re-election bid since the moment he took office, making any primary challenge a long-shot. But Walsh sees it differently: the president is \u201cripe for a primary challenger,\u201d Walsh wrote in a New York Times opinion piece earlier this month. Walsh is joined in the Republican primary by former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who himself announced a challenge to Trump in February but has earned little interest among prospective GOP voters.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s more on Walsh\u2019s political and financial history:\n\n\n\nIn 2012, outside groups such as FreedomWorks for America collectively spent roughly eight times more \u2014 more than $5.2 million \u2014 to boost Walsh\u2019s congressional campaign as they did to support his opponent, Democrat Tammy Duckworth. But she won.\n\nWalsh raised a little more than $2 million for his 2012 bid, with the biggest chunk of the money \u2014 about $860,000 \u2014 coming from Illinois donors.\n\nIn 2011, Walsh\u2019s ex-wife sued him, alleging he owed more than $117,000 in back child support payments, and said he had failed to pay what he owed even as he loaned money to his own campaign. The former couple later settled the dispute and issued a joint statement saying they \u201cnow agree that Joe is not and was not a \u2018deadbeat dad\u2019 and does not owe child support.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Walsh was taken off the radio for using racist slurs on the air, something he said he did in an attempt to have an \u201chonest discussion\u201d about them. He has also been asked to account for past tweets when he said, among other things, that he believed former President Barack Obama is a Muslim (he is not) and accused Obama of \u201chatred toward Israel.\u201d\n\nWalsh\u2019s personal finances have been tumultuous in other ways, according to a 2011 Chicago Tribune investigation. The newspaper reported Walsh\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended after he allowed his high-risk car insurance to lapse. It also said he had previously been subject to state and federal tax liens and lost a condo to foreclosure.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., waits for the start of a televised debate against then-challenger Democrat Tammy Duckworth at the WTTW studios Thursday, Oct. 18, 2012, in Chicago. (AP file/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nWalsh\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure form, filed in 2013 at the end of his time in Congress, showed he owed between $50,000 and $100,000 in legal fees and $10,000 and $15,000 in student loan debt.\n\nAfter leaving office, Walsh launched the Grow and Be Free Super PAC, which he said would back conservative candidates and act as an alternative to Republican super PACs backing more establishment candidates. The group raised nearly $30,000 in 2013, including $5,000 from GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein, and then fizzled, officially shutting down in 2015.\n\nWalsh at one point worked for the libertarian Heartland Institute, which amplifies questions about scientific consensus on climate change, and has been prominently featured at Heartland Institute events since leaving Congress.\n\nWhen Politico asked Walsh if he could raise enough money for a primary challenge to Trump, Walsh\u2019s response: \u201cAbso-freaking-lutely.\u201d\n\nSources: The Center for Responsive Politics, Federal Election Commission records, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Huffington Post, POLITICO and Salon.\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nHelp support this work"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57334782", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Swansea\n\nKyle Joseph scored a hat-trick in Wigan's League One win at Burton in December 2020\n\nSwansea City have agreed a four-year deal for Wigan striker Kyle Joseph.\n\nScotland Under-19 international Joseph has scored five goals in 20 appearances - 13 of which have been starts - having broken into the Wigan first team during the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe 19-year-old's contract with the League One club expires this summer, but Swansea will pay around \u00a3500,000 plus add-ons as he is under 24.\n\nSwansea are also interested in forward Thomas Henry and midfielder Liam Walsh.\n\nThe Championship club are keen to bolster their attacking options this summer having gone through much of last season without a natural centre-forward in their squad, and Joseph become the Swans' first recruit ahead of the 2021-22 Championship campaign.\n\nThe deal is subject to English Football League, Football Association of Wales and Football Association clearance.\n\nAndre Ayew, Swansea's leading scorer in the last two campaigns, was released earlier this month with his lucrative contract about to come to an end.\n\nThomas Henry played briefly in Ligue 1, the French top flight, for Nantes\n\nThe Welsh club are also keen on Frenchman Henry, who plays in Belgium for OH Leuven, though it may be that the former Nantes player is beyond their reach financially.\n\nHenry scored 21 goals in 31 appearances in the Belgian top flight last season.\n\nFormer England Under-18 international Walsh, 23, is a free agent after being released by Bristol City.\n\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page."}, {"url": "https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2114724346359/fit-again-joe-walsh-pushing-for-league-start-against-wigan", "page_content": "Joe Walsh is pushing for a Lincoln return (PA Archive)\n\nLincoln boss Michael Appleton could give Joe Walsh his first league start in more than a month against bottom side Wigan.\n\nThe defender had been sidelined with a knee injury before returning in the Imps\u2019 FA Cup defeat by Plymouth at the weekend.\n\nLiam Bridcutt, Lewis Montsma and Tom Hopper were all rested for the cup clash and should come back in.\n\nRemy Howarth and Zack Elbouzedi have missed recent matches through injury.\n\nLeam Richardson and Gregor Rioch remain in interim charge of the Latics as they look to end a run of nine league games without a win.\n\nDan Gardner will be checked on after missing last week\u2019s draw against Bristol Rovers with an injury he picked up in the previous clash with Oxford.\n\nKal Naismith and Lee Evans could come into contention after making good progress in their recoveries but Will Keane, Viv Solomon-Otabor and Darnell Johnson are definitely out.\n\nNorway youth international Thelo Aasgaard will hope to keep his place in the starting line-up after showing promising signs against Rovers."}], "Joe Walsh made over 50 appearances for Wigan.": [{"url": "https://www.antimusic.com/news/2022/10/26Joe-Walsh-And-James-Gang-Announce-First-Instore-In-Over-50-Years.shtml", "page_content": "Joe Walsh And James Gang Announce First Instore In Over 50 Years\n\nEvent promo Event promo\n\n(BeautifulDay) Joe Walsh, Jim Fox and Dale Peters, the classic lineup of James Gang, have announced their first in-store event and signing in appearance in more than 50 years.\n\nThe power trio will sit for an on-stage interview moderated by QFM96's Archie and will then sit for an autograph signing on Tuesday, November 8th at 6:30pm at Used Kids Records, 2500 Summit Street, Columbus, OH, 43202.

The other two departing players are Joe Walsh and midfielder Max Sanders. Young defenders Hayden Cann and Sean Roughan have been offered new deals, with Hayden penning his already. Negotiations are ongoing with Roughan, who is expected to be in demand.\n\n24-year-old Poole completes a two-and-a-half-year stay with the Imps, during which he made 131 appearances, starting 107 League One matches. He was last season\u2019s Player of the Season and this season\u2019s 617 Player of the Season. On his departure, director of football Jez George said: \u201cWe have done everything possible to keep Regan at the club, but he wants to explore options at a higher level, and we fully respect that.\n\n\u201cRegan has been brilliant for Lincoln City, captaining the team on many occasions, including on his final appearance at the LNER Stadium on Sunday, and is held in high esteem by everyone. We sincerely wish Regan all the best in the next chapter of his career, thank him for everything, and hope that he gets the opportunity he deserves at a higher level of the football pyramid.\u201d\n\nMax Sanders\u2019 departure is a little more surprising; after a torrid first 18 months under Michael Appleton, he appeared to have cemented a place in the side in the first half of the season. Since Ethan Erhahon\u2019s arrival, Sanders has found his game time limited, and it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll search out a move closer to his home in the south east. Max\u2019s last involvement with the club was to miss a penalty in the final game, but his appearances have been sporadic \u2013 he started just 27 League One matches for the club, coming off the bench 30 times.\n\nJoe Walsh\u2019s departure is a surprise to nobody, and you have to feel for the defender. His injury record has been horrible; in three full seasons, he\u2019s started just 39 matches and made 52 appearances. This season he\u2019s played 14 matches, being sent off once, and has appeared just twice since the turn of the year.

Joe has repeatedly put his body on the line, notably in the League One play-off semi-final and final, and Max showed his undoubted ability right up to his final appearance on Sunday. Both are quality players and good people, and we wish them well in their futures.\u201d\n\nObviously, at this stage, all loan players have returned to their parent clubs, which leaves the Imps squad looking as follows.\n\nPlayers under contract for 2023/24: Adam Jackson\n\nBen House\n\nCharles Vernam\n\nCharley Kendall\n\nDanny Mandroiu\n\nDylan Duffy\n\nElicha Ahui\n\nEthan Erhahon\n\nFreddie Draper\n\nHakeeb Adelakun\n\nJay Benn\n\nJovon Makama\n\nJordan Wright\n\nLasse Sorensen\n\nLewis Montsma\n\nMJ Kamara\n\nMorgan Worsfold-Gregg\n\nOisin Gallagher\n\nPaudie O\u2019Connor\n\nSam Long\n\nTed Bishop\n\nTJ Eyoma\n\nShare The Stacey West\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\n"}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-walsh-got-any-gum/", "page_content": "The late '80s were a challenging period for classic rockers: Could they remain relevant and maintain their levels of success, born of moments six or eight or 10 years before, when they were topping the charts and regularly packing arenas? Many were staring down their 40s, if not meekly entering them, crossing a threshold that at one time was impossible to fathom. Rock was a young person's game, a music of rebellion and reaction to those of a certain, older set.\n\nJoe Walsh was among this aging rock-star demographic, turning 40 in 1987. He dealt with his age and the expectations of a rock audience by both indulging in a debilitating drinking habit, while embracing then-current keyboard-heavy sounds on the solo album he released that year, Got Any Gum?\n\nThe bulk of the project was recorded at Memphis' renowned Ardent Studios, where producer Terry Manning preferred to work. Walsh liked Studio A in the facility, according to studio manager Jody Stephens, who initially rose to fame as Big Star's drummer. The room \"has huge baffles so that you can really damp things down to where it's almost a '70s studio,\" Stephens later told Goldmine. Others who have made albums there include the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Robert Cray.\n\nDrummer Chad Cromwell, a session musician and would go on to play with everyone from Neil Young and Mark Knopfler to Michael Bolton and Jessica Simpson, remembers how he got asked to play on Got Any Gum? It all started, in typical fashion, during a messy gig with Walsh.\n\n\"I met Joe at a recording studio in Memphis where I worked a lot and did a lot of sessions,\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"When Joe came into town, he just came over and there was some sort of party going on. I was introduced to Joe. That was one of the strangest things because we just stayed up all night, acting like idiots, as everyone would do in the mid-'80s.\"\n\nWalsh asked Cromwell to accompany him to Dallas, where they would rehearse for a week with bassist Rick Rosas before playing a radio station-sponsored festival concert in Los Angeles. Cromwell agreed, but the week went by and no rehearsals happened. \"We get on a plane [at the end of the week] and fly to L.A.,\" Cromwell recalled. \"We get off the plane and literally get in a car and drive out to [the venue]. There are 20,000 people at this venue and I am shitting myself since I still haven't rehearsed with Joe and Rick.\n\n\"I remember walking onstage,\" he added, \"going, 'Okay! I'm probably going to be put on a plane home after this is over with, but fuck it. If he doesn't want to rehearse, I'm just going with it, with him. I'll see what happens.'\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'In My Car'\n\nA few missteps aside, the gig went well, and Cromwell became Walsh's first-call drummer when he went back to Memphis to record Got Any Gum? at Ardent. Cromwell was intrigued by working with Manning, who had provided the drum programming and synthesizer work on Eliminator \u2013 the 1983 LP that brought the rough-edged ZZ Top a whole new sound, and a big hit record.\n\n\"Terry was pretty big on whatever the latest, coolest piece of gear would be at the time,\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"There was a company called AMS \u2013 they made a gated reverb box and then a delay box that probably is most well known as the drum sound on 'In the Air Tonight' by Phil Collins. Same gear, same box.\n\n\"If you listen to Got Any Gum?, you're going to hear the same thing,\" Cromwell added. \"I remember thinking at the time, 'This is the most incredible drum sound I've ever heard in my life.' I wasn't really thinking about how dated that would sound 10 years later.\"\n\nThe drum work wasn't the only quintessentially '80s sound on Got Any Gum? as the preponderance of synthesizers and compression led to an overall thin audio quality. That was, of course, somewhat typical for the era \u2013 but not for Walsh. For perhaps the first time, it sounded like his guitar was fighting to be heard over the patches and plastic. Got Any Gum? was about as far as one could imagine Walsh getting from the sound he'd all but patented since the first James Gang record decades earlier.\n\nWalsh saw it differently. \"What I'm really trying to do is get back to that young, aggressive feeling,\" he told the Sun-Sentinel while on a supporting tour. \"I'm full circle from being young and curious in the James Gang, going through development as an artist in the Eagles. I want to get back to what it was.\"\n\nOpinions are split on whether Walsh's curiosity actually resulted in a good record. There are certainly some intriguing songs to pick through, dated production and all.\n\n\"In My Car\" was co-written with Ringo Starr and originally appeared on Starr's 1983 album Old Wave, with Walsh co-producing and playing lead guitar. The big keyboard sound on Walsh's cover sounds like it should be on a soundtrack to an '80s high-school movie \u2013 though the keyboards are underpinned by an acoustic guitar, and Walsh plays a tasty solo in the middle of the song.\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'The Radio Song'\n\nOne of the few tracks on Got Any Gum? that got any traction was \"The Radio Song,\" which was a minor hit at rock radio, hitting No. 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It's a pretty simple song about the pleasures of listening to music, with a chorus that's a winner, and some insistent guitar work that cuts through the atmospheric synthesizers, however briefly.\n\nComing in late on the record is \"Memory Lane,\" a touching ballad cut from a similar fabric as \"Pretty Maids All in a Row,\" Walsh's contribution to the Eagles' Hotel California. It's a heavy sentiment, on the power of looking back, and how memories can pull us out into \"faraway places and long ago names.\"\n\n\"Fun\" is perhaps the cut that sounds most like classic Joe Walsh from Got Any Gum? It's got a guitar sound right out of \"Rocky Mountain Way\" and \"Funk #49,\" with cannon-shot drums and an unfettered Walsh vocal. All the hard-rock noise is given purpose as he implores the listener to have a good time \u2013 while also noting how good a time Walsh is also having. How this didn't crack rock radio like \"The Radio Song\" did is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, few people embraced Got Any Gum? Released on Oct. 29, 1987, the LP was a critical dud. (The Los Angeles Times, in a typical comment, described it as a \"monumental flop.\"). Got Any Gum? was a commercial disappointment as well, topping out at No. 113 on the Billboard album chart.\n\nWalsh was still a sizable live draw, but his physical condition was becoming a concern. Supporting the record at the end of 1987 and into 1988, Walsh began to show the effects of his issues with alcohol. Carter Alan, a writer and longtime disc jockey in the New England area, saw it firsthand when he served as emcee at a Walsh show in New Hampshire.\n\n\"What was tragic,\" Alan said in his book Decibel Diaries: A Story of Rock in 50 Concerts, \"was the extent to which Joe Walsh's drinking had crippled his ability to play. I almost cried as he fumbled the solo to 'Life in the Fast Lane,' unable to replicate or even approach the mastery of his original studio performance. While Walsh's fingers responded clumsily, as if operated by an inept puppeteer hidden in the rafters above, several extended episodes of slurry rhetoric at the microphone replaced much of the music.\"\n\nListen to Joe Walsh Perform 'Fun'\n\nWalsh's promotional appearances on television shows like Late Night with David Letterman and The Arsenio Hall Show were shambolic, with sloppy performances followed by uncomfortable interview segments between the hosts and a visibly impaired Walsh.\n\nOn Hall's show, Walsh accused the host (a fellow Cleveland native) of stealing his hubcaps, before degenerating even further into a drunken announcement of his candidacy for president. He'd also done so in 1980, to great comic effect, but repeating the joke while slurring his words on national television in 1987 was not so funny.\n\nIt took the 1994 Eagles reunion to get Walsh to rehab \u2013 and he says he's remained sober to this day. Chad Cromwell remembers the circumstances that led Walsh to get help. Cromwell was having dinner with a friend in a restaurant in Hollywood when Walsh, fresh from a meeting with his Eagles bandmates, showed up and approached their table.\n\n\"He looked straight at us and said, 'They won't let me in the band if I don't go to rehab. I gotta go to rehab,'\" Cromwell told Rolling Stone. \"He was just a wreck. It was heartbreaking. He was in such bad shape. The next morning, he went to rehab. He has been sober ever since.\"\n\nWalsh's fortitude is the likeliest reason he has remained sober, but Cromwell also credits others for compelling him to get in that condition. \"The Eagles definitely saved his life,\" Cromwell added. \"No question about it.\"\n\nCombining sobriety and the life of a working musician was no easy task, Walsh admitted in a 2012 talk with Interview. \"It wasn't like you flick a switch, and you're sober,\" he said. \"It takes a while. You have to learn how to do everything all over again. You can measure how long that takes in terms of years.\n\n\"What I didn't know at the time was how to write music and do rock 'n' roll and live rock 'n' roll and record sober,\" Walsh added. \"I didn't try to do that at first. I learned how to take care of myself and then play in front of people. I didn't tackle going back to rock 'n' roll until I had some sobriety under my belt.\"\n\nThe Most Awesome Live Album From Every Rock Legend Some of these concert recordings sold millions of copies, while others received little fanfare. Still, they remain the best of the best.\n\nHow a Drug Dealer Inspired Eagles' 'Life in the Fast Lane'"}, {"url": "https://music.douban.com/musician/118893/", "page_content": "\u7b80\u4ecb \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\n\n\nJoe Walsh\n\n\u547d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6Walsh\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea6\u76f8\u5f97\u76ca\u5f70\u30021975\u5e74\u8fdb\u5165\u8001\u9e70\u4e50\u961f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e50\u961f\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u6d3b\u529b\u30021978\u5e74\u7684\u4e13\u8f91\u300aBut Seriously, Folks\u2026\u300b\u3001\u5355\u66f2\"Life's Been Good\"\u7535\u5f71\u300a\u90fd\u5e02\u725b\u90ce\u300b... 1947\u5e7411\u670820\u65e5\u51fa\u751f\u4e8e\u80af\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u30021969\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u6447\u6eda\u56e2James Gang\uff0c1975\u5e7412\u6708\u52a0\u5165\u8001\u9e70\u5408\u5531\u56e2\uff0c\u662f\u6700\u5148\u53d1\u884c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e13\u8f91\u4e0e\u62e5\u6709\u7545\u9500\u5355\u66f2\u7684\u56e2\u5458\u30021973\u5e74Bill Szymczyk\u5c31\u662f\u9760Walsh\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u624d\u63a5\u66ff\u539f\u5236\u4f5c\u4ebaGlyn Johns\u3002Walsh\u521a\u52a0\u5165\u65f6\uff0cSzymczyk\u8fd8\u66fe\u66ff\u4ed6\u62c5\u5fc3\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4eba\u6f14\u5531\u751f\u6daf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660eWalsh\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4e50\u56e2\u6ce8\u5165\u4e86\u6447\u6eda\u7684\u65b0\u751fJoe Walsh\u547d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6Walsh\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea6\u76f8\u5f97\u76ca\u5f70\u30021975\u5e74\u8fdb\u5165\u8001\u9e70\u4e50\u961f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e50\u961f\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u6d3b\u529b\u30021978\u5e74\u7684\u4e13\u8f91\u300aBut Seriously, Folks\u2026\u300b\u3001\u5355\u66f2\"Life's Been Good\"\u7535\u5f71\u300a\u90fd\u5e02\u725b\u90ce\u300b...

By then Joe\u2019s fans already included guitar icons Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to many records,\u201d Clapton said, \u201cbut I listen to his.\u201d Page talked of Joe\u2019s \u201ctremendous feel\u201d for the guitar, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve loved his style since the early James Gang.\u201d\n\nOf course, that was even before Joe joined the Eagles and made indelible contributions to the great American pop culture canon on such songs as \u201cHotel California\u201d and \u201cLife in the Fast Lane,\u201d and, more recently, became an honorary member of the Foo Fighters.\n\nJoe Fidler Walsh was born in Wichita, Kansas, on November 20, 1947. His mother was an avid piano player who brought music into the family\u2019s humble home before Joe was old enough to discover rock 'n\u2019 roll on the radio. When Joe was still young, he and his family moved to Ohio, Chicago, New York City, and then Montclair, New Jersey. In 1965, Joe landed back in Ohio where he attended Kent State University. His professional music career began then, in coffee shops and bars.\n\nThough Joe had played guitar in a high school cover band and a popular Kent bar band while in college, he really came into his own in 1968, when he joined the Cleveland-based James Gang. One night in May, 1968, on the way to Detroit for a show at the Grande Ballroom opening for Cream, half the band quit. Needing the money to pay for gas to get home, the James Gang took the stage as a trio, and Joe was forced to learn on the fly how to carry rhythm and lead duties while now singing lead simultaneously. It proved a revelation. Permanently reconfigured as a trio, the James Gang quickly developed a huge following in the Midwest and landed a record deal, leading to a 1969 debut album, \"Yer\u2019 Album,\" that became an FM radio staple and drew the ears of guitar aficionados like Pete Townshend \u2014 who personally invited Joe and the James Gang to join the Who on tour. Townshend regarded Joe as \u201ca fluid and intelligent player\u201d with few peers.\n\nSoon the American public caught up in a big way, as the James Gang scored hits with singles like \u201cFunk #49\u201d and \u201cWalk Away\u201d and gold certifications for the albums \"James Gang Rides Again\" (1970) and \"Thirds\" (1971) before Joe\u2019s departure following the landmark 1971 live album, \"Live in Concert,\" recorded at New York City\u2019s Carnegie Hall, where the James Gang was the first rock band ever to play.\n\nDespite the band\u2019s upward trajectory, Joe found himself at a creative crossroads: The music he was hearing in his head no longer fit the trio format. He impulsively walked away from a band with consecutive gold albums and moved from Cleveland to a former mining village high in the Colorado Rockies to pursue an as-yet-undefined sound with a new set of collaborators. In typical Joe Walsh style, he found out about a new studio being built nearby and arranged to record there for next to nothing in exchange for working out the kinks in the untested room. The album became the much-loved self-titled 1972 debut by Joe\u2019s next band, Barnstorm, and the studio became the legendary Caribou Ranch, soon to be home to hit recordings by Elton John, Chicago, and Earth Wind & Fire, among many others.\n\nBarnstorm\u2019s second album, 1973\u2019s \"The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get,\" yielded the biggest hit of Joe\u2019s career to that point, with \u201cRocky Mountain Way\u201d eclipsing his James Gang output. Once again, however, despite another band on the rise, Joe was gradually getting restless.\n\nHe found a new sense of home \u2014 and a new manager, Irving Azoff \u2014 in the musical melting pot of Los Angeles, where Joe formed bonds with Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Jackson Brown, Dan Fogelberg and J. D. Souther, among others. The 1974 solo album, \"So What,\" emerged from this period, and both that album and the live solo album that followed, \"You Can\u2019t Argue with a Sick Mind,\" hit the charts, making Joe a bona fide solo sensation.\n\nEven so, when the Eagles asked Joe to join, he jumped at the chance. He and the members of the band had already been jamming and writing together as part of the magically fertile LA scene, and now he was able to bring his rock edge to the vocal harmonies he loved so much in the Eagles. The result was lightning in a bottle, and the new lineup of the Eagles defined an entire era with \"Hotel California.\" The album took the already-successful band to dazzling new heights: \"Hotel California\" went on to sell over 50 million copies and the title track won the band a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Joe\u2019s presence also transformed the band as a concert experience, adding his harder-edged solo songs to the live repertoire.\n\nAs the recording of the Eagles\u2019 follow-up album dragged on, Joe recorded and released a solo album, 1978\u2019s \"But Seriously Folks\u2026,\" which spawned his signature send-up of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle, \u201cLife\u2019s Been Good.\u201d During the same period he recorded \u201cIn the City\u201d for the soundtrack of the film \u201cThe Warriors.\u201d That track was also re-recorded for the Eagles album that finally emerged in late 1979, \"The Long Run. \"\n\nDespite the success of \"The Long Run,\" which included three top 10 hits and won the band another Grammy, the extremes of being the biggest band in the land took its toll: Eagles ground to a halt in 1980 and eventually confirmed they had split up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Joe recorded another solo album, 1981\u2019s \"There Goes the Neighborhood,\" featuring perennial fan favorite \u201cLife of Illusion.\u201d Even as Joe spent the next decade battling increased problems with drugs and alcohol, one thing remained constant: his desire to make and perform music. \"You Bought It \u2013 You Name It\" came out in 1983; \"The Confessor\" in 1985; \"Got Any Gum?\" in 1987; \"Ordinary Average Guy\" in 1991; and \"Songs for a Dying Planet\" in 1992. Those years also saw him join Ringo Starr\u2019s inaugural All-Starr Band alongside members of both the Band and the E Street Band, among others; he also toured extensively with Australian supergroup the Party Boys. In addition, Joe played on records by everyone from the Beach Boys, Bob Seger, and Steve Winwood to Michael McDonald, Warren Zevon and Lionel Richie, and produced a New Zealand band called the Herbs.\n\nIn 1994, Hell Freezes Over, and Joe teamed up again with Don, Glenn and Timothy to reform the Eagles. Pent-up demand for the band led to 10 years of record-breaking tours. And when in 2007 they recorded a new studio album, \"Long Road Out of Eden,\" it reached a staggering six-time platinum status long after the industry had pronounced the album form dead.\n\nIn 1998, Joe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame together with the band.\n\nThe reformation of the Eagles coincided with a new musical beginning for Joe, who was now clean and sober since 1995, leading to one of the most fertile periods of his career. In addition to all the activity with the Eagles, Joe embarked on a James Gang reunion (originally at the behest of then-President Bill Clinton). In 2001, Walsh received an Honorary Doctorate from Kent State University.\n\nIn 2012, Walsh released his 10th solo album and first release in 20 years, \"Analog Man.\" The record featured 10 new songs and was co-produced with Jeff Lynne. Critically acclaimed, it also resonated with fans and concert audiences, and Joe found himself in high demand as a collaborator, producer and guest musician. Among the highlights: he played alongside Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen in the closing jam at the 2012 Grammy Awards show and that same year the Berklee College of Music gave each of the Eagles Honorary Doctor of Music degrees; he took part in the 2014 CBS TV special commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Beatles' first appearance on U.S. television; and he appeared on the Foo Fighters 2014 \"Sonic Highways\" album and the corresponding TV episode documenting its creation.\n\nIn 2014, Walsh played select solo shows as well as with the Eagles on The History of the Eagles World Tour, named after their two-part, Emmy award-winning documentary, and the tour continued through July 2015. In fall 2015, Joe launched his solo \"Walsh Toor 2015.\" On Oct. 4, 2015, Joe performed at the UNITE to Face Addiction rally in Washington, D.C., which he viewed as an honor since he had been sober himself since 1995. Joe headlined the show alongside friends including Steven Tyler, Sheryl Crow and Jason Isbell.\n\nThe year 2016 saw Walsh back out on the road, with a summer co-headline arena tour with Bad Company, as well as solo Walsh Toor dates. In August 2016, \"Citizen Soldier\" was released - a documentary about an Oklahoma National Guard brigade deployed to Afghanistan - to which Joe proudly wrote original music, always eager to contribute to helping vets and bring awareness to their cause. On Sept. 28 Walsh performed with Vince Gill, James Taylor, Chris Stapleton and Kacey Musgraves for All For The Hall. October saw Walsh as grand marshal for the NASCAR \u201cCitizen Soldier 400\u201d race at Dover Downs. On Dec. 4, Walsh became a Kennedy Center Honor recipient as a member of the Eagles, which was presented by Ringo Starr. Closing out the year, Walsh was honored for his solo career by the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, which on Dec. 8 gave Walsh \u201cThe Founders Award,\u201d presented by Ringo Starr and Paul Allen. The event included a tribute concert celebrating Walsh\u2019s musical legacy by Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins, Paul Rodgers, Todd Rundgren, Robert Randolph and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.\n\nIn 2017, Walsh launched VetsAid, his 501c3 nonprofit organization, with the first annual concert event on Sept. 20 at the EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia. A Gold Star family member himself, Walsh always has supported veterans issues and his goal was to raise funds to directly support a variety of veterans service organizations that provide complete holistic care for veterans and their families - physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. The first show featured full set performances from Joe and his friends Keith Urban, Zac Brown Band and Gary Clark Jr. VetsAid 2018 sold out the Tacoma Dome, with a crowd of 17,500 (over twice the audience from the first year, 7,500) and this time Joe was joined by friends Haim, Chris Stapleton, James Taylor and Don Henley and a special guest, Ringo Starr. VetsAid has paid out over $1,155,000 in grants and the third annual VetsAid has just been announced and will take place in Houston, Texas, at the Toyota Center on Nov. 10, 2019.\n\nThe year of 2017 also saw Walsh play a six-show residency series at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, continuing to tour throughout the year as a solo artist and then returning to the House of Blues in November 2017 for additional dates. That summer Walsh reunited with fellow Eagles member Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit, accompanied by Deacon Frey and Vince Gill, for the triumphant Classic West and Classic East concert events. This led to additional stadium and arena breaking shows around the world throughout 2018.\n\nIn October 2018, Facing Addiction with NCADD honored Joe and Marjorie Walsh at its annual gala for their enduring and inspiring service and support of addicts and alcoholics in recovery. Their brother & sister in law, Ringo and Barbara Starkey, presented their award.\n\nThe year 2019 saw the Eagles continuing to play to capacity crowds and garner rave reviews. Of their June 2019 Wembley performance critics wrote: \"Eagles are not just the best selling American band, they are simply the best.\" (Daily Mail) \"Eagles take flight at triumphant show\" (Metro) and \"soaring return\" (Guardian). It is safe to say these Eagles aren't landing or stopping anytime soon."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/joe_walsh/notable_appearances", "page_content": "Notable Appearances\n\nWalsh has produced albums for artists such as Dan Fogelberg and Ringo Starr. He was a background musician (1st guitar solo) on Eagles bandmate Don Henley's 1982 hit \"Dirty Laundry\" (listed as such in the liner notes of I Can't Stand Still and Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits). Walsh played guitar throughout Who bassist John Entwistle's 1981 solo album Too Late The Hero. Walsh has also contributed to albums by: America, REO Speedwagon, Andy Gibb, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Steve Winwood, and on the Richard Marx hit \"Don't Mean Nothing\".\n\nOnscreen Walsh has appeared in: The Blues Brothers, RoboCop, Promised Land, The Drew Carey Show, Duckman, MADtv, Rock the Cradle and Zachariah.\n\nOn February 12, 2012, Walsh appeared on stage with Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Dave Grohl, and McCartney's band at the Staples Center in Los Angeles to close out the Grammy Awards show.\n\nWalsh was a regular guest deejay on the Los Angeles radio station, KLOS during the mid-1980s. They had a Saturday evening feature, with celebrity guest-hosts taking over the mic (Walsh was the guest host far more frequently than any other). He was also a frequent guest and guest-host of Detroit & Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl."}, {"url": "https://instrumentio.com/what-kind-of-guitar-does-joe-walsh-play/", "page_content": "Joe Walsh has had an extensive career and many people know him for his elaborate guitar solo featured on Hotel California and his blues guitar on Life\u2019s Been Good. He is considered to be an icon of American rock music and is the lead guitarist for the band, The Eagles. Throughout his career, he has inspired many other guitarists to pick up the instrument including Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, both of whom went on to become legends themselves. In this article, we are discovering what kind of guitar does Joe Walsh play.\n\nJoe Walsh\u2019s Guitars\n\nWalsh is known primarily for playing Fender and Gibson guitars and has had various models from both brands. He credits these guitars for their classical sounds and dynamics which is why he loves to play them. Joe has also had some signature models made in his name. Discover more about his collection below.\n\n1958 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop\n\nYears used \u2013 1970 to Present\n\nThe story about how Joe got his hands on this Gibson Les Paul is unknown but there are theories out there that say he got it after he sold his 59 Les Paul to Pete Townshend. The Goldtop would make a few appearances with The Eagles but it was rare because the humbucking sound didn\u2019t go well with Don Fedler\u2019s go-to EDS tone. The guitar finally got out into the spotlight when Walsh decided to become a solo artist in the mid-80s.\n\nThe Goldtop edition of this Les Paul was from the 50s which is affectionately known as Gibson\u2019s Golden Era, especially towards the end. this was one of the last gold Les Pauls built before the brand would switch it out for the sunburst finish. The neck and body are both made from mahogany and it features a maple top. The materials it has been made from contribute to both the tone and weight of the guitar itself. Along with the finishes, the bridge is the Les Paul standard Tune-O-Matic that can be adjusted easily using the deluxe Kluson tuners. All of these things combined add to the premium look and feel of this guitar. The fretboard is crafted from rosewood and it has the Gibson trademark trapezium inlays on it.\n\nThe legendary PAF pickups, two of which are included in the piece, are able to produce a lot of different tones and have won over guitarists for many years. Joe Walsh said that the design and sound of this guitar are some of the best he has experienced and this is why it\u2019s probably his all-time favorite instrument. He uses it now on a regular basis to inspire him when making new music.\n\nThere are several versions of the Goldtop Les Paul in Walsh\u2019s collection, including one that features a Bigbsy tremolo bridge and the pickguard removed. He used this during a live performance of Life\u2019s Been Good in 1995. He also received a 58 reissued version of the guitar from his wife.\n\nFender Stratocaster Elite\n\nYears used \u2013 1983 to 2012\n\nJoe has sometimes been credited for his fused solo sound which was enhanced by the use of this Stratocaster. Some fans think that Walsh got this guitar during 1980 when the first-line up of The Eagles was on its last legs but it didn\u2019t make its debut appearance with Walsh until 1983. Regardless of when he got the guitar, the Fender Stratocaster Elite has been a big part of his main guitar rig since this time.\n\nThis particular model of Fender tried to incorporate the standard Stratocaster design with active electronics. The Elite has a lot of features that are the same as a standard Strat but the tremolo bridge is different. It is called a Freeflyte and features separate push-pickup selections.\n\nThe body of the guitar is made from alder with a maple neck and fingerboard. Twenty-one jumbo frets sit on the neck which suits Walsh\u2019s playing style. The tremolo mechanism in the Freeflyte bridge was a step up from earlier versions of this model and it allows Joe to get more daring with his whammy bar.\n\nOther distinguishing features of the guitar include two single-coil pickups from Alnico that are gold-covered and there is an internal dummy coil that cancels out humming. This was unusual for a guitar of this time and was considered to be advanced in terms of technology. There are the three standard push-button pickup selection controls and the master volume knob, an MDX booster and a TBX equalizer.\n\nAll of the extras that come with this Elite model of Strat made it sound like a humbucker and it makes the piece a lot more versatile and distinctive from other models on the market. The Elite series has easily become the flagship in terms of how innovative Fender can be and Joe Walsh is very fortunate to own an instrument like this.\n\nFender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster\n\nYears used \u2013 1988 to Present\n\nThe Fender Eric Clapton Signature is pretty much a reissue of the 1957 Strat. The body is made from alder with a rosewood neck which has been cut into a soft V-share. This replaced the original maple neck from the 57 guitar because Joe prefers the tones that rosewood can provide compared to maple.\n\nPowering the guitar are three Vintage Noiseless pickups and an MDX mid-boost circuit along with TBX tone controls. The combination of these controls means that Joe can pretty much replicate Clapton\u2019s signature sound.\n\nJoe Walsh has been seen with this particular model during a few of his tours with The Eagles. One of the appearances that people remember the most was in Wembley in 2004 which was to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster guitar.\n\nRickenbacker 230 GF\n\nYears used \u2013 1992 to Unknown\n\nThe Rickenbacker 230 GF was made as a collaboration with Glenn Frey, a co-founder of the Eagles. It was his signature guitar and he gifted one to Joe. Glenn wanted to make a guitar that did away with complexity of the time and return back to simplicity. The guitar is practical as well as having clarity and longevity and did away with the fancy finishes.\n\nThe shape of the guitar comes from the Rickenbacker Series 200/2000 solid bodies and then refined it with some more contours for extra comfort. The body, neck and fretboard are all made of solid maple and it was finished off with a jet black, high-gloss lacquer which makes the instrument feel majestic.\n\nThe 230 GF has two humbucking pickups with a high output of sound that can produce tones from loud to warm. These particular models have a more refined sound which can be adjusted with a pickup-selector, volume knob and tone controls. Joe enjoys using this as a slide guitar and you can see him playing it in the History of the Eagles Netflix documentary for Hell Freezes Over.\n\n1977 Fender Telecaster Custom\n\nYears used \u2013 1977 to Present\n\nThis vintage 1977 Telecaster is a beautiful model with a contoured maple neck, a slim body and black dot inlays. The neck is incredibly smooth and plays like an absolute dream. The sunburst finish is made up of three tones and it adds to that already vintage feel of the piece.\n\nFor the humbuckers there are two original Fender Wide Range ones installed which come with embossed covers. The pickups are controlled by a three-way switch along with two volume and control knobs which have been embellished with witches hats.\n\nThere are a lot of premium qualities to this guitar and it also has an intense tone which makes it no surprise that a guitar player like Joe would have one of these in his arsenal. You can see Walsh playing the guitar during a live 1977 concert when he performed tracks like Take it Easy and One of These Nights.\n\n1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard\n\nYears used \u2013 1959 to 1969\n\nYou will often hear Joe Walsh say that this guitar is one of the most important instruments he has used throughout his career. It was this guitar which helped him find that balance between and Larry Lewis who was in the Mesles. Whenever Lewis would opt for his single-coil axes, Joe would pull out his 59 and find the ideal tone to suit it. This guitar was the main one Walsh would use when he played with The Mesles and it was also a part of the James Gang.\n\nFrom 1959 onwards Les Paul guitars were considered to be the pinnacle of craftsmanship in terms of American electric guitars and are now some of the most collectible instruments on the market. This model acted as a flagship and features a maple top along with a cherry sunburst finish which can only be found on these guitars from this era.\n\nThe original guitar is setup with PAF humbuckers which have been used on almost every infamous rock album from the 60s. Another great benefit of this piece is that it can be adapted in both appearance and sound. Joe would often use this guitar during his live concerts.\n\nJimmy Page of Led Zeppelin fame would be the one to buy this piece from Walsh in 1969 for a measley $500. It was to be his first ever Les Paul and soon became his most famous guitar. The Custom Shop over at Gibson would later inspect this original and reproduce it in limited numbers for a much higher price.\n\nGretsch 6120\n\nYears used \u2013 1957 to 1970\n\nThe Gretsch 6120 is a truly iconic axe. It has a hollow body and it first appeared on the scene in the 50s. It was to be the first in a series of guitars signed by Chet Atkins. The 16\u2033 maple body is laminated with an ebony fretboard and inlays that are known as thumbnails.\n\nIf you want a guitar with a clean tone, this is the one to go for thanks to the two Filtertron humbucking pickups which you can control with a volume knob, pickup selector and tone switch. The tremolo tailpiece is a premium Bigsby one which adds to the overall look of the guitar. Joe kept the guitar until 197p and then he gave it to Pete Townshend from The Who as a gift.\n\nDuesenberg Joe Walsh Signature\n\nYears used \u2013 2015 to Present\n\nThere was a few times Joe Walsh collaborated with guitar brands and Duesenberg were one of them. He wanted to create a guitar that had his favorite tones along with that crunchy rock feel that Joe is known for, along with a single coil that were common in the 60s. Named the Joe Walsh Alliance Series, there are quite a few pieces of Joe\u2019s style and personality added into these models.\n\nJoe is an avid fan of radio and what\u2019s interesting is that the fretboard inlays of this guitar spell out his name using morse code. The Tibetan Knot which you will see between each pickup is a symbol that has a lot of meaning to Walsh and he also has a tattoo of it.\n\nThe top of the guitar is made from laminated spruch while both the neck and body are strong maple. The mini-humbucker is a LittleToaster and this mixes well with a SingleTwin Mini noiseless single coil that gives you an open, responsive sound.\n\nWalsh is a self-confessed guitar nerd who likes to tinker with the hardware on his guitar\u2019s which is why there is nickel and gold featured on this one. You can see that the craftmanship of this piece is exceptional and it\u2019s a great model for Walsh to have in his collection.\n\nCarvin Custom Shop CT6M/CS6 California\n\nYears used \u2013 2004 to Present\n\nJoe first saw this model of Carvin in the back of a magazine as an advert. He knew the brand already from the 60s and had used one of their amps before he purchased their guitar. Joe says that his Carvin is both reliable and delightful and thank to Frank Zappa, he reached out to the brand to get some custom guitars made.\n\nThe CT6M has a maple top with a burst finish that goes to the edge of the body which is then finished off with a faux binding. Both of these models have Carvin Vintage Alnico humbuckers, the C22B and C22N. Joe is a fan of the bridge being built into the body rather than sitting on top of the screws, claiming that no other guitar brands had agreed to do this for him before. The shorter neck make it ideal for Walsh\u2019s larger hands so that he can reach the higher frets.\n\nWhile Joe has a lot of custom guitar models, he says that no other company has allows him to be as involved in the design of this piece than Carbin did. He had a lot of input on the different aspects to make it truly custom.\n\nIn more recent years Joe has replaced some of his more traditional Les Pauls with the CS6. The sound coming from this guitar was made under Walsh\u2019s exact specifications so they\u2019re better for him to play. You can see these models being played both in live shows and in the studio ever since Joe received them in the early 2000s.\n\nFender Custom Shop Gold Sparkle Telecaster\n\nYears used \u2013 Unknown\n\nFender issued a limited run of the Gold Sparkle Telecasters in the mid-90s that was finished with a Lucite coating which many of the Sparkle guitars had in these years. The specs are pretty much the same as the 65 Telecaster. It has a solid alder body along with a rosewood veneer fingerboard and a maple neck.\n\nThe neck and fretboard are all one piece and they include the spaghetti symbol. Kluson tuners are featured and the pickups make the sound more twangy. You can see the guitar being used by Joe when performing The Girl From Yesterday in 1995.\n\nDuesenberg Double Cat\n\nYears used \u2013 Unknown\n\nThe Double Cat is so -called because it has a cat eye F-soundhole and deep cutaways that give it a unique personality. The body is made of solid alder and it also has a flat maple top. The body is robust which gives the Double Cat that distinctive look and the maple neck gives it the tone that musicians such as Joe look for.\n\nInside the bridge is a traditionally wound GrandVintage humbucker and the neck has a Domino P90 single coil pickup. Both of these have been wired in the middle so that the frequencies can be separated, giving the guitar an open and varied sound.\n\nThe fretboard has been finished by hand so it makes it much smoother and playable. Everything that has gone into this instrument has made it one of Joe\u2019s favorites and we can see why he cherishes it so much.\n\nJoe Walsh\u2019s Amps\n\nFender Blackface Champ\n\nYears used \u2013 1964 to 1970\n\nKicking off our list of Joe Walsh\u2019s guitar gear is the Blackface Champ which was introduced in the 60s by Fender. It is a 5-watt amp which is powered by a 6V6 tube and an 8\u2033 speaker which means you can push it to the absolute limit. This is the reason why it was one of the most popular amps used in the 70s.\n\nWhen you play using the amp you will hear that it\u2019s pretty loud and offers your sound a lot of depth, particularly if you mike it up closer to the speakers. The straightforward and innovative design produces a great tone that is ideal for recording. Joe used this amp to record Funk #49 which was one of his biggest hits in the 1970s.\n\nRoland JC-120 Jazz Chorus\n\nYears used \u2013 1975 to 1984\n\nThe JC-120 is a classic guitar amp that came out of the 70s and it has been popular ever since it has been released. It is one of the more popular Roland models and guitarists around the world have used it for a long time.\n\nThe Jazz Chorus is known for having a clean tone and it was the first one of its kind to use this sort of effect. Now it\u2019s used all the time, but Joe was able to use it to improve the overall quality of his sound and add on a natural stero chorus tone. In terms of guitar gear it is sturdy so it\u2019s ideal for those who travel with their equipment all the time.\n\nVox AC30\n\nYears used \u2013 Unknown\n\nDue to the increasing demand for loud amplifiers, the Vox AC30 was introduced in 1958. It\u2019s become known to hit those high ends and is an important piece of guitar gear for rock artists like Walsh. It can produce smoother tones as well as the rowdier ones and it would become known as the amp that powered the British Invasion with the iconic AC/DC. Walsh is a big fan of this amp because he says it sounds great when paired with his Fender guitars.\n\nDr.Z Z-Master Joe Walsh Signature\n\nYears used \u2013 2019 to present\n\nThis is the amp that is Joe\u2019s signature and it came about when he was approached by Dr. Z in 2018. They wanted to recreate one of Walsh\u2019s favorite amps which was the \u201959 Tweed Fender Bandmaster amp. This was another one that he gifted to Pete Townshend.\n\nAs an amp, this one provides enough versatility to match how Joe likes to play and to suit his extensive collection of guitars. Inside there are two internal blended voices that each have independent volume knobs which means it can generate a great range of different audio textures.\n\nCarvin Nomad\n\nThis Carvin amp has been a regular fixture on the stage with Joe and he says that it is very reliable for him. The powerful amp is loud and features 50 watts of power. The speaker is a GT12 which produces a distinct and clear sound and it\u2019s incredibly lightweight being only forty pounds.\n\nThe Carvin Nomad has twin channels and loads of different level settings which means that Joe can dial in his rhythm and lead guitar tones. The reverb gives him more range in terms of sound texture and adds to the atmosphere. It\u2019s an important piece of gear that he has at his disposable and he once said he couldn\u2019t blow one of these up despite making several attempts to do so.\n\nJoe Walsh\u2019s Pedals\n\nBoss OS-2 OverDrive/Distortion\n\nYears used \u2013 1990 to Present\n\nThis is one of the pedals that Joe uses a lot and it usually accompanies him on his tours. It combines both overdrive and distortion effects int he same pedal. You can use the effects by themselves or join them together so that the tone is more unique. There are four onboard controls which allow you to customize the tone further and it\u2019s a pedal that is known for pickup up on those subtle guitar accents. It\u2019s a great pedal that doesn\u2019t take up too much room and it is perfect for the blues solos Joe is known for playing.\n\nBoss DD-3 Digital Delay\n\nYears used \u2013 2012 to Present\n\nThe Boss DD-3 Digital Delay pedal comes with a range of different applications. It\u2019s one of Walsh\u2019s favorite pedals for effects and he always keeps one around. He uses it to create repeats and latch effects during his live shows. It features a complete delay time control for those slapback repeats and all of the characteristics make it worth being in Joe\u2019s collection.\n\nSummary\n\nJoe Walsh has made a huge impact on what is now known as a rock guitarist. Besides being an amazing musician, his voice is also ideal for singing blues rock. There are so many riffs and solos he has produced that continue to influence modern guitarists even now. Fans around the world will always remember the contribution he has made to rock music as a genre.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat guitar did Joe Walsh use on Life\u2019s Been Good?\n\nJoe Walsh used his Les Paul coupled with a Fender amp called a Twin Reverb to create the sound you hear in Life\u2019s Been Good.\n\nWhat guitar did Joe Walsh use on Hotel California?\n\nFor the famous solo you hear in Hotel California, Walsh used his classic 70s Fender Telecaster, one of many Fender guitars that the musician has in his collection.\n\nIs Joe Walsh a good guitarist?\n\nJoe is a great guitar player and was recognized as such back in 1970 to 1971.
