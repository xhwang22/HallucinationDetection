They already did a remake of The Fog and, well, it sucked. But there are a lot of others classics in that catalogue. Maybe Big Trouble in Little China? Wait, on second thought, Carpenter hates that idea. How about Assault on Precinct 13? Oh, they did that one already too. Huh.\n\nPerhaps the timeliest Carpenter film is one of the few they haven\u2019t strip-mined for parts yet: They Live, Carpenter\u2019s searing satire of \u201980s culture and television\u2019s mind-numbing effects on the human psyche. A relative flop in its day, They Live has slowly grown into one of the most acclaimed and beloved science-fiction films of the 1980s. If anything, its message is even more prophetic and ominous now in a world of smartphones and social media.\n\nIn a recent interview with Den Of Geek, Carpenter revealed that you could see a new They Live \u2014 and that \u201cit might be closer to reality than you think.\u201d Asked how he would refashion the material for 2018, he refused to answer, because we might actually see the answer soon on the big screen. He also discussed a remake that was in development at some point:\n\nThere was a feature film. It was a feature film called Resistance, written by, oh, the guy who did the Apes movies. Matt Reeves. But then he moved on, and so the sequel is, well, we'll see. We'll just have to see.\n\nIf I get a vote: Do a They Live TV series. What better setting to eviscerate the medium than the medium itself? 10 episodes on Hulu would give us enough time to really explore the premise of this world that has been secretly overrun by aliens. Then one entire episode can just be a recreation of the famous fight between Roddy Piper and Keith David."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/richard-karen-carpenters-biography-1258579/", "page_content": "In the summer of 1974, the Carpenters sat down with Rolling Stone writer Tom Nolan at Hollywood\u2019s Au Petit Caf\u00e9 for a cover story. Richard and Karen Carpenter, who had spent the past four years scoring massive soft-rock hits like \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve Only Just Begun,\u201d \u201cSuperstar,\u201d and \u201cTop of the World,\u201d took the opportunity to vent to Nolan about the uncool, wholesome image that they felt the press had created for the sibling duo.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026thing they\u2019ve built up, where it\u2019s implicitly understood the Carpenters don\u2019t smoke, the Carpenters don\u2019t drink,\u201d Richard said. \u201cNever would swear. Never would listen to rock music. It\u2019s like we\u2019re Pat Boone, only a little cleaner. As if all we do all day is drink milk, eat apple pie, and take showers. I don\u2019t even like milk.\u201d\n\nRichard can only laugh when the quote is read back to him nearly 50 years later. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what were described as,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the way we looked and our audiences looked. The rock critics, they didn\u2019t like our audiences. It made the whole thing seem irrelevant, like we were nothing, and in no time at all, no one would ever remember us.\u201d\n\nThe new book Carpenters: The Musical Legacy tries to show how wrong that was. Written by Mike Cidoni Lennox and Chris May, the massive, definitive biography chronicles the duo\u2019s career in elaborate detail, based on more than 100 hours of interviews with Richard and full access to his archive. It aims to correct the legacy of the group, which is often overshadowed by Karen Carpenter\u2019s death from anorexia in 1983.\n\n1974 Richard Carpenter Collection\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cBetween the TV movie [1989\u2019s The Karen Carpenter Story] and a number of unauthorized documentaries and articles, that\u2019s what a lot of the attention is focused on,\u201d Richard says. \u201cNot how successful we were and continue to be, nor Karen\u2019s voice and how timeless it is. It gets pushed to the back. The two of us are underrated, to this day. And we sell a lot every year, all over the world \u2014 still.\u201d\n\nThe book marks Richard\u2019s second time authorizing a Carpenters biography, after 1994\u2019s The Carpenters: The Untold Story by Ray Coleman. \u201cKaren\u2019s anorexia was much fresher,\u201d says Lennox, \u201cand he delivered what Richard calls \u2018the anorexia book.\u2019\u201d Adds May: \u201cHe\u2019s been down this road before, and he was very hesitant to do it again. We weren\u2019t sure if we were going to get his blessing.\u201d\n\nThat changed when Lennox and May approached Richard to write the introduction to their book. Lennox, a senior entertainment reporter at the Associated Press, and May, a music director and arranger, are both longtime Carpenters experts \u2014 they met online on a forum dedicated to the group. \u201cHe realized our hearts and background,\u201d May says.\n\nSoon, Richard was overseeing the entire project, and Lennox and May had gained his trust. \u201cThis was a book that intentionally didn\u2019t want to dive into their personal demons, and we make that point really clear,\u201d says Lennox. \u201cAfter reading the first draft, Richard said, \u2018You\u2019ve really got to deal with Karen\u2019s anorexia by the time you get to late 1973, and you have to deal with my use of Quaaludes.\u2019 These were things that he knew. The word \u2018authorized\u2019 can be a very dirty word, and here we were trying to just focus on the music. He pushed us into things and kept us in the nonfiction section.\u201d\n\nKaren rehearses at home, 1973 Richard Carpenter Collection\n\nHaving full access to the Carpenters\u2019 archives meant Lennox and May were able to provide an extensive history of the group. One chapter includes a Year in the Life, which maps out 364 days the duo spent in 1970 \u2014 from the release of their breakout single \u201c(They Long to Be) Close to You\u201d to their self-titled third album. Tour dates, television appearances, chart positions, and other major events are laid out in immense detail. This is somewhat rare, since many groups from that time don\u2019t have detailed records of their tour schedules, let alone the dates of photo shoots.\n\n\u201cWe were getting close to deadline,\u201d Lennox recalls, noting they spent four years writing the book. \u201cThere was a substantial amount of their gigs [that] could not be found. We finally said, \u2018Richard, we need a complete itinerary for the Carpenters.\u2019 He went downstairs, and lo and behold, he brought up Karen\u2019s itinerary, and in they were in [her] handwriting.\u201d\n\nThe writers used more than 200 images in the book, some of which showcase Karen\u2019s drumming. \u201cShe was a rare bird in that department,\u201d Richard says. \u201cShe was way beyond a novelty. There are more women playing the drums now.\u201d\n\nMore than anything, Richard says he really misses his sister\u2019s company. \u201cWe definitely liked and disliked the same things \u2014 a real friend where you could talk about anything you wish and you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable,\u201d he says. It also pains him to think about the records the Carpenters could have gone on to make. \u201cThat\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, she was only 32.\u201d\n\nNearly four decades after Karen\u2019s death, Lennox and May hope the biography will reintroduce the duo to a younger generation and rectify their legacy. \u201cMy hope is people will realize that the story of Richard and Karen Carpenter is not the most tragic in pop music \u2014 it is one of the most triumphant,\u201d Lennox says. \u201cThis gray cloud will no longer loom over this incredible work. I think the last thing in the world that she would have wanted was for her death to define her life.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/06/05/katharine_carpenter_feature.shtml", "page_content": "Katharine decided to pursue a career in journalism after work experience on her local newspaper and setting up a children's programme on hospital radio as a teenager.\n\nShe started at the BBC in 2000 as a news trainee.

The crew realizes it has no choice but to kill it before it can finish them all off\u2026 and then move on to potentially consuming the entire world.\n\nWith my three 20-something nephews rolling through town for the weekend, my daughter and I agreed that, with that impressively large opening scene of the helicopter chasing the dog through those white mountain-y landscapes of its Antarctica setting (okay, it\u2019s actually Alaska, but who\u2019s to know?), shot in the director\u2019s preferred epic cinemascope shooting format, the moody score (it\u2019s credited to Ennio Morricone, but some of those simple drones overlaid by hypnotic beats sound an awful lot like a Carpenter score\u2026 hhmmm\u2026. verrrrryyyy interesting\u2026) and the way-ahead-of-their-time, mind-bending-even-for-today grue-strewn and fantasmagorically inspired flesh-melding special effects, there was no better film with which to impress them with their uncle\u2019s projector set-up than John Carpenter\u2019s (arguably, but not my much or many) true masterpiece, The Thing.\n\nI mean, let\u2019s be clear, Carpenter\u2019s created a bunch of great, iconic films (and a recurring Shape named Michael Myers) that will live in the halls of horror history forever\u2026 but it\u2019s the seriousness of his approach with The Thing that stands it apart from the rest of the considerable best of his output. I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s not above wallowing in the delicious frisson and gore of the genre \u2013 it does, gleefully! \u2013 but it\u2019s in the perfectly placed fades to black, and the lingering on the thoughtful faces, and the confidence and intelligence to know when to leave words unspoken and hanging in the air, that reveals a maturity in storytelling that Carpenter had never surpassed before, and doubtfully ever will again (certainly not after the many years of dreck we\u2019ve witnessed him churning out with depressingly little interest or regard in the last twenty years or so).\n\nSomething that stands out each time I go back is just how impressively directed the film is. Trying to provide interesting and vibrant orchestrations of the up to a dozen crew members at a time around the various small rooms, while carefully making sure to allow for the individual personality that each actor brings to his character (one nice actor-ly touch I\u2019d never noticed before, but did this time thanks to the crisp blu ray transfer, is that Richard Dysart\u2019s Doc Copper is wearing a nose ring!) could hurl any filmmaker into a life-threatening anxiety attack to the point of running off into the cold night in sheer terror. But Carpenter\u2019s touch with the physical movement, as it is with the narrative flow, is practically flawless.\n\nWhen the film came out and, as it was being mercilessly (and entirely undeservedly) shredded apart by foolish mainstream critics, I distinctly remember Roger Ebert on his \u201cAt the Movies\u201d review show complaining to his co-hort Gene Siskel that you couldn\u2019t tell the various characters apart. Well\u2026 I don\u2019t know what movie he was watching, but the casting in this film is just about perfect, with each actor bringing just the right color to his character; never going too broad to seem unreal, yet not too complex either, which would unnecessarily emotionally muck things up against the other actors. The casting is so right, in fact, it\u2019s hard to imagine there wasn\u2019t a bit of happy accident mixed in with intelligent choices (and gotta mention that main dog who brings the initial death to the camp\u2026 it is simply astounding, delivering such a sense of stillness and control you can almost hear it thinking at times\u2026 ).\n\nThere\u2019s an early moment in the film that really speaks to the, I dare say, unusual deeper resonance that the director reaches for with the film, in which initial camp manager Garry (played by long-time brilliant character actor Donald Moffett, whose character quickly gets supplanted in the leadership role by Carpenter\u2019s preferred modern day anti-authoritarian cowboy hero Kurt Russell) is forced to shoot a crazed Norwegian pilot who has shown up at the camp desperately trying to kill the aforementioned dog and anyone who gets in the way. Carpenter spends just an extra beat with Garry, showing us the terrible reality that Garry experiences having just killed someone. He quickly recovers, but just that quick focus on that emotional moment, as subtle as it is, provides added weight to the experience of the film.\n\nIt\u2019s a monster movie generically called The Thing, as if the creature is a single entity, and yet, ironically, there is really no single \u2018monster\u2019 in the film (as many times as I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 and it\u2019s been a lot \u2014 I\u2019ve never really been quite sure how this creature, or creatures, or series of destructive cells, operates\u2026 or what it actually is\u2026 or if it even has a central intelligence? I mean, why does Blair at the end suddenly turn into, assuming it\u2019s even him, this tentacle lathered all-tooth face creature with dogs growing out of him? And why does Norris do this slow transformation, when it seems like everyone else gets transformed real fast? And why do the post-taken over humans keep leaving their tattered clothes around?)\n\nIt\u2019s not a killer car, or a boogeyman, or a vampire, or goth star from Mars, as in other Carpenter films, bur rather a nebulous, shifting threat; an existential one. With its ability to take over its unwilling hosts and rip them to shreds and twist them into all sorts of untenable shapes, it represents a state of abjection. In this way, the \u2018Thing\u2019 is a creation more akin to the perverse heady musings of David Cronenberg than it is related to the grounded, lesser intellectual pleasures of Carpenter. It\u2019s a representation of the anxieties of our body rebelling against us with disease and aging\u2026 with no presence of a human soul speaking to the existence of angels to take comfort in; there\u2019s only (rending, transmogrifying) flesh.\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise that the first sensationalistic images of grue we see aren\u2019t of the audacious Rob Bottin variety that the film is deservedly known for, but instead real ones \u2013 squishy organs being removed, with the camera fetishistically studying them like it\u2019s all a good gore gag \u2014 by Blair (Wilford Brimley, delivering as good a performance as the rest), pulling them from the seemingly dead ameboid alien form and describing them as \u2018what appears to be a normal set of human organs\u2019. They are normal. And that\u2019s the horror. This is surprisingly deep stuff for Carpenter. And it really works.\n\nThe ending \u2014 with the two surviving alpha males, talking tough and swigging the last bit of whiskey like heroic genre figures, with the darkness and nihilism (and the final reprise of the deliberate beats of the Carpenter \u2013 uh, oops, I mean, Morricone, of course \u2014 score) encroaching in around them \u2013 brings it to a close on a perfect note.\n\nAnd the movie (and the projector system) was a big hit with the nephews.\n\nOne of the extras on the impressively jam-packed Scream Factory blu ray was a VHS quality version of the network television cut of the film so, on the next night (post-nephew visit), in the interest of checking out how the television execs went about dealing with (and snipping away at) the plethora of flesh-churning and body-opening effects work that so defined this film (especially in the far more innocent and highly edited network-television landscape of the 80\u2019s), I decided to do something that I generally never did back in the day, deliberately, on moral grounds \u2013 that is, watching a broadcast television edit of a theatrical film. And, of course, the movie loses a lot.\n\nAlong with the terribly frustrating (especially having watched it in the correct aspect ratio just the night before) pan-and-scan 1.33 cropping that reduces the impact of so much of Carpenter\u2019s carefully composed shots (as well as the grandiose sense of the proceedings), the usual revising of naughty language also isn\u2019t done with much inspiration; for instance, Childs original line about \u201cvoodoo bullshit\u201d becomes the relatively inept \u201cvoodoo bullstuff\u201d \u2013 not a particularly creative solution, I dare say, for an editing field that while being clearly offensive to the original artist\u2019s work, can still admittedly offer all sorts of entertaining possibilities (just look at the television edit of Brian De Palma\u2019s Scarface, where endlessly foul-mouthed Tony Montana\u2019s \u201cThis city is like a woman that hasn\u2019t been in fucked in weeks\u201d becomes \u201cThis city is like a chicken that hasn\u2019t been plucked in weeks\u201d for some inspired choices by whoever is in charge of doing these rewrites).\n\nA full 12 minutes are cut from the running time to fit into the two-hour television time slot (knocking the film down to 90 minutes, to go with the commercials) and the impact is fairly drastic. Along with full scenes, heads and tails are cut everywhere, moving the story along faster, but effectively muting the mood drenched atmosphere, and the lingering on the cold solitary environment that are such an important part of the film\u2019s power.\n\nNo surprise, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of cutting around much of the centerpiece FX-set pieces\u2026 scenes like the original dog exploding outward in the dog kennel and attacking the poor other mutts and, of course, the infamous and incredible chest-with-teeth moment (with the unforgettable head melting off and growing legs and antenna is gone entirely). However, I must admit\u2026 even cut down (and cropped) as they are, there\u2019s a frenetic quality that Carpenter captured that, even seeing so much less, these scenes still manage to be effective\u2026 they likely just would never have become as iconic if they were originally presented like this (I mean, come on\u2026 those incredible effects just have to be seen!).\n\nThere\u2019s also seem really off-putting creative decisions that come with the television cut that there is simply no way John Carpenter (or really any creative personnel) had anything to do with; for instance the inclusion of an intermittent, bland-voiced omniscient narrator (introduced, no less, in cinematically verboten fashion \u2013 as we see the opening story credit \u2018Antarctica, Winter, 1982\u2019, the guy somberly intones the very words, breaking the standard rule that you don\u2019t use voiceover to say exactly what you see on screen). The fact that the narrator goes on to soberly state the name and a completely unnecessary brief history for each of the characters (whenever there\u2019s a convenient close up) makes me wonder if the execs hadn\u2019t taken to heart influential critic Ebert\u2019s (off-base) criticism of getting lost in all the characters. The narrator even provides a final coda, a brief closing warning, straight out of a 1950\u2019s horror film and the time of the hysteria of the red scare, not only comforting us with the existence of God, but warning us to be on the look out for threats, that I guess could have been fun in a nostalgic way, but ends up diluting the quiet perfection of the original\u2019s nihilistic ending.\n\nThere are also other cuts that are stranger, making little sense, such as the moment the newly revealed monstrous Palmer, burning up in flames and transforming, bursts out of the shelter and into the snow, where MacReady hurries out and throws a grenade after him, blowing him/it to smithereens\u2026 well, the television cut unaccountably gets rid of the Russell character hurling the explosive\u2026 so Palmer now just suddenly blows up! It seems a decision based upon pure disrespect for a genre audience (\u2018ah, they\u2019ll enjoy anything\u2026 as long as it blows up!\u2019).\n\nSaying that, even with the cropping, the radical cutting down for time and gore and the strange disrespectful editing choices (and I didn\u2019t even mention the odd occasional random-seeming use of a different shot than the theatrical \u2013 for instance, a single two shot during a conversation between two characters rather than back-and-forth over the shoulder shots), the film still kinda works. The inherent power of the performances, the direction, and the fascinating thing creation itself, still manage to push through. Though I don\u2019t suggest watching your favourite movies like this.

Carpenter came to Tennessee via the VISTA program. Studies at the Highlander Center in New Market, Tennessee, introduced Carpenter to the \"new regionalism,\" a model for understanding mountain culture. Studies at Tennessee Tech in Cookeville introduced him to small format video. Carpenter then traveled to New York to study small format video production at the Alternate Media Center (AMC) of New York University. At the AMC Carpenter studied with the center's director, George Stoney.\n\n\n\nCarpenter returned to Appalachia in 1971 as the coordinator of a community program in Monterey, Tennessee, on urban and rural education. He also began doing his own freelance video documentaries on life in East Tennessee. Carpenter traveled widely among the communities of the region, interviewing farmers, shopkeepers and others. He then showed the interviews to other farmers and shopkeepers and encouraged them to add their own comments. To Carpenter the process of communication was as important as the finished documentary.\n\n\n\nCarpenter told Stoney of his work in East Tennessee. In turn Stoney communicated with friends on the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) about Carpenter's work. Subsequently, in November 1972 ARC awarded Carpenter a two-year grant, to be administered through the First Tennessee-Virginia Development District. With this grant Carpenter founded Broadside TV in Johnson City.\n\n\n\nThrough Broadside, Carpenter put into practice his view that portapac and small video format technology could be used by members of a community to teach themselves their own culture. Carpenter aimed to provide the medium through which individuals could generate the material for their own learning. His model was the community newspaper--hence the name \"Broadside\" television.\n\n\n\nIn East Tennessee, where television reception was poor, cable service was well established. However, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) mandated that cable operators produce a certain number of hours of locally originated programming. Carpenter and Broadside took advantage of this ruling and convinced local operators to turn over to Broadside their local programming budgets. Broadside thus was free to use its own discretion in regard to the types of programs it produced. In return, however, Broadside agreed to produce a certain number of hours of bluegrass music and wrestling. These subjects were among the favorites of the cable operators.\n\n\n\nWith subsequent grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Tennessee Arts Commission, and private sources, Broadside was able to produce a variety of programs on life in central Appalachia. Among the topics examined by Broadside were coal mining, energy and environmental needs and problems, land use, traditional arts, handicrafts, music, education, storytelling, aging and the needs of senior citizens, and regional history. The Southern Appalachian Video Ethnography Series (SAVES), produced in partnership with East Tennessee State University, is of particular interest and importance.\n\n\n\nBroadside also served as a tape clearinghouse which distributed tapes to schools and community groups throughout Appalachia. In addition, Broadside contracted with local agencies and establishments (e.g., Memorial Hospital in Johnson City) to make instructional films.\n\n\n\nBroadside's fortunes, and those of other video producers dependent on local cable programming, changed in 1974 when the FCC dropped its requirement that cable operators provide locally-originated programming. Faced with the loss of the major portion of its funding, Carpenter and Broadside had to reevaluate programming strategy. This task fell primarily to Carpenter's successors, as he left in 1975 to head the Citizens Committee for Broad-casting. The station in 1977 sought unsuccessfully to use Channel 41 as a public cable television station. A year later, in 1978, unable to maintain its operation, Broadside filed for bankruptcy.

The team of Post and Carpenter first rose to fame in the 1970s with the music for The Rockford Files, and they even scored a pop chart hit with the theme to The Greatest American Hero. But their work for 1980s TV, especially the cop and detective dramas (such as Hunter) created by producer and writer Stephen Cannell, made their musical style the default sound of American television. They also worked with Cannell on shows like The A-Team, which was decidedly not in the cop/detective mold. Mike Post furthered his influence on the procedural genre after Carpenter\u2019s death with his work on Dick Wolf\u2019s Law and Order franchise, complete with the iconic \u201cdun-dun\u201d sound.\n\nIn the American Heritage Center, the Mike Post and Pete Carpenter Collection documents this work and is a great asset to researchers who want to look into this key moment and team in the history of television music. This collection collects the full scope of Post and Carpenter\u2019s work in the 1970s and 1980s, from early shows like Toma and The Rockford Files, continuing on with A-Team and many shows they worked on for Cannell Productions in the 1980s that are not as well remembered, such as Riptide and Hardcastle and McCormick. Also included is Post\u2019s solo efforts on the classic and influential police drama Hill Street Blues, co-created and produced by Stephen Bochco.\n\nThe collection mainly consists of the scores and parts used for recording, with most of them also including a cue sheet. These cue sheets are a valuable source of information on the many composers and arrangers who worked in the Post and Carpenter offices and who wrote many of the cues credited to Post and Carpenter, mimicking their iconic style.\n\nThis is not surprising considering that the team were scoring hundreds of hours of television each season. Included on these scores and cue sheets are names such as Ron Jones and Walter Murphy, both of whom have long composition careers of their own, with both even working together on the animated show Family Guy. Ron Jones also worked extensively on Star Trek: The Next Generation and even parodied his music from the show in later work on Family Guy.\n\nWhile the bulk of the collection is the scores, parts, and cue sheets, there are a limited number of \u201cmusic timing\u201d guides for the 1970s materials, including dozens of such guides from The Rockford Files. These are typed versions of spotting session notes and were used by Post and Carpenter as they went to work on crafting the scores for each episodes. There are a limited number of guides for other, short lived shows, along with some pilots that never went to series.\n\nThese materials provide a rich source of research material for film and television music scholars who wish to research the music for one of the most prolific composition teams ever, and whose music accompanied some of the shows that helped set the stage for today\u2019s television landscape.\n\n\u2013 Michael Harris, graduate intern\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n"}], "Carpenter created the television series The Protectors.": [{"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068122/reviews", "page_content": "3 /10\n\n\"The Protectors\" was a British television show (ITC) back in 1972-74. It was an attempt to capture the spirit of \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\", and to capitalize on Robert Vaughn's fading \"The Man From UNCLE\" popularity.\n\n\n\nThe best part of the show was its catchy \"Avenues and Alleyways\" theme song played at the beginning and ending of each 24-minute episode. New viewers will find even 24 minutes too long as the low budget and lack of talent (both writing and acting) doom things from an entertainment perspective, unless you can find unintended humor in the idea of an action adventure show in which action and adventure are conspicuously absent.\n\n\n\nVaughn plays Harry Rule, a member of a three-person team of freelance troubleshooters based in Europe. A fair amount of each 24-minute episode is taken up by scenic \"establishment\" shots to make it appear that the show was produced on location in a variety of exotic European locales.\n\n\n\nHarry appears to be the leader of the group, if only because he has the most screen time. Tony Anholt plays the gadget guy (today he would be the team nerd). He is definitely a third wheel, rarely starring in an episode and by the second season rarely even appearing.\n\n\n\nMy theory is that \"The Protectors' target audience was nursing home residents with bad hearts, who wanted to see a secret agent type show but could not survive exposure to things like action, suspense, humor and hot romance.\n\n\n\nWhich is about the only way to account for the casting of Myree Dawn Porter as a character called the Contessa di Contini. Despite her exotic name, the Contessa was about as antiseptic and sterile as a wax figure. It is likely that the character was meant to be a slightly more sophisticated version of Emma Peale, but the Contessa avoids all action and contributes nothing in the humor, parody, or seduction departments.\n\n\n\nSince the popularity of this type of show requires a fair degree of sensual energy, the nursing home explanation is the only way to account for the casting of an actress in her late 30's, especially one clearly showing a lot of mileage. She was certainly no Alexandra Bastedo (\"The Champions\") and the show's frequent close-ups of her face were not a good idea.\n\n\n\nIf you have nothing better to do than watch this series, watch for the absence of young attractive actresses (a staple of every Saint and UNCLE episode) as villains or heroines. Apparently Porter had a contract clause specifying that no \"featured\" actress could be younger than her; and they wonder why these things don't get better ratings.\n\n\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child."}, {"url": "https://televisionheaven.co.uk/reviews/protectors-the-1964", "page_content": "The Protectors had one of the most difficult jobs on television when first introduced in 1964, as this team of specialists were brought in to bridge the gap left by the concluding episode of that year's highly successful series of The Avengers.\n\n\"We sell security. Object: To prevent crime,\" was the motto of the three specialists operating out of a plush London office.\n\nProducer Michael Chapman said of the series, \"This is in sharp contrast to The Avengers, which dealt with crime in a stylish, fantasy world. Our show is about three level-headed people who try to prevent crime from happening.\" Certainly Heather Keys played by former Compactactress Ann Morrish was no Cathy Gale. \"I suppose it is inevitable I should be compared to Cathy,\" said Morrish in 1964. \"But off-screen and on we couldn't be more different.\"\n\nThe series took for its inspiration the many security firms that were beginning to spring up around Britain at that time, and after placing advertisements in newspapers, asking prospective clients to call 'Wellbeck 3269' the SIS (Specialists in Security) firm headed by former insurance investigator Ian Souter (Andrew Faulds), and assisted by ex policeman Robert Shoesmith (Michael Atkinson) found themselves assigned to cases involving forgery, espionage and murder. African born Faulds had previously come to public notice as a prospective Labour parliamentary candidate for Stratford-on-Avon, and took up his political career once more after retiring from acting to become an MP.

Across two seasons and fifty-two episodes the Protectors, an international detective agency with agents in every major city on Earth, tackled all manner of crimes across England and Europe.\n\nThe reason the show\u2019s Anderson heritage may have escaped many fans could be partly due to the fact that the series was not based on a concept he created, but rather one that he was presented with by Lew Grade and essentially told to get on with. Gathering together as many of his familiar team as possible he set to work fleshing out Grade\u2019s one-line concept; \u2018there is a small group of private detectives who are able to work more efficiently because they are operating outside of the law\u2019, and the result was ironically one of the most successful series he would ever produce.\n\nDespite this however, the series tends to be more often thought of as \u2018just another\u2019 in the long line of filmed action series produced by ITC through the 1960s and early 1970s \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why. Being a contemporary thriller series The Protectors lacks any of the fantastic vehicles, secret bases or impressive gadgets almost all of Anderson\u2019s other work is known for, and while this may be a contributing factor in the show\u2019s lack of appeal to Anderson fans that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a good series here worthy of attention \u2013 one that perhaps has more in common with his other works than it would first appear.\n\nWhile the production of the series was by most accounts not a very happy affair there\u2019s no denying that the three central characters \u2013 Robert Vaughn\u2019s Harry Rule, Nyree Dawn Porter\u2019s Contessa Caroline di Contini, and Tony Anholt\u2019s Paul Buchet \u2013 do work well together on screen and have a very good chemistry. Harry Rule may not always be as warm or charming as Vaughn\u2019s Man from UN.C.L.E. Napoleon Solo was just a few years earlier but he also feels more credible here, more dangerous. Nyree Dawn Porter brings all the glamour and sophistication of a live-action Lady Penelope (right down to the Rolls Royce and chauffeur) while also being just as formidable in a fight as her male colleagues, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why Tony Anholt was brought back a few years later for Space:1999\u2019s second season. All three characters felt like the traditional globetrotting adventurers of previous ITC shows but were also credible as agents capable of handling themselves in a scrap, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for one to carry an episode alone if either or both of their co-stars weren\u2019t around.\n\nUnique among Anderson\u2019s live action shows (and most other ITC action shows of that time) each episode of The Protectors was only twenty-five minutes long. While this sometimes created scripting problems (the convoluted 2000ft to Die fails as an opening episode, and if anyone can tell me what A Case for the Right is even about I\u2019d be grateful) and character development usually takes a backseat to the action, the same could equally be said of Captain Scarlet, Stingray, or Joe 90. On the other hand, as those shows proved, a shorter running time almost certainly avoids having episodes drag. When The Protectors is working particularly well (Balance of Terror, The First Circle and Shadbolt) the resulting drama and action are easily as entertaining as the very best episodes of any of those earlier series. It also avoiding becoming formulaic, as the vague nature of the show\u2019s original premise allowed for a wide variety of stories to be told; from conventional ITC cops and robbers fare like Your Witness and Thinkback, to intense two-character stories like The First Circle and For the Rest of Your Natural\u2026, surprisingly though-provoking political dramas like The Last Frontier and Border Line, and even to occasional comedy episodes which veer from genuinely charming (Sugar and Spice) to THE ABSOLUTE VERY WORST THING WITH THE GERRY ANDERSON NAME ON IT EVER.\n\nThe series also benefitted from ITC\u2019s decision at the beginning of the 1970s to start shooting their action series on location as much as possible, thus the Europe of The Protectors wouldn\u2019t be the same Elstree backlot street set that The Saint or The Champions set their Europe on; it would now be the real thing. Memorable stories would take place in Malta, Venice, Rome and Salzburg to name just a few, and the show took full advantage of the storytelling opportunities these locations presented. At times The Protectors almost feels as prestigious and expensive a series as Thunderbirds and later Space:1999 do, and while 1999\u2019s budget would be used to create some extremely impressive indoor sets The Protectors was the only Gerry Anderson show whose world did not have to be built from scratch; they could find adventure literally on their own doorstep.\n\nLongtime Anderson fans may also enjoy seeing familiar faces from his other shows turn up in guest roles, including Shane Rimmer (who also wrote several episodes), Jeremy Wilkin, Cyril Shaps, Vladek Sheybal, Neil McCallum, and most notably Ed Bishop who plays a mentally disturbed Vietnam war veteran in arguably the show\u2019s best episode, The First Circle. The Protectors is also full of enjoyable guest turns from such notables as Patrick Troughton, Derren Nesbitt, David Suchet, John Thaw, and Eartha Kitt. We also mustn\u2019t overlook the show\u2019s music, with a sparkling main theme and incidental score from John Cameron, as well as perhaps the most enduring element of the entire series; Mitch Murray and Peter Callandar\u2019s Avenues and Alleyways, sung with typical gusto over the end credits by the legendary Tony Christie.\n\nAfter a successful first season the show received minor cosmetic changes going into its second year, with greater emphasis placed on the three main characters and more of a inclination towards downbeat endings that perhaps reflect the shifting attitudes of the early 1970s. The era of the millionaire playboy television hero was almost at an end, and several of The Protectors\u2019 cold and grey London-based final episodes (most notably Shadbolt) feel closer in tone to The Sweeney than the affluent globetrotting of its earliest installments. Had the show earned a third season it would have been interesting to see whether or not this trend would have continued, and seen The Protectors step from the shadows of its predecessors to truly pursue its own path. Sadly, this was not to be; Faberg\u00e9, who financed both seasons, pulled their support for the show and the planned third season never materialised.\n\nThe Protectors will likely always remain the odd series out in the Gerry Anderson catalogue due to it being so utterly unlike anything else he ever produced, and yet it remains one of his most successful. Aside from the usual flurry of books, comics and home media releases it is one of only a handful of his shows to go to a second season (especially revealing when taking into account that very few of the ITC action series ran for more than one) so there are more television episodes of The Protectors in existence today than any of his other shows \u2013 fifty-two!\n\nLongevity alone is no guarantee of quality, yet The Protectors is easily one of the best ITC action shows of the early 1970s. The Persuaders! remains hugely entertaining but the rest are a mixed bag; The Zoo Gang was decent but ended as soon as it started, Jason King is based around a character who doesn\u2019t want to do anything and so doesn\u2019t, and The Adventurer was dead on arrival and only went downhill from there. During a period when the regular ITC team were struggling to produce decent (or even watchable) shows Gerry was handed a blank-slate of a concept and brought the same perfectionism to it as he did to all his other shows. The result was a slick, energetic and confident series that hit the ground running; at times in the wrong direction, but always with a dynamism and scope that its contemporaries sometimes lacked \u2013 or took for granted.\n\nOver the years Gerry\u2019s comments on the series tended to cover more the various personality conflicts involved with its production, yet I\u2019ve often wondered what he thought of the finished product itself. For the first time in more than a decade he got to step away from the world of science fiction and produce a kind of series he wasn\u2019t used to making, but had always dreamed of. That the result was not only the equal of similar shows of that era but at times exceeded them was certainly something he should have been proud of.\n\nFive to see: The First Circle, Shadbolt, Balance of Terror, The Big Hit, Zeke\u2019s Blues\n\nFive to flee: A Case for the Right, See No Evil, Quin, Goodbye George, Burning Bush\n\nOne to destroy with fire BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK: It Could Be Practically Anywhere on the Island.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of The Protectors, then you may also be interested in our range of The Protectors merchandise \u2013 available exclusively from the Gerry Anderson Store."}, {"url": "https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/07/09/the-protector-season-4-explained/", "page_content": "It has finally arrived on Netflix, so let\u2019s get The Protector season 4 ending explained.

Robert Vaughn stars as Harry Rule, the suave American who leads the operations and works from a London office; Nyree Dawn Porter is the elegant, Rome-based Contessa di Contini, and Tony Anholt is Paul Buchet, a French agent operating out of Paris. The three of them make up this unique team that tackles baffling and dangerous assignments. Together they move around Europe`s most top resorts. There are some impressive locations that give the show glamour. The team keep in touch via hi tech seventies computer equipment. There are fashionable cars and private jets used as they fight crime head on. They tackle spies, murderers, smugglers and drug pushers. Harry Rule is the leader, an American who works from a hi tech office in London and lives in a country mansion with an Irish wolfhound named Gus. He is looked after by his au pair, Suki, who is a martial arts expert. The Contessa di Contini is Lady Caroline Ogilvy, an elegent English widow. Her late husband was Italian and has left her the villa in Rome. She specialises in art and antiques fraud and is chauffeured by a karate chopping driver named Chino. Paul Buchet is french, and works from an apartment in Paris. The three main characters have a special, and warm bond to each other and there is good atmosphere.\n\nThe series has style, glamour, action and a little comedy all neatly packed into each episode that runs just under half an hour. This means that there isnt the character development like there would be with an hour long show. But it doesnt matter because the three main characters do get character development over the series anyway. The running time also gives the show originality that makes it stand out. (there were very few other shows that had the same short running time made by ITC, and thay were series like The Adventurer made around the same time as The Protectors, and the early episodes of Danger Man from the sixties all of which I also reccomend) And the 25 minute episodes dont offer time to get bored as things move along quickly. The whole show has the feel of a standard hour long ITC show but its just shorter.\n\nRobert Vaughn, Nyree Dawn Porter and Tony Anholt give a good performance. The series has charm with its seventies style of fashion, cars, locations and clothes. And the whole production seems to have even more originality about it than it did at the time. It is entertaining and nostalgic enjoyment that is on offer in this release.\n\nThe adventures of the Protectors were produced by Gerry Anderson (puppet master who created Thunderbirds) and Reg Hill.

At the University of Southern California, he had his first success with a short student film. While he enjoyed his biggest hit with 1978's Halloween, Carpenter continues to thrill and disturb audiences with such films as 2011's The Ward.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nCarpenter, born on January 16, 1948, in Carthage, New York, developed an interest in film and music as a young boy. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, where one school project, The Resurrection of Bronco Billy, won him an Academy Award (best live action short subject) in 1970. Carpenter co-wrote the screenplay and composed the music for the film.\n\nWorking with Dan O'Bannon, Carpenter started his first full-length movie while at USC. Dark Star, a sci-fi comedy, started out as a short film about astronauts on a mission to blow up unstable planets, but the pair later expanded it to feature length. Carpenter handled many responsibilities on the film, serving as its director, producer, writer and composer. Made a shoestring budget, Dark Star was released in 1974 and eventually became a cult classic.\n\nPaying to tribute to the westerns of Howard Hawks, especially his masterpiece Rio Bravo, Carpenter next worked on Assault on Precinct 13 (1976). The low-budget film is an urban retelling of a traditional western standoff, with a Los Angeles police station coming under siege by gang members. Carpenter earned kudos for this gritty thriller with the London Times calling him \"a first-rate story-teller.\"\n\nCommercial Success: 'Halloween' and 'The Thing'\n\nWith his next effort, Halloween (1978), Carpenter made his name nearly synonymous with the horror genre. Again wearing many hats, he served as the director, co-writer and composer on what became one of the highest-earning independent films of all time. Costing only $300,000 to make, Halloween terrified movie audiences with the story of Michael Myers, a killer who escapes from a mental institution to returns to his hometown to wreak havoc. Donald Pleasence played Myers's doctor from the institution and Jamie Lee Curtis appeared as a teenage babysitter trying to avoid Myers's murderous wrath.\n\nCarpenter drew comparisons to famed director Alfred Hitchcock for his ability to take the audience on a visual thrill ride. Critics also complimented him for his advanced technical skills. This suspenseful and violent film paved the way for a wave of other slasher movies, such as Friday the 13th. Halloween itself became a film franchise, but without Carpenter onboard. He only penned the screenplay for Halloween II (1981).\n\nWith his initial success, Carpenter found himself working on studio films and with larger budgets. Again turning to horror and suspense, Carpenter wrote and directed The Fog (1980). The residents of a small coastal town had to battle against the zombielike beings, the former inhabitants of an old leper colony. His then-wife, actress Adrienne Barbeau, co-starred with Curtis in the film. Turning to a gritty, futuristic action drama, Carpenter worked on Escape from New York (1981) starring Kurt Russell. Both films opened to disappointing reviews and mixed box office results. Carpenter teamed up with Russell again in 1996 when he directed Escape from L.A. Teaming up with Russell once more, Carpenter directed the cult-classic horror film The Thing in 1982.\n\nTaking on one of the literary masters of horror and suspense, Carpenter directed the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King's Christine. He took a break from his usual fare for the science fiction romance Starman (1984) starring Jeff Bridges. Bridges played an alien who takes over a dead man's body and becomes involved with the man's widow (Karen Allen). The film proved to be a critical and commercial success with Bridges earning an Academy Award nomination for his work.\n\nLater Career\n\nReturning to independent film, Carpenter has continued to work with varying degrees of success, but none matching the heights he reached with Halloween. Horror thriller Prince of Darkness (1987) and sci-fi action flick They Live (1988) failed to attract much of an audience. Carpenter tried comedy, directing 1992's Memoirs of an Invisible Man with Chevy Chase, which also proved to be a disappointment.\n\nAfter the 2001 sci-fi thriller Ghosts of Mars, Carpenter took a break from directing. He worked on a few television episodes, but he did not return to the big screen until 2010 with The Ward. In the thriller starring Amber Heard and Mamie Gummer, young female patients at a mental institution suffer at the hands of an evil ghostly figure.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCarpenter has a son, Cody, from his first marriage to actress Adrienne Barbeau. The couple was married from 1979 to 1984. Carpenter has been married to producer Sandy King since 1990.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: John Howard Carpenter\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: January 16, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Carthage\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: A master of horror, John Carpenter created the 1978 thriller hit 'Halloween,' which has inspired and influenced countless other filmmakers.\n\nIndustries\n\nHorror\n\nAstrological Sign: Capricorn\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\n\n\nWestern Kentucky University\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION"}, {"url": "https://www.gerryanderson.com/the-protectors-the-forgotten-anderson-series/", "page_content": "Although The Protectors itself can hardly be said to be an entirely forgotten series relatively few people realise that was in fact a Gerry Anderson production, being produced in the gap between UFO and Space:1999 from 1971-73. Across two seasons and fifty-two episodes the Protectors, an international detective agency with agents in every major city on Earth, tackled all manner of crimes across England and Europe.\n\nThe reason the show\u2019s Anderson heritage may have escaped many fans could be partly due to the fact that the series was not based on a concept he created, but rather one that he was presented with by Lew Grade and essentially told to get on with. Gathering together as many of his familiar team as possible he set to work fleshing out Grade\u2019s one-line concept; \u2018there is a small group of private detectives who are able to work more efficiently because they are operating outside of the law\u2019, and the result was ironically one of the most successful series he would ever produce.\n\nDespite this however, the series tends to be more often thought of as \u2018just another\u2019 in the long line of filmed action series produced by ITC through the 1960s and early 1970s \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why. Being a contemporary thriller series The Protectors lacks any of the fantastic vehicles, secret bases or impressive gadgets almost all of Anderson\u2019s other work is known for, and while this may be a contributing factor in the show\u2019s lack of appeal to Anderson fans that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a good series here worthy of attention \u2013 one that perhaps has more in common with his other works than it would first appear.\n\nWhile the production of the series was by most accounts not a very happy affair there\u2019s no denying that the three central characters \u2013 Robert Vaughn\u2019s Harry Rule, Nyree Dawn Porter\u2019s Contessa Caroline di Contini, and Tony Anholt\u2019s Paul Buchet \u2013 do work well together on screen and have a very good chemistry. Harry Rule may not always be as warm or charming as Vaughn\u2019s Man from UN.C.L.E. Napoleon Solo was just a few years earlier but he also feels more credible here, more dangerous. Nyree Dawn Porter brings all the glamour and sophistication of a live-action Lady Penelope (right down to the Rolls Royce and chauffeur) while also being just as formidable in a fight as her male colleagues, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why Tony Anholt was brought back a few years later for Space:1999\u2019s second season. All three characters felt like the traditional globetrotting adventurers of previous ITC shows but were also credible as agents capable of handling themselves in a scrap, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for one to carry an episode alone if either or both of their co-stars weren\u2019t around.\n\nUnique among Anderson\u2019s live action shows (and most other ITC action shows of that time) each episode of The Protectors was only twenty-five minutes long. While this sometimes created scripting problems (the convoluted 2000ft to Die fails as an opening episode, and if anyone can tell me what A Case for the Right is even about I\u2019d be grateful) and character development usually takes a backseat to the action, the same could equally be said of Captain Scarlet, Stingray, or Joe 90. On the other hand, as those shows proved, a shorter running time almost certainly avoids having episodes drag. When The Protectors is working particularly well (Balance of Terror, The First Circle and Shadbolt) the resulting drama and action are easily as entertaining as the very best episodes of any of those earlier series. It also avoiding becoming formulaic, as the vague nature of the show\u2019s original premise allowed for a wide variety of stories to be told; from conventional ITC cops and robbers fare like Your Witness and Thinkback, to intense two-character stories like The First Circle and For the Rest of Your Natural\u2026, surprisingly though-provoking political dramas like The Last Frontier and Border Line, and even to occasional comedy episodes which veer from genuinely charming (Sugar and Spice) to THE ABSOLUTE VERY WORST THING WITH THE GERRY ANDERSON NAME ON IT EVER.\n\nThe series also benefitted from ITC\u2019s decision at the beginning of the 1970s to start shooting their action series on location as much as possible, thus the Europe of The Protectors wouldn\u2019t be the same Elstree backlot street set that The Saint or The Champions set their Europe on; it would now be the real thing. Memorable stories would take place in Malta, Venice, Rome and Salzburg to name just a few, and the show took full advantage of the storytelling opportunities these locations presented. At times The Protectors almost feels as prestigious and expensive a series as Thunderbirds and later Space:1999 do, and while 1999\u2019s budget would be used to create some extremely impressive indoor sets The Protectors was the only Gerry Anderson show whose world did not have to be built from scratch; they could find adventure literally on their own doorstep.\n\nLongtime Anderson fans may also enjoy seeing familiar faces from his other shows turn up in guest roles, including Shane Rimmer (who also wrote several episodes), Jeremy Wilkin, Cyril Shaps, Vladek Sheybal, Neil McCallum, and most notably Ed Bishop who plays a mentally disturbed Vietnam war veteran in arguably the show\u2019s best episode, The First Circle. The Protectors is also full of enjoyable guest turns from such notables as Patrick Troughton, Derren Nesbitt, David Suchet, John Thaw, and Eartha Kitt. We also mustn\u2019t overlook the show\u2019s music, with a sparkling main theme and incidental score from John Cameron, as well as perhaps the most enduring element of the entire series; Mitch Murray and Peter Callandar\u2019s Avenues and Alleyways, sung with typical gusto over the end credits by the legendary Tony Christie.\n\nAfter a successful first season the show received minor cosmetic changes going into its second year, with greater emphasis placed on the three main characters and more of a inclination towards downbeat endings that perhaps reflect the shifting attitudes of the early 1970s. The era of the millionaire playboy television hero was almost at an end, and several of The Protectors\u2019 cold and grey London-based final episodes (most notably Shadbolt) feel closer in tone to The Sweeney than the affluent globetrotting of its earliest installments. Had the show earned a third season it would have been interesting to see whether or not this trend would have continued, and seen The Protectors step from the shadows of its predecessors to truly pursue its own path. Sadly, this was not to be; Faberg\u00e9, who financed both seasons, pulled their support for the show and the planned third season never materialised.\n\nThe Protectors will likely always remain the odd series out in the Gerry Anderson catalogue due to it being so utterly unlike anything else he ever produced, and yet it remains one of his most successful. Aside from the usual flurry of books, comics and home media releases it is one of only a handful of his shows to go to a second season (especially revealing when taking into account that very few of the ITC action series ran for more than one) so there are more television episodes of The Protectors in existence today than any of his other shows \u2013 fifty-two!\n\nLongevity alone is no guarantee of quality, yet The Protectors is easily one of the best ITC action shows of the early 1970s. The Persuaders! remains hugely entertaining but the rest are a mixed bag; The Zoo Gang was decent but ended as soon as it started, Jason King is based around a character who doesn\u2019t want to do anything and so doesn\u2019t, and The Adventurer was dead on arrival and only went downhill from there. During a period when the regular ITC team were struggling to produce decent (or even watchable) shows Gerry was handed a blank-slate of a concept and brought the same perfectionism to it as he did to all his other shows. The result was a slick, energetic and confident series that hit the ground running; at times in the wrong direction, but always with a dynamism and scope that its contemporaries sometimes lacked \u2013 or took for granted.\n\nOver the years Gerry\u2019s comments on the series tended to cover more the various personality conflicts involved with its production, yet I\u2019ve often wondered what he thought of the finished product itself. For the first time in more than a decade he got to step away from the world of science fiction and produce a kind of series he wasn\u2019t used to making, but had always dreamed of. That the result was not only the equal of similar shows of that era but at times exceeded them was certainly something he should have been proud of.\n\nFive to see: The First Circle, Shadbolt, Balance of Terror, The Big Hit, Zeke\u2019s Blues\n\nFive to flee: A Case for the Right, See No Evil, Quin, Goodbye George, Burning Bush\n\nOne to destroy with fire BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK: It Could Be Practically Anywhere on the Island.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of The Protectors, then you may also be interested in our range of The Protectors merchandise \u2013 available exclusively from the Gerry Anderson Store."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Protectors-Complete-DVD-Robert-Vaughn/dp/B003YCLZKA", "page_content": "The protectors is a great 1970s classic series originally created by the famous ITC studios. It is a good fun detective type of show. Robert Vaughn stars as Harry Rule, the suave American who leads the operations and works from a London office; Nyree Dawn Porter is the elegant, Rome-based Contessa di Contini, and Tony Anholt is Paul Buchet, a French agent operating out of Paris. The three of them make up this unique team that tackles baffling and dangerous assignments. Together they move around Europe`s most top resorts. There are some impressive locations that give the show glamour. The team keep in touch via hi tech seventies computer equipment. There are fashionable cars and private jets used as they fight crime head on. They tackle spies, murderers, smugglers and drug pushers. Harry Rule is the leader, an American who works from a hi tech office in London and lives in a country mansion with an Irish wolfhound named Gus. He is looked after by his au pair, Suki, who is a martial arts expert. The Contessa di Contini is Lady Caroline Ogilvy, an elegent English widow. Her late husband was Italian and has left her the villa in Rome. She specialises in art and antiques fraud and is chauffeured by a karate chopping driver named Chino. Paul Buchet is french, and works from an apartment in Paris. The three main characters have a special, and warm bond to each other and there is good atmosphere.\n\nThe series has style, glamour, action and a little comedy all neatly packed into each episode that runs just under half an hour. This means that there isnt the character development like there would be with an hour long show. But it doesnt matter because the three main characters do get character development over the series anyway. The running time also gives the show originality that makes it stand out. (there were very few other shows that had the same short running time made by ITC, and thay were series like The Adventurer made around the same time as The Protectors, and the early episodes of Danger Man from the sixties all of which I also reccomend) And the 25 minute episodes dont offer time to get bored as things move along quickly. The whole show has the feel of a standard hour long ITC show but its just shorter.\n\nRobert Vaughn, Nyree Dawn Porter and Tony Anholt give a good performance. The series has charm with its seventies style of fashion, cars, locations and clothes. And the whole production seems to have even more originality about it than it did at the time. It is entertaining and nostalgic enjoyment that is on offer in this release.\n\nThe adventures of the Protectors were produced by Gerry Anderson (puppet master who created Thunderbirds) and Reg Hill. (who produced many other british programmes)\n\nIts good that Network DVD have finally released this wonderful series to go along with the other ITC programmes they have in their catalogue. Its taken them a bit too long realy because they have had the soundrack available for some time. The series has been out before on ITV entertainments and its still possible to get that version, but this Network release is the one to get. Its well presented as are most of their releases.\n\nJohn Thaw, Diana Quick, Stephanie Beacham, Peter Bowles, Patrick Troughton and George Baker are among the many stars making guest appearances, while Tony Christie sings the show's theme tune, Avenues and Alleyways - a UK Top 40 hit in 1973 and on its re-release in 2005. This 7-disc set comprises all 52 half-hour episodes, originally aired between 1972 and 1974 There are some limited extra SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n* Over 1500 stills (disc 7) including PR and behind-the-scenes shots\n\n* PDF promotional material including original brochure and press information\n\nThe soundtrack is also available seperatley which I also would reccomend.\n\n]\n\nThere are no subtitles for hard of hearing.

I was a teenager then and immensely enjoyed this adventure yarn of a team of World War II paratroopers sent on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines. Usually the heroes in such stories were British or American, so it added a certain frisson that the paratroopers in this case were Germans sent to kidnap or kill Winston Churchill in a desperate bid to change the course of the war. Jack Higgins\u2019 novel was an instant bestseller and has remained so over the years, selling more than 50 million copies.\n\nJack Higgins was born as Henry Patterson in 1929 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, to an English father and a Belfast mother. When his father abandoned them, his mother returned with Henry to live with her own family in Belfast. Henry learned to read at a young age through reading The Christian Herald to his bed-ridden grandfather. His mother remarried and so Henry was brought up in Leeds, England. In 1947 he began two years\u2019 national service, giving him experience of military life. In 1959, while a teacher, he began writing novels, and soon became a full-time novelist, using different pen names until he settled on Jack Higgins. His 85 novels have sold more than 150 million copies and have been translated into 55 languages. Several have been made into films.\n\nAlthough it would not be described as an historical novel, The Eagle Has Landed purports to be based on actual events.\n\nHowever, there are some details which are historically accurate. There were Irish people in Berlin who cooperated with the Nazi regime (see David O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s Hitler\u2019s Irish Voices, Beyond the Pale Publications) and a handful of British volunteers in the Waffen SS. A lead character, Joanna Grey, assists the Germans because of what the British did to her and her family during the Boer War. And the Nazi high command did think up some wild schemes to win the war. Higgins hit upon a success in the character of Liam Devlin. From Belfast, Devlin was one of those IRA men who fought for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. It\u2019s made clear that he has no sympathy for the Nazis and only wants to help the cause in Ireland. Devlin features in several later Higgins\u2019s novels.\n\nHiggins assumed that The Eagle Has Landed would never be made into a film as its heroes were Germans and an IRA man, but in 1976 it was filmed with John Sturges as director, starring Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, and Robert Duvall. It was to be Sturges\u2019s final film. It sticks to the core of the novel. Michael Caine plays Fallschirmjaeger Col. Steiner who leads a team of fellow German paratroopers on a mission to kidnap or kill Winston Churchill. They are aided by IRA man, Liam Devlin, who teaches at a Berlin University, and a sleeper agent, the South African Joanna Grey. Disguised as Free Polish Army paratroopers, Steiner\u2019s men infiltrate a sleepy village in Norfolk. After a promising start, predictably, the plot goes wrong. Churchill is safe and Steiner is killed but Devlin escapes. Although garnering no awards the film was a commercial success.\n\nWhile the film remains true to the main thrust of the novel, there are certain key differences. The sympathetic portrayal of Steiner and Devlin remains, but the producers seem to have had a problem with negative portrayals of the British.\n\nAnother character in the novel, an English volunteer in the Waffen SS, Harvey Preston, is excluded along with a pair of vicious Cockney gangsters. The motivation for Miss Grey to work for the Germans \u2013 the brutal behaviour of British troops in the Boer War \u2013 was cut from the final version of the film. The village vicar, Rev. Verecker, is a nasty character in the book but a nice guy in the film. The portrayal of Col. Steiner may be seen as part of a broader tradition of recognising some Wermacht officers as \u2018good\u2019 Germans unsympathetic to the Nazis, such as Field Marshal Rommel, or actively opposed to them such as von Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters, at a time when Soviet Russia was seen as a major threat and Germany an important member of NATO.\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed was Higgins\u2019 most successful book, probably helped by the popularity of the film. It is, of course, a great adventure story which keeps the reader intrigued with \u2018what ifs\u2019 in history, but its real achievement is to take traditional villains \u2013 German soldiers and IRA men \u2013 and turn them into sympathetic heroes.\n\nTony Canavan is consulting Editor at Books Ireland"}, {"url": "https://homework.study.com/explanation/who-wrote-the-novel-the-eagle-has-landed.html", "page_content": "Question:\n\nWho wrote the novel The Eagle has Landed?\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed:\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed, which is set during World War II, is a best-selling book.

The characters discuss the historic rescue of Hitler's ally Benito Mussolini in September 1943. After Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned by the Italian government, Otto Skorzeny led a German team and achieved his release and escape from Italy.\n\nAdolf Hitler, with the strong support of Heinrich Himmler, considered a similar plan to kidnap the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr (German military intelligence), is ordered to make a feasibility study of capturing Churchill and taking him to the Reich. Canaris realises that although Hitler will soon forget the matter, Himmler will not. Fearing Himmler may try to discredit him, Canaris orders one of his officers, Oberst Radl, to undertake the study, despite feeling that it is all a waste of effort.\n\nAn Unteroffizier on Radl's staff finds that one of their spies, codenamed Starling, has provided a tantalising piece of intelligence. \"At any other time, in any other place, this information would be useless,\" Radl said. \"And then synchronicity rears its disturbing head.\" Churchill is scheduled to spend a relaxing weekend at a country house near the village of Studley Constable, Norfolk, where Joanna Grey, an Afrikaner woman and longtime Abwehr agent, lives. She detests England because she was abused and raped by British soldiers, and her husband, daughter, and parents were killed during the Anglo-Boer War. As a result of her reports, Radl devises a detailed plan to intercept Churchill and transport him to Germany. Although Radl is certain the plan has real possibilities, Admiral Canaris orders him to abandon it.\n\nHimmler, however, has already learned of the scheme and summons Radl. He orders him to proceed, but without informing Canaris. In response, Radl arranges for Liam Devlin, a member of the Irish Republican Army[2] who served as an officer in the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War,[3] to be smuggled to Norfolk by way of Northern Ireland. Posing as a wounded veteran of the British Army, he contacts Mrs. Grey, who arranges a position for him as gamekeeper to the estate of Studley Grange. While awaiting further developments, Devlin becomes romantically involved with Molly Prior, a girl from the village.\n\nMeanwhile, Radl selects the members of the \"commando style\" unit, to be led by disgraced Fallschirmj\u00e4ger commander Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Steiner, which is supposed to carry out the operation.[4] While returning from the Eastern Front, Steiner had intervened when SS soldiers were rounding up Jews at a railway station in Poland. To the outrage of the SS and Polizei, he took one of their men hostage and helped a teenage Jewish girl to escape on a passing freight train. For this he was court-martialled, along with his men, who backed his actions. Too highly decorated to face a firing squad, Steiner and his men were allowed to transfer to a penal unit in the Channel Islands. There they are forced to make high-risk attacks with human torpedoes against Allied ships in the English Channel.\n\nRadl travels to Alderney and recruits Steiner and his surviving men. Steiner's father, General Steiner, is being tortured by the Gestapo for his alleged ties to the German Resistance. This serves as an additional incentive for the Colonel to accept the mission. Radl relocates Steiner and his men to an airfield on the north western coast of Holland, where they familiarise themselves with the British weapons and equipment they will be using. The team will be air-dropped into Norfolk from a captured C-47 Dakota with Allied markings. The commandos outfit themselves as Free Polish paratroopers, as few of them speak English; the plan is to infiltrate Studley Constable, capture Churchill, rendezvous with an E-boat at the nearby coast, and make their escape. As part of the ruse, they arm themselves with Sten guns, M1 Garands, Bren guns and revolvers, as well as Browning Hi-Powers, instead of German weaponry.\n\nAt first, the plan seems to go off without a hitch. But one of Steiner's NCOs rescues a young girl who fell into a mill race. He is killed by the water wheel and his German uniform (worn, by Himmler's order, under the Polish uniforms, as protection against being executed as spies) is seen by several of the villagers. Determined to continue the mission, Steiner arranges for the locals to be rounded up, but the sister of Father Vereker, the local priest, escapes and alerts a nearby unit of US Army Rangers. Colonel Robert Shafto, an inexperienced but glory-seeking officer, rallies his forces to retake the hostages. Without notifying headquarters, he orders a foolhardy assault in which many Americans are killed. After the Colonel is shot in the head by Mrs. Grey, Major Harry Kane, Shafto's Executive officer in the Rangers,[5] organises a second, successful attack.\n\nSteiner, his second-in-command Ritter von Neumann, and Devlin escape with Molly's aid. Determined to finish the mission, Steiner allows Devlin and Neumann to escape without him and decides to make one last attempt at Churchill. He succeeds in reaching Churchill, but hesitates, is shot and supposedly killed. (However, Steiner reappears alive in The Eagle Has Flown, a quasi-sequel.) In Germany, Radl has had a heart attack, implied to be fatal. At about the same time, Himmler, upon discovering that the mission has failed, orders Radl's arrest for high treason.\n\nThis account is surrounded by a frame story with a prologue and epilogue, a technique that Higgins uses in other of his novels. The author, whilst doing historical research in Norfolk, supposedly meets various surviving characters. Some paperback editions have more historical backstory than others, including a meeting with an older Liam Devlin in a Belfast hotel. The final revelation comes from an aged and terminally ill Father Vereker: at the time of his supposed visit to Norfolk, Churchill was en route to the Tehran Conference. The \"Churchill\" whom Steiner nearly killed was an impersonator, meaning that even if Steiner had fatally shot the man, the government would not have been affected.\n\nCharacters\n\nPublication details\n\nReception\n\nThis book rapidly became a bestseller. As of 2010, it has sold more than 50 million copies.[7]\n\nAdaptation\n\nThe film rights were purchased and an adaptation was quickly prepared. In 1976, a British film of the same name was released, the last film directed by John Sturges. It starred Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Jenny Agutter, and Robert Duvall. Its success also stimulated more book sales.\n\nSequel\n\nHiggins wrote a sequel called The Eagle Has Flown, which was published in 1991. It was also set during World War II.\n\nHiggins featured his character of Liam Devlin in several later thrillers. He is older and acts as a mentor to Sean Dillon and Martin Brosnan. In Higgins' novel Confessional (1985), Devlin allies with MI6 to prevent a rogue KGB assassin from murdering Pope John Paul II.[citation needed]\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074452/reviews", "page_content": "Warning: Spoilers\n\nThere be spoilers ahead...\n\n\n\nI tend to love movies like this -- high adventure and a ripping good yarn, especially when fact and fiction is blended (unfortunately, that's also a feature of most Hollywood films that purport to be factual) -- and the book upon which it was based was one of my favorites when I was in my early teens. This excellent and entertaining movie still holds up well and is a classic of its genre.\n\n\n\nActors like Michael Caine and others -- some known and some lesser-known to most -- anchor a simple but strong storyline that's nicely paced. The acting's good from all involved, and Donald Sutherland plays his role as the sardonic Irishman to the hilt, perfectly, but if there's one stand-out performance in this film my vote would go to Robert Duvall, whose Colonel Radl is the most complex and conflicted of all of the characters (most of the principals being similarly conflicted, one way or another) and his acting is paradoxically stunning yet subtle. A recent graduate of \"The Godfather,\" Duvall would go on to ever-greater heights with his work in the magnificent \"Apocalypse Now\" and beyond. This movie's not quite the caliber of either of those two hallowed ventures, but it's well worth catching if you're a fan of Duvall, too.\n\n\n\nThe plot is entirely plausible in both its big picture and in its details. One of the most refreshing aspects of the film is that the German characters are not portrayed as Nazi fanatics. Indeed, all of the film's German characters are portrayed as being decent people, contemptuous of the Fuehrer and his Nazi hierarchy, except for Himmler and his SS men.\n\n\n\nSteiner, Michael Caine's character, is a paratrooper decorated with a Knights Cross (and subsequent honors), and his men are a collection of combat veterans. The contrast between these 'good' Germans and the 'bad' Germans is established from the start, with the showdown between Steiner's group and SS who were 'liquidating' a Polish ghetto and shipping Jews off to the death camps. Steiner's stand results in he and his team being assigned to a penal unit for which life expectancies were very low. The planned kidnapping of Churchill, at first dismissed by Duvall's Radl and his superior, Admiral Canaris (a historical figure, chief of German intelligence, played well by Anthony Quayle, who even looks like the Abwehr head), begins to seem possible in light of a random intelligence note regarding the British Prime Minister's impending visit to a remote, seaside town. A special team would be needed, and herein lay the road to salvation for British-educated Steiner and his crew. The actors who play Steiner's men are believable as elite forces who have seen it all yet still have retained their humanity. Included among Steiner's men is a face, briefly shown clearly, familiar to viewers of 1978's \"Grease\" -- Jeff Conaway.\n\n\n\nThe ubiquitous Donald Pleasance (whose lack of discrimination in film projects is rivaled perhaps only by that of Michael Caine) wallows in the role of Himmler, perfectly capturing the former failed chicken-farmer's look and unnerving normality, a normality that barely concealed a seriously-disturbed megalomaniac. He's perfect as Himmler, turning the small role that the Reichsfuhrer-SS has in this film into a freaky and haunting performance. A gray little man with no personal charisma or physical ability, Pleasance's Himmler is ruthless and emboldened by the power that he wields and it shows. Scary.\n\n\n\nLarry Hagman is great (if greatly annoying, albeit intentionally) as the aptly-named Colonel Pitts, a gung-ho but combat-green US Ranger officer who injects a bit of comic relief amidst the serious action of combat. I think that Pitts has seen too many John Wayne movies. He also plays to certain stereotypes about the Ugly American that have become firmly entrenched in the UK and elsewhere -- our sympathies lie more with the Germans of Steiner's unit than with him. His foil -- antidote, really -- is the All-American Treat Williams, playing a junior Ranger officer who does actually appear to know what he's doing. Still, the firefight between the relatively raw Rangers and their seasoned opposition -- Steiner's men are veterans of the Eastern Front, Crete, Norway, and may other nasty war zones -- is something of a study in contrasts.\n\n\n\nMichael Caine, who gets to wear the cool leather jacket, is really the main character in the movie but the piece is such an ensemble effort that he is far from the movie's focus in terms of time. I wouldn't be surprised to find that Donald Sutherland's sly character actually gets more screen time. Donald Sutherland's always excellent and this film's no exception. He's also got some of the film's best lines and his character progresses the most as the film goes on.\n\n\n\nMichael Caine's always a pleasure to watch, even in his most dire films (and several have been pretty dire). He's well cast as Steiner and embodies his war-weariness, style, knowing humor, and gentlemanly conduct very well. Colonel Steiner is the calm in the center of the storm in this film and is the kind of leader that most soldiers would probably love to serve with.\n\n\n\nIf you want to see a movie that's not too heavy and not too cerebral but still not lacking intelligence in combination with a good, rollicking storyline that includes a few satisfying twists, this one's a good one to sit back and enjoy. It's a tribute to the film-makers' breaking away from the stereotyped Nazi that the viewing audience and the German characters' American and British adversaries feel sadness at the film's end, with the decimation of what remained of Steiner's men. Ultimately, the film's further testimony to the futility of war, even more directly in this case because of the ersatz Churchill -- a nice, sad twist to the tale.\n\n\n\nThey don't make movies like this any more, and that's a pity."}, {"url": "https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/73796/the-eagle-has-landed", "page_content": "(1976) was the last film directed by John Sturges, for many years one of Hollywood's most successful directors of action films (, 1955;, 1957;, 1960;, 1963).

And it was one of England's most beautiful summers to boot. The storyline of The Eagle Has Landed follows Caine as Colonel Kurt Steiner, the commander of a group of German soldiers under orders from Himmler (Donald Pleasence, doing his stock Teutonic villain role). Col. Steiner is ordered to parachute into England with the intention of assassinating Winston Churchill. Like the similar The Day of the Jackal (1973), which followed a plot to murder French President Charles DeGaulle, the story had the disadvantage of trying to maintain suspense when the audience knew full well that Churchill was never killed by Germans or anyone else. Jackal got around the problem by following the intricacies of the plot with almost excruciating detail. Eagle's ace in the hole was provided by Sturges's handling of the action sequences, a quality he brought to the historically foregone conclusions of Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and The Great Escape.

Also in the cast are Jenny Agutter, Donald Pleasence, Jean Marsh, Treat Williams, and Larry Hagman.\n\nActor Allusion: This is not the first time Robert Duvall played a sympathetic WWII German Wehrmacht character, as Duvall previously guest-starred in two episodes of Combat! as a Heer medic named Peter Halsman and a Heer demolition expert named Karl.\n\nAdaptational Name Change: Colonel Robert Shafto to Colonel Clarence Pitts, Major Harry Kane to Captain Clark and finally Ritter von Neumann is given the nickname \"Hans\" by Steiner in the film (which becomes the case of an aversion of One-Steve Limit, due to the presence of one of the German paratroopers Hans Altmann).\n\nAdaptational Villainy: In the book, Himmler ordered to have Steiner and his crew to wear their uniforms underneath their disguises so they do not get prosecuted as spies. However, in the movie, it was Steiner's demand alone to wear their German uniforms under their Polish ones, Himmler on-screen never suggested such a thing as he never cared for the lives of Steiner and his men.\n\nAdapted Out: The present day Book Ends, Steiner's father and his arc involving being imprisoned by the Gestapo, renegade Brit Harvey Preston and his arc explaining how he came to be fighting on the German side note Truth in Television as there really was a (very small) SS unit comprising of British and Commonwealth soldiers recruited from POW camps\n\nAlas, Poor Villain: Steiner's team who were all killed in the line of duty with Neumann and Devlin as exceptions are given this treatment by the Allied forces who respected them and in the book weren't posthumously honored and completely forgiven by the townspeople and the vicar until after the war. Only Preston (who was Adapted Out in the film) wasn't acknowledged in the posthumous honor in the book.\n\nAll for Nothing: The key twist of the film: after the entire German force and scores of American and British troops have been killed, it turns out that the \"Churchill\" in the area is a Body Double while the real one attends a conference in Tehran.\n\nAll Germans Are Nazis: Averted. Steiner and his unit are depicted as chivalrous men of honor, and they are opposed to the persecution of Jews.\n\nAmerica Won World War II: Zig-zagged and ultimately subverted. A company of US Rangers just happens to be stationed in a manor right next to the village, and is tasked to neutralise the German commandos head-on before Churchill arrives. While there are plenty of British characters, they provide mostly the Innocent Bystander role. The American Colonel's plan of attack ends in complete disaster, succeeding only in getting him and many of his men killed. While a second attack (led by his subordinate) is successful, Steiner escapes to confront Churchill... who is revealed to be a decoy, making the entire battle essentially meaningless.\n\nAnti-Villain: All of the Germans and their allies are Punch Clock Villains who seek to avoid unnecessary casualties mostly and in some cases feel they have legitimate grievances against the British. The exception is Heinrich Himmler, who signed off on the mission and is pretty much as much a bastard as he was in Real Life.\n\nArtistic License \u2013 History: The Nazis really did send a commando squad to assassinate Churchill, but they knew all about the Tehran Conference and sent them there, and Roosevelt and Stalin were targets as well. They were foiled before they got anywhere near him or any of the other leaders. Incidentally the mission was headed (from abroad) by Otto Skorzeny, the man who rescued Mussolini which in-universe inspired the events of the story.\n\nBadass Crew: Steiner and his paratroopers.\n\nBadass Preacher: After learning the truth about Steiner and his men, Father Verecker remains a Defiant Captive with his anti-Nazi Patriotic Fervor against them. In the book, it is revealed Verecker used to be a military chaplain until a Career-Ending Injury caused by a German bullet to the face cuts his service short causing him to have a personal grudge against the Nazis for his disfiguration (which Father Verecker doesn't have in the film, making his hostility towards the Germans being mostly out of patriotism rather then also personal reasons).\n\nBad Boss: Himmler has Radl executed by firing squad to distance himself from the failed operation, using Radl as a scapegoat and making it seem like he exceeded his own orders after Himmler manipulated/forced him to carry it out. Averted with Reasonable Authority Figure Canaris, however, who Radl tells his junior staff officer will protect him and his family from reprisal.\n\nThe Bad Guy Wins: Subverted. Steiner kills Churchill, but he was just a body double. The real Churchill wasn't even on the same continent.\n\nContrived Coincidence: Radl notes the odd synchronicity of him being ordered to evaluate the feasibility of a commando strike against Churchill just as Intelligence receives a report that Churchill will soon spend a weekend at a location where such a strike would be possible.\n\nCurb-Stomp Battle: Inflicted by the hardened veteran German paratroopers upon the relatively inexperienced American Rangers mainly due to the incompetence of Colonel Pitts.\n\nCyanide Pill: While collecting the papers needed for his mission, Liam Devlin asks Colonel Radl, \"No Cyanide Capsule?\" \"I could not think of a situation that would force you to take one\", replies Colonel Radl.\n\nDeath by Adaptation: The Jewish girl whom Steiner helped escape, but was shot and killed actually survived unscathed in the book.\n\nDefiant Captive: Father Verecker attempts to talk down Steiner after he and most of his congregation have been taken captive.\n\nDemoted to Extra: Arthur Seymour and the German pilot who escorted Steiner and his team and the E-boat captain who was sent to rescue the said team are given less prominence than in the book.\n\nDies Differently in Adaptation: Arthur Seymour is shot dead by Molly, while in the book he survives up to after the war only to die in a drunk driving accident. Also, the Churchill impersonator who was shot by Steiner in the film was actually saved at the last minute in the book before the latter could pull the trigger, but is killed instead in a bomb raid during a theatre tour .\n\nDoomed by Canon: If you know history, you will know that the Germans' do not succeed, and in fact, Churchill wasn't even in the country at that point in time.\n\nDressing as the Enemy: The German paratroopers disguise themselves as a Polish unit. Subverted, in that they wear their German uniforms underneath.\n\nIn the climax, Steiner steals an American soldier's uniform to get close enough to Churchill to assassinate him.\n\nEyepatch of Power: Subverted. While Colonel Radl does wear a black eyepatch, he is neither particularly evil nor that powerful. He is in fact a calm, empathetic and remotely fatalistic officer.\n\nFace Death with Dignity: The Body Double could have revealed his true identity to save his life, but acts as Churchill right to the end.\n\nRadl. Knowing that he's doomed once the mission falls apart, he makes sure his assistant and his family will be safe from reprisal. Then, when he is arrested, he calmly surrenders and is executed by firing squad.\n\nFaux Affably Evil: Himmler tries to present himself as an amicable sort with lots of bemused chuckles and smiles in his mannerisms, but it doesn't put Radl at ease dealing with the most dangerous man in the Third Reich.\n\nGeneral Failure: Colonel Failure at least. Pitts got his commission for his experience as a veteran weekend warrior in the Louisiana National Guard and had never seen combat. Once combat finds him, he botches it spectacularly. One can easily see why his superiors refused to give him a combat command and wanted him transferred back to America.\n\nGlory Hound: Colonel Pitts (who loudly resents that he is about to be transferred to a desk job stateside without having ever seen combat) refuses to call in the presence of the Germans to the British or other American units so he can hog all the glory for himself. He gets much of his platoon and even himself killed in the process.\n\nHave You Told Anyone Else?: Molly manages to avoid the Germans after they've taken the rest of the town captive and goes to Joanna for help. Joanna, who is actually a spy, asks her if anyone else knows about this before reaching for a pistol.\n\nHero Antagonist: The Allied forces of course. Captain Clark in particular, who spearheads the effort to prevent Steiner and his men from killing Churchill after his commanding officer Colonel Pitts proves to be The Neidermeyer.\n\nHeroic Sacrifice: One of the Germans dives after a little English girl to save her from being crushed by a watermill, only to fall victim himself and inadvertently expose having a German uniform under his fake Polish one.\n\nMost of the troops who proposed the Bolivian Army Ending to help Steiner escape.\n\nHistorical Villain Upgrade: Admiral Canaris was in fact a member of the German Resistance, involved in several plots to kill Hitler, and shared information with British intelligence, and is unlikely to have signed off on a plot like this or at least done something to sabotage it (to be fair, he only authorized the feasibility study because he felt obliged to go through the motions in regards to the Fuhrer's idea until Hitler came up with another \"brilliant\" plan, even if he felt it was a total waste of time). Men like Radl would likewise have been chosen for their Anti-Nazism as much as their competence. Subverted somewhat since they are still presented as sympathetic, sane and reasonable men, compared to Hitler and Himmler, and in the end Radl's underling is told Canaris will protect he and his family from Radl's fate at Himmler's hands.\n\nHonor Before Reason: Incorrectly reported regarding the German paratroopers avoiding detection by not wearing the German uniforms beneath their Polish disguises. In fact, the Hague Convention specifically allows soldiers to wear enemy uniforms as a legitimate ruse d'guerre. They are not, however, permitted to fight in enemy uniform. Therefore, while the audience may not understand why, or even consider the decision foolish, the decision to wear the German uniforms underneath the Polish ones was actually in compliance with international law. The history of the Brandenburg Commandos discusses this legality at length, and the real world German commandos performed a number of missions wearing multiple uniforms.\n\nHypercompetent Sidekick: Captain Clark is this for Colonel Pitts. Unlike Pitts, he is not a Glory Hound and actually does value diplomacy and tactical approaches. In the novel he was a combat-experienced Ranger.\n\nInspector Javert: Colonel Pitts, the leading Special Branch detective hunting Devlin in the book and especially Father Verecker towards the German paratroopers.\n\nIt Has Been an Honor: Steiner to his troops, who propose a Bolivian Army Ending while giving him cover to escape and complete the mission.\n\nKarma Houdini: Devlin survives the battle and evades the post-battle sweep in the movie.\n\nMen of Sherwood: Initially subverted with the American soldiers when their commanding officer displays a sense of Hollywood Tactics. However, once the idiot gets himself killed , his second in command rallies the survivors in an effective way against the Elites Are More Glamorous Forced into Evil German paratroopers.\n\nMiles Gloriosus: Colonel Pitts. He was never given any meaningful authority throughout the war, and it really shows.\n\nMilitary Maverick: Steiner is a German war hero, but he opposes the deportation of Jews. He confronts the SS to save a Jewish woman. He refuses to salute a SS general and he insults a SS Sturmf\u00fchrer. He is court-marshaled and ends up in a penal colony.\n\nMy Country, Right or Wrong: Steiner and his men will carry out the missions they are given for their country, even if they don't agree with their leaders' politics.\n\nThe Neidermeyer: Colonel Pitts. Piqued at being ordered back to the US (he is considered too inexperienced to participate in D-Day) he launches an attack on the church where the German Fallschirmjager (paratroops) are holed up without doing a proper recon, completely missing the Germans hidden at various points in the village and wiping out his entire platoon; to top it all he gets killed by Joanna Grey while trying to kill her with a grenade; since they were played by Larry Hagman and Jean Marsh, respectively, this spawned a thousand t-shirts saying \"Rose Shot J.R.!\"\n\nNo Celebrities Were Harmed: Devlin and Steiner are both composites of numerous real life people, most of whom had much colder relations with the Nazis. Averted with Heinrich Himmler, played to perfection by Donald Pleasance, and Admiral Canaris who in reality was involved in several plots to assassinate Hitler.\n\nNo Good Deed Goes Unpunished: Steiner's and his men's act of trying to rescue a Jewish girl from the Holocaust is what led them to face a court-martial by their SS rivals, transferred to a penal colony for his men to die one at a time in suicide attacks and eventually embarked on a mission to kill or capture Churchill, which happens to be their only means of escaping court-martial.\n\nLater, one of Steiner's men not only drowns rescuing an English girl, but his German uniform is also revealed in the process, blowing their cover.\n\nOdd Friendship: The roguish Devlin gets on very well with both Radl and Steiner, who are straight-laced military men.\n\nPlucky Comic Relief: Werner/Corporal Kuniski is the joker of the German paratroopers.\n\nPoor Communication Kills: The novel has the C-47 on which the protagonists flew to England shot down by a German night fighter that mistook it for an actual Allied plane. For added horror, the plane's crew are listening helplessly on the radio as the fighter closes in for the kill.\n\nSame Language Dub: Arthur Seymour (Terence Plummer) was dubbed by BRIAN BLESSED.\n\nThe Scapegoat: Hitler never signed off for the mission to capture Churchill; Himmler faked the order, and while visibly upset that the mission failed he was able to easily buck the blame to Radl and have him executed for \"treason\", since he was \"exceeding his authority\". Radl seems vaguely aware of this, but can't do anything about it, though he claims he was \"measured for my casket months ago\" \u2014 though that was probably just to tease his doctor rather than because of presentiments of death.\n\nShoot the Shaggy Dog: For the Germans, since the entire mission was a pointless effort from the start because the Churchill residing in the English countryside was just a decoy, and the real Churchill was in Tehran to attend an Allied conference. For the Allies, it's a resounding victory.\n\nShot at Dawn: Radl is arrested and summarily executed by an SS firing squad under the pretext that he \"exceeded his orders to the point of treason\" .\n\nShown Their Work: While most movies of this era handwaved the use of non-German equipment by Germans by simply assuming the audience wouldn't be able to tell the difference, they actually go out of their way in this one to provide believable reasons for it, such as the British torpedo boat used by Steiner's men being specifically mentioned as being a captured vessel, as well as the C-47 that was used to drop them into England. The Rangers use bounding overwatch at the individual level when assaulting the church.\n\nSympathetic Inspector Antagonist: Captain Clark is this to Steiner and men. He even gave Steiner and his team a chance to surrender without any bloodshed, however Steiner chooses to Face Death with Dignity and remain Defiant to the End since he's an enemy soldier. Also in the book only, the young Special Branch detective partner hunting Devlin which the latter acknowledges he's this and spares his life after overpowering him and killing his superior.\n\nThose Wacky Nazis: Played straight with Himmler, Preston in the book and the SS handling the Holocaust, averted with Steiner and his platoon, who are disgusted with their government's crimes against humanity and only undergo a mission to kidnap Churchill to escape court-martial after trying to save a Jewish girl. Averted with Radl, his junior staff officer played by Michael Byrne and Admiral Canaris (like in Real Life) as well.\n\nTitle Drop: After the mission to capture Churchill commences, as Radl brief Himmler on its progress. Radl: Reichsfuhrer, I am pleased to report that the Eagle has Landed.\n\nToken Good Teammate: Steiner and his team, as well as Liam Devlin and Colonel Radl along with his staff subordinate played by Michael Byrne (as part of being Typecast as a Nazi or WWII German soldier in his acting career), are considered to be this to the rest of Nazi Germany. Admiral Canaris counts too as he was one in Real Life.\n\nToo Dumb to Live: Colonel Pitts, due to his incompetence and inexperience in combat and eventually gets killed by sleeper agent Grey before having the chance to toss a grenade.\n\nTragic Villain: Radl, Steiner, and Steiner's men could easily be the heroes if this movie if they just weren't fighting for the wrong side. The Nazis screw them over, ruthlessly use them, and basically get them all killed.\n\nVillain Protagonist: The protagonists are a group of German commandos trying to assassinate Churchill under orders from Heinrich Himmler. The film does establish that the commandos themselves are honorable men concerned only with their mission and are disgusted by the war crimes they witness, even if their bosses might be mass murderers.\n\nWhat Happened to the Mouse?: The commandos' torpedo boat with Hans, Steiner's Number Two and the Sole Survivor, is last shown beached somewhere with nothing else shown about him or the boat's skipper and crew.\n\nWorthy Opponent: Captain Clark is this to Steiner."}, {"url": "https://graemeshimmin.com/the-eagle-has-landed-book-review/", "page_content": "The Eagle Has Landed: Book Review\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed, written by Jack Higgins and published in 1975, was a massive bestseller and critics generally regard it as a classic of the spy thriller genre.\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed: Title\n\nThe title references one of the defining moments of the novel, when Steiner broadcasts the message \u2018The Eagle Has Landed\u2019 back to Germany.

The major ones are blacked out like this [blackout]secret[/blackout]. To view them, just select/highlight them.\n\nPrologue\n\nIt\u2019s the 1970s. Jack Higgins is researching a Norfolk churchyard for a magazine article. He discovers a mass grave with a headstone that says:\n\nHere lies Lieutenant-Colonel Kurt Steiner and 13 German paratroopers, killed in action on the 6th November 1943.\n\nThe vicar and the locals become angry when Higgins asks about the headstone, but he bribes one to tell him who Kurt Steiner was. He gets the answer, \u201cHe was the German lad who came here with his men to shoot Mr. Churchill\u2026\u201d\n\nKidnap Churchill\n\nNow it\u2019s 1943. Inspired by Otto Skorzeny\u2019s daring rescue of Mussolini, Hitler has the idea of kidnapping British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nOberst Radl examines the possibility. He thinks it\u2019s impossible until he reads a report from a German spy, Joanna Grey, which says that Churchill plans to weekend near the Norfolk coast.\n\nRadl devises a plan to drop a unit of Fallschirmj\u00e4ger paratroopers into Norfolk. They will drop one night and kidnap Churchill the next. The German Navy will then extract them by boat.\n\nRadl plans to disguise the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger as a unit of Polish paratroopers. They will need an English-speaking officer to avoid arousing suspicion. Radl hears of a veteran Fallschirmj\u00e4ger, Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Steiner, who speaks perfect English because he spent his childhood in London. But Steiner is now in a penal unit, because he and his men tried to stop SS troops killing a Jewish girl in Warsaw. Now they are making suicide attacks on shipping in the English Channel. Radl has Steiner and his men reassigned to his command.\n\nRadl also recruits an IRA member, Liam Devlin. Devlin infiltrates England, contacts Mrs. Grey and gets a job as a marsh warden. He also becomes romantically involved with a local girl, Molly Prior.\n\nThe local bully is jealous and tries to attack Molly, but Devlin defends her. Devlin also buys an army truck and a jeep on the black-market to transport Steiner and his men. The black-marketeers try to double cross Devlin and he shoots two of them. One dies of his wounds and this draws the attention of the Police Special Branch, who start searching for Devlin.\n\nThe Eagle Lands\n\nSteiner and his men parachute into Norfolk, where they\u2019re met by Devlin and Mrs. Grey. They spend the day in the village, having duped the locals. A child from the village falls into the millrace and the current carries her away. One of Steiner\u2019s men rescues her, but he\u2019s crushed by the water wheel, revealing his German uniform. The villagers realise who the \u2018Polish\u2019 paratroopers really are\u2026\n\nSteiner\u2019s men [blackout]round up the locals, but one escapes and alerts a unit of the US Army camped nearby. The Americans make a foolhardy attack and the battle-hardened Fallschirmj\u00e4ger massacre them. More American troops arrive. Outnumbered, Steiner\u2019s men make a last stand at the church.[/blackout]\n\nMolly [blackout] helps Steiner and Devlin escape from the church. Devlin heads to the coast to be picked up by the German navy, but stops at his cottage on the way. The Special Branch detectives are waiting, but he shoots them, wades out to sea, meets the ship and escapes.[/blackout]\n\nSteiner [blackout]steals a dispatch rider\u2019s motorbike and infiltrates the house where Churchill is staying.

He tells Higgins that, in fact, at the time of Steiner\u2019s attack, Churchill was in Tehran. The man Steiner nearly killed was a double and Steiner\u2019s sacrifice was futile.[/blackout]\n\n(For more on summarising stories, see How to Write a Novel Synopsis)\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed: Analysis\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed is a daring novel attempting a tough trick. That it succeeds triumphantly is a testament to a great thriller writer.\n\nThis success starts from a great high concept and then builds on it. The novel is relatively slow-paced until the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger land in England, but the tension develops steadily. Once in England, the pace accelerates for an action-packed last quarter. The final twist is stunning on a first read.\n\nThe Issues\n\nThere are two major problems that Jack Higgins overcame:\n\nThe first problem is that, as with The Day of the Jackal, we know the ending before we start. The Germans didn\u2019t kidnap Winston Churchill during World War Two, so Steiner must fail. It\u2019s just a question of how.\n\nSecond, the reader is being asked to accept a Nazi soldier and an IRA terrorist as sympathetic protagonists.\n\nIn The Day of the Jackal, Frederick Forsyth solved the problem by making the story into a \u2018howdunit\u2019. The vital key that Jack Higgins used to solve these issues was to make the varied cast of characters vivid and sympathetic.\n\nMaking difficult characters sympathetic\n\nHiggins gets around the problem of making the protagonists sympathetic in two clever ways.\n\nFirst, Higgins has an eye for character in a way that Alistair Maclean, for example, never had. He uses that skill to make Steiner and Devlin as sympathetic as possible to the reader. In fact, to a modern eye, he potentially even goes too far, as anti-heroes are much more mainstream than they used to be.\n\nSteiner and his men are professional soldiers, not Nazis. They are in a penal unit, after attempting to stop an SS unit killing a Jewish girl. Steiner himself has an old-fashioned code of honour, and his father is an anti-Nazi who the Gestapo have imprisoned. He also has no negative personal characteristics at all. His men love him. Women love him. He\u2019s thoughtful, charming and strong. He inspires instant respect in everyone he meets.\n\nDevlin is a more complex character than Steiner, possibly because Higgins based him on an actual person: Frank Ryan, an IRA man who fought on the Republican side in Spain and spent the war in Germany.\n\nDevlin is a ruthless IRA terrorist, but he\u2019s also charming, funny and full of self-doubt. He falls for a local girl and defends her against a local thug and would-be rapist. He outwits the unpleasant, double-crossing black-marketeers. This is a classic device to make an anti-hero sympathetic: he\u2019s not as bad as the characters he\u2019s pitted against.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed has a Mission plot (see Spy Novel Plots).\n\nThe \u2018Mission\u2019 Plot The Protagonist: Is given a mission to carry out by their Mentor. Will be opposed by the Antagonist as they try to complete the mission. Makes a plan to complete the Mission. Trains and gathers resources for the Mission. Involves one or more Allies in their Mission (Optionally, there is a romance sub-plot with one of the Allies). Attempts to carry out the Mission, dealing with further Allies and Enemies as they meet them. Is betrayed by an Ally or the Mentor (optionally). Narrowly avoids capture by the Antagonist (or is captured and escapes). Has a final confrontation with the Antagonist and completes (or fails to complete) the Mission.\n\nThe plot has several unusual aspects, though:\n\nThere are dual Protagonists, Steiner and Devlin, both of whom are antiheroes.\n\nThere\u2019s no single main Antagonist. Although there are antagonistic minor characters, such as the black marketeers, the main antagonist is just the British and American military.\n\nChurchill is a Personified MacGuffin, as the entire story is about the attempt to kidnap him, but he has no direct role in the plot.\n\nTragedy\n\nAs story theorists from Aristotle onwards have said, the goal of tragedy is catharsis: the creation of powerful emotion in the reader.\n\nIn The Eagle Has Landed Higgins details the mission preparations as Radl brings the team together, and all the characters on the team are likeable. This builds the reader\u2019s empathy and involvement in the plot, but they know it must fail. This creates the classic dichotomy of tragedy. Because of their sympathy, the reader wants Steiner to carry the plot out somehow, or at least survive, but feels the inevitable approaching, creating an emotional response.\n\nThe second element of tragedy is that the character\u2019s own flaws bring about their demise. Steiner and his men fail because they are too nice. If they hadn\u2019t saved the local girl, they would not have blown their cover and the mission might have been a success. If they didn\u2019t let the villagers they were holding as hostages go, they might have escaped. In the end, Steiner fails because he\u2019s not ruthless enough.\n\nSo, The Eagle Has Landed has all the critical elements of a tragedy, and that\u2019s a big part of its success.\n\nIs The Eagle Has Landed true?\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed opens with this Author\u2019s Note:\n\nAt precisely one o\u2019clock on the morning of Saturday 6 November 1943, Heinrich Himmler, Reichsf\u00fchrer of the SS and Chief of State Police, received a simple message. The Eagle has landed. It meant that a small force of German paratroops were at that moment safely in England and poised to snatch the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, from the Norfolk country house near the sea, where he was spending a quiet weekend. This book is an attempt to recreate the events surrounding that astonishing exploit. At least fifty per cent of it is documented historical fact. The reader must decide for himself how much of the rest is a matter of speculation, or fiction\u2026\n\nHiggins framed the novel with chapters from his own point of view, where he makes further claims about the witnesses he\u2019s met and the documents he\u2019s examined that prove the story is true. There are also two maps of \u2018Studley Constable\u2019, the Norfolk village where most of the story takes place.\n\nThis authenticity convinces many people that the story is true.\n\nFalse Documents\n\n\u201cAt least fifty per cent of it is documented historical fact.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just be clear here \u2013 The Eagle Has Landed is not even remotely true. Jack Higgins is simply using the false document technique to add authenticity to his story.\n\nHe goes to such lengths to claim authenticity because people are more likely to accept a fantastical story if they think it\u2019s true. This is a common trait in spy thrillers \u2013 an aura of authenticity helps maintain the suspension of disbelief.\n\nIn fact, there were no German spies in England during World War Two \u2013 they were all picked up by MI5. And they would have picked up any spy operating their transmitter from their bedroom twice weekly in no time, so Mrs. Grey\u2019s part of the story is pure fiction.\n\nAnd would Germany really send such a small force \u2013 only just over a dozen soldiers? Similar British raids, like the Bruneval raid, comprised a minimum of a company \u2013 over a hundred soldiers.\n\nEven Studley Constable does not actually exist.\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed \u2013 The True Story\n\nThe only elements of truth in The Eagle has Landed are:\n\nThe Soviets claimed to have foiled a plot to assassinate Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt at the Tehran Conference. The plot involved German spies preparing the way for a paratroop landing. After the war, Otto Skorzeny, who the Soviets said was behind the plan, claimed it never existed and the story was Soviet propaganda.\n\nHiggins based Devlin on a genuine IRA man, Frank Ryan. Ryan organised various stillborn plots to supply the IRA with German money and weapons, one of which was called Operation Sea Eagle. Nothing ever came of the planned operations, and Ryan died in Germany in 1944.\n\nChurchill didn\u2019t have a double, but he had a vocal impersonator, Norman Shelley, who may have recorded some of Churchill\u2019s speeches for radio broadcast. British general, Bernard Montgomery, had a double.\n\n\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed: Alternative Cover\n\nThe swooping eagle is the emblem of the Fallschirmj\u00e4ger. It\u2019s shown here in a closeup of their badge. The red, white and black colour scheme is also reminiscent of Nazi Germany without the clich\u00e9 of including a swastika.\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed: My Verdict\n\nFully deserving of its status as a classic covert operations thriller. A must read.\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed: The Movie\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed was filmed in 1976, directed by John Sturges and starring Michael Caine as Steiner, Donald Sutherland as Devlin, Robert Duvall as Radl and Jenny Agutter as Molly.\n\nThe movie didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nMichael Caine is badly miscast as Steiner. Robert Duvall has a good go at his role, as do the supporting cast playing various Nazis. Donald Sutherland and Jenny Agutter are okay, although the movie cuts the romance sub-plot down dramatically. Sutherland also looks nothing like the short, dark Devlin described in the book. Larry Hagman has a disastrous comic turn as Colonel Pitts, the incompetent American commander who gets his butt kicked by Steiner and his Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.\n\nCaine himself has said the movie disappointed him. He claimed John Sturges was not really interested in making the movie and failed to edit it effectively. In fact, The Eagle Has Landed was Sturges\u2019 last film.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer:\n\n\n\nThe Eagle Has Flown: The Sequel\n\nThe Eagle Has Flown relies on a retcon to get the plot going, as Steiner was clearly dead at the end of The Eagle has Landed:\n\nThe second bullet caught him in the heart, killing him instantly.\n\nBut at the start of The Eagle has Flown, Higgins resurrects Steiner. Apparently, he was \u2018very lucky\u2019 that the bullets didn\u2019t kill him. It\u2019s hard to get over such implausibility, but if you can live with it, then the novel is a solid enough thriller, though nothing like as good as The Eagle Has Landed. The plot concerns an attempt, sponsored by Himmler for nefarious reasons, to rescue Steiner, who is being held in the Tower of London. Devlin also returns.\n\n\n\nJack Higgins wrote two other novels centred on the character of Liam Devlin, Touch the Devil and Confessional, both set when Devlin is a much older man. Devlin also makes cameo appearances in some of Higgins\u2019 other thrillers.\n\nWant to Read it?\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed is available on US Amazon here, and UK Amazon here.\n\nI\u2019m not linking to the movie or The Eagle Has Flown, as I don\u2019t recommend them.\n\nAgree?
